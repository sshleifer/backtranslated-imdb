Shirley Jackson's novel 'The Haunting of Hill House' is a story of fear in an atmosphere that represents a supernatural phenomenon in an old mansion. The atmosphere came out well and was very cold. A masterpiece that haunts <br /> <br /> 1963 'The Haunting' refrigeration is still close to this book. But also add their own details to the plot Fortunately, these things are very rare and the horrors of the book and the horrors are performed better on the screen. Black and white photography increases the horror of movies only. Great! <br /> <br /> Then Jan de Bont did this in 1999. The remake of The Haunting affects the cinema - if you call this remake, why do they have to make a new movie in 1963? Is a mystery in itself But now try to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> It started on average like most horror movies. The scenes used for the Hill House are beautiful and mysterious, and in a matter of minutes it seems that this movie is quite fair. And then the first fear came: the harpsichord wire loosened a woman's face (Dr. Marrow's assistant). This is hilarious and tells the truth, it almost tears me. <br /> <br / > From then on, the movie turned down. The show seemed to be quite woody when the movie went on, with Owen's Wilson character particularly irritating. (So ​​it's a relaxing story when he executes the cremation) <br /> <br /> Special techniques that make this movie Which is a shame because most of them are incredibly wonderful and look very old There are many examples of these things, so I won't bother to list them. <br /> <br /> So, overall, I and hundreds of others recommend that you look at the original refrigeration or as are The choice of buying a novel by Shirley Jackson, but please stay away from this. And if you decide to watch this, watch it on TV (as many channels like to film this movie, not the original) or rent it cheaply But please don't buy it, no matter what you do. Don't waste money! <br /> <br /> Final score: 4/10
