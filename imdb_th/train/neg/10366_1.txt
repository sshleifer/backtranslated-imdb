Unexpected boredom for more than 80 minutes. For the first time, I wonder if it's possible to produce something like that. Then, when I arrived at the 70th minute, I was confident that it was only a few minutes and I reached the end that I was proud of as I considered watching this movie as a good test for human patience and shit. Is it worth it to watch? As I have written above, if you want to test yourself, take a look and if you are determined enough, you may survive until the end ... Movies lack links and the characters don't seem to have all the feelings. In the movie, you can be sure that you've seen it before and it looks like they will be put in this movie to fill the movie reel.
