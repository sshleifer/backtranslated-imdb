I just saw DreamGirls yesterday and I am really disappointed. Despite all the Oscars, it's nothing special. Everyone who is impressed with this film has never been interested in watching real classical music movies. Except for the great performances of Eddie Murphy's great musical and dramatic performances, Dream Girls is just a TV movie with no style or flair. Just an amateur singing! <br /> <br /> Now the first half hour is good. But I was frustrated with Eddie Murphy's crazy fanatical acting. That is the best song and the best show in the movie, and the "up to the top" part of the movie is only part of the movie that has a consistent view or has any momentum. The remaining hours and 45 That minute is a form of disorientation and disorientation that is not realistic or amazing. It looks boring and includes too many similar sounds. <br /> <br /> Condon didn't try to turn any song into a big show as I expected. Each number in the second half is just one closeup after others "sing" to each other and the way they shoot numbers. "Love me" The great Hudson's is illegal! Condon just shot her, stomping around the stage - no drama! God sucked it! <br /> <br /> and notes for everyone involved - what "conversation dialogue" may work on the stage But it doesn't work in movies (See the embarrassing failure of Evita and Phantom) Everything that "I'll hit youuuu something" Efff-ieeee! "Shit should be left on the floor of the room. That's not" Song ". <br /> < br /> Again movie - except Eddie Murphy's amazing performance - nothing more than a popular TV movie. Must have megabucks behind the publicity for this movie! I wonder how much money will be spent for Oscar to be a hilarity before anyone else. An overview of this film, except for Eddie's movies, nowhere to be a talent movie Oscar! (Except Eddie) I will rank there with Grease 2 BIG especially disappointed after all (I have a lot of income) hype!
