Don't be mistaken. This is not a horror movie or a real movie. I strongly recommend to watch 82 minutes of failure; The only reason for receiving stars is the presence of Chris Pine. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a hint of surprise as a plot to happen - but not <br /> <br /> The characters change aggressively in their actions. he Have time to develop - thank the editors who are thrifty and the writers are ashamed straightforward - before returning to a beautiful and playful state (Brought to the teenage montage) The only thing that makes it worse is to add a perishable ethnic 'companion' token. <br /> <br /> Confrontation with obstacles. (Whether human or physical) is short, confusing and totally pointless If he spends the summer with Keanu Reaves fighting the desert Navada I beg you to experience boredom, which is different from you may have been convinced in this movie.
