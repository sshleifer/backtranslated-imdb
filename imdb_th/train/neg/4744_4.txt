The worst DCOM I have ever seen may not be as bad as a smart house. It's terrible. Actions and stories do well. But the surprising effects <br /> <br /> They are very fake! The only good fight scene is between the brothers and Shen. That may be the only scene that I'm excited. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found this movie very boring and the movie ended immediately. <br /> <br /> I'll give four for Brenda Sung, who is a very funny actor and fight scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
