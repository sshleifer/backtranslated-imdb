Unfortunately, the value of entertainment, intention or unintentional being crushed by disjointed stories, lack of practice for a long time, and poor quality of any current action to make it easy. That can't be tolerated: <br /> <br /> 1) You don't know what happened. <br /> <br /> 2) Almost no fighting. <br /> <br /> 3) Fighting at There is a short and terrifying shot. <br /> <b r /> Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Lee is beautiful. Her face is glorious. For them only I gave "The Bodyguard" is the second star from 10 movies. This makes 87 minutes feel like 5 hours.
