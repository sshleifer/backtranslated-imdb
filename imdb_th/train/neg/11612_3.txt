Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returned to the screen after his debut, this time it was a movie played for uh ?? During a diving trip, Rome found the body of a blonde beauty on the seabed, her feet as you expected, wrapped in cement. Rome, in the immediate case after being hired by the mountain man Waldo Gronsky, Rome found himself at risk as soon as he had to investigate certain types of mafia that looked at him and he found himself the main suspect. Must run away and hope to solve the problem alone Sinatra tried to sell jokes to us and convinced us that he was a good detective. Oh and not talking about having sex appeal to Raquel Welch. But he was miserably failed The ridiculous excuse that frankly surrounds every woman is quite surprising. Every woman in this movie is the head of a head that likes to bend in front of the camera. They every time they Bent back muscles There are even funky gay characters who are begged to believe that this is a movie created by "real men" for "real men" to confirm their gender. The flag set is a shameful problem.
