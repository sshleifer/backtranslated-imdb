I'm very disappointed in this movie. If so, it is weak that is bordering with silly: a spirit that can affect the reality that they do? Obviously, the mission is very important for Soul Hunters who have been assigned to be one of their younger members? And the whole story of B and "holobrothel" and the prosecution of the station was so bad that at one point I broke out on television "Why are you wasting your time on this matter?" <br /> <br /> The heart of the "river of spirits" is not related to the questions of the soul in more depth than the original "Hunters Spirit" We see that Soul Hunters can make mistakes. But we still don't feel their culture (Which female spirit hunters are there?) <br /> <br /> The performance doesn't matter because the content they have to work with and special effects, especially the planets in the first performance, are impressive. Much But overall I would say that I missed this.
