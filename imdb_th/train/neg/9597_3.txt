As far as I like Japanese movies, this story not only cuts ... movies that should be about the rebellion and survival of the royal family, becoming a very slow movie with a suspicious plan. Photographing is ok, even though I can see better sword fighting scenes in Japanese movies. Other things, fast cameras and the way they follow characters do not convince me at all. The soundtrack is so weak that you don't notice its appearance. But the worst thing is the method that has been developed. I have to admit that sometimes I understand that who is who and what happens .. Peaceful love between the main character and another chapter is not necessary and seems to come. From the influence of Hollywood, <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you are looking for action-oriented Japanese movies, it's very slow with very little sword fighting scenes and sentimental feelings ... in the way. That's wrong ...
