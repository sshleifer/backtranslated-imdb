I can't help thinking of the back mask: Leslie Vernon (More amazing movies) when watching this because of the realism and great creativity This may be a great movie. The performance is ... from some actors. It's okay from others ... It's so scary. <br /> <br /> In addition to good ideas and that style Excellent The story is quite good as well, although suffering is often caused by a massive explosion to a rational mind. <br /> <br /> Never mind. It's a horror movie. After all, <br /> <br /> I really want to see this remade ... I want it to be a great movie that it wants. <br /> <br /> But (and you don't Can really blame the idea behind this film) This created from the shoe line budget and fx damage to the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Great movie ... If you Must switch to Better performances and fx /> <br /> slightly better whoever wrote <br it should continue.
