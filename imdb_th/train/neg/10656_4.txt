What can I say? The movie Kamal Hassan is very scary. He has performed very well. But it is a scary story with a horrible direction In my opinion, director Gautham Menon had to give up in directing. There are many tragedies in the movie. In addition, we cannot believe how horrific those crimes are. Not useful in the movie. Gautham has just finished the story, but both Kamal Hassan and Jyothika do really well. I don't think this is a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa, which you can watch with your family. You won't sleep watching this movie !! However, Harris Jayaraj did a great job again and that's why I gave this movie 4 of the 10 songs of 'Partha Modail Nallae', lively and relaxing. Apart from that, the movie is excellent. Overall, this is just a bad movie and not good. Kamal Hassan I think it should be denied this movie.
