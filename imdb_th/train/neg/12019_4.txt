I read good reviews on this board for "Mr. Scarface" but for everyone who did not practice in the Gangster movie of Italy like myself, the picture may look very sensible. In fact, after the initial settings associated with the ten million deception of the lira, the image turned into a fairly regular revenge, with a slight twist on the identity of Rick (Al Cliver) characters. Makes me confused by combining Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but while other audiences commented, he was the only person who gave this picture to his life in an ineffective effort. I find it quite unbelievable that Manzari's followers, who chase Tony through the streets, were not stunned before Tony shook their hands. For his entire collection as a character named Jack Palance lost his desperate desperation near the end of the war against the United States, "Mr. Scarface" is quite suspicious. I've seen spaghetti guava enough to know that they don't all work; I guess in this case, the first look at the spaghetti flick. The thugs do not make it either.
