I love Columbo and have seen quite a lot of episodes. But this one is undoubtedly ranked the worst of the lot. Piles of boring and pointless piles, which are pointless, which spoil both the time of the audience watching and the ability of Peter Falk's performance that looks very boring. 'Plot', as it seems, will. Was created because the movie proceeded with not even a slight hint of the ingredients in the recipe that made the show a great success in the beginning Part of the proceedings I found was very confusing. (Or annoying) is the character of Peter Falk, who was introduced to guests who attended the wedding as 'Lt' Columbo. If the manufacturer insists on keeping the secret of Columbo's name, why can't they cut the line? This is totally because it sounds ridiculous? As I said, this is a hole and all Columbo fans would do well to avoid it like an epidemic.
