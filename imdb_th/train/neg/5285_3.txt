Some places on this website have written that in order to get Jane Austen's best work, we should read it easily. I agree with that However, we love the excellent literary adaptations and the current writers' strike, reminding that if there are no good writers, it is difficult for actors to take their roles to live. Jane Austen's PERSUASION The current version shows us what happens when you don't have a good basis for a well-written adaptation. This version does not compare with the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which serves well and remains the importance of the era and character limitations (except except for the strange parades & kissing in the street scene in Bath). Version 2007 shows Anne having anger. Other characters are not very developed, which is a crime, considering how Austen can draw such great characters. Choosing a certain prudence. The sequence of events that can be understood in this novel is completely thrown away, and Anne Smith, a poor and poor school friend of Anne, is walking around in Bath - walking around as many characters. People seem to do The strength of the characters and the ingenuity of Captain Wentworth, which made Anne love him at first, seems to have not been written in Rupert Penry Jones. Wentworth Ciaran Hinds has more content and can be media More than this, PJ can do it with his poses. Overall, the 2007 model year was disappointing. It seems to reduce the novelty to become a worthwhile melodrama that will be debated. If they want to bring our modern emotional luxuries to Austen's work, they should do what they do about Shakespeare's adaptations: adapt to at least today. " Bride & Prejudice "was removed from the historical setting and location and was fun to watch as well as" Clueless ". This is not PERSUASION but they do not know what to call it.
