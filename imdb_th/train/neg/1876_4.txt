This is a low budget spoof of espionage. To help determine your expectations, you should know: (1) The performance is heavy. The stars are enjoying sending eyes with excessive gestures, frequent hand gestures and spacing from the keys. (2) The script lacks continuity and reliability. The lines often have sudden vibrations and humor because they are not related to the previous plot elements. (3) Shots are framed in an unbalanced angle. (4) Jeff Gold Lam Popeye offers a classic, complex and miserable dialogue in a style. <br /> <br /> This film has a clever approach, starting with the plot that was stolen from the movie. B of 1930: Secret Code Carl Sagan's description of the film's great performance is mainly used for comic effects. During the first 90 minutes of the gag, Ned, Fay's son, Grim, was ordered. Let out often until you can't help laughing while feeling sorry for the boy. Parker Posey The beautiful fall posture design from the bed also helps create laughter early in the movie. <br /> <br /> The slow pacing of the film does not have a comedy element or elements of the drama that occurred later. The impact of this film is dramatically reduced from the original comedy. Moreover, it is difficult to be too involved with their characters and fate when the first part of the film is sarcastic. The music score is very strong and I find that (And non-violent camera angles) more annoying than jokes. <br /> <br /> Great performances, reasonable and elusive thoughts / responses to rebellion and slow pacing will make a large audience. This movie is too long at 158 ​​minutes. <br /> <br /> That said, fans who are sensitive to the movie's satire may want to watch again ... using captions to get the most intelligent dialogue. This film is too slow for me and the friction is heavier than the light. But comedy movies may attract your tastes very well This movie is worthy of independent film enthusiasts, the fans of director Hal Harley or the likes of Parker Posey (who has the most time on the camera).
