I have to congratulate the genius that has been certified Edward Furlong. You are not as good as you think. Friends. You can't grab all the cheap amateur shit. The only intention is to get a certain amount. > <br /> The filming is not good and I mean bad. Anyone with a camera will get the same results or better. <br /> <br /> Actions Suppose don't go to the supermarket looking for actors. Good people tend to have a degree, or at least have a damn experience! Director .. Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your purpose in life as a director you suck Your director is bad. The angle is messy. (Not in a good way) The lines look like they're reading from toilet paper and damn songs ... It always happens when it shouldn't and Go out without a clear reason And don't go to writers as well Making movies is not like serving on a coffee shop. It requires art and skills. What I really doubt you will have. <br /> <br /> Instead of creating a bad drama movie, you should shoot something. this Go back to forgiveness and wait until something good happens .. or just go find a job on the coffee shop. You will have less stress and you will save money on watching movies and getting cash back. <br /> <br /> Vote: 1/10 (My first one)
