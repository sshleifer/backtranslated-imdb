This film is not interesting, except during the first ten minutes. Speed ​​and editing are a perfect introduction to the band's performance better than Gosford Park. Then, it slowly mysteriously loses focus and begins to resemble only the original French movies that will eventually come to focus on the relationship. The love between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve) in the middle has a lot of pitches and has an end that is too loose in many stories. The beginning is still endless. <br /> <br /> ******* The The spoilers ahead, the main subject is the relationship between Antoine and Cecil. He was loyal to her after he had had an affair with her many years ago, despite being remarried and housed in Morocco. As a creator, he now created his own life and recovered her with the mask of Cécile's marriage. After completing this, he was buried after a strange accident. (Literally) and became a coma He woke up after she had burned their old image as an indicator that they were reconciled with the past and able to start their lives again appropriately together. <br /> <br /> It is unclear whether the vision this director wants us to see because there are many other stories here: illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, have a radio often. Broadcasting about the overthrow of Iraq's past regime Cécile's son is bisexual and dog bitten (loyal) when he meets his girlfriend while the woman he lives with seems to be sick (then?). Her sister is a traditional Muslim and has a relationship with her husband. Of Cécile It shows that Morocco does not have to go back, although every building with strange colonial vision shines through, which almost praises the past. It shows that Islam is lagging behind and tend to be extremists, which sometimes can be true. But certainly not in general In the end, it can be explained entirely as a place to add coolers and arters. <br /> <br /> Deneuve and Depardieu are great. With this material, they are so familiar, they can rotate something special in every scene: raise eyebrows, body language, pride that spreads awkward behavior. This film is disappointing and confirms the limited role of French cinema in the world today. There are certainly some notable exceptions.
