Use "Rambo" mixed in "Miami Vice" to cut the budget by 80% and you have something that a few ten-year-old boys come up with if they have a big backyard & too much access to the "Penthouse" Cop and the past. Commando McBain (Busey and with the name McBain, you know he is the most manners possible) was selected to pull the stolen American super hero in Mexico. Caught with the tank being hardbitten Sgt Major O'Rourke (Jones) & McBain Devon's old love (Fluegel), the commander and now the meat for the terrorist / spy / merciless drug dealer. For action movies that have low sex, have a lot of action and have sex. The joke that happened was that McBain was shot all the time and survived. Collecting ammunition as a souvenir. Obviously, the author does not see "The Magnificent Seven" ("The person for us is the person who makes him see that face") and doesn't think McBain is wise. Even for budget planners, production costs are not good, with very little distance between interaction and movement. The main pillar of the tank is stupid enough for Ed Wood Fluegel, who used to be Julia Robert Blonde. (She has a bigger role in "Crime Story" than Julia!) Must change from pretending to be shocked until kicking the butt and back again immediately. Jones, who is in an amazing movie, is stuck here. Both he and Busey may come out with easy money and laugh a few times. Look for talented actors and future Danny Trejo ("Heat" "Once upon a time in Mexico") in a horrible stereotype. Too boring for guilty pleasures "Bulletproof" is still noisy enough to play when you leave home. But want people to think that someone is at home
