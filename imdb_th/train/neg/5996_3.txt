Thunderbird (2004) <br /> <br /> Director: Jonathan Franks <br /> <br /> Starring: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbett <br /> <br /> 5? 4 ?? 3?? 2 ?? 1! Thunderbirds! <br /> <br /> Suddenly, Thunderbird was my favorite childhood. When I heard that they were going to create a Thunderbird movie, I was happy. I can't wait to see Thunderbird 2 screaming to save people's lives. As Thunderbird 4 dives into your mind, I can't wait. Then came in August 2004. When the movie was finally released Critics Pan It But I still want to go Finally, as long as the heart is in the same place, that is important to me. So I sat in the theater, the only teenager in the group of 50 people, all over thirty and ten years old. Could it be the most awkward theater experience I have ever had? <br /> <br /> The movie (which is intended as a prequel) focuses on Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet), the youngest of Tracy clan. He spends his life hoping that he can help people. Can be like the rest of the family But he is too young One day, he finally got a chance when The Hood (Ben Kingsley) sets the trap for the rest of the family on Thunderbird 5 (space station). This story involves the fact that he must outsmart The Hood and help his family before. The Hood can Steal all the money from Bank of England. <br /> <br /> Believe me, the plot sounds like a normal episode of Thunderbird. When you read it on paper When it was taken, it was what we had in our hands. First of all, this movie is for children like the first episode shown However, Jerry Anderson treats us as adults and provides a fairly progressive plan for children's programming. On the other hand, causing the plot to shake while trying to make himself a franchise for Spy Kids. The final product is a movie that tries to attract fans of the Thunderbird series and children while That lacks both comedy, comics, and comedy that nobody thinks are amusing around this movie, and I'm sure Jonathan Frakes wants him to never direct this story. <br /> <br /> Every Every person gives Good image by considering all received scripts Ben Kingsley is great as The Hood. My only complaint about the character is about the followers of The Hood, who had been reduced from the old Looney Tunes cartoons to miraculously bounce back. When the kids easily took them, <br /> <br /> There is nothing strange about this. The movie is while I watch movies. I enjoy. But when the light lit up, I realized that this movie was quite bad. I softened to $ 8 and my time was gone for two hours. Happiness that is wrong? Maybe. However, Thunderbird is a memorable mess. Instead of "going", I suggest you avoid this movie. If the rest of the movie seems to be like the first ten minutes of this movie, it would be an incredible movie that should be worth the name of Thunderbird. However, we received a movie with Thunderbird fans. (If you want to see your childhood being torn in pieces) or something that is really boring to pay attention <br /> <br /> My rating for Thunderbird is 1 star rating.
