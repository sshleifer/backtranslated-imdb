Amy Heckerling's second film, Johnny Dangerously, is a parody of the 1930s gangster movie made in the Warner Brothers tradition. Michael Keaton is a middle-aged gangster star looking back at his life when he caught a child trying. Stealing from his pet store in 1935, Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) had health problems. At a young age through Peter Boyle, at the same time, Richard Dimitri, a fargan player, played a criminal who was a rival to Boyle and Keaton. Eventually he got up in the Joe Piscopo line. Griffin Dunn is the brother of Keaton, the district attorney, Glynn O'Connor, his wife and Marilyn Henner as Keelon. The movie seems notoriously cheap, making it look like a television show instead of a drama movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a great start and slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialogue and movie pulp, it is owned in the first half. But after that it would lose steam quickly and flow into ordinary and rude people in the second half Keaton Chewing Scenery makes James Cagney the most impressive. Stapleton has many nasty vulgar lines, not a joke. Piscopo made a bit "once" too many times. Many supporting actors tried to seize the fort, such as Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street trader. Alan Hale, Jr. as the table leader and Sudie Bond is an unscrupulous clean woman. The second half of the year evolved into a popular tone or missed on TV shows. The closing scenes using The Roaring Twenties were the era of The Call of The Wild Clark Gable, which was seen in the tents earlier in this film. I think Heckerling should Better known because the target audience must be aware of the actual release date of The Roaring Twenties in 1939 * 1/2 from 4 stars.
