Fans of goremeister Herschel Gordon Lewis should look elsewhere if they pick up this movie so that his blood tank is sloshed because of a small amount of blood release in this movie. But Lewis decided to try and tell a strange story based on a special effect in a cheap basement that might have doubled if the actors had changed their bags for a change. Change in one day Oddly enough, while being cheap and acting very badly (Especially by McCabe as Mitchell) All of the plot's foreign interest keeps attention throughout. Imagine how this movie will be with the right budget! Overall, it is a strain for champagne tastes on a beer budget.
