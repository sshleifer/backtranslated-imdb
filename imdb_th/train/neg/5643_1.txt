I am the owner of two home entertainment stores and I've seen bad movies in my time. But this one is terrible. I forced me to register here and comment on it. How bad is it? Suppose Sophia Coppola deserves an Oscar for her performance in Godfather III, compared to Giada Colagrande in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a robot and without being uninspired. Her lover had died a month before she arrived at the 'Baan Yang' that he had given to her. She found that he cheated on her throughout her relationship. But doesn't seem to register with her Within one day, she began to have a relationship with Leslie (Dafoe), the house attendant, even though she married Dafoe outside of the screen. Her scenes with him were cold and uninteresting. Miss it Even Willem Dafo was unable to help this film from the amateur train wreck in the movie theater where it was.
