Immediately after renting and watching this movie many years ago, my friend and I decided that it set the absolute value to zero at the movie level. Nothing about movies that could be worse than that again. To this day, we still rate movies, even movies that are terrible. How much are they better than "The Lonely Lady"? <br /> <br /> A long time ago For other things "last summer" and "diary of crazy housewives" and she said that she was asked to write a screenplay for Harold Robbins' book "The lonely woman", she said that she sent for treatment and it was rejected because they didn't think she understood the problems of female script writers in Hollywood. Then she said "I think they have other people to write." The interview was filmed before the film was released. She died in 1981 and I bet that the first thing she did when she arrived in heaven was personally thanking God for helping her from participating in the results.
