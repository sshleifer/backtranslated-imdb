I saw this movie on the day This afternoon and I can't see who can sit in this trash. It's not funny at all, and it takes a little wavy time. I know that this movie is for kids, but that doesn't mean that writers should use their intelligence to give permission. I bet that the writer is sitting around a big wooden table and thinks a) the word "poop" is equal to a big laugh. B) A four-foot-tall boy can dip into the basketball net with ten C) Children should always fight with the kidnappers armed with guns because the kidnapper will fall in love and d) 3 months karate training is all you have to overcome with a ninja called a sword. One good thing I can say about this movie is that it has the "gang" of the weakest suburbs in the world that can't make anyone afraid. Maybe those MST3K may use this movie for a good laugh. Don't pay attention to the weak excuse for this movie.
