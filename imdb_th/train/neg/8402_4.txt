Three Stooges in the western comedy movie, perhaps "Rockin 'in the Rockies" may mean combining short Stooges comedy with Western music in matin√©e; If so, this is a good way to quit Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (like rust) is a handsome young hero; And Mary Beth Hughes (in June, blonde) and Gladys Blake (As Betty Brown) is a beautiful woman. Hoosier Hotshots is a harmonious group. Their songs are quite melodious. However, this is the 1940s, not the 50s, so this movie is not "rock". There are a few laughter. But the humor of the Stooges brand is quieter than usual. The horses that are mentioned are not yet useful. <br /> <br /> **** Rockin 'in the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
