(Reviews are in English because they are not allowed to use the Swedish language) <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with very low expectations and I can let you know that this movie is hardly possible. <br /> <br /> As far as I like to see Janne "Loffe" Karlsson on the big screen again, the writer should know from the beginning in the writing process that seven people fell into the water, not Strange or funny The story is very thin and funny and predictable. Stories that are not just boring. I smiled like three times in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The Swedish product Findus is a joke. (Unintentionally) Why isn't it just a big symbol that says; "Findus makes it happen!" <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 doesn't have to go to the cinema or on the DVD. Just wait for it to broadcast on TV. It takes too long.
