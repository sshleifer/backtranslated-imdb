It seems like one of the movies that we think we should like. But i didn't do It seems to be trying too hard to be 'Arty'. All flashes don't have content. It has beautiful scenes and one of them is something to follow. But they all together and it became a difficult task, just sit through I rent it because of the glowing comments on the video box and the fact that I am a big Shakespeare fan. But I was very disappointed I just found it boring and sometimes boring.
