This documentary begins with interesting evidence - it creates interesting and credible arguments that the history of Jesus is generally believed to be legendary. Unfortunately, after doing this with us, the movie will change gears and become more than a non-stop Christian attack and focus on a simple goal. Something with the church (He is a former Christian publisher and has legitimate anger) and the film seems to be a form of his debut. It's interesting to see the first 20 minutes of expansion, but overall, this movie is disappointing.
