(Spoiler) Wow, this is terrible. I do it twice when watching the old Star Trek episode the other day - it's something that everyone gets infected from that area and then is a little crazy. at night! He played the first person infected with the crew who died from depression. All I can think of is that he has seen his own movie too many times, which is what causes depression. This movie is full of people who are not really cute. There is no character redeemed in the movie, not one. It's very difficult to feel bad about Dr. Beck turns into a bat. (Or whatever he becomes real) because you don't like him And you don't like his shrill, bone wife or Sgt. Nasty Ward or Dr. Mustache Love ... then why do you have to invest time or energy in this movie? In the absence of sympathy with the characters, there is no reason to pay attention to it. Not to mention the scary movie, which makes them look like filming movies through urine and special effects, five hundred bats, most of which seem to be a piece of paper thrown into the fan to simulate a flying bat It's not the worst movie I have ever seen in MST3K, but it definitely comes down to the bottom.
