This is the most romantic and funny comedy I have ever seen. Every scene is very precious and the actors bring two people - Corey and Danny very annoying. Corey is a fool and innocent and shouldn't listen to Danny's false promises. <br /> <br /> Neve Campbell and the Killer from Urban Legend are the only redemption features in the movie. Danny Paras looks at his thirties and the woman he tries to sleep in. Corey looks as though she's still in college. <br /> <br /> Here in Australia, this movie is named Too Smooth; Nothing smooth about this movie. 1/10 Avoid
