So when Herbie made my first appearance, I was perfectly happy to see Dean Jones Kelley. I just wanted to be entertained in just a few hours and eat popcorn with too much butter. Now, unfortunately, I expect a sensational / delightful story whenever I watch a movie if I don't take medicine. And this is another good movie for drug users No significant laughter, no complicated plot lines, no difficult twists. Herbie is fully loaded for full load. <br /> <br /> This is the first time I've seen La Lohan on the screen since she changed places. With Jamie Lee Curtis (I think she's great about that) and I can't say that I'm very impressed at this time. In addition to her unnatural hair color that is constantly changing and ridiculous, she does not have a real ring when the children at the house that spend a lifetime hanging around the street race. Her 'speed needs' are not consistently shown in movies - maybe it is somewhere else - she looks older in her part and seems to always look for something. (A popular designer changed a new place to spend money) Set. I don't see any chemistry with Justin Long. Love is the best. The only time that Lindsay was involved was when she interacted with Matt Dillon, which I thought was the most suitable as a bad evil. Guy Trip Murphy <br /> <br /> It's a good story. Have seen Herbie again and i love Intro movies with materials from old movies If Disney emerges with Car 53 jewelry, I may wear something for loyalty. His new features (?) Are a little inconsistent. (Did he follow the driver's mind? Is he now playing skateboarding?) But whatever we all know how it will end But I hope he will meet someone who is less dazed than Maggie. And my head is still painful from that lesson. Maggie and the audience. We hammered the house. <br /> <br /> What will make the movie worth? There is an old Herbie in the real story with a real plot - at least Herbie and Lassie - but it's clear that it's asking too much. Why did Disney return to the same point as "Herbie Goes Bananas" and "Computers that wear tennis shoes?" Why is innovation? <br /> <br /> I'm sure this is a great movie for children and those who don't have expectations. For the rest of us .... it is for when you have symptoms 'Flu and can not use the suspicion of the rear window
