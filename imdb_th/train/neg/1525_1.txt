I watched this on the weekend afternoon because there was nothing else. It would be more fun to chew my feet and maybe less painful. I want everyone to see this thing just to see how bad the movie can be. It is purposely. I am cringed in every useless effort that carries humor in a child, unrehearsed, badly executed, that it is beyond belief. This is a movie that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas. I think I am really exaggerated? Give airtime and think again The most horrible If this is not a prank, the director and others responsible for this story should be removed and fired immediately after being forced to watch this movie again.
