Can not display the exchange quality I wish I could get my time back. A good skull face smiling really bright on the camera. When the disease killed the people in a bad script, I ((spoiler)) was happy to see all the dead or incompetent characters. At the end, especially the party poop who drank contaminated water on their way to the alleged sunset. Eliot shines for a moment. There may be ten theories that say how weed smoking in the forest is good when others soak up beer. Overall, I found that most were pointless, even though they didn't use violence without reason and didn't have enough nudity, happy to see the death of the actors in the way that they hoped. Will not happen at night, uh)
