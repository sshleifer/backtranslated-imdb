As a mother of 2 children who are or should I say, grow up with the reincarnation of Scooby. I feel well positioned to comment on Scooby, the historical and current versions. <Br /> <br /> If it's a family We have never seen any episodes before Shaggy and Scooby have received clues that we might enjoy. It is light weight. Nothing special. Saturday morning cartoons. But most importantly, the problem is in its current form, so light weight that it will not have the longevity of Scooby and the "old" gang. I'm sure it might succeed in getting a quick financial return. But I am confident that the long-term purchase in the elderly and young people is in the real danger of losing my 6 year old son who saw the new version, not satisfied and without any stimulation. Terrible and why it doesn't like the final series (Where are you?) <br /> <br /> People are scrappy. Looks like an anomaly But never ending better Hope to receive a clue to get a reference to the manufacturer.
