I like Jane Austin's novel. I love books and movies, arrogance and prejudice, feelings and feelings, and I passed halfway through Mansfield Park, but I couldn't get to Emma. I quit using this book after 2 chapters and at the end of the movie I don't care about Emma. She doesn't seem to change at all. Maybe it was Paltrow's performance. (Which is great in Seven) or I'm not interested in the movie dunno <br /> <br /> The costume is good But the dance is quite clumsy compared to the Pride and Prejudice dance by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. <br /> <br /> I gave it 2, basically for Knightly, beautiful blood, and although it was a rather mixed show for Ewan McGregor but I like to sing his songs
