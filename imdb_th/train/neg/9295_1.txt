I was so surprised that this movie was bad. Good movie shooting and beautiful landscapes can only shoot movies. I hope to get a repeat of the Hero, but it's a lot worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is the reason that Kung Fu movies received bad reputation at first. No convincing characters (Even in the cartoon world of Kung Fu movies, these characters are ridiculous) almost no plot and twisted absurd stories. <br /> <br /> The film is boring and annoying because it reminds you of Trying to make a make make game with your child every time you think your stupid fight causes a strange feeling. They invented another absurd twist that is unreasonable. ("Ah, you just think you have a magical power and 10,000 ray guns, but I eat my vitamins with plutonium." And Teflon, so your ray gun can't be used and I'm invulnerable with your magical power .... don't have to touch no one plus infinite exchange ") Children can continue with this insanity Because they do not care that Everyone is listening because they're fun. However, for viewers, especially adult audiences, long films, this story is worse than the competition with waste gas. <br /> <br /> A spoiler in front. Note for Kung Fu filmmakers. In you Come back to hurt until you are in the PCP, in which case your kung fu is not strong (b) if you repeatedly fall on your back with a knife in it, it will hurt more and do more damage unless Is a fake pillar (c) when you are stabbed with a knife heart, you die, especially in ancient China, where there is no Kaiserperen around the corner Snow feet and (e) sometimes Whether it's worth the while describing the characters and their aspirations <br /> <br /> In no case shall go to see the hero again, because at least in the small world of its own.
