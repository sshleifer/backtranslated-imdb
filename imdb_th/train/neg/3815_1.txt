The show is a bad ham. All the jokes are superficial and the target audience is clearly a very young child, assuming that they have a lower IQ than the average. I know it is meant for children, but Malcom is in the middle. But they still have a sense of humor and circumstances for adults. <br /> <br /> What should we expect from the show, led by Bob Saget, the only comedian? In existence that is a little more funny than a ball in the groin of a man, which may be the reason why he stopped hosting the most fun video home in America. You want to save money in college, let your children be confused and foolish.
