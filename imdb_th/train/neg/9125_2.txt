It is one of the jokes about being a child that can be easily fooled by advertising. I have spoken earlier in other films, which are commercially available for movies (funny), making it look more fun than it is. Seeing an advertisement for this thing in 1981 made me think that this would be the most funny movie, what I and my brother who went and agreed with me didn't know was the scene used in TV commercials as the last scene. In the movie! <br /> <br /> Since this scene is the final result of all that happened earlier in the movie, I can guess that there is nothing funny to use! The last scene is thanks to poison for children. Fu Manchu changed from an old man with a long mustache to an Asian / Elvis boy like a rock star! (With no less singers backing!) <br /> <br /> Set up without a reason. In 1930, Peter Sellers did his best with the materials that were close at hand. The rest of the actors were just people. Normal, boring and my brother and I laughed through this story almost every thing. It is a common thing that we expect to be a comedian of the type "Pink Panther" Peter Zeller is very good. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that is pathetic. This is his last movie before. He will die His appearance in the Muppet Show is more fun than failure. Still, I didn't make him wrong. I was wrong with other people involved in not trying to create a better movie. 2 stars. Good cheer !!
