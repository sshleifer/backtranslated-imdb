The evidence of this film is good enough. But with sub-performances, it is gentle and boring. <br /> <br /> This film spoiler doesn't work because of the nature of death. It's a murder. It's not like the man intended to do. There is also a secret that reveals that this kind of event causes justice to a certain extent. There is no emotion in this movie, the first 20 minutes or just having this girl call her sister and hear her message. It's boring and boring. <br /> <br /> With some scrubs and better performances, it should be good.
