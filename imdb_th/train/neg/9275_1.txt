Omen IV (1991) is a bad guy for T.V. The movie since the 1980s ended. I guess the executives are experimenting with potions. (Drugs selected during the 90s) because there is no other reason to explain this imitation. Why do they do this t.v movie? What are they thinking when this happens on the idea board? Do they even think that this movie will be the next story? Maybe they think it can be made into a series? We will never know But i know one thing This film is the main reason that I have never bought the Om's The Min's trilogy. They should fall a couple of dollars instead of putting this "special" sheet out. Omen IV, in general, the American family will create the first movie. Rather than being a punk boy, we have a nose, a nose, a scary girl who is left with all the people around her. If the family has stronger parenting skills, there will not be any devil incidents that appear in the past. These parents need to put their feet down and actually discipline! <br /> <br /> Not the best advice to avoid costs!
