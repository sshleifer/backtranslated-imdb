The same difficulty that I have with the musical "Les Miserables" applies equally to "Oliver". They only wrote the Broadway style melodies that were never before and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The same brutality and unsightly activities of the drama do not mix with some sunny ditties. Absorb the score well It is an uncomfortable mixture that makes sour taste well. <br /> <br /> Oliver's casting doesn't help anything: uncertain things in a short time and annoying value. Fagin performed his daily activities adequately, although the songs he needed to sing were a little bit of time. <br /> <br /> "As long as he wants me" will receive strange, throat and stressful actions. Two large production numbers, "Who's buying" and "Considering yourself", looking beyond power, everything except the kitchen sink thrown in. It's one thing everyone must go out. <br /> <br /> Sadness, despair, and viciousness of most novels do not seem to lend themselves to dance and dance. While this novel is a classic, I have to admit that I have problems with Dickens' consciousness because his work tends to release negative vibrations. This may be because of his personal life, which is full of disappointment and regret. <br /> <br /> Not all of the abilities of this production, whether it is a rear or rear camera, can overcome the nature that Without obstructions of basic materials All of this resulted in me feeling uncomfortable. <br /> <br />
