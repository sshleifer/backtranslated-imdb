Obviously, people who write behind the box are not interested in watching this "movie". They explain that "Intrigue and violence designed unbelievably" I do not see "intrigue". I see a miserable effort in Kung Fu movies. Instead, I don't see "violence". At least I don't see anything that makes. I do not believe in what might cause a man to hurt the skin that is "not allowed" - but here I may reveal too much about the "plot". (Some stories, including occasional kung fu movies) I can honestly say that this celluloid cannot be checked. What you may choose to do, I will still <br /> <br /> correct. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> PS. I didn't look at the choreography.
