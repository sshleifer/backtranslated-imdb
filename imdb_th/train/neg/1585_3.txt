::: SPOILER ALERT ::: <br /> <br /> Soooo, Arnie is really good, but after the incident of a helicopter fight and disobedience, he was sent to prison. (Or more) work camps) He escaped, but after a while he was arrested again. This time ended with a bizarre reality show that he should run for a while from a group of people with many themes and eventually died. But we all know Arnie and we all know that he is stronger than the strongest. <br /> <br /> I want to like this movie. However, "The Running Man" has too many flaws that make I was really annoyed, for example. The creation of the new Arnie battle within the helicopter, which the spectators who received the shock showed a summary of the events that occurred with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that Helicopters The soldiers at Arnie flew with nearly 10 cameras filming the crew, one of which was _inside_ the eyes of a crew member at Arnie. <br /> <br /> There are other shortcomings. As well, and the plot, which in theory seems to be interesting and innovative, can be used for a while, then creates a group of ignorance and unrealisticness that it drowned. <br /> <br /> The show can't really be said. Say that it is always better than sub stories with Arnie in the leading role. The rest of the actors get bad or bad. <br /> <br /> Special effects are okay. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Score: 3/10
