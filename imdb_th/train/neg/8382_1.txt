There is a Bugs Bunny cartoon named "Baby Buggy Bunny" that matches this story. Facing the boy, Finster robbed the bank and money in the car rolled out and fell into the Bug's rabbit hole. He dressed as a boy to enter the Bugg's hole to receive money. The scene in "Little Man" that he looked in the bathroom mirror shaved with a cigar In his mouth is straight from the cartoon This is a hilarious 5 minute cartoon, not a movie. If you are really interested in this, buy a Bugs Bunny DVD. It is more original in the first time (1954). Moreover, you will get a classic Bugs Bunny cartoon rather than boot!
