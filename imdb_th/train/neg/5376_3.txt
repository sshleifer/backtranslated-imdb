THE CHOKE (also known as AX in the UK) is a slasher created in the form of DVD movies. I say "should" because the movie's name does not have "V" in parentheses to indicate that it was created for DVD movies (Although it has a look of one) <br /> <br /> Easy plot? The band is holding a gig in the packing factory in the past and they are killed one by one. <br /> <br /> I think most will agree that this movie has never been a masterpiece. But this is not a mistake here, even straight-to-DVD movies, such as the BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb rating), has many redeeming features and sometimes comes out of being one of the movies that call. that "Very bad, they are good." However, THE CHOKE is too short to be a serious Slasher (like Halloween) or a movie that "Very bad, it's good" (eg THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE) <br /> <br /> The movie starts to close. Good with the characters killed by using a drill The impact of the blood is wonderful. But understandable because the budget is very low But from that point on, it has fallen all the way. <br /> <br /> There are many mistakes in THE CHOKE that I can spend all day talking about them. But there are some who are clear and I will go to them. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, as the band seems to have started with about 50 people, but after the song stopped, it seems to be There are only 8 people left (and still means being locked!) <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are not favorite. Most of the members of the band are violent or aggressive. No one really cares about what happened to them and even the friends they should forget when they were sent. The highlight of this movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to see that the packing factory is a church. (Seriously!) He plunged really funny lines without clear reason. But sadly, his appearance was unable to record movies. <br /> <br /> There are many people who walk around and talk without any special features. The film takes about 65 minutes. The character walked away. The character disappeared for a long time without explanation. Like in the direct movies, other DVDs such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters take the time to swear each other seriously without provocation. With more regular eruptions (Mostly from male characters) and almost causing full-blown fighting In fact, the pattern can be said as follows: The character walks around - the murder occurs - the character walks around - the murder occurs. You get the idea. <br /> <br /> The conversation is terrible and it seems that there are a few lines without using the word f. Maybe this is a joke. But it's sad And another issue, we have seen this thing done a thousand times before (Usually with more impact) <br /> <br /> This film is without any doubt. The body acts as an indicator that the character is in danger only. Mania runs around loosely and the characters act like all morons. They try to leave the factory or find weapons to protect themselves. And many times they do not pretend to be afraid. <br /> <br /> In the same vein as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the killer will not see at the time of the murder. Except for the final murder when revealing the identity of the killer) random weapons appear to kill the suspected victim. No one can see the character at any time in DRIVE-IN MASSACRE. This makes the movie funny. (Unintentionally) But here is not a joke. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And when other reviewers point out Terrible, even for people who like punk rock. Specialty, watching the choreography is uneasy. The score (at the end, there is no song at the beginning!) Consists of a group of Sugarbabe Wannabes singing some very bad songs that are not related to the movie. Done in this app This investigator likes bad movies (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as much as classic movies. (Such as Halloween and Friday the 13th), but it seems that THE CHOKE tries too hard to be one of those categories without matching And even when the movie direct to the DVD is a bad effort <br /> <br /> In a positive light, this movie has a rather good blood murder scene. But when the surviving characters do not receive serious situations, these scenes will quickly lose their importance due to the violence that they lost in being forgotten. <br /> <br /> Fans Of the traditional 1980s movie B-movie slashers. And fans of classics such as Halloween and Friday the 13th should do everything in their power to avoid it!
