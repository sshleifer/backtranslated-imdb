As a South African, it is an insult to think that someone really paid for this nonsense! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the director is one of the original authors of the original Zisha "Beyond this" with an awesome series! The original series is based on historical facts about men who are strategists, leaders and great warriors. A man who has played a huge role in the history of the indigenous tribes in South Africa. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film. But nothing except the hogwash that is copied from the bottom of the tank by the writer Failing to make an impression since the middle of the tenth century What is here to help slaves drowned with red buoys? <br /> I expect the blonde woman to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen in a red swimsuit. Their small, unreasonable reasons No matter what is more strange than the strange plot, which may be dreamed of after 10 pints at a fancy dress party, where the caveman dress inspired the writer back to the theme Africa for His next "blockbuster".
