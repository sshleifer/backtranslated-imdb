In the heyday of the 90s (The Spirit of God), you can open Comedy Central every hour and watch the biggest comedy show of all time. Saturday Night Live A delightful performance that is not available to players. The original or the second golden age of SNL with great people - Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade .... I received the news from MadTV for the first time when About half a year ago and I think I had to go through the shocking moment. How great is the performance for a long time? There are many terrible flaws. I think I will start with writing. Most of the writing is very bad. It's nothing more than humor in kindergarten bathrooms. Most actors are not capable. There are a few sketches that I like, such as Ms. Swan and Stuart. Some and have a few talents in performances such as the beautiful Alex Borstein. Phil LaMarr is a talented actor, not a comedian. Although there are a few moments But they are not enough to exchange for the infinite scary water that is full of babbling who thinks of this.
