Unfortunately, you can't go below one star before watching The Wicker Man. I considered Aliens 3 as the only movie to receive a negative star. In all fairness, The Wicker Man didn't distract from the previous movie. But the truth is still entertainment. My accumulated movies have fallen by watching it. <br /> <br /> There are cheap tips as well. Often used in Hollywood when manufacturers are too stingy to hire a good writer or hurry too much to allow them to bring the plot to a satisfactory conclusion: slap at the end Shocking and hoping that the public will be misunderstood, meaning it is a trick that is not very successful and in this case only manages to shame the shame of good actors and ridicule with the producers. Moreover "Carefully designed" (or they put it). Conclusions do not seem to be based on reason from the plot. (Which, by nature, I cannot explain the details without introducing spoilers) to that point. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that might attract psychologists, pedophiles and fans of Nicholas Cage at Can be difficult But only a few main viewers If you want something along these lines, I suggest M. Night Shyamalan's Village. Instead of missing some memories, I think I have to see something better to force it out of my heart. I say Killer Tomatoes' attack or Pee-wee's big adventure.
