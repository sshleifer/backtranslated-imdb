This movie is really scary !!!! The performance is slow, slow to the point, and the wooden character should not be on it. The best part is to show Iron Maiden's singing in the movie at the cinema and that is The ending is worth watching and waiting. But that's it !! The characters in this movie made me almost asleep. Avoid it !!!
