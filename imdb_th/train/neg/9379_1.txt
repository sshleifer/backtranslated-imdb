This movie ... I don't know why they used unexplainable characters, such as Pippi Longstocking and Tami Erin, who had a strange charm. Why do they spend money on art and special effects that are not bad at all and do not have to correct them? I will never know. Why sometimes costumes and costumes are due at times and sometimes not strange, why do they act so bad music? Why does the script understand anything ... What are they thinking ?? Nothing about this movie should be. Every section is dubbed (And usually not good) Every sound effect is a little wrong, everything is in the wrong place, everything is bad. It manages to create the right atmosphere despite all problems. But never captured the magic that was the work of Astrid Lindgren
