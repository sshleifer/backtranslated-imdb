The end of violence and a million dollar hotel has hinted at the idea that Wanderer lost his vision, his ability to tell interesting stories through animated maps. The land of abundance sealed the coffin. I was afraid that it would be a visibly innocent and sensitive movie. The characters are flat and fixed. Writing the storyline and direction is the best. For the first time in a period of time, I was impatient that this movie would end so I could continue to live. The madness of the war of the Uncle, the patriotism that stares in the sky at the end ... All this makes me feel that it is simple and pathetic. screen What happened? The days of experimentation, writing, recognition and the possibility of filming interesting behind him for a long time, I am afraid. Hopefully he will discover his inspiration again ... at the Toronto Film Festival, where I saw this film. The vender is there to recommend. He offered us the following things: "I hope ... No, wait ... I know you will enjoy the next two hours." I'm afraid he will be more wrong ...
