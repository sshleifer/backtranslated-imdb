I see every episode of this spin. I think the first season is a good effort considering the expectations of tracking success. That is Grey's Anatomy. So I continue to watch. I am afraid that the second season will not have charm, chemistry and, more importantly, the Gray Anatomy of the previous generation. Writing lacking intelligence and funny suggestions that are seen in GA are shown as formulas. But did not feel that it was formulated and invented Unfortunately, PP is not like that. I like the appearance of Kate Walsh in GA. I am afraid that Kate Walsh's life in LA is not interesting.
