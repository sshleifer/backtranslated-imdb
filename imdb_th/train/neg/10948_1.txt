What do they think of "Cannes" one of the most annoying movies of all time? All the details of this film, whether shown, are meaningless. If I had to watch her wear those shoes again, I thought I would have to shout. If the purpose of this film is to show how Rosetta's life is pathetic, it will be mentioned in the first fifteen minutes of this film. But no, we have to watch countless redundant scenes over and over again The whole thing is full of characters that are not favored and not sympathetic. They deserve the suffering that is Rosetta and think that I passed. "Tumbleweeds" to watch movies beyond this excitement It's like watching grass growth only more exciting.
