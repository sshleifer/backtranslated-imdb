This is a classic example of an increasing problem with movies. Why does the background sound and soundtrack sound louder than the conversation? What makes it feel? This movie is not alone. Most movies seem to do this now for 2 years. I wonder if it's just something wrong with my TV. But then I have a new TV & there again. The background noise that may occur blocks the city behind the actors. The conversation broke down. <br /> <br /> It's more distracting in this movie because in my English version. Hopefully Jean Reno will say, "Sorry, you can say or take the marble out of your mouth." If you watch on the DVD and you have a high school French language, I recommend the French version with the word. /> <br /> I give a 4 because <br very Reno in Leon. People are crazy about the scenery. But I saw it on TV & I lived in the Rocky Mountains for a couple of years, so "added"
