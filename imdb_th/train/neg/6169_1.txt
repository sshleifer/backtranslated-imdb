As a big fan of horror movies, especially J-horror, and I think Nekeddo burâddo sounds quite good. I researched the plot, read the reviews and looked at the photos to make sure that it looked like a scary and scary movie before downloading. Very excited to finish and ready to be scared and revive the horror with the amazing blood that I was expecting. I was very disappointed. The plot is ridiculous and not misleading and does not explain too much. Blood that is hilarious is quite scary and scary and what is the cartoon style sound effect? The show may be the only thing that is mildly scary about it. I do not understand the idea of ​​the cactus and the way the mother's husband disappeared in the sea after the flashing lights. They left both unexplained explanations or maybe I missed because my mind didn't understand what I saw. I appreciate that it should be; Shocking and few scenes (Eating strange flesh and kissing your own mother) Of course, I just think that they go a little far and not in a horrible way. They make it unbelievable. Than horror in my opinion However, it is an entertaining and laughing movie from me and a few friends. But sadly, we expect horror movies to not be funny, so it's worth watching entertainment. But don't expect dark and deep Scary and scary movies You will be disappointed. If this is a horror / tricky comedy, I might score about nine important points as a strange scene when the husband climbs inside his wife's stomach and closes her wounds. But is a sad horror i gave it one
