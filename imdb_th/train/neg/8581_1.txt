The apology for this movie is not about anything! Rachel Griffiths has to spend money. This movie requires a very low budget because there is no light. I followed the oath if I had seen Pete. Postlesumthing or else I will kill myself I am happy to know that there are 1) the plot or 2) the script. My greatest regret is that I waste time watching this garbage.
