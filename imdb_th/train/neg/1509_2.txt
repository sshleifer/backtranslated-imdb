I have trouble scoring this movie. It was a great deal and it was clear that there was a lot of money. Gere and Danes were concentrated. (Although the character of her screen uses a slight increase and determination), editing and movies are great. On the other hand, it is one of the really sick movies that can't help. But wondering if the director himself likes to show a specific scene or not How do they create this movie ....
