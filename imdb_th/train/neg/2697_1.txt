Based on the personal experience of director John Singleton at the University of Southern California A movie that has a racial political center that takes place at a modern college. <br /> <br /> There are three main characters that this film laid the foundation for: Malik Williams, a sportsman without eyebrows. African concerns American man Kristin Conner, a soft white woman who is sheltered and Remy, a white man who is not involved. The trio were overcome by the fact that instant life in college was not as good as advertised when the three were unhappy with their preparation (Malik) without innocence (Christine) and without Demand (Remy)> <br /> One good thing about this film is that it shows that modern American colleges are just a large high school. College is not a place to create a character, develop potential or promote personal progress. But is an institution that is used to gather all types of students in an atmosphere that is suitable for all sizes It is an experience that is often created for failure for most students. It would be nice if the movie was about imitation rather than racial politics. <br /> <br /> But it wasn't, and that's what the movie broke. It seems that Singles have a bad experience in Southern California. In this film, he let everyone go out. No need to hit around the bush. Here, Singleton helps the heroes and villains in this piece to be easily seen. <br /> <br /> The black characters in the movie are seen as heroes here. That the whites in this movie are seen as evil For Christine, who was raped by a white student, <br /> <br /> Who can understand the inconsistency of this movie? The black gang member who came to help the white girl after she pointed to them who raped her The comfort that a black gang member has at the university while having a head skin group met in a small dark room that is planning violence? <br /> <br /> Omar Epp (Malik) and Christy Swanson (Christine) performances are disappointing. They look like the third option for their role. Playing in this movie (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore should play Malik and Kristin, but not available) Shea Jackson, also known as Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes and Regina King are all annoying in their roles. And Lawrence Fishburn, very intuitively as a professor of history, only Michael Rappaport who did well in this film and he thought that his characters in the three main characters changed the most In the movie <br /> <br /> John Singleton wants to manage the competition and inequality in America's college life with this film And he did quite well It's like killing flies with a shotgun. Life is more complex than you think, and people are the same, and they should know this. High learning is evidence that he doesn't understand this at all. Watching movies now and now will cause confusion, disappointment, and anger towards the public that he wants to say too. Not to mention it will not entertain them a little.
