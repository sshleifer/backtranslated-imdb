When I discovered that there were movies with both actresses like Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder, I passed the roof! Jeremy Irons (an actor that I still admire even after this disappointment) The drama is terrible. He treats the family like shit, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I cannot approach or sympathize with any one character and I have no rudeness. But the sex scene is not really necessary. The characters of Wynona and Antonio are likely to be more developed and their love is increasing. Then what is Meryl's character and her "mysterious power"? Why don't they do more? The film has a lot of endings and the most important thing is that this movie has a lot of punches and wasted abilities.
