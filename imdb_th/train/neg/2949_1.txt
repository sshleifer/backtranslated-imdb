Wow ... what would you do with $ 33 million for me to choose? Can you a) tear it off and wash it out of the bathroom? B) Create a movie based on the evidence of Whoopi Goldberg as a police officer of a highly difficult future that is allied with the rubber dinosaur. "I didn't bump into the trumpet" and raspberry blows on the basis that this is a joke. That's right. You will choose the more useful option - wash the bathroom down. <br /> <br /> This must have faith. I can't find the words that explain how bad this movie is. Not suitable for the category "Very bad - good." Actually, I have it on television as I write - and while watching, I feel the need to come to IMD and register my disgust. <Br /> <br /> Consider Jurassic Park a couple of years ago. Do they think that the audience will be able to tolerate the men who dress in the rubber dress again? WG should walk around and curse the consequences. Everyone involved will have to go to hell because of bad money. <br /> <br /> I have to stop writing - I'm going to explode.
