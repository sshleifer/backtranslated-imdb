To me clearly, I used IMDb for many years, but today I have problems registering on the website, so I give the lowest score possible. I've seen hundreds of movies, some of them are terrible. Although I have never seen the difference of excuse and incompetence with high intentions and failures, <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is an awesome actress like a princess. Fiona Shaw is a character that is always entertaining. But the dialogue in this film is worse than in the interesting French drama which is the source (Marivaux never went to Hollywood before and now we should do that)> <br /> To show that Leontine is a great and passionate philosopher and scientist, she shows the secretion of chemicals from beakers to the beaker as crazy and shouts the famous scientist name. And the love between Agis and the princess plays better For this, both worthy of being awarded the 'Clair Danes' award, which in the fair world will be rewarded for anomalies and not receiving a new interpretation of interesting teenagers from literature in the 1990s. <br /> In addition to the plot and brutal dialogue, there are also attempts to introduce art tropes in the filming. For example, there are some moments when a certain audience disappears from the perspective of an action sitting on a chair watching the main character. The director wants us to know that she has adapted the drama. I understand But it didn't happen until in the movie At this point, seeing a lot of people sitting on a chair for a moment and disappearing, it was creepy and annoying. They are like a terrifying zombie horde of zombies appearing through the fog full of fear. When you see the fun and scary music that ends in this movie, you have to wake your crowd into zombies and kill them all because of the injustices that have poisoned your mind for 112 minutes. br /> <br /> -Matthew McGuire
