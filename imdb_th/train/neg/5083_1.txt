I think it is useless to comment on this "movie" for the simplest reason without any comments. It is like a rotten egg that has nothing good to show to the world that excerpts from the fact that Rotten like endless The number of eggs has never been before. But since comments are necessary for ridiculous greatness ... <br /> <br /> Dirtyness is the right word to describe this movie created in the same manner as the "Romanian" movie directed. By Lucian Pintilie to explain what is called "Romanian reality" in the communist era (1990 to the present) <br /> <br /> Under circumstances that are not recommended for people outside Romania for others (who recently found amateur cameras Lack of plot Lack of quality, director / voice actor and others that are trendy and even artistic.): Watch and enjoy this "movie" (as I know you will) but can't do other well-intentioned IMDb members. Write an online review because it will mislead, irritate and eventually waste time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie (in other groups) has some value. But the study for it is an example for: "How not to make a movie"
