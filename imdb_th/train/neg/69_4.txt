I think this is Australia's famous and ridiculous story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom are very good in their roles and make their characters a good personality. But all things feel compelled and mechanically. <br /> <br /> The starting point may be more relevant. May start with a shot and then flash back to conclude that they were there or something like that And I feel that every scene is predictable and there are regular signs such as TV soap that is terrible The only thing I can say in his favor is that it does not make a lot of Mick Jagger models.
