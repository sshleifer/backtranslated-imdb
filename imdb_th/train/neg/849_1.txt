One star, that's all the documentary deserves. I am not disappointed with watching some feature films. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the series "Walking With ..." including Nigel Marvin Spin-offs for Fun, fun and informative And although prehistoric human subjects have never attracted me as much as other prehistoric creatures, the story is still interesting and unique in the survey When I saw all other documents from the series, I thought I had to see this document as well, especially after seeing quite good reviews in other places. <br /> <br /> Good for people who review. Good of this document ... What do you think! lol <br /> <br /> Although the information they can pass is interesting But the presentation failed in every way possible It has a terrible flow and doesn't focus on what it is trying to say. (With information that is scrambled and sometimes goes out of place) scary effects (including CGI and especially Camera effects <br /> <br /> Speaking of makeup effects, one reviewer spoke of a laughing scene when a caveman encountered this giant monkey and it looked like a horror movie in the 70s. There are many times, just as people portray monkey men seem ridiculous and ridiculous. These things were not helped by the location and composition of the terrifying camera. <br /> <br /> The worst part of all is that nothing appears in an interesting or lively way or from a distance. It doesn't seem to be serious. In addition, there is a lack of any emotional punch that has been made in the series, remembering the episode "Walking With Dinosaurs" of the fate of Ornithochirus (sp?) Or not? That time also caused me to tear down every time I watched. This participation is the most lacking. When you get more involved in the subject and it's a personal matter, even a subject that is just speculation, you care more about the facts around. <br /> <br /> The elegance of saving only Is a good description (At least in the BBC version I see) and music. Otherwise, don't bother even renting this one unless you want to laugh happily. (Which I do often This is not in the shelf and the document "walk with ..." <br /> <br /> And it's reasonable to learn that this document is not created or directly related to the same person who did it. Others in the series? Hmmm ...
