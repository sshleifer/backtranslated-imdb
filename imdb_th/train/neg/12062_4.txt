When the combination of the best director / actor was talked about by the team of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson, often not mentioned Probably because the export of nine joint ventures between these two companies carried the music range from excellent action entertainment to moderate levels. Unfortunately, Kinjite: Forbidden subjects fall behind. <br /> <br /> Sadly, Kinjite should be a lot better. But for my life, I do not understand why it is necessary to make the father of the lost Japanese girl. The man who had received cheap jollies because of the love of his marriage was depleted. That might be good for other movies. But it doesn't have a purpose here. <br /> <br /> A straightforward police drama with Charles Bronson as a deputy policeman who sees too much work in his field and has Strong bias towards the East That part may be used to explain a bit as well But he must overcome it if he and his partner, Perry Lopez, are searching for a captured Japanese female student. <br /> <br /> Bronson's time in the secondary team tells him to go. Where to find the kidnappers? Pimp Jaime Fernandez, a stylish and murderer, plays as a person and he and Bronson have some history. In fact, in the best scene of the movie Bronson made him eat expensive rolex watches and put his car on fire. <br /> <br /> At one point, Fernandez happened to the point where Bronson and Lopez In the restaurant throughout the night of his little snacks, he sprayed the place with Uzi, killing everyone, but Bronson and Lopez. I think the little event will have more than two police officers from the LAPD after the Ferrari. Anders But that is one of the most formidable big holes at the end. <br /> <br /> There is still rough justice at the end of Fernandez. I hope the whole film will improve. This is the team's final film. Bronson-Thompson And the last film of J. Lee Thompson as director He should go out with something better.
