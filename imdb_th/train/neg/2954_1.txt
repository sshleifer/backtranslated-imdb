I watch many bad movies !!!!!! It's a real hobby. Almost every Saturday there will be a group of friends and I gather together and see garbage from around the world - anything, Turkish superhero movies, vampires from Brazil, Italian gorilla transplant movies, movies Kevin Costner, anything (except Raising Helen) Ihave never seen the worst movie of THEODORE REX. Never and it wasn't so badly fun in Edwood's way - it's just a story. Now, this movie is famous in Hollywood at the time of doing because Whoopi took off the gloves and made it clear to the media and everyone who listened to that she hated this piece of CRAP = She tried to leave the contract. Her she She groaned But even then, they poured her fat butt into the police costume of a tight future that looks scary, yes !!!! And you can see what she saw while doing - do everything except looking for her agent so that she can scream at him Dinosaurs have about three facial expressions and the script is very scary. The third level can work better if the promised cookies.
