This movie looks as fun as staring at the sun. Sheriff Pataki is a person who doesn't like anything more than sitting on a fat back, making a ring of smoke from inflatable cigars and drinking liquors while doctors act like zombies. Everything is called "Blood" which, in fact, looks like Fruit Punch. <br /> <br /> Most planning seems to be very scary to call this movie shit. In this movie, it's a waste of time. The horrible ending. The outline looks scary and the scene is terrible. Is there anything else I should say to your audience there? My advice is to let your Rabies shoot. If you have already watched the movie This film may give a bubble in your mouth if you don't get a modern image.
