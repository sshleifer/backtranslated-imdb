For the first time in years, I felt the need to sign in to IMDb today to purify the film by writing reviews because it was just a release. The plot sounds fantastic when I read it. I expect to have the least mysterious thriller. Unfortunately, everything was badly tainted by tedious world stories and many thoughtful things and tricky teeth. "No one says that this kind of thing, except in a bad movie" Just suffer. <br /> <br /> This is the worst offense of this movie: <br /> <br /> - Script Requires a lot of coincidence and mysterious and mysterious folly of the demon The main character that is laughable. In fact, it's anger and laziness. <br /> <br /> - Involved in that: cheap excitement, a "timely" parade. <br /> <br /> - The main character. Okay, it seems that the screenwriter has never had real experiences with humans in real life. But getting all the knowledge from a bad movie So his character is boring and lacking in the second generation. They are just a plot device that does not have a slight personality. They are "the woman in the breakup that still loves each other". Never seen before, except in the 100,000 movies and it is not realistic or very entertaining. up Think of the impressive two-dimensional Hollywood fare and you have already received it. There is no one character in this film that is fresh, charming or interesting from a distance. <br /> <br /> - The subtle and subtle resolution that is very bad and only needs to be broken down. Falling one word "Resolution" may not be appropriate because this film has a lot of disorientation which doesn't happen anywhere. It's time for you to pass your attention no longer. The third movie that I sent the fastest because it couldn't bear to watch. <br /> <br /> Okay, no matter what the recovery feature of this movie is, everything will be buried beneath. Incompetence Do not see this chaos.
