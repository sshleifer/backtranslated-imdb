No plot, crappy and pointless acting .... <br /> <br /> This should be a horror movie, right? There is no fear or fear, just BOOM BANG GORE, then made some marines in the desert for some strange reason, and they were hunted by mutated animals from the first movie, which is good and <br /> <br /> It's another excuse for money and pointless violence, just like the sequel of "Saw". They know that the plot doesn't have a dog spot. Any further reinforced the more people will see it. I miss the suspicious horror movie that came to Hollywood. You can do a lot better.
