This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree with other reviewers who say that special effects are available. I find that they are terrible: it's not true and they are so fake that it distracts from the truth Archaeologists are looking for "sets". They do not care to tell what is defined or something special about it. That also makes it unclear why they searched in California while the movie's introduction took place in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert Going to the desert really. The beginning - the ancient ceremony - it looks like it was shot into the studio instead of the desert. <br /> <br /> The action level is constant throughout the movie. It makes the movie look short and professional for this particular movie.
