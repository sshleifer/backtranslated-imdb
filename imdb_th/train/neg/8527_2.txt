There are three films that have a style of animation that I remember very cute from children. The movie "The Last Unicorn" "Flight of Dragons" and "The Hobbit" I own a copy of "Dragon" and The Hobbit "(both excellent) and I have never seen" The Last Unicorn "for over a decade. That is to this day and now I hope that there will be no The thing that bothered me the most is the script. It's incredibly absurd and often ridiculous. Things will happen without reason and other things will happen without explanation. We don't talk about small things here as well. We are talking about planning issues. Important! The story begins with itself. But it works well if the script is good Not close. Moreover, the music is awesome! I know that music in movies like this rarely has anything to be called a classic piece. But the music in this movie made me want to make myself lose my bowling ball. This is one of the movies that I will show to my children. But it was cut off I do not think I will be able to sit that festive shit again. Disappointing is mildly laid out.
