I will show this movie under the horror movie genre. I do this because I do not recognize the genre that is called scary. Since the horror genre came close to horrible, I decided to put it in this category. The show was not professional. You know who the villain will be in the first scene. The ugly heroine like in the movie Students of filmmaking should bring this movie as an example for lessons that should not be done in a movie. It's so bad The bad word man is to say the least. The gangsters kidnapped the fleet and wanted 10 million dollars. They needed money to deliver in the Rose Island that lived in the middle of the Pacific. They will sit in a duck after receiving money. No escape plan is a stupid way. Female cruise director is a former Navy kung fu police officer. I'm afraid. The hilarious part is the solution to the time bomb problem. He said he knew what he was doing and he pulled all the wires one at a time. Then he put it in his pocket and referenced from the movie that had all the connections that he was crazy? While we are crazy about watching this RIDICULOUS, if you have a M-i-L that you don't like to bother you, rent this movie and pretend you enjoy it. I assure you that she will certainly tell your spouse that you have a bad taste and that your son / daughter is married to someone who is below your family's standards.
