You don't just hate it when you order a steak. But the restaurant for your chicken <br /> <br /> That's what I feel is watching this thing called "Battlestar Galactica". The argument can do more than quality. But the truth remains, not what the fans ordered. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you sat down at the restaurant I was talking about. You have been waiting for many years to bring back the famous New York steaks you love. When your meal arrives, you will find that they have used the name "New York Strip" with a chicken dish. You complain, but the waiter just said "but cheeken ze, very good ees zir"! Are you really interested if the chicken is good, you want the New York-steak bar! The waiter explained, "You zee zir, ze chef want to do as you zay, zomezing new. We feel that cheeken ze will be more popular. Zo we give our name deesh delicious earlier" you ask if you Will you find the original New York strip in the future? But was informed that because the restaurant has a dish called "New York" Now on the menu, you will not see the original New York strip - again. <br /> <br /> This is the creation of a new thing and hit the name "Battlestar Galactica" on it. <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> * This mini series despises all fans of the original program! * <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the production team is responsible for this new version. The team responsible for BG Resurrection should love the original series. - Search to improve what fans love. Don't try to sell the new series by using the name Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> If SciFi Channel wants to make the show New, then do that! Set a new name! Don't use names that we remember with love in trying to lure audiences. That gives us no chance to see the appearance of the manuscript in the future. <br /> <br /> We wait 25 years to see what we know as BG because we like something about the original! We don't just want NAME and the rest of the basic concept. There are some things that we like about the original series! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the best element of the original is something that has been cut. Of course, the original BG is incomplete and can be used to update. However, this mini-series does not have any improvement in the story, but is a special effect (which is good, but not strange, according to today's standards). <br /> <br /> Many viewers will Debate about the quality of this new program, but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dreams. <br /> <br /> Being said ... I'll comment on the advantages of This new self (Not comparing to the original): <br /> <br /> The fight sequence is the best. Obviously, there is an attempt to make the effect look more "real" and "Wow - look at the effect" less. I won't say that these sequences are Special according to today's standards But they still keep the original movie produced for cable What is the agreement with This "pseudo-live-cam"? Some views try to mimic the effects of "real" cameras by tracking backward and zooming. However, it is widely used because there is no clear source of these cameras. The smarter series like Babylon 5 is the only example I've seen. "Live camera" that is used effectively when we see actions from Security Cams. <br /> <br /> Script, you ask? The script feels like being written by a teenager for other teenagers. The characters feel that they are cardboard and stereotypical. In fact, the whole story is mixed together from other well known maps. The only good feature of the whole story is a few elements that are preserved from the original series. Obviously "stupid" for digesting your average TV audience. <br /> <br /> Human interaction is poor. Instead of a delicate drama, good expression and timing, every moment of human tension is exaggerated to the point that they clearly lose the ability to move all moderated audiences. This is evident in the interaction between Adama and his son. The director must try to make sure that the most dense and worrying audience will not miss it, even if not interested. Sorry, but the real man does not work like it constantly. <br /> <br /> Do not think that this BAD program is in itself. Nothing good. It will never be respected by SciFi fans or real craftsmen. But it will be something that people can watch Although personally I can live without it. I watched it only to see how it actually captured the souls of the original. <br /> <br /> The way in which this mini-series is always remembered is a symbol of quality in the storytelling that has been left. Outside to attract more numbers, even SciFi Channel still has "spatter" to produce to meet the crowd compared to the real niche market. Science fiction fans It will be when we ask for a steak and they insist on giving us the chicken even if there is a complaint. <br /> <br /> I leave you with one thought - <br /> <br /> No "MOORE "<br /> <br />
