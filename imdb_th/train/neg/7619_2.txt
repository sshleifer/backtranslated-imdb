As a fan of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, I can resist any animation that can happen to me. But there is no reason for this (HA!) Robert Napton can use to receive at least 4.50 from one unsuspecting person. <br /> <br /> Humiliated by Robert Napton! Make you shy for taking advantage of these poor Mexican actors, which you might promise to make it big in American movies. You are a shameful person! <br /> <br /> In this movie, there is no time for a little movement. Do you use snot with these people? Oh, they're crazy in the fields! Like all 6 people and that's not the Asian people behind Why is it always daytime? Why does it take 1/2 of the movie to perform? .. And more importantly, why do we watch 1/2? <br /> <br /> PS: You owe me 4.50
