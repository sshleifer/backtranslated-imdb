After reading other reviews, I thought that this movie would be really good. I enjoyed the movie "B" but this was not possible. Shooting is probably only half the good thing in the movie. But the correction is still not needed. It is lacking and spinach. Anyone who chooses music and sound can do a very bad job. The song is very bad, especially the setting of the atmosphere or the scene. If the performance is better, they can pull the movie out. Unfortunately I saw better performances in porn. If you want to watch the vampire movie "B", watch 'Blood Ties'. You will get more entertainment.
