Ok, now I'm watching TRASH, what kind? "The Witches' Mountain" must be one of Spain's discrete exploitation while also interesting. There is nothing suitable here and I still wonder if I had a script to work with. In any way, I can't close it. Scratching your head with confusion begins immediately with an opening sequence about an angry little girl who kills her mother's cat. So, do you think that this movie revolves around children who have been taken over by evil forces? Heck no, because after this call, the girl and her evil didn't speak anymore. Then cut the man with the most impressive trimmed mustache that you've ever seen, who broke up with his girlfriend in a rather uncertain way When she asks him to spend his vacation with him, he will call the employer immediately to request any type of work! Excellent movement Eventually this film began as he traveled to a lonely mountain area to take pictures of the peaks. Even though it wasn't before he accepted the new girl (Patty Shepard) and took her bare breasts! Throughout the journey, strange events, everything happened like that ?? Did you guess? Never describe a girl waking up in the middle of the forest, scary music, loud, playing anywhere and someone stealing a jeep! The car witch really pushed? Obviously, the silent witch is the owner of the mountain and they practice voodoo about the intruder. It's as close as I described the plot. But there is a good chance that I will go out ?? More important is the atmosphere! "The Witches' Mountain" is sometimes very creepy, with awesome music and interesting movies. All supporting characters look mysterious and Patty Shepard, who plays as a good heroine This is a European horror movie that seems to be a myth if someone who cares to write a structured screenplay.
