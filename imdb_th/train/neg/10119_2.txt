The animation in the imagination of Peter & the Wolf is excellent, but when 29 minutes, this movie is causing sleep. They should call it "Peter and the Clam" because everything moves according to the snail's rhythm I can't even watch a movie in one sitting - I have to watch it 15 minutes at a time and it's a pure torture. <br /> <br /> Save yourself 30 minutes. - Don't watch this movie - and you'll thank me. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the Oscars nominated committee will only look at the first few minutes of the nomination. Unfortunately, voting for the winner in the Best Animated Short (short!) Category, the voter must pass all the judgments. I feel sorry for them - and have to predict that there is no way this movie will come close to victory.
