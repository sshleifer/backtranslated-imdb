Holy shit This is the worst movie I've ever seen. All performances are good. But there is no real plan! No plot! The clown group talks about this and that is your movie. Um ... Robert Duvall's character is old and still asking the same question over and over again. This makes him get the same response. Then again I'm pretty sure that this movie has screened more than six stories because people think they should like it. Good performances with famous and highly regarded actors But really perfect work is a hot idea Maybe a bit deceitful, because the water vapor rising from the fresh pile sounds like what happened and in this movie nothing happens!
