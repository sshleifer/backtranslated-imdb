I will spend a lot of time on this check, just like the author did with the script. This is the worst sequel ever made. <br /> <br /> They kill Navin Johnson. Not only is GOD-AWFUL's performance of Mark Blankfield, so everyone is there !! Physical comedy is forced to be flat and predictable. It seems that the script was written by the Mongolian monkey, using the pen name Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. The way that the producers tried to squeeze out the nasty things from the movie They can also make veteran actors Ray Walston look like a clown without talent. Director Michael Schultz is ashamed. <br /> <br /> I want 96 minutes of my life. I use it. When watching memories reminiscent of this great comedy, so I can try and judge everyone involved.
