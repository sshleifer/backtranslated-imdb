Demi Moore's character in this movie was chosen as a seal because of her appearance. That was a bad start and the movie started from there. The story is unbelievable. The intention to make it in a strong military unit is not enough. This film does not convince me of the physical abilities of women of all types of work. <br /> <br /> Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same The difference between sex is what makes life interesting.
