"American Nightmare" is officially tied in my opinion with "It's Pat!" For the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Seven friends (similar to K-Mart's actors "Friends ") Gathered in a coffee shop to listen to American Nightmare, a pirate radio program It is hosted by men with beards. That is the most exciting aspect of his performance. <br /> <br /> Chandler, Monica, Joey and ... Oh, I mean, Wayne, Jessie and the gang. Other bad lines Change their biggest fear for a DJ with a mustache. <br /> <br /> The crazy nurse doctor is listening ... <br /> <br /> Crazy Nurse is torturing Ross. And Rachel and ... wait for apologies again ... by making their fears come to life. These fears include stunts such as "Voodoo" and the dentures by an old woman with teeth <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is rotten. Fun in the killing of Crazy Nurse. No inspiration. Nothing will make the audience "jump." The ending is broken and - again - Voodoo. <br /> <br /> If you don't care about your loved ones for rent. "American Nightmare" with them. <br /> <br /> If you care about your loved ones - even a little - go to the Blockbuster in your area. Rent a copy of "American Nightmare" all and hide it in the freezer.
