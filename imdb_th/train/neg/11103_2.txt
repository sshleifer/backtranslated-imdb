OK, so I just saw the movie, even though it appeared last year ... I think it's a good movie in general, except the story is stupid and scary ... First of all, we never know anything. About life, why do they appear, they are doing in our world, and really, they used to be on earth before we come, or are they just coming from space? Secondly, the role of the butcher in preserving peace is clearly created ... In fact, the underground for sub-stations is how big? There are so many creatures, so I think instead of killing innocent people, they can plant tactical bombs, or maybe it's clear that Nuke can do this job. I know it sounds funny and it is But I do not see that killing people is necessary ... Third, Leon behaves like Superman, jumping on a train and fighting with Vinnie Jones, which is higher and bigger. Then again, when he faced the conductor, he did nothing and acted as a boring person, looking at all the nasty things. I mean, ok, the controller has an eerie help (lol), but if Leon is brave he will have to go all the way ... I mean, he risked his life first, so he didn't do anything when he should. have He may die as a hero. But life is like a coward ... this may be the case But not after showing much courage before ... Police then ... come! This is a city that has a subway station. I think there must be other police except that woman. Other police stations are really stupid ... Overall, the great performances of Vinnie Jones. Interested in reason It's not really created ... by what means the signal on the chest? Vinnie Jones can't compensate ...
