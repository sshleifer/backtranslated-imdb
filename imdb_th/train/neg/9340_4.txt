<br /> <br /> This is one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Usually Roger Ebert won't let me down But I felt cheated after seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> The only excitement is to see Elizabeth's bank in her underwear. That is an apology statement about this movie. It promises a lot. <br /> <br /> This is a ragged rag. <br /> <br /> I can't show deep enough bitterness to watch a movie And hope that I will remind you of disappointment as well
