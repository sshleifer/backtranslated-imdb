This boy is a horror movie! While I didn't see all the work of Burton / Taylor, I can say with confidence that this is the worst thing. The wealthy but sick woman (Taylor) is the owner of this beautiful island in Mediterrania. The officer wears a pullover when she visits by this travel poet. In fact, the whole film is just a festival, talking with talk, mostly unreasonable. Even in 1968, no one could make the head or tails of nonsense that was pretense and time passed to make it more clear. If it is not for movies and beautiful scenery The only thing that the film did well was the unintentional laugh and the cost of the stars.
