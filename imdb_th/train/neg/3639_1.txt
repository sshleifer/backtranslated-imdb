This movie sucks from beginning to end (especially). At the end, you may not get worse. The show's story, photography, camera work, etc. It's terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> But that Is what makes it look good Will make you laugh better than enough The worse the better! <br /> <br /> I don't really know how these people think about creating this movie. Are the Viking movies serious? The story is very ridiculous. It is like a comedy that disguises the mafia like a mafia. No point, but funny. <br /> <br /> Watch the ending of this movie ...
