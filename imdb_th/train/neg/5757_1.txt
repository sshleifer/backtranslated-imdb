This movie can be watched while Nicolson is on the screen. However, I have to fight with the passing of boredom when this movie is based on Meryl Streep, who will perform the scene without Jack She is as gentle as it should be. The relationship between the characters is nothing special. These characters have been transmitted before - and much better. It feels like a situation based on real life in the worst sense: 90% of everyday life is boring and not worth writing or watching. What Ephron felt about her life and relationship with Carl Bernstein was so interesting enough to write about my escape? Maybe she wrote it as a therapy - for many writers, putting one episode in their lives on paper is about ventilation. That's fine. But why, why do everyone in Hollywood feel so? That this story is worth filming is also a mystery for me
