"Unhinged" is a bizarre little movie which is a forgotten movie from the golden age of the genre. It's hard to write a satisfying review of this movie because of the fact that this movie has a novelty. It has a lot of plot - three young women are traveling to see rock concerts, collide with cars and end up at the mansion of an unusual old woman and her daughter. At a glance, women realized what was wrong when they heard strange sounds and voices from the attic. Moreover, the mother and daughter seem to have a very strange and strange relationship, because they have a hard fight in front of their neighbors when eating dinner. The old mother still went as far as calling her daughter as a prostitute and selling herself and accusing her of pretending to be people at night to sleep with them. Halfway through the movie, when a woman finally decided she should leave for help, the killing began. <br /> <br /> This movie is on the bottom of the tank. No one in the three girls who are stranded can show, especially the "lead" girls. It's almost unbelievable to hear that they deliver their lines in the same color tone throughout the story. Mother and daughter are better, but not so much. This film is quite boring in some parts and is very true. The killing seems scary. But there is nothing we have never seen before However, as mentioned here, this film scores from interference and ending the great ending. It came entirely from the left field and had the same shock value as the ending of the classic "Sleepaway Camp". Unfortunately, the rest of the film is boring and suffers from horrifying and frightening performances. Bored The lonely and creepy mansion and the dark light make the movie look like a grainy, but it quickly collapses when one character tries to show. It might be worth it if you can put it out until the end. But I said that you better just forward quickly to the last 10 minutes 4 out of 10
