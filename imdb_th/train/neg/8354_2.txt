Every movie that Brooke Shields serves Fonda will be both unusual and horror. Actually, the shield is not good because she is still young and inexperienced. Peter Fonda is not good because he is bad. I like him in Ulee's gold many years later, but the Lord above him is terrible here. Not that others are good No single show (Outside of Henry Fonda's delightful pendant) that can be passed I have never seen a movie that has many bad performances. In the case of Luke Asu, the leader of the villain, it is clear that because of the conversation and the direction that is bad because he has worked well in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is an embarrassing ham. Writing is a very scary story, and actors can't make mistakes in the horrible things they say. But they say it's terrible! Corrections and directions are worse than pedestrians. The image was taken for too long without a remarkable reason or was cut before being aware of the impact of the scene. This image is worse than I imagined and will be completely forgotten. (And probably never did) without participation of two famous names A bright spot. One point: filming movies in the Grand Canyon is great. Capturing the beauty of that area in the way that even the production of the big screen Imax is still not good. Paper Moon, a bad version with a cute father-daughter type or a pretty baby model that has a romantic relationship between forty years and 13 years old. It shows more than in the past and makes Quite annoying
