This is a baffling movie. <br /> <br /> The beauty in sex between a man and a woman is shown by a group of men and women that can be described as an odd ball and a wrong set. <br /> <br / > Greenaway accepted his inspiration in Fellini's movie "8 1/2", but while Fellini was a giant of the world film But Greenaway can't. <br /> <br /> He doesn't have the sense of touch and the ability to convey feelings and emotions. With the agility of clarity, <br /> <br /> He pretended that the movie was divided into chapters with written introductions for each person, as if the audience had to be guided in the movie except that the alert was In writing will remain The screen for a few seconds is not long enough for readers to get the results that they are often overlooked. <br /> <br /> For only two women that can be described as a Palmira watcher who plays enough. Lilly Walker and Giaconda played by Natacha Amal. Both women and men retreated from the light of reality to the darkness of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Greenaway wants to point out that sexual fantasies do not lead to happiness. Women themselves are falling because they provide services in exchange for money. The relationship between men and women will be diminished in commercial transactions. <br /> <br /> There is no feeling of happiness or happiness or love in movies. Of course, there are many scenes that are not satisfactory. Much: <br /> <br /> Suggestions of a conspiracy relationship between father and son, Philip and Emmental, played respectively by John Yuen and Matthew Delamere. The two that Giaconda is carrying Day actually pregnant with her first double fetus is terminated, and the second time she was sent to a destination chosen by men from the flight. Both men have sex with women without legs. (Half of the women are in the name) The beast that is between Beryl, played by Amanda Plummer and the pig named Horace. Father and son share women between them. Women enjoy sexual assault. Dad slept with the dead wife. <br /> <br /> Obviously, there were no scenes for sex. But only hint. <br /> <br /> The decline of women is like that. It is not surprising that the movie will be booed when it was first released in Cannes. There is something more special: the female actors in the film line up to protect it, showing that there is no limit to the innocence of women and women to deceive themselves that men are being exploited. <br /> <br /> Greenaway's directing is a hypocrisy. It's a style victory over the content of Film as Art, along with abandonment of common sense. <br /> <br /> Greenaway tries to achieve the surrealism of surrealism. The banality of human relations
