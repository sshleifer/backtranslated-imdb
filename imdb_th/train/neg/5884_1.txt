I'm an avid movie fan. I like all kinds of movies. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I understand that it follows the book closely which makes the point that everything should not be made into a movie. Especially when the authenticity of the experience in this book is called into question more than once. <br /> <br /> These characters are not strange. They are mentally ill. What happens is not a joke. They are being disturbed. Especially considering that they should be true I want to wash my brain after watching
