Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) was changed from a doctor (John Carradine - drunk at drunkenness) and came out as Myra (Raquel Welch). Then she decided to destroy the masculinity. (Or something like that) and conducting film history teaching at the acting college conducted by the disgusting John Huston (without asking) and breaking up the happy couples (Handsome handsome man Roger Herren and Farrah Fawcett - yes, THE Farrah Fawcett) <br /> <br /> They brought a wonderful novel from Gore Vidal that was not able to use and tried to really shoot. They also hire British people who have a strong anti-American attitude and hire many actors with "talent" (Welch, Reed), suspicious and embarrassing old experts (Huston Carradine Andy Devine, Jim Bagus, Mother West) all together and .... Surprise !!! The exact calamity <br /> <br /> The film was rated X while the film was rated X (dropped to R), mostly because of the genuinely tacky scene that Welch filmed the Rusty (Roger Herren) scene and the scene in which Welch tried to have sex with Fawcett. <br /> <br /> This movie is very scary ... The scene jumps across the place and people talk and Doing things that aren't sensible, it's not good at all. I'm never bored at /> <br /> The show Difference <br go horribly scary ... really sad ... I Huston chew scenery again and again and again nastily. Welch is not as bad as Myra, but her lines are meaningless, so you never know what to do with her. West is hardly in this movie. (As a blessing) and it is tiring to hear a woman who is about 80 years old. Comedian Roger Herren (no matter what happens ...) is still very handsome and not as bad as Rusty Fawcett does not matter. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find something to say about this ... You just watch it in disbelief. Must watch the movie. - Believe it !!!!
