This movie has been played a lot recently during the day on HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they assume that people are interested in comparing with Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks at the same name. The only reason to see it for the attractive Matt Lattanzi Yum! Although I have to say that Matt is a long time than a tooth for playing as a high school student. If he is a woman, they will let him play as the mother of a high schooler! (Is it just me or his daughter that starts to look like Shelley Duvall?) Yes. Plot - Who cares? General teen highjinx played by adults
