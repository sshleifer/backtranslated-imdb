Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) kills his children and his wife has been betrayed in a house attack Then Archer found himself facing a man. (Tilch Wieger) was tied and closed the chair. He said that this was someone who killed his child and attacked his wife and he was able to do what he liked with him. And there are many tools to help him ... <br /> <br /> Movies are interesting at first. (And shows the real restraint in terms of blood and blood) but has been confused in this minute Plan to twist and change Everything ended with the last twist that was old and stupid until I was shocked that everyone thought it would be used anymore. Talented actors like Ellard Schweitzer and Plummer participate in this kind of shit. It's beyond me. This thing has received three stars for the show. But the plot is stupid and incredibly twisted, truly making this work boring
