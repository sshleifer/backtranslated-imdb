This is really terrible. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature about this movie is the next time people ask me what the worst vampire movie I've ever watched. That's right. <br /> <br /> I think it's taken at 35mm, so it's nothing like hell. I will not pay attention to the comments. But I noticed that there was a boy fan (May be connected to the movie) has claimed that this is the best movie since The Matrix Let me refute the myths and lies. <br /> <br /> Nothing good in the movie. Everything shouted, tacky. An ugly actress The fight dance was the worst I've ever seen. The fighting scene has incredible skill. Imagine a girl hugging her arms in a circle in vain and making a soft kick that will not hurt the kitten. Clearly, the director has just pulled people out of the street so that they have a role in the movie. <br /> <br /> I know that the director doesn't have much budget for this movie Can't forgive
