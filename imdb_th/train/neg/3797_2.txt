For many years since Alex Rain (Played by Olivier Gunner in the first film) stumbling upon a plot of horror related to the replacement of humans with machines. However, since then, the war between Cyborg and humans has emerged. The daughter of Olivier Gruner's character (she also inherited only half of his acting ability), which I think is the least connected movie at first. However, when the best actor is created, she hides. In the 1980s, while the bounty hunter from the future clunker this confusing sci-fi. Nemesis becomes a hit song that I can see why people like it, even though I'm not a movie fan. Nemesis tries ambitiously to come up with different ideas, develop a beautiful appearance, and give many actions. It almost works. Nemesis 2 doesn't have that dream. But it was cut from The Terminator, along with a muscular woman with a low acting ability. She made Olivier Gruner look like a master, and the sequence of operations lacked a major explosion. Original selling point I will admit that I am not a fan of the original. But it deserves a better track The manuscript also has good performers such as Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and yes, Jackie Earle Haley. This person has no one, and this time it's a boring movie with a pretentious aura In fact, after I saw this, it was an inspiration to add half stars to the original. <br /> <br /> * From 4 (not good)
