This is the worst movie of the Home Alone movie I've ever seen! See episode 1 and two, but don't let anyone say it's better than the first two! I mean, actually you didn't create a movie, then create a sequel with characters and actors too. I mean, it's okay if this is not a "Home Alone" movie, but they didn't make it home. This movie makes me sick! Buy Episode 1 and 2
