I usually don't write reviews. But I can't understand why it has been rated very high and want to warn those who love horror because I can assume that all those high scores are received by general TV viewers. <br /> <br >> I only watched the first two episodes. But both of them were very lamenting. It's not funny anymore. The same old story that you've seen / read a few times - Toys have a life of evil from another dimension ... and not just those stories. This is not an innovation, they are also quite bad models. I want to like "chucky" and "Silent Hill" above both episodes every time. And don't ask about visual effects ... the ones that were at first were okay But the second person at that time ... scary. It seems that some student film projects go wrong. Blood ... or blood ... uh ... nothing to say. <br /> <br /> It might. It will be interesting for a ten year old child who may not have seen / read many scary stories. I would recommend "Beyond belief" - Now that's what I call the right mystery TV program.) But for adult horror fans, this is worthless. I only give 3 points because in reality, there are some beautiful movies. (Especially in the second episode) and good performances
