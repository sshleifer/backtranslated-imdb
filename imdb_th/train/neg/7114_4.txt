As far as film filming is quite good for the mid-50s, there are a few times that the light is too hot. But the image is generally in the frame and in focus The performance is higher than the average for a low budget. But the direction is terrible Many scenes were dragged out for too long in anxious attempt and that effect didn't exist. The attack by the skull in the pool should be completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull is evident with the poke and rope. I couldn't help thinking. But the budget does not allow them to build houses, so they make references to those who move and store everything in the store should come soon. It's not good enough to be a "good-bad" movie, but it's not good enough to be "good" as well. Get the MST3K version ... It's more fun.
