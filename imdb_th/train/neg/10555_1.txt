First of all: I like Splattermovies. Good and not afraid to experience the art But without a budget flick, it's not like that! The image quality is very low, the most annoying soundtrack I have ever heard (!!!!) and for FX ... the quality is very low, causing some people to look bad as they should. In the real movie (The thing that the garbage is not here) is not a concept, a story with some wafer, original performances and rare conversations - I think I count about 10 sentences in all movies. lots of (May be an indication for What does this kind of audience do !!!) Story It seems that a boy must watch his father be raped and kill his mother's psychological damage and while the adult goes on a tour. Until now, very good ... but for the director of the art director, this plot is just a line to create a cheap shot that produces a row without any text or any reason. Naked women bound in a clay hole ... Why and why is the only time you see both women and men in the movie "Blood") ??? disturb? Yes!! get sick? Yes!! necessary? No! art? NO !!!!! Everyone mistakenly believe that cheap art shows should go to see his psychiatrist as soon as possible, or see Pink Floyd's "wall" to see how similar topics can work in an artistic way ... The latest movie (!!!!!!!!) Andrew Cobb movie ... !!!! And all you head out there, remember: not everything that looks cheap and obviously doesn't have the feeling of being an "art" automatically ...
