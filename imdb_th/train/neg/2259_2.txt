For my life, I can't understand why they want to make a movie about "Jerry Springer Show". It's incredibly worthless. Some ways, sadly, it is a miserable pleasure. We must all agree that we have seen at least once. It is part of our pop culture. I saw this in the United States recently. It's quite bad. I will admit that Jerry works awesome in what I think he means to perform. Or something like that, Jamie Pressley is in there. She plays herself in general. What she wants is Kid Rock, her lover. It would be perfect. So I suggest skipping "Ringmaster" just by watching "Jerry Springer Show". More fun. <br /> <br /> 2/10
