You have to deliver to Steven Seagal: His other mistakes may be what he tastes good in women. If you choose a Siegel movie, chances are there will be at least one beautiful woman. And usually they do not act as just eye candy; They participate in the action and fight, shoot the gun, kill with a knife, etc. "Flight of Fury" offers Ciera Payton's partner (who has a very sexy face. Find time for them to participate in both the violent and lesbian caresses! And if it seems like I spend too much time talking about them, that's because the rest of the movie, even though it has passed, it's not exciting. The weakest side seems to be Seagal, which seems like he doesn't care to pretend to be interested. This is a military type fighter, with very little fighting and he doesn't suit his role. (Invisible fighter pilot Of course "the best in the world") which may well describe Aggressive sleepwalking (* 2/1)
