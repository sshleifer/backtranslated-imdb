Oh! I have heard various reviews about this subject ... but one of my hardcore horror critics found it frustrating. He's a man on the nose! This film is run by pure amateurs. They have to do only once, maybe two in each movie scene. It seems like hurry. The script is also bad .... They have a line that tries to be unique but fails miserably. "Take your meathooks away from me!" Oh man. It happens all the time with comedies ... but with horror movies and with actors below average .... unbelievably poor results Lines and situations are all predictable. But the thing that made me feel negative about this film is that the acting is offensive again. It's scary. There are also a few Asian people working in the booth. I think he's great. <br /> <br /> This movie is a stupid story about 5 t tourists who go on a vacation in Asia. They ended up in the wrong place and fell into the hands of a mafia who had sex / slaughterhouse. Sounds like a cool matter. But watching people with diarrhea can be more fun and intense. The only reason for this horror is because of killing. No signs of doubt. <br /> <br /> I like other horror fans who are dying to get a little blood from this story. Unfortunately, there is a huge U capital. This movie is very disappointing. I enjoy resting my ankle and blood. The lazy chicks are like that. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie screams amateur. This is the first feature length of Ryan Nicholson and most of them fail. There is no denying that he has a horrible sense of humor and tastes for patients. I pray that his next movie doesn't play like a horror movie, another story, unless he tells us what it is. Even after this disappointment, I was happy to let Ryan shoot again. From what I saw him, he was dedicated and serious about the genre. Good luck next time because this is bad news.
