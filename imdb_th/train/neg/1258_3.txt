Warning: many spoilers! <br /> <br /> Tim Burton created this comedy movie as much as creating Psycho - Oh, yes. Some idiot people do that. - I break the case. <br /> <br /> The film opens with chimpanzees that damage the simulation, proving that he is not a clever person. From the beginning, Marky Mark appeared in the picture without the appearance of the pants that had been rejected by ordinary women who like to touch. Chimpanzee <br /> <br /> The image of the formidable creation of the space station that orbits Saturn without clear reasons. Of ships that are busy with genetic experiments on monkeys Do we have to travel 1,300 million kilometers to Saturn to do these experiments? The special technical team announced the use of chimpanzees. <br /> <br /> Marky's chimpanzees lost their way in the 60s era of sci-fi movies - The Time Warp. Stealing the pods unnoticed at the same time showing his pitiful stupidity in installing a space rescue mission deep into the wormhole to taste the chimpanzees. Limited fuel and oxygen supplies. <br /> <br /> Before anyone can say that `Pointless Remake 'Marky entered the wormhole, colliding with an extraterrestrial planet, taking his hat off, regardless of the badness of the atmosphere and Being chased through a sound stage that is almost like a lush rainforest if it's not because of the backdrop of a plastic tree. <br /> <br /> Surprise! It's chasing APES - or at least * surprisingly if no one sees Planet of The Apes thirty-three years ago. <br /> <br /> Since Marky Mark didn't show his pecs Taking his pants or his white breasts, he doesn't have a habit Michael Clarke Duncan's gorilla teeth that have been crooked, greatly helped create * the lack of his * character Helena Bonham-Carter (an irritated chimpanzeer) who lost without the script Papyrus performed well in defeating both Marky and Clarke. As a cardboard cutout, most of the slave trader Orangutan Paul Giamatti was given the role of relief in comics and coins. Although I have problems hearing about this movie But one review headline recorded the essence of Planet of The Apes, which rethinked: 'The Apes Of Roth' while others looked at something special from one million BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth as Chimpanzee Thade, chewing a lot of scenery and throwing plenty of kaka His character lacks curves. Behavior: Thade is crazy when we first meet him ... and he is quite mad at the same level as the ending of the good-natured movie. <br /> <br /> Original POTA (1968) Taylor presented the character to Charlton Heston, who was not interested in humanity as he left the world for free without regret - but when the film progressed, Taylor was unaware of it. Find yourself trapped in a fight to prove the value of humanity - as the only champion! The original movie finally was a story of humiliation, not salvation: when Taylor discovered the Statue of Liberty, he was forced to realize that his race was not victorious. Is there anything about the brain or ironic of Leo Marky Mark? Or Roth's Thade, but there are a lot of runs. <br /> <br /> slogans cry: bring back to the world But it is the planet of APES. In this film, humans and monkeys collide here together. Humans have deteriorated into cavemen, causing monkeys to be spoken and glamorous body armor. A monkey that deserves to inherit the planet! According to Markie Mark, in the arrogance, the true human being admits that man must be an elite hunter just because they are there. `Take it back 'It's a ridiculous story like a monkey that flew here in 2001, complaining that "the planet that humans evolved from APES ?? !!' then causing problems with their anuses too much fur and <br /> <br /> Heston was thrown in 1968 POTA because he built his reputation as a maverick: he was Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! To make him a stubborn creature in the alien society is baffling the expectations of the audience: How is Charlton's man in our world unable to control respect? Marky Mark has proven that he has tight body pants. <br /> <br /> Although Heston is being humiliated from the monkey council all the time But he dominated the screen with his special abilities and excessive power. When Marky Mark tried to cultivate the heat in the Mongoloid human, it was like a man who was not popular in the school. Let you stop drawing dicks on the blackboard and you throw shoes at him. Burton tried to raise the level of Markki to be the icon of humanity But he turned out to be a bit bitter In the original movie, the monkeys look at Taylor as a distraction. But he is also a symbol of humanity <br /> <br /> It can be said that those who raise the chewing scene and the acting technique - Heston - should be the father of Thaddeus Roth, which is the prismoine of this film. As Roth Charlton's stepfather, his immortal voice turned his back on this man. Curse them all to hell! '<br /> <br /> The film is stupid and stupid. While Thaddeus gave a lesson to Marge, who hit the pods down from above, along with Markie's chimpanzees in there, Apes showed their hebetude by bowing in obedience to anonymous creatures. While Marky proved his own hebetude by muttering "Teach these monkeys about evolution." First, they are not monkeys. You are a monkey! Secondly, it is a genetic modification and an interesting plot invention that brings monkeys to this point, not evolution. And what you intend to teach them by blowing them with hidden lasers is called hate people, not evolution. <br /> <br /> The distorted ending will only confuse the audience. Who believe that half of Estelle's role Is part of the plot (Still my pants) <br /> <br /> No matter what he is the last hope of mankind Finally, Epson police took Marky to the plot plot, which he heard last time that `It's a crazy factory! MADHOUSE !! ... '
