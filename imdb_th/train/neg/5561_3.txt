I saw this movie under the name "Tied Up". In general, I enjoy Dolph's movies. So try it. It's not worth it I have read some previous comments about the box that tempted the audience. Don't be fooled. This is the best movie. The show does not exist. Plot a few things that can be very predictable. The movies in the place seem to be shuffled together. This just causes damp. Not worth the price of cheap rental return. As a big fan of Dolph, I'm still waiting to see him. At the end of the movie, you are still waiting. It's best to avoid this film and spend your time watching almost everything.
