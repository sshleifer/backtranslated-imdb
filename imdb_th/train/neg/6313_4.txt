It is not often that we in England have movies about urban life from the perspective of the Afro Caribbean community. The last example I remember was the Babylon that was bad in the 1980s, so I had high expectations when hearing about Bullet Boy, a movie that has been dubbed as the English version of La Haine! Goodbye, no! I agree that the use of dialogue and the environment makes this movie accurate, which can not be missed in other British films, but my concern is that the film ends sadly. <br /> <br / > This film is related to Black's intensifying problem with the tragic black violence that is common in London. But I am concerned that the film makers now use the casting as a plot compared to the characters that have the same damage. Saul Dibb has a great opportunity to make movies that may be both fun and strong. Inspire all of us. But sadly missed and created a movie that reinforces the idea that a black man in London, the only future is violence
