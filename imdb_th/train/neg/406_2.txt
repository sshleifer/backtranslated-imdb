The sound of this movie is about the wonderful graphics that have caused Kevin Bacon to disappear. Sadly, they stopped there. They are supposed to make the next chapter disappear. Then, the silly scenes and ultimately the visible elements of this movie. <br /> <br /> Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe are listed as writing works for this film. I don't think they really exist. I think they bought this script at "Scripts-R-Us" where you buy the standard "Monster Movie" script and fill in the blank. There are strange monsters stalking us together (actually "separate" in this movie) Hit the Alien / Giant-bug / Monster / Invisible-man with a deadly crowbar, a large rabbit / shark / The invisible man in the fire that never survived is not dead. Did you know that the standard content Although the minimum number of elements that are specific to invisible human films (IR glasses, spraying with certain colors) is not effective, <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that there are many possibilities. To be an interesting movie They have psychological problems about this, the deterioration of the mind due to the invisible healing process and many other ideas often touching each other in less than 2 seconds and interesting. If there is any need to help Kevin Bacon, it will eventually be a much better movie. In summary, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> I'll talk about the incredibly stupid elements of the film's ending. But I don't want to do spoilers. When it can be said that these characters are very stupid, they don't think of pulling the plug on the machine instead ...
