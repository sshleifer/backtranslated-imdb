I was a type of person who went down to the local library and read a book about Babbage's different mechanisms while my school friends were playing football, so if there is anything that is targeted for this film May be included in it. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just have to watch again. The first reviewer said that do not watch this movie while tired. Maybe that's my mistake. <br /> <br /> I try my best to enjoy this movie and have the aspects of my favorite story. But overall I find it unskilled and somewhat raving. <br /> <br /> Being a computer that confesses myself I can't help. But choose the exact time when the movie was actually created and how the graphics used to reflect that time (eg 1997) must be played in the game era "Mind Grind" to mention one example, this film could not escape the explosion of low-resolution multimedia at 16 bits at that time. Now, fortunately, this thing has diminished in recent years in the gaming world, at least in favor of real gaming. <br /> <br /> Have to turn to watch this movie through the channel. German FTA satellites do not think it will broadcast on FTA in the UK. But recently I was slightly amused when seeing the End Got Gotog (dog dog) credit. There are 4 people designing Maybe it will make me feel happy because ten years have passed since the movie was created. However, the end result makes the movie graphics from eight look good by comparing <br /> <br /> But as a whole For the main story, I agree that the format is not the best idea. Like everyone else, I admit that Ada deserves a movie without sci-fi angles and a more straightforward biographical approach may be more appropriate to cover the life of an amazing woman. <br /> <br /> There are basic errors that Undermine my enjoyment of this movie First of all, the basic idea is that the information that has disappeared from the real world in the past can be recreated precisely through some predictions through intelligent agents using software that seems to be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The movie that computer equipment can certainly predict the mechanism of everything (such as the wind). At this time, it is unknown. <br /> <br /> Ok, so Victoria may have a view. This But GÃ¶del's work in the 20th century proved that the mathematical system could not be accomplished. Turing worked in the scope of computational ability, not to mention the theory of chaos and quantum mechanics, breaking all these concepts. The software should work. <br /> <br /> Finally, clicking the mouse in the air means that "Programming" is unusual, as mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> This movie may be May have been agreed But at least in some technical ways, scientific advice should be credited to the film in a faithful belief. <br /> <br /> I won't forget this movie like "Pi". It's clear that Is a unique job Many serious mistakes for me to truly enjoy it. 3/10 from me
