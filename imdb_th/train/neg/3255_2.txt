I saw this movie last week in 1975. I was 13 years old and at that time I found it ample and quite fun. Then I discovered the world of Doc Savage through the novel Bantam, a story about old magazines. I never thought about Doc's kingdom, but I became a big fan of Doc Savage that you can meet like Fast. I read (and still own) all Bantam books. I started to read comic books. The downside (along with Star Trek and Doctor Who and all forms of geeky fat boy activities) and the peak time. Great with each adventure I've done with Doc and Fab origin. 5. Philip Jose's farmer's book - Apocalyptic Life of Doc Savage became a Bible for me and to this day I have a passion for Doc steps. So my saying that I have to admit, now many years later that the movie really missed the boat. It's a movie that doesn't know what it wants to be when growing up. The screenplay is boring and not similar to the story. These stories are from the short 30s, and if anyone looks at the AKA Kenneth Robeson outline to write them, they are divided into 3 dramatic scenes that scream to preserve the screen. Who would think that with George Pal and Michael Anderson at the helm, it would be better? The forgery element missed the goal and the more intense moment almost got there. But then short It is interesting to see that they hire a second actor. (People who used to be just players and before this movie) which everyone admits themselves well. Of course, Paul Gleason has become a great player in all aspects of entertainment and Bill Lucking is Television forever All the rest fell sadly from the map. I hope to own a copy of this movie because it's the only film version of my hero. But I'm afraid I won't look too much because it's too painful. I'll say 0 but I give 2 out of 10 instead for some art direction. (Doc's answering machine at the end is a nice touch) and the actor from the third Stinger is in the sun.
