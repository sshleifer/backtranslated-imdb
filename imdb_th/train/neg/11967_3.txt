Considering the risk of showing same-sex relationships before the end of 1980, Personal Best should have done better than playing the same sex relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) over the trials of life. Cahill br >> <br /> It seems to me that the creator of this movie has a same-sex relationship between two charming women to attract viewers. In addition, consider 90 seconds of revealing the goals of many women, jumping back across the high jump poles. This random scene has very little relevance to the movie, and it seems that this is just an act for the audience to be interested in this film. I think manufacturers try to deal with the boring plot and the more boring scenes of the movie. (Race and Oregon Race Track 1980) <br /> <br /> This review may look serious. But it's true The exploitation of the body of the young Muriel Hemingway and the relationship between same sex destroys any credit that I will give to this film. <br /> <br /> Pepper Thompson
