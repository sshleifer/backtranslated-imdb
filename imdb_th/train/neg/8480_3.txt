I can't say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. But then again, I cannot say that it is one of the worst things I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ok, so basically a girl skates well. It wants to go. Expensive school Can not afford and must have hockey scholarships She must hide her skating secrets from her friends. <br /> <br /> Personally, I don't like actors playing Katelin. She can't sing to save her life. But make a crying sound like a child who pretends to cry for his own way. <br /> <br /> Katelin is just a annoying person. The way you try to do good and benefit people. As the two skaters called her name and they said something about her choreographer and she said that she 'painted the line' made me cringe. <br /> <br /> We are all Knowing where it will go with her and the classic Spencer, they don't like each other and the combination at the end is just a normal thing. Must see if you like skating The main players are very annoying. It's good to kill time in general.
