Rajinikanth was born again after receiving seven magical powers that he could use. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with this movie that are obvious to the general audience: 50 kings are still at home with their father. his mother The next girl's father thought he was an interesting "boy" ('vaseekaramaana paiyan'); Rajinikanth interrupted the film with his sermon. The worst thing was how women in the past had exercised through House work - but we have to believe that he is not a respectable person. Even though he can read well, he loses seven of the six powers from the stupid kite. I can only go, but you will get the picture. <br /> <br /> There are god-men, gods and Rajinikanth. Rajinikanth tuning is one of these categories. Initially Rajinikanth is just Rajinikanth doing what Tamil heroes do - stand up against villains and even being the oldest has been courted by the most beautiful girl in the movie Rajinikanth Well done and the format Rajinikanth's trade mark, it was really fun - "baba count" as a novelty. What makes this movie unbearable is that the first minute is just the preface of the worst book to write. Although the prefix is ​​separated by compulsive and explicit comedy. <br /> <br /> The director doesn't explain the hero's purpose. We see that heroes are facing many obstacles. (From normal politicians) but we can't root for the hero because we don't know what the ultimate goal of the hero is At the end, when everyone wants him to be a hero, give his sermon again and walk away as a hermit. The director did not propose a solution to the climax scene. <br /> <br /> A. The rating of R. Rehman is really interesting. Regardless of whether he is acting smartly or doesn't care to fully invest in this film - who can blame him? There was one scene in which Rajinikanth stepped into a robber's van and threw knives and started counting Baba. The song is suitable for the moment and acts as a catalyst that adds further tension. There is no song that will disturb the movie's music after a few years. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest rank you can set in IMDb. This movie has all the elements shown.
