While flipping through the channel on Saturday night, my friend and I stumbled on this movie. First of all, the Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as a Native American? Seriously?! His accent is pierced even though his character is a Scottish person. Next, I was shocked when I found that the film was created after he had played James Bond / Agent 007 at least twice. This film shows the stereotyped pattern of inspiration by the professor. The girl who plays Pony should be paid to shut her mouth. And this movie won? I can't believe it. Brosnan is an attractive person. But we want to measure our eyes seriously after watching this thing for just 10 seconds. We changed from "Kicking and Screaming" to this and we want to change back. We watched the classics of children 1995 "The Indian in the Cupboard" at night, which mentions the Iroquois. The following line shows our desire to run: "Take me outside the Earth grasper" from "The Gray Owl": "If you don't like it, you don't have to watch"
