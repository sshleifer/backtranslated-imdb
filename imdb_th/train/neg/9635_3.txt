Wow! Terrible things Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor visited the road show in Sardinia and connected with director Joseph Losey, the famous Williams Williams. Taylor plays a widowed widow who is dying and has a fortress over her subordinates on the island where she commands a very loud voice, who records her memories to the incredibly ill secretary. When Burton's upset appeared by claiming to be a poet and an old friend, Taylor became aware of her time. Finally insulting --- it's hard to check whether Taylor and Burton act poorly or if it's Williams's intention to make their characters unattractive. If so, the performance is excellent! Burton muttered his line, including the word Boom, many times while Taylor screamed her. She is really scary. Noel Coward is Taylor's trusted person. "Witch of Capri" <br /> <br /> Assuming the boom is a fleeting and fast-moving life. - Two standards of Williams's theme But it was wrong from Losey with Taylor and Burton not spelling the audience Most of the lack of consciousness. Any substance that the film will be completely diluted. <br /> <br /> Boom has a beautiful photograph. --- The camera must not be focused on Make the beauty of Sardinia! Contributors include Joan Chimkus, the mighty Romolo Valli, as a knowledgeable doctor on Taylor, and Michael Dunn is a disgusted dwarf security guard for both him and the dog. Berber!
