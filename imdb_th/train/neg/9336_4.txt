Crime drama "blaxploitation" is not good, aimed at the black market of the early 1970s. Pam Grier was a star in the role of a nurse who became a female vigilante after drug traffickers made Coffee's little sister a serious nonsense. Violent, intractable, accompanied by canned energy and excitement; There is only Grier's mood swings that cause lectures. (She is not an actor here But her connection with the audience in the first way) is no different from what Charles Bronson did at this time. The film marketed and advertised as a cruel exploitation. But still trying to find audiences in large cities However, today it is only a footnote in the history of the 70s film and lacks the attractiveness of other movies of this type. * 1/2 from ****
