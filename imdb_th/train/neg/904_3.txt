"Stella", starring Bette Midler in the title role as Undaunted Tear One night in Stephen Dallas, a skeptical medical practitioner who flirts with Stella and her prostitution cause trouble. She sent both the proposal of marriage and abortion, sending him to a wealthy medical career and raising her own daughter near poverty. Flash-forward 16 years and the daughter grew up into a beautiful and cute young woman. Dr. Dallas is not in the picture. But still being thin But take care of the relationship with his daughter and ?? .. I'm impatient and worse The acting and writing of the screenplay are so great that you have to mourn for almost every scene. The culprit is Bette Midler, but the back is John Goodman as a alcoholic friend. Each scene seems to be made more than the final scene until the final scene, which is true. This film has a rate of not more than grade D, but as the film camp received unintended B + points. <br /> <br />
