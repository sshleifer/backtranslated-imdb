If asked how I would define "shallow", I would say "See Jerry Bruckheimer's production" If asked if I would set the phrase "Wasted potential" How do I answer? "Look at Jerry Bruckheimer's production." Bruckheimer's production almost always ensures that the fire at the box office. But almost received criticism from critics From the top of my head, I can think of the officers and gentlemen and the black hawk to get a lot of acclaim. <br /> <br /> CRIMSON TIDE received acclaim from critics as well. In Bruckheimer's better movie, which doesn't say much The problem I have is the situation that created the story: Russia is fighting against the Chechen and the conflict spreading throughout Russia, leading to Russia, especially Taiwanese patriots, to capture nuclear missile bases and threaten the West if they intervene. Perhaps the end of the Cold War has everything related to it. But I found that this setting is not very reliable. It is not assisted by geographic errors such as the French airline Foch in Med (does not have a position Foch is in a better position than in the Black Sea?) Or that the documentary film contains a family film that has Conflict from the Balkans The first Gulf War and even Vietnam, the adjective "not very reliable" once again dived into my mind. The story will be better when the story is right - the battle of the will of the command between the commander of the nuclear submarine and his second commander - is in progress. Director Tony Scott did his best as an actor. But the problem remains in an unbelievable situation The worst thing is that if this was created in the mid-1980s when WW3 was possible - no probability - this movie would scare me. But after the Cold War ended, therefore the danger of a nuclear war means CRIMSON TIDE.
