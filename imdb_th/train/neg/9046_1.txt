Now, for the truth, the story is very weak - for Walt Disney movies about all the garbage. When Robinson appeared in movies everywhere, I was shocked that it was so bad. It's like "Alice in Wonderland" is wrong! It feels like they have some ideas, crushing crazy garbage together to try and go with it. After that I sat there to ask to finish. My brother lost interest half way and confused with the story. The character is weak and after Robinson appears, you don't care about the ending. You just want the movie to end. It's a movie that will be forgotten and quickly forgotten. If you have free time, don't waste time on this.
