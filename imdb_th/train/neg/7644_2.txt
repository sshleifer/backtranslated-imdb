For a long time I had watched this movie very badly .. The average performance was very boring and I lost my life in the execution. It's not completely original. O and this is as funny as Clint Eastwood, a Schwarzenegger pregnant! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenes (One scene of the TV show - Where are you in hell?) Correctly - 80% of the actors come face to face - forgotten actors If they hope to have a new career, I think it won't happen to their resume! The script has the potential But there are no 80% actors or directors (who are actors and clearly should be actors). Remove it. Fred Durst is the only person who seems to be better than others. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if Have you ever considered this issue - I suggest you turn to something less painful because not only Losing all time But it is a weak example of a movie that looks bad
