The script is a lot of laughs ... On the other hand, it makes the actors sound stubborn and unrealistic and unbelievable. There are repetitive phrases - "My cute little daughter" and a little difference. Of that line which is in my heart ... and it is only a dialogue that is sloppy opera. <br /> <br /> Worse than that, the music is still wrong! In addition, the blue theme "theme" is scary and completely wrong for this. And most feelings are too much, because the use of tools, textures and the arrangement of this theme will not change even though the emotional context of the scene will occur. <br /> <br /> After that, whenever Appears, it will emerge like a sore thumb Change from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> Music that is repetitive and as if the writer is writing songs for soap or sitcoms - is a low-budget Canadian sitcom in the 1980s and That makes it so. Feeling like we were always throwing at the ad. <br /> <br /> This is a lot of jokes, too, and is a real stretch that many of these characters use only one type of NY accent - accent. Thicker I don't know if it's a question about the limited ability of an actor by knowing only one * accent * NY, or is it a question of the director's ability to observe the unusual gaze? <br /> < br /> In the end, it is an amateur script with lead lines, which makes "movies" all of this ... explode. When any foundation is shaky and unstable, it is impossible to create it without Shortcomings reveal themselves in ways that damage and unflattering.
