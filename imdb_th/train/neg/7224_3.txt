The movie remains gray for too long. Has been described very little when the movie is moving with the consequences of strange sequences that seem to have profound meaning But because of the storytelling method, they become just strange and do not understand It forces you to watch the movie again. But there is no way I can do that It was that I watched this movie in the morning. I'm sure that if I watched this movie in the evening I would fall asleep. For me, this movie is like the "Blade Runner" of a poor man. <br /> <br /> This film raises questions and impossibility too. It makes the movie create a pointless and unsustainable impression. <br /> <br /> The strange image of the movie doesn't help much. This film is half-CGI / half-life. But it did not drop by half as good, impressive, exciting and imaginative, as in the case of later movies such as "Sin City" and "300". Is a pointless and strange choice as well, considering that the character's animation doesn't look impressive Of course, the future environment still looks good and the movie is not cheap. But there is a style above substance and in this case it's not a good thing to say. <br /> <br /> Some lines are also scary and certainly not amazing. The main god of this film speaks of continuous lines such as; 'I will do this But there is no concern about why I want to do it 'than to say nothing at all. Mr Horus! It's annoying and it's easy to put in a movie if you're not interested in explaining anything about the story. In addition, the question and the deeper meaning of this film is confusing in movies and screenplays. <br /> <br /> Actors still do the best. It seems that they believe in the project and are confident that what they do will be something special. So I can't say anything negative about them. <br /> <br /> Stories and movies are far from the original. It severed from most classic and semi-classic movies, mostly modern science fiction. It may be the reason why the movie impresses me repeatedly. <br /> <br /> Experimenting a failed and interesting movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
