- = There are spoilers from both the original and the movie = - <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Notre Dame de Paris. I also read the book this summer and I watched the movie today at first. I have hope To see a good movie, especially when I saw 6.3 IMDb point.first, the scene was good, but actually I waited for the movie theater scene directly from the book But it is normal, but when Esmeralda kisses gringoire, I feel that something is wrong ... They don't kiss in the book, even in the musical .. <br /> <br /> And why is there a big gap? Esmeralda was judged by the magician in the book. She taught her goat how to answer the clock numbers or write "phoebus" .. Wait, is there a phoebus not there? In this film, he is a junk soldier more than this. The creator makes Quasimodo's love appear and they cancel Frollo's love .. But Notre dame is his frollo, his struggle between love. God and human love in the movie We can't find anything like we have, some bad guys who are really bad and kill those who clash with their thoughts ... and not mention phoebus frollo, not talking about jehan ( Brother Not to mention Esmeralda's mother (sometimes it's okay, the story will have a lot of shuffling). They haven't talked about the real story .. (PS: frollo is not Opus Dei or some people A member of a cult that he is really interested in with alchemy, he tries to create gold .. He is attached to science and religion.) <br /> <br /> Finally, don't watch this movie, it's the director who is Masterpiece And if you watch it before reading the book, God has mercy on you .. You must read the book immediately .. <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than the hunchback of Notre Dame II. your Time to watch the musical Notre Dame de Paris .. When talking about ..
