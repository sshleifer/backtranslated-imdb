Do not even worry about this movie, it is not good when judging it is an advantage. But compared to the 1972 manuscript (which is traditional), it is very bad and BTW has commented that the 1972 movie is not good compared to this book. This is a stupid story. Shouldn't judge movies from the books they bring. They are two different art forms (as if this need to be pointed out But it is so) if you use this criterion for all movies, so "2001" will suck and therefore "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs"
