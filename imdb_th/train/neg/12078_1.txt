I literally slept 3 times. Watch this movie. It's true that it's Shakespeare and that makes some ideas interesting? But this film is more outstanding than the obstacles that have long been and what can not prevent many people from ignoring Shakespeare's story. <br /> <br /> The big roadblock The most in this production Often during the character's interaction, it is difficult to distinguish who is who. True, I believe that this film has been dubbed in English. Of course, they will receive voice-overs, which may add a little more drama to the classical and literary genres. <br /> <br /> It's hard to rate this movie more than 1, though it may be based on prejudice. It may be age and what appears to be a very low budget. Even so, it was certainly painful and boring. If you confirm in Hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1/10
