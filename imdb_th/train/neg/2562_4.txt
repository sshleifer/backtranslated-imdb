Let me start by saying that this movie has 1 funny point, beginning with the exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator: Huh? Wait! Who are you? George: I'm new. George Studio is too cheap to pay. Brendan Fraser, narrator: How are you involved? George: George, good luck. I guess <br /> <br /> Sadly, it's the most funny part of this movie. <br /> <br /> It's still fun ... but Again, I was entertained ... <br /> <br /> I won't say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. (The name goes to Disaster Movie, which is extremely funny ...) This movie fell to # 7 in my top 15 ... <br /> <br /> If your little child is entertaining Easy. You will enjoy this movie. If you are a movie watcher who wants a good comedy, you'll have to shoot yourself half way.
