This is a bad movie. The story is sweet rice porridge. I think the production cost is ok. Taking good pictures, unobtrusive directions, and all that Mark Hamill is terrible. Not surprisingly, he never had any career other than his "Star Wars" movie. I would just say "Buh-bye, Mark" as he sank in the confusion that deserved receive On the other hand, Annie Potts is very young, stealing the show fully. She shows the charm, beauty and performance with all the shuffling in a single show. I remember seeing her in "Texasville" recently and taking notes of her beauty. It's interesting to see you ten years ago. However, if you are interested in Miss Potts to escape from this movie, sing along the hill.
