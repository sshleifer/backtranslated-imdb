I hate this movie The original dream has such an amazing atmosphere and mystery. Like many horror movies in the 70s, it looks and feels like a creepy documentary, Phantasm II from the late 80s. Pumping action. But still paying attention to the sad emotions that Phantasm III is terrible, it describes a strange occurrence in the previous movie in a dull way, which is diminishing instead of expanding their power. It reduced the degradation of the image from the first Phantasm, such as the correct confirmation of the original. There are many spheres flying in this movie that look like household pests rather than deadly orbs. Hundreds of hanging from the ceiling like a swaying Christmas ball in the body. No one - Master Praphan, DP, editor, director - noticed or was interested in how they looked so bad? Moreover, Phantasm III also presents a recurring joke that is not repeated. How is the difference from the intensity of the first movie? The original dream uses humor to reduce the relentless commitment to death. Phantasm III uses death to create countless cheap jokes about Reggie's craving: many people refer to the movie "flying balls". I understand Sometimes the crew may be fired from these jokes. But they are with us
