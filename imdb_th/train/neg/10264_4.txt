Head of New York General Jane Gale (While Mary Barton) worked with Ethel Granin, her sister. (As Dolphin Barton) at "Smirner's Candy Shop" after Mrs. Grandin was kidnapped by dealers to buy and sell women as prostitutes who were prostitutes. Her police boyfriend Matt Moore (As Larry Burke) must help the girl who is threatened with "Traffic in Souls" with a reputation that is hard to support. But it did not work well and it did not show anything that was unique in having the "virtue" of a woman threatened by a sex worker Maybe it will be supported as a movie that handles topics in a much longer length than usual. (Claimed to be ten wheels originally) The scene in New York City is the main attraction after many years. The prisoner's pan behind the bar is memorable because there is nothing to make the camera moving. <br /> <br /> **** Traffic in the spirit (11/24/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
