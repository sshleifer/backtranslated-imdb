This is one of the movies that are insulting. It has no real plot. We have never done personal matters with motivation other than wealth. The characters are the worst actors ever played in a movie. Looks like a supernatural threat But then it was controlled by the three elders Why do they do what they do? In order to attack the fear of other members in the group? I don't know. There is some mist from the fog machine that circulates in the hall and everyone seems to be afraid of it. What does it do? I don't know. There are some nudity for my own benefit. I am always amazed to see this in this old movie. Things have been agreed today. However, people run around like a chicken ready for an ax. They have no plans. No resources, nothing. There are five stupid climax points in the movie. Who are these people and "is" a ghost or a demon? What happened to others? I challenge everyone to tell me with confidence. A mess
