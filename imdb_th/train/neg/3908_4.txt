There is enough power of the stars in the spirit house to create a new galaxy. But the final product is debatable The film and its substance are very lofty and I think maybe most people will agree with them. (Liberal democracy, good, fascist regime, violence, bad, open-minded, good, racism is not good, etc.) Unfortunately, we were beaten from head to toe with these things and used as much as I described. /> Finally, we are left to watch the people of great honor without flaws. Impact on the disgusting Cretins that do not qualify for redemption. It shines out with skepticism in the "pro" bad wrestling competition. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays as a patron. Meryl Streep is a talented bride and Glenn Close, like her brother-in-law. When the camera is with these people, the movie tends to be very active and fun. Unfortunately, the House of Spirit joined too many subplots, and the character appeared and came out of the picture as a gallery shooting target. We don't know them, so we don't care about them. The result is boredom. <br /> <br /> If Bille August, director and screenwriter (From Isabel Allende's book) making this film longer or tearing a few characters It's a good effort with good messages and bad answers. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
