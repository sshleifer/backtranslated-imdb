Coyote Ugly may be more effective if filmmakers create R-Rated happy / seeking movies (with many nudity), but because PG-13 ratings are what every studio needs today, we Ending with a movie like this: Flick PG-13 "Tease" that is not allowed to go as close as the movie should be gone. <br /> <br /> The script is a general story. Easy to predict the plot points that will occur 15 minutes before it actually happens. The show is sufficient. But the characters are like paper, which nothing can do There are also many points that seem to me watching music videos more than movies. <br /> <br /> The only asset of this film is the amazing female lead. We will see them in some very tight and revealing outfits ..... But there is only so much that can be shown due to the limitations of PG-13. There are many cleavage and body fitting that beats the numbers. Well-designed dance But there are no nudity or sex stories to say about Tyra Banks (she is still more beautiful as she ages), moreover, still in the movie for a short time (and she has a killer smile) and Shows the true potential of acting. <br /> <br /> The only person I can see is this interesting movie, a young boy. Not allowed to watch movies with R rating. The audience may benefit a lot from the excitement aspect. But adult audiences will feel annoyed and cheated. <br /> <br /> Score: Movie-1 for women -10
