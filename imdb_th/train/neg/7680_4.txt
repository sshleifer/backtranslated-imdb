Snow White I think it's a bad movie in an artistic perspective. The plot is quite clearly visible. The characters are overly correct. However, the movie doesn't seem to have many artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> But I think this is a commercial thing. Including the characters from the French part of Switzerland (the actor IS is the leader of the band he went on tour with in the movie - a band called SENS UNIK) seems to focus on a large audience Direct Swiss German films are not sold in France - and vice versa. What happened to my nerves was the position of the product in the movie. Some scenes that think of advertising clips! <br /> <br /> I think the topic of "Young people who take drugs without other goals in their lives" is the truth that is widespread in Zurich. Therefore, it should be explained more thoroughly. I hope Samir will have enough money with Snow White so that his next film will show his true artistic skills.
