I didn't expect much from this movie after "Life is a Miracle" that was terrible. It turns out that this movie is worse than "Life ..." ten times. I have the impression that the director / writer just Messing with the audience: "Let me see how empty you can (the audience) keep." The dialog box is empty ... The situation is simple. In no time, photography is really good. Only a few comical lines, semi-funny But it was hard to laugh truly. During this "joke" I laughed at myself to watch the movie until the end. If you can lift yourself above the failure of this director ... you will find a good show of a few legends (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek) and the great works of Emiri's son Stribor Kusturica. Swat <br /> <br /> Brief: Too bad for such a great director! Emir Kusturica is still young and should make a top-rated movie. He chooses to make this movie affordable for personal use with a proud attitude towards world trends and negligence for his ex-girlfriend.
