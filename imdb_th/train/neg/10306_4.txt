After watching a dozen episodes, I decided to give up on this program because it showed in an unrealistic manner what a mathematical model When Charlie predicted future behavior of people using mathematical models, I think my career is funny. I'm not a mathematician instead of a chemical engineer. But I work very hard with mathematical models So I will try to explain to ordinary people why the show is close to the "belief" of the fairy tale. <br /> <br /> First of all, choosing the right model to predict the situation is a task that needs to be done. Charlie Eppes shows Saw that it was a genius But even though he had to spend time researching suitable models, especially for trying to guess who would do or where he would be in the near future People who are unpredictable and haphazard, have no form for them. Isaac Asimov also wrote about it in the 1950s, although there are models for specific individuals. But probably the probability (patience), which means that it has a good chance of wrong predictions. <br /> <br /> Second, assume that the form is suitable for someone or Found the situation must know the parameters of the model These parameters are constant values ​​of the equation, such as gravity acceleration (9.8 m / s2) and are often not easy to judge again. Charlie Eppes must be someone who is too smart to know the correct parameters for The model he chose And after selecting the model and parameters, it must be tested Oddly, they are not and by wonders, they are definitely suitable for the predicted situation. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, creating a very important model is always overlooked, not just But from numbers only - fi movies: the computational effort needed to solve these models, trying to make Excel solve complex models with many equations and variables and will find Herculean's work, although Charlie Eppes has software Correct in correcting his model, he may be stuck with hardware that will slow down considerably And even if there is a mix between the appropriate software and hardware, the model solution may take several days to arrive. He solved them immediately! I can use his computer in my research. I will be very happy. <br /> <br /> As a drama, it is far from the best performance. The character is quite fixed. But not even funny, even in the Big Bang theory The crime is boring and the way that Charlie Eppes can solve it sometimes makes the FBI seem incompetent. <br /> <br /> For some ordinary people, for others, how to manage things makes it difficult to swallow!
