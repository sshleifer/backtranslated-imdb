After reading for many years how great this movie was, it created Ruiz among French critics. (Especially the Cahiers disrespectful group of people who despise) when I finally watched about a year ago, I found it quite disappointing Very high expectations) filmed in saturated black and white movies, CPUs that were intended to be built for TV, and were only one hour long, being told in the form of conversations between art actors and narrators outside the screen. As they pondered through the drawing set (Which is shown in the form of tableaux vivants) and trying to find out if they have some clues about the hidden political crime or not (Kate Beckinsale movie The Great Uncovered has similar arguments) Borgesian is my word Read many reviews about this movie. But I would say that almost all of Borges's stories are more interesting than this movie.
