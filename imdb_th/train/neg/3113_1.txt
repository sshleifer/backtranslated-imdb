This movie is a mess. I was surprised that it had a drama. Without having to wait for Robin Williams straight to the video It's badly written It's a bad director. It is a worse offense: it has an interesting topic and drops into a ridiculous and boring thriller that doesn't have excitement and no doubt and without internal logic or emotions. That is beyond the expectation that the audience I agree with is laughing. Save money. The movie trailer is totally misleading - it's unambiguous and without excitement - in fact the worst offense The movie is that it's boring.
