Until now, the worst movie I have ever seen is Ben & Arthur. You should check out the comments about this movie instead of this movie. The examination statistics for this film were positively distorted through relentless and unscrupulous pushing by some people involved in making evidence that is relatively easy to find online. At least someone who gave Ben & Arthur enough honor to let him stand on his own shaky legs instead of being unscrupulous, so those who like me will buy it. <br /> <br /> Everything. About this movie is terrible. Scripts, stories, casting, direction, photography, editing, music ... What's more in movies? No matter what it is, it is terrible as it has been. If it is not satisfactory, it would be ridiculous. I keep watching because I think it has to be better because I haven't found any positive opinions. <br /> <br /> Don't spend a lot of money on making great movies. Low budget and does not mean that the movie must not be good. A favorite example of a budget masterpiece, the shoe laces are the amazing Mala Noche of Gus Van Sant, but there are many more. The secret of Sideline director or original cut is not good, not because the person who created it has no money But because they have huge artholes and are not capable of anything except self-promotion
