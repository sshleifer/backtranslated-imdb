Next part of "The Howling", this story is chosen from the funeral of Karen White. (She was killed at the end of the first movie) Stefan Crosco (Christopher Lee Sad) Arrives there and tells Reb Brown, Karen's brother, Karen is a werewolf. He will go to Transylvania to kill Striba (Sybil Danning), the leader of the werewolf. Ben and Karen colleagues (Annie McEnroe) Join him <br /> <br /> Scary scripts, bad directions, wrong corrections and truly scary performances by Brown and Mac. Enero Most werewolf effects are kept in the dark - for good reason! They are awesome when you see them. Subpar special effects also - even though I like the cartoon lightning that comes from Danning's finger. There is also a werewolf orgy which is a particularly stupid person and Danning take off her at least. Eight times during the closing credits! <br /> <br /> There are a few good things - I find that the village in Transylvania is fun - it looks like it's from a horror movie from the 1930s! There are interesting camera techniques during the transition scene; Brown and McEnroe have a good body and Lee and Danning are good in this matter - but they can't really record - why are they doing this? Where do they make money? ??? This is one of the lowest rated IMDb movies, the only one that should tell you something. Expected that Nanning was very shocked when she watched the movie - I can understand why! Can't miss
