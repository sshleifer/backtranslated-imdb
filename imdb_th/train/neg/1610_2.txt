What I want to know about this movie - I saw the road show version for 4 hours. That's a very surprising story. For a movie about two very charismatic men - Castro and Chloe participated in a big political battle. It was almost devoid of emotional fire. The scene between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who is the best performer With a slightly high pitched voice) without drama or depth, and basically came down to Castro. Che: Go here, go there, do this and that. There is no explanation as to what effect or use of this action will result. Odder still has actors in the actors with the power needed to play Castro - Joaquim de Almeida, but he is divided into sub-sections in the second half. If there is no tension or passion that you expect to shoot these people and their followers, this movie becomes an epic length film about a hairy, bearded man running through. These were shouting and shooting without purpose or end. Many of the reviews that I read were praised by director Steven Soderbergh's work while ignoring almost all actors. (One of the fact is, spend more time talking about Soderbergh's new digital film camera than the story or actor, or the fact that it's all Spanish with English subtitles.) This is a strange thing to do since a) Soderbergh in the movie and b) It is not only a very talented job without making a mark that nods JFK's Oliver Stone in the black-and-white camera cut when C he came to New York if you can imagine the Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty. You will get an idea of ​​the boring ability of this movie.
