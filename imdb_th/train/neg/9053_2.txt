Just I found the TV program "Mash" repeated. "Political sins", doubling the hypocrisy and the biggest sin of all, and that is? It's incredibly boring. You have Alan Alda as the main leader "(star)" who loves himself and his intelligence so much that I feel uncomfortable trying to sit and watch various episodes. The original series has both McLean Stevson and Wayne Rogers, which I will happily accept, having to dress and style to present their characters. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farrell both singular and composite together, it's like eating caviar and fresh oysters with bread Wonder Loretta Swit, which I did. Found that it was not boring and without her own mistakes, it was not surprising to look at, and Gary Burghoff, who was good at this, was tired of looking and acting on the show When I saw a one-year program showing me Jamie Far is just a "comedian". The eyebrows are low and not worth mentioning here. The reason I didn't give a rating (one) that anyone who read this at this time is wondering if any ranking is not just a subjective call. Television, except for a few exceptions Say that, Mash has quality in production. (According to television standards) in that era and today and therefore deserve two things. Rob Ritter
