Cash (now played by Khrystyne Haje for Angelina Jolie) has traveled to the wasteland after her death. (After her guardian died at a young age, the guardian said that played by Elias Koteas, a real good actor), a stone fragment looking for Cyborg to exchange scrap metal and cash. She is the leader of the Cyborg group who has been burnt. (Including William Cutt, Evan Luther and human scientist, played by Zach Gulligan) with the bounty hunter Richard Lynch Malcolm McDowell. As the employer of Lynch Cyborg 3, managed better than the other two items. But still is a very boring feature The problem with this is that potential ideas have never been used well. The daily action sequence and the actors' names, such as McDowell, Katt and Galligan, almost do not have to do. Norch is above normal (as always) and this film lacks the inspiration or ambition that is not as fun as it had been before (the second one is Van Damme that is boring) and disappointing. The science fiction is almost irresistible good idea any of this was the only thing I can say about it /> <br /> * 1/2 out of four <br (poor).
