This shows in the biography box and is information about children's cartoons! I give 2 out of 10 because of the attention to detail because most of them have a sense of the 70s and three women who play three traditional angels. They look like them, so make-up is good. But it is void of all the usual / often seen in one of their biographies No interviews with surviving members, crew members, production team members, etc. or friends, family and biographers of those people In fact, I know as much as the program I did before I watched this movie, based on a biography (supposedly) for learning what nobody knows about the program and not knowledge. General that never happened before
