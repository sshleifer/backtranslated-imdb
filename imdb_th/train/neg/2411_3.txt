The living death Hood is about a young scientist named Rick, who lives with his brother in Oklahoma, where drug dealers and prostitutes are full of streets. Then, one night, Rick's brother was shot by the gang, driving down the road that had fought him earlier Rick calls his scientific partner to bring the latest formulas they have made that bring healthy blood cells. The formula was not tested on humans or even corpses. But Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life again. He gave the body twice the amount of the formula. But nothing happened So Rick calls 911 and the body is bought to come back to live again and eat human flesh. Now Rick has to meet his zombie brother before the whole hood is changed to a neighborhood. Of the dead Hood of dead creatures is one piece of trash The plot is a hoax directly from the Resident Evil. The performance is especially scary, with Rick disguising his brother. The gun is a fake, because every time a weapon is fired, it sends out a spark and Just makeup incoherently. It's just a fake blood covering the actor's face. Zombies have also been fixed. They roared and had to be shot in the heart! Zombies should fight, shout, groan, and be shot in the brain before death! This movie is very scary, the scene is the only good time of this movie. Hood of the Livingers gets 3 out of 10 little entertainment here and there. But it was successful as a festival with limited budget
