The best amateur describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel "Celestine Prophecy", which follows the teacher's spiritual awakening from a mysterious village job in Peru. The home video quality actors present the characters that are called exaggerated and homophobic, while the film is driven by Armand Mastroianni's hardest direction, despite efforts in temples and fans. Interestingly, the fare is getting stronger in the ABC's "Lost" or Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code" uselessness. Filmmakers barely work at all. This film reveals spiritual propaganda, poor consumption, and very little results that can pass through this mess to see the true point.
