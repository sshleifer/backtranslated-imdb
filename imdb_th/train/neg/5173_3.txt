When I saw this thing at the store, I thought it looked good and original, such as Wolfs Creek. Meet the Texas fanatical massacre and I mean it costs just three quid (about $ 6) straight talk I don't think it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Looks like the director - 'The Butcher Brothers' can't decide if they want to make horror movies. Horror. It ends with a full sadist hour. With thought At fifteen minutes and all the characters are one-dimensional and you do not care what happens to them. But trying to make the audience interested about the characters they added And the beginning of the movie that doesn't need to be completely honest. <br /> <br /> The only good part is the middle / end - I won't destroy it for you. But that's just the "good" part. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a pointless clock. It feels like a two-hour movie. But actually takes only 75 minutes. If you want a movie with art, don't worry. If you want a slasher movie - don't worry - the movie will move very slowly without anything going on.
