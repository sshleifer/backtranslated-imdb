ALL FOR LOVE (named after the weekend) is a romantic drama with Captain Saint Ives, a French officer in Napoleon's army captured by England and imprisoned in Scotland, where he meets and falls in love. The girl who visited the prison In addition, there is a story related to murder. <br /> <br /> I will be honest and accept that I have not taken this movie too much because I am not a fan of drama. But I would say that this is a good act by everyone involved, and it is a good actor with Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E Grant, Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs. The costume design you can expect. <br /> <br /> I would be very surprised if the movie didn't receive any complaints after broadcasting on BBC2. At tea time, Captain St. Ives was in bed with a prostitute. Disclosure of nipples And a full bath scene of French prisoners are male full frontal nudity, not to mention the bloody crime scene to see clearly. You have to really worry if the BBC scheduler has any kind of clues to what they are doing.
