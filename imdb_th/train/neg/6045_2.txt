This is an interesting idea that is not good. The hidden meaning in the art left as a clue by the serial killer. Sounds interesting. But the action in "Anamorph" is slow and the eyes are excruciatingly not interesting. There is no other way of explaining movies except boring things. The clues of death are just an interesting part of "Anamorph". Everything that connects them is boring. Willem Dafoe gives credible results as an examiner. But he is involved in a slightly stretched script, a character that supports many characters, including Peter Stormare as an art expert James Rebhorn as the police chief Paul Lazar as a medical examiner Double lines speak through the door that is broken. Not recommended. - MERK
