My children watch the program every day. It is a wonderful application for young children. However, they need to stop the show again and make a more realistic list and get rid of Rooney's yellow teeth and Deedee. The pot is the only doodle that has clean white pearl teeth and kids observe these things and ask both 2 Does it brush your teeth? Does the show lead to the United States and if so, can we find a schedule at And another thing if we can add Mo, you have to stop hiding a lot. Sometimes when you emerge from a place where you are not afraid of young children and what is pulling the rope? What does that mean? Others are then wet all the time. They need to add new things to their performances instead of the same OLE, the same.
