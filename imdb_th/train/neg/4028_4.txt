This is a very good movie - good actor (Robert Loggia, Ellen Parker). A good plot (mysterious missiles from space threatens to burn the world) and many stock images. (If the Air Force has a movie The rocket launcher was used.) Unfortunately, it was destroyed by too many plays and impossible timelines. <br /> <br /> The film involves missiles from space that were attacked by the Soviets and diverted attention. To low atmosphere orbit At less than five miles and with speeds exceeding 4,000 miles, it emits one million degrees of exhaust, burning everything on the ground, including glaciers, remote warning lines (Dew) and Eskimo. <br /> <br /> All attempts to destroy missiles fail. <br /> <br /> The first flaw in this film appears first. While we didn't expect much from low-budget movies But some things can't be forgotten - like a little research For example, both the Soviet and US anti-ballistic missiles fired at missiles with unprecedented precision. However, the first successful ABM test was not conducted until March 1961 by the Russians. <br /> <br /> There is too much melodrama. Dr. Loring (Loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) plays their love affair with as much wood as a log cabin. Parker's character cried and booed at Loggia's sacrifice as if she were in the screen test. Loggia was a brave man like a businessman. The scientist (Phillip Pine) hams it so much that he makes William Shatner look like an actor. The driver of the bus continued to blow the crap in the background behind the scenes. The only good actor is a movie commentator, played by veteran actor Laurence Dobkins ("Naked City"). <br /> <br /> All of this may be overlooked. If not in that period After the missile data was sent to DC Pentagon to lead a group of scientists, General (Larry Kerr) announced that the missile would attack New York City in 63 minutes. After this, a discussion by scientists and a serious lull According to the word that was searched by the ambassador to see if the missile was an attack from Russia and if necessary to respond. <br /> <br /> The film shows that The military is completely disturbed. People protect civilians from their jobs and go to their stations. Eight million people take a break while the school bus picks up millions of children. (And we can see the white city of New York that I have ever seen, although watching the sci-fi movie of the 50s makes it seem like this is a standard.) Hold in the dark for tens of minutes. Then, unbelievably, a man in the Pentagon announces that the missile will attack Ottawa, Canada in 51 minutes! All such actions occur in 12 minutes! Then, to add fuel to the fire, Loggia thought of any way to stop the alien missiles. He gradually created a large amount of plutonium, packed in a jeep and brought it from the DC to the missile base that was far away to place it On a missile On the way, he was hit by a road by a fierce driver who had already been robbed. He eventually brought the plutonium back and drove to the base to deliver the weapon. All of this is in the same 63-minute time frame. <br /> <br /> The film also makes the audience look as if Ottawa may have been saved only to show that men, women and children are roasted. The missile said that there would be five minutes to New York. Loggia continued to drive to the base (another 4 miles to go). He reached the base and placed the arm of the weapon and counted down for two minutes. All within five minutes The New York constituency should be burned, at least. <br /> <br /> However, the missile will be destroyed if you have not guessed the ABM warhead. Destroy it with a large nuclear bomb that uses plutonium. Five seconds later, the explosion will disappear and everything is clear. Yes, they caused a nuclear explosion equal to 100 Hiroshimas in the suburbs of New York City and nothing happened. <br /> <br /> This film has all the elements needed to be a good B movie but lose them to Loggia. Playing as his character lonely, you don't care that he will sacrifice himself at the end. You don't care about other characters, even the scientists played by Pine. The tension that should make this film impossible during the time allowed (Not yet until today, not with Jack Bauer) <br /> <br /> This movie is very difficult to find. As far as I know, it has not been published in any media and for good reason. I do not know whether this movie should be or is a standard practice. But there is a scene in which the government sends the best military scientists and businessmen to the deep shelter that they are worth to lose. No single woman or minority in the bunch Hari Rhodes is the only black man in this film and he plays the piano. It's worse than "27 days" in which the aliens gave the opportunity to five Earthlings to save or destroy the world, and he didn't include blacks or Hispanic people. <br /> <br /> I saw things. This in the sci-special fi night in Turner's classic movie and I don't think it will appear again. If you find a copy of somewhere you may want to install it on Amazon.com
