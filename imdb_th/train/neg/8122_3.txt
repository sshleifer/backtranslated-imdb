Painful to watch and not all for caring for the character's struggles The two main characters are Cynthia, Mother and Monica. Their characters are firmly accepted until redemption, they become accepted characters after the unbelievable fast death of the family It's not worth the wait. I hope the field that is worthwhile for honesty among the family will be less headache to watch.
