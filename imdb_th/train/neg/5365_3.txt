"Personal training" is being separated from the successful "Grey Anatomy" and is quite written. The actors are excellent. The evidence may work. But the writing is terrible. <br /> <br /> Pre-pilot who disguised as the Grey's Anatomy scene should be my first warning. The plot is just blah. I think maybe it's a coincidence. So I set the DVR to be a pilot tape and other episodes. <br /> <br /> While I watched the pilot, I was just wondering if this performance with a skilled actor would make the pilot boring The pilot should suck people and bring them back. There should be flash excitement, excellent writing, interesting stories, along with the excitement that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season. Surprisingly, this program has no such thing. <br /> <br /> Think of it as a coincidence. I just watched the second episode, hoping for the best. And although slightly better But it's not close to what it's interesting to not miss on TV. <br /> <br /> I just polished this list from the show. Not worth the effort of IMO and I will be very surprised if this program is done through the middle of the season. Pass this person up
