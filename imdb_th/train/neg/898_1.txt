Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" is rude, rude, raw, rough and rough. This is the only way to describe this shocking and worthless piece. Eddie Murphy tries to find a shot rather than laughing and trying to beat him. He manages to be funny sometimes. But most will lose the plot with vulgar language and nasty jokes. <br /> <br /> Forget it! Besides that you will enjoy Eddie's foul style. I don't think I'll bother with "Eddie Murphy Raw". I like Eddie more than in the movie. <br /> <br /> Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
