I watched horror movies since I was 5 years old, starting from Childs Play. Since then, I have watched good and bad horror movies. But this is undoubtedly the DUMBEST movie I've seen. Actors do everything they can with the content. Just stupid plot Plus it's just all blood I have a lot of blood. But it's ridiculous! In one scene, the character will be stabbed in the back and choked with his gut! Ordinary fool! The other problem of this movie is that it's boring and probably the slowest movie ever created. The end of it is stupid. But then again it goes with the rest of it! At the end, when the girl is away from the human / ancestor, she gets help from the old woman. The old woman is drinking tea. But when she turned to talk to the girl, the girl attacked her! She became a cannibal! Movie about mental retardation
