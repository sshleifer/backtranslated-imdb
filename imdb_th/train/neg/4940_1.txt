This item proved to be a 30-minute DVR hard drive space loss. I didn't expect much and actually received less. Not only did I hope this program would be canceled in the second episode, I didn't. Would like to believe that Geico will try to use advertising campaigns, cavemen that once had I would like to spend one night looking at my daughter's lice to see lice rather than looking at this junk. I wonder if ABC forwarded this show to be consistent with the fall schedule. AFLAC / Ducks has a documentary on the case in which I cannot comment on this show for me clearly and said that it is not too good.
