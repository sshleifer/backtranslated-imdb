Ok, I saw this movie for the first time at 9:00 am at Cinemax a few weeks ago and thought it would be an award. This movie is a great movie. I mean, the mother of the monster shows her true form only at the end of the movie. I will "That's why she doesn't show up faster in this movie for a moment". Would it be better if they were just going to kill fun, like two young women, then let the sheriff or police detect and enter the old man to kill the monster, help the girl / woman and have another 1 2 people killed in the process? I think it will be a much better way. Also suck because the son is the main character and he was killed first. Why not get rid of the mother first? In addition, she has strengths at the end of the movie when she starts killing people. She said by herself that she was too weak. This time, Stephen What? I never stopped acting by any actors. They tried their best. If not for a good performance, I will give this movie 1/10 3/10
