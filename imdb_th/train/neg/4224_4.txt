Star rating: ***** The Works **** Just think of the sign *** that was a little bit in the middle of the moment. ** The backs were * The Pits <br /> <br /> In this release For Nick Park's lovers and dogs, they are forced to fly to the moon when the old Wallace doesn't have cheese. <br /> <br /> Just like the shortest feature in just 22 minutes, the adventures of W / This G is the fastest and It shows Oil-based animation is a little funny and funny here, which reminds Mork's animation about a small man in the box. <br /> <br /> Admirable, though, the craftsmanship. The latter is true. Wallace & Gromit (may be too clean and original for my generation) The only thing I really enjoyed is The Wrong trousers (and that's even more than when I was young and I didn't know anymore. Will say The satisfaction of seedier life) I was driven to search for an early effort due to the resurgence of popularity in popularity as a result of a hugely successful film adaptation. <br /> <br /> Technically, what is considered!) This lacks the emotional angle that the successor must have. That was said that it was quite fun for the first time and certainly set the standard for the greatest thing to come with two stars but is a good two stars **
