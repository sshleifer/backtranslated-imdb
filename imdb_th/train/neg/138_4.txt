Pros: I like this movie because it's the first horror movie I've seen for a long time that really scared me. The show is not bad and the killer "Cupid" believe and annoying. <br /> <br /> The Bad: The story and the story of this movie is incredibly weak. That was scary and very disgusting I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is unable to deal with blood. <br /> <br /> Overall: Fear good, but it's not good. <br /> <br /> ** From **** *
