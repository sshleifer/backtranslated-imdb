My girlfriend has a habit of going to Blockbuster and choosing a movie that no one has heard about. Sometimes it leads to a fun discovery. Often the best thing that can be said is that they run the course for one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> She brings "advice from the caterpillar" back home. She is excited because the box says it's funny. Fortunately for us, the propaganda on the box never lies. <br /> <br /> This movie is a patient exercise. This is one of those movies that you will hate every character in this movie, unless you're a cunning and shy person who likes to watch movies about yourself. Until the introduction of a good character The characters who pretend to be annoying leaders will fall in love and act in a way that in the real world will drive anyone away. <br /> <br /> Spoiler from here <br /> < br /> Therefore, the group of artists who are upset, jaded and cocky have sworn love and find success in their careers. Then they found good habits, intelligent, mature and loving. (A perfect man) Then we watch the woman who is an artist who often pretends to be annoyed (in her 30s?). It will be strange when she falls in love. So she tried to escape from the smart and good-natured man and was with a married man who had a good but empty sex. She was rude to men and did everything in her power to drive him out. Go In the real world, she would be quite successful. I definitely want to escape from you and I don't have a relationship with you! <br /> <br /> Although it's a good thing that the man 'Fight for his love' but I never want her to have him. (My girlfriend didn't) She didn't deserve him. And why I wonder why the director thought 'The perfect man' should be punished by winning a relationship with her? When the artist asked 'Almost perfect man' will leave. We also screamed him out. There is a problem with the movie when the heroine of the film is annoying, children and stupid that you want her to fail. <br /> <br /> Moreover, let me say that Andy Dick makes me laugh a few times. Although his character pretended to be an annoying point About other characters, they behave well, have bankrupt and annoying habits. <br /> <br /> It's funny and I can say that I laughed a few times in this movie. Unfortunately, no laughing occurred until the last 10 minutes, but by the time I laughed, I had prayed for the film to end too long. I want to get rid of these boring characters from my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to see people you hate fighting with love for people they don't deserve, this is Movie for you
