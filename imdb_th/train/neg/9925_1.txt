This is the 30th anniversary DVD for Blazing Saddles, which is great. But not like this Nowhere I see the name of Mel Brook here and I can guess why he has more feelings than not involving this pilot. My gawd. Who will find this funny? Of course, there may be a competition issue. But for me, it's not a joke, because it's not a joke. It's like a writer who doesn't try to be funny just to cash in on a tie with Blazing Saddles. Do they expect this show to set off many seasons when they create this pilot? Flat, they don't care It's a fast cash cow which thank God for not paying. I guess it's only useful for historical purposes or to show how stupid and unkind Hollywood writers can be.
