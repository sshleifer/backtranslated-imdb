I like movies about morally damaged characters. But this is too much The show wasn't great. But that's not a real problem. The problem is the feeling that is sinking into my stomach into the movie for about 20 minutes. These characters are hollow. They have almost no depth and little things that they have devoted to the cruelty they show to each other in the face of friendship. Exploring the dark side of the character set may be interesting. But you have to give those characters a true personality or they are just a weird cardboard These characters are cardboard and the pictures they give are very ugly.
