This is a movie that shows that emotions and music and the surface are not enough to make a good movie. Of course, viewers will be taken care of in many scenes in Los Angeles at the age of thirty-one. I like the view of a wheelchair approaching a tunnel and a tram up the hill - but In a sense Because it creates the mood that "What is about to happen" - and nothing to do The script also has deception against planning or action or injury - and the time that is not delivered. Not even presenting the theme (I think) of this movie But the character is not suitable The actors are both too beautiful, their roles do not convey any oppression or pain, and the script doesn't make us see. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland now? That is another story. His character is very well played so I want the camera to follow him.
