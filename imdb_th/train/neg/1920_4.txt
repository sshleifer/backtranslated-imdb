I didn't say that the Night of the Twisters was scary, but it was far from great. The best medium course. I seem that every time a movie is released, the second movie must be at the same time. (Think about Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's Peak) The Night of the Twisters is just a Twister, except for the worse and has special world effects. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to do with. The show shown in that though They are not excellent. It's a movie. The director. Special techniques. The whole story is too strange to be interpreted. The tornado strikes the city and, in general, this film is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with damage. <br /> <br /> I don't know why it looks as though there is a double disaster movie. Almost released But this would be better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt
