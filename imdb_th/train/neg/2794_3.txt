Because I am a musician, I think maybe I'm going to watch this movie in TMC. Nothing good anymore. One of the worst mistakes in my life until now and only half can be done. I seriously thought that it was one of the softest core movies with crappy stories and crappy performances. But no, I am not happy that even "musicians" are not very good. I hope there may be some people laughing. But I'm not sure if they're trying to throw one liners or not. But now I have to sit here and watch the rest until Pulp Fiction begins or maybe better. And now I'm sitting here typing until I have 10 lines
