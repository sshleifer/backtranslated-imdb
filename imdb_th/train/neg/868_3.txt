Go to the zoo, buy peanuts and feed them to the monkey. Monkeys are funny People with amnesia that don't talk a lot, just sitting there with empty eyes is not something funny. <br /> <br /> Black joke? There is no black person in it and there is no funny thing in it. <br /> <br /> Wal-Mart bought any of these things and placed it on the dollar rack It has a label I think they brought out the bare scenes. They may also bring other things. Who knows? What we know is what they bring out. <br /> <br /> <br /> The performance seems to be good for me. There are lots of things that can't be reached. Should it be a city? Should it be a big lake? If people in the church are too hot, why are they wearing coats?
