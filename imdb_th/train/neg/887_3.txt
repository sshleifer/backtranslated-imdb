After the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime", the directors decided to gather and create a similar poetry style film in New York. Unlike the original film, the story in this movie sometimes seems to come and go too fast - by the time you think about getting into it, it is in many cases too. And often start and stop and start again - with stories woven together So there is no name indicating that the story is complete and less structured. <br /> <br /> Sadly, however, while "Paris, Je T'Aime" was hit or missed (mostly hit), most of "New York , I Love You "Missing stories tend to have more sex in nature But still less sweet - and often worse It's a boring and unbelievable movie that has a few special stories, and maybe the melodious song makes it seem more. I understand that now it's a good quality song. But the somber tone really makes me feel like cutting my wrist! Among the better ones is a story about a young man who took a young woman sitting in a wheelchair to go to the wedding ceremony. They talked about cheating outside the restaurant. All of this is sad because I love the very first movie and I want to love this movie very much. I respect what they try. <br /> <br /> Anyway, and this isn't really a complaint, but I'm surprised that how many people smoke in the movie. For a movie recently, that is unusual in our anti-smoking culture. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you receive a DVD, there are two parts that are included as specials that are not included in the movie. One of them consists of Kevin Bacon. (Wearing a cool hat) eating hot dogs .... and nothing more for nearly ten minutes Other features of teenagers who spend time filming movies around the world, including unhappy couples
