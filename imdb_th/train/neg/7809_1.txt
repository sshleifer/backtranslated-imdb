It was Michael Madsen's first debut. Zen Sen plays Cecil Moi, a family man with an alcoholic that lives around him Cecil grabbed the phone book, looked up at the name of the preacher and called him at night. He went to the preacher's house and talked about his problems. The preacher taught Cecil to respect the Word of God and let Jesus stay in his heart. That makes everything better. Ah ... If only everything in life is easy The fact that "This movie" looks like it was created for about $ 500. Definitely didn't help. 1/10
