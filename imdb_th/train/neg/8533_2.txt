Even in 1942, the standard of making movies at HER CARDBOARD LOVER presented that the oldest Machinations of half of the couple (of husband / wife, ex-husband / ex-wife) to get back again at the threat of marriage. With others, divorce or eventual separation by jealousy, humiliation, or other forms that have been done much better in classics such as his Friday girls and the stories of Philadelphia. Both of these films represent women who have a strong and indomitable screen and the player is a female protagonist. In both films, both women are separated / divorced from the first husband (witty) and marry a colorless man who is absolutely opposite to them and both are distracted by denying the husband to be a husband. Soon <br /> <br /> Plot in HER CARDBOARD LOVER Change gender: here is Norma Shearer in this role of Cary Grant to get rid of ex-girlfriend George Sanders by employing Robert Taylor to post Sta is her Gigolo.

Lose all interest in the subject at the same time and there is no secret that everyone who has experienced this kind of thing Has lost focus primarily and cannot wait until retirement or ending the contract as soon as possible It may be the case here. She seems lost. She looks tired. She seems uncomfortable traveling through the pilot instead of living that part. After this film, she will not do anything more. But will be responsible for discovering Janet Leigh, who will be the star of her screen in the late 1940s and late 60s
