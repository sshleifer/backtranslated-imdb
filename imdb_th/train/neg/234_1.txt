This film is absent, intermittent and planned. It is a very meaningful image of women. I rented it because it was identified as a joke (it can be stretched) and because the cover says Andie McDowell shows that storm. She's not me as a gal. I watched this movie with two men and we spent an hour after that. Then exclaimed how bad it was. <br /> <br /> Warning: Summary summary below! RAMPANT SPOILERS! <br /> This movie begins with a story that is quite about an old woman with a younger man. They want her to marry a boring old man who loves her. But she is very happy with the puppy being oversexed, which you are rooting to let it fall out and of course she decided to marry that man But her meticulous girlfriend, who has received help from those who have a strong desire, plans to trick our heroine into thinking that the man is cheating on her. It works. She struggles with him, he runs out of the house and is right. Truck collision (Can you remember the movie name?) So he is now dead, two thirds of this movie. And even though our heroine is the headmaster of the school that takes time to care for women But it seems that she forgot to use contraception and pregnancy. <br /> <br /> She lacks the relationship with her girlfriend. She decided to marry a boring person. Am I talking about boring people who love you like this? She asked him to marry a young man (well, right?) But now she tells him that she will marry him and apparently he doesn't have any arguments to be dicked in this way. Save her life at the altar and take her home without them confessing that most of them are responsible for the love of her life that has been knocked out. She has children in the final scene. They leave it in the crib. Home Needs while they go out to the balcony to smoke, drink and be satisfied. I am not a child I issued a section about cancer of the red herring and the ridiculous lesbian moments of the harp.
