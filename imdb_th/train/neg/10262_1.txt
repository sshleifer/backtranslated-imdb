Now I flick out of curiosity and have to keep looking - in the same way you see a car ... <br /> <br /> I appreciate the fact that it's a trick. But should not stop I am from criticizing the acting and the terrifying dialogue of God. Seriously, this rating is one of the poorest movies I've ever watched - it looks like the Tales episode from Cryptkeeper and is a much worse movie ... <br /> <br /> Okay - a little criticism (1 ) When his doctor had a heart attack in front of a monster (We have never seen a monster attack him, so we are considered a heart attack.) The army then released a shell of bullets at a monster that is a doctor's foot - but the doctor did not touch any missiles and still lives. (2) Attacking the army from a distance of 100 yards and we see the use of the flame-geez machine. Those things are within 30 meters! (3) When a monster tries to take a military professor to run into the classroom and shoot up to the ceiling The monster makes the boy fall and the soldiers don't try to shoot the monster ??? Come! (4) The monster seems to have something from Power Rangers! (5) There is one scene in which five "good people" (priests, young women, doctors, journalists and children) are all shocked and we get answers. Satisfy (Along the line of the hand towards the mouth) one after the other - is very natural! (6) The generals run away from time to time (7) The generals refuse to try using electricity and will not listen. (8) The performances are terrible. (9) Am I talking about a monster, a rubber suit? (10) The song that the great God does not stop!
