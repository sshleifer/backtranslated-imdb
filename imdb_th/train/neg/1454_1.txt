I recently watched this movie twice recently and I can't understand why the program makers made this nonsense. I mean yes. It gave a great impression on Hitler's environment and I meant the way they built Austria in the late 1890s, World War I and World War II. What I do not understand is the reason that they imagined Hitler as a pure evil, madness, unreliability and unstable mind. He is a man of love and wisdom, which of course he has his dark side. But why, in the name of heaven, therefore showing him this way All his positive views were cut from the situation without leaving anything other than images like the propaganda of the most influential man in modern civilization. Yes, he threw Germany into the Second World War. Yes, he was a class, and sometimes he had sexual instability, especially at the end of the actual war. If you want to remind us, <br /> <br /> I don't think this movie is a warning. The real danger of Hitler and the Nazis was the fact that they were able to rise to power in a time of severe weakness around the world. The truth about this evil is remembered. But still being hugged by almost all German people (Not to mention the Austrians and many others) makes a warning of modern civilization, not the fact that Hitler is like If so, the creator made us believe - I would believe that the German people would be retarded. One guy in this movie will never go anywhere near the party leader - not to mention ReichsKanzler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
