I was in second grade 12 years ago. I remember clearly. We learn about space. Every little boy wants to go to the area, right? After I saw this, I was scared to death that I would "accidentally" be thrown into space by some psychotic robots with a single follow-up mind. I don't know if this is a movie. I think it's a news program or something. I guess it was my own version when someone released the radio program 'War of the Worlds'. So recently I received this movie again to see by realizing that my favorite actor Joaquin Phoenix is ​​in That (also known as Leaf Phoenix) I can tell you that I'm laughing in an amazing part and laughing harder in the show. I mean, when Andy is in space, she moves slowly. Have you ever noticed that I don't think being in space will make you speak slowly or think slowly. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Andy is knocked out of the oxygen tank and starts to float back when the safety door closes. Little Max tried to pull her in. Suddenly, we approached Max's face while he yelled. (In slow motion) "Whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?" I have no comment.
