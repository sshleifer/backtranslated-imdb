In what would be his first screenplay based on his own short story "Turn About" William Faulkner gave a strange story about loyalty, sacrifice and really strange relationships. Originally, this was only a character on Tone, Young and Cooper, but MGM needed to bring Joan Crawford to another picture to fulfill her promise and Faulkner needed to create a female role. Crawford insisted that her stripes be written in the same style as the young and her shared voice, which led to a lot of unintended hilarity when the three were communicating in shorthand like a telegram. Which looks like a sketch of Monty Python in Semaphore). The sentence that has almost all meaningfulness seriously makes Ernest Hemingway read like Henry James. <br /> <br /> This film also reflects the familiar theme. Faulkner's close relationship with his brother and sister, "Temple" and elsewhere) When Young offered Crawford a place with a tone instead of three engagement rings In their childhood, the rings were exchanged for others. The intimacy of the tone and sound is also noticeable, especially when they go out to the fate of Thelma & Louise. Frankly, it's creepy. <br /> <br /> Not creepy for this New Yorker. But is a recurring pattern of Wellington's large cockroach, which Crawford caught cheerfully. Must turn your back!) And Young becomes a warrior. Blech <br /> <br /> being said to have some good performances In particular, he also participated in the scenes in which he took on the Cooper fighter plane and Ross Cogans was happy as Cooper's plane friend. The voice, though he cannot express through realistic conversations But having a good time, causing him to tears, bursting over the fate of his girl friend Crawford was removed from a meaningful dialogue, mostly found to be a balance of wood or drama for one role. <br /> <br /> Battle scenes - not surprising for movies. Howard Hawks - - is the most exciting part of the whole picture But not enough As far as I'm concerned, this is 75 minutes in my life. I won't come back.
