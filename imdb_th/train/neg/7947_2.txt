When I saw this film on FearNet, I thought it would be a scary movie. Obviously it's not. I do not know how this movie was allowed to be shown on that site. FearNet is a website that shows horror horror movies. <br /> <br /> The performance is great from every actor. I hate this The story is stupid. The movie begins with a scroll man whose seal is stuck. He destroyed the seal and some disasters occurred. The water turns into blood, the ocean dies. The moon turns red. <br /> <br /> The female characters are annoying as well. Many things that you do not make sense Like when she saw a piece of paper with a date By chance it was the day that she expected to give birth to her child and she became curious about it and began researching and asking people in religion what it means. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler notification * <br /> <br> Two of the worst things that happened in this movie were the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that God told him to kill his parents and the end that Demi Moore died after giving birth to a child. Her and her The soul into it, <br /> <br /> This is what happened. The moron has been shot and killed and the revelation will begin. Demi Moore entered the hospital in the middle of a major earthquake and gave birth to her child. She touched her son's head, transferred her soul into the child and died. Then the revelation stopped. <br /> <br /> Why did God suddenly change his mind? He was very angry when the governor allowed him to execute a person with mental disabilities. He was a forgiving person when a single woman transferred her soul to her child. <br /> <br /> * The spoiler ends. <br /> <br /> The movie is rather stupid. This is the religious end of the world propaganda. The performances from Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and others are excellent. That's all there is. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 2 stars out of 10, a good performance with many nonsense!
