Memorize the memories of Geisha as a beautifully filmed movie. And the performance was excellent, at least in terms of how the characters were shown while they were being scripted. <br /> <br /> However, many details, both small and large, are just _wrong_ that bother me too much Can enjoy it fully A small detail that shows the type of lack of sensitivity is one scene. (There is no such thing that does not spoil anything.) Mamaha emits a bell that hangs at the door of the house where Sayuri lives on a snowy day. The sound of the bell that she sings is Furyin or the wind bell - that's just hanging out of the house in Japan in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes do not have a doorbell - they just open the door and declare themselves. (You may think that this is a small detail, but I would like to say that the movie created about America with a Christmas wreath hanging at the door in July and no one thought anything) and don't make me start at all. In a completely wrong hairstyle given to Meiko and Geisha, which is a Pan-Asian / Chinese style / Kung Fu-Ish, which is vague and nothing like the real thing I think this is the attitude of the warriors to the culture that they are trying to really communicate in their attitudes and portrayals of people and situations. <br /> <br /> So I think the more you know About how Japanese culture and the world of geisha and meiko in Kyoto (which is "Miyako") so I think you will enjoy this more I think this movie is probably much better ... as it is, it's just "The exotic version of Japan" of Hollywood
