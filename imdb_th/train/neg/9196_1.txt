This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only positive thing I can say is that it's so terrible that it's funny. First, there is no plot. The actors seem to read the cue card and do the stupid things. Like being chased by the dead But still want to go out and look for their friends Zombies are terrible, no matter where they are as close to Romero's work as those who have received movies. And the most stupid part is that they still show flashes of video games, respectively. Action Like we do not have video games about shooting zombies, 20 people know how to use automatic weapons and shoot targets without even aiming the gun. And the way in which people die stupidly It's like a bullet, so stand and wait to jump. And when entering the corner in front of the house, they ran out of ammunition instead of shooting the door open, so stupid. With a second chance The worst movie I have seen for many years. Movie B on movies is better.
