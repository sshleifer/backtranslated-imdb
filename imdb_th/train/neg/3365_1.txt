Poor remake of the year 1963. This classic started well enough, then replaced the special effects that were messy and pointless. For example, in the original, the coldest moment occurred when Nell and Theo slept side by side in a double bed, listening to the fear of the sound outside the room. Nell tells Theo to release her hand because she hurt her. Then Nell looked at Theo, who was several feet away and realized that No, Theo held her hand. In the latest version, Nell lay alone on the bed when suddenly she jumped out and jumped over the floor. It was only when she said that the invisible power stopped to pull her that we knew what had happened. And everyone can explain the meaning of Nell's last words - "It's about the family. It's always about the family." <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature is the performance of Lili Catherine Zeta -Jones shows again that under her appearance there is a little depth. In the traditional way, Claire Bloom introduces her lesbian persuasion thoroughly. However, Zeta-Jones must spell words, for example by asking Nell that she has a girlfriend - or a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Of course one person should be sent to a cemetery that is pointless
