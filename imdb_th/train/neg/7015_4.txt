"54" is a movie created from the famous "Studio 54" in the 70s - Hangouts for the upper classes in society and party groups. In this film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character based on the real staff of the studio from 1977-1982. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that it has a spark and style and no substance. It tries to be a dirty and very detailed word, such as "Boogie Nights", but eventually meets as a humble person. Mike Myers gets a merciless mission to play Steve Rubell, the owner of the cocaine club. It's just a little funny role, and if this is Myers's best effort to enter a drama like Lemmon and other comedians of that era, it's a complete failure. <br /> < br /> "54" should be clever, interesting, but it's just a flick of a stupid teenager that doesn't entertain or participate from a distance. Look at your own danger.
