This film is another good example of what Jerry Bruckheimer, since about 1997, seems to be the best in the film one year before the film is released I'm not a movie critic. But this movie can be predicted as it comes Every comedy effort, every effort at the moment of touch and pathetic effort in the love story is what I predict in my heart. Do yourself a favor and save your money in this one.
