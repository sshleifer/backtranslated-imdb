This is another great screen for the US TV program during the sixties. It's an amusing story. But it is a very good formula. Intelligent Martian landed on Earth and found a man that was not too bright. In his view, <br /> <br /> The usual weirdness happened to humans. Help him to return home All the way he received that girl is Hannah. <br /> <br /> This is a great outside for a cute Hollywood star that I've never seen before. Stay <br /> <br /> Satisfying. Some free time. If you don't have anything good to see.
