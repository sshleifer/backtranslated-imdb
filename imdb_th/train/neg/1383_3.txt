Lame, cliched superhero action drivel Movies I have high hopes for this movie and the type of action actors. HK's playmate is someone I didn't underestimate. But I hardly see that the story is boring and laughing. This story will be forgotten because it is usually in this type of movie when the compensation act. Unfortunately, it's not. That action has a trademark, surreality and, above all, of the actions of HK, but it does not involve a very disgusting matter, and in reality it is not completely incoherent. (Perhaps this is because of a new revision Place of patchwork) I'm very disappointed.
