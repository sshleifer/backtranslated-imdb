I read the positive reviews of this movie and was very surprised by the horrors that occurred. As a story about AIDS and the story of "Ghost" / "Blithe Spirit", some of this movie can't make it true in what it wants. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark are a couple. Gay men with "open" relationships - Simon can have anonymous sex. (Although it is safe) on the side when he wants Mark is HIV + and he and Simon seem to have no sex life anymore When Mark died, Simon, a habit of closing emotions after being rejected years ago by his father, tried to erase his memory and just received a bachelor's degree. Regardless of his behavior before Mark's death is very different. But Mark comes back in a form of horror and foils his works while Simon opens and accepts his true feelings. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Simon is the one who selfish Most of the movies By the time he should be more sympathetic, it was too late to take care. On the other hand, Mark follows the footsteps of Demi Moore from "Ghost" by crying abundantly throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a strange switch in tone after Mark returns. Trying to cripple with jokes, TV shows "Sek", but that's not long. When Simon's emotional health is at risk, all things become bigger and more with an amateur effort that will twitch you. The ending, along with the angels, the golden male muscles that mark tears for heaven, while the chastened and grieving Simon waves, bye, are amazing because most are not deliberately funny.
