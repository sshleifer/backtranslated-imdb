I may give more credit because it's Halloween. I am at "Knott's Scary Farm" and I feel like watching a magical Halloween movie. <br /> <br /> Oh and it's the price. I am one dollar. <br /> <br /> I tend to ffwd through movies like this to go to "good things" but I resist the craving here and I'm not sure why. Obviously, from the opening, this is not a "real" movie, not even a movie. B There is a lot more in the category of "horror" movies of DeCoteau, such as "The Brotherhood", which was filmed in a 50-cent movie watching video In fact, I was scared for half a minute. One of his college boys. In his pants or something) there are no cut pictures (too expensive to set up multiple cameras) and flat light but ... it's hard to identify There is something refreshing about watching the director who doesn't have money pulling out of the half-movie. The fact that he made half the commendable work and the film had a merit share - the performance wasn't bad. The shooting was quite good. (If too bright to be scary) There are some surprises and things ... different. <br /> <br /> There are a number of college kids. (Unknown cause) stuck in the warehouse where they are decorating the annual haunted house The creepy old man gave them the book of Satan and they accidentally called the power of hell. This resulted in the people in the haunted house becoming the ones that were created and caused many chaos and human suffering. In the way we are treated to complex lesbian relationships and weird ideas - it's interesting that this pair seems to be the most harmonious in the movie. Yes there is sex scene But it is not disgusting - or at least not more than you found in a legal movie about lesbians showing that they have sex It is quite unusual for a horror movie that takes time and effort to do this without having to turn to cheap exploitation. <br /> <br /> Another thing about this story that makes me interested. Is it trying to imitate "Stupid boy who has sex and killing" the aura of the 80s slashers is difficult to do because there are many movies that already exist. I'm not sure if it's good or bad that these filmmakers try to create a new program in that style without the irony as if it were still a lively genre. But I admire the effort. <br /> <br /> Which one is the reason I sit through it; Sometimes you just want to watch horror movies that are free of cost, no budget and horror stories. There are too many settings, not enough blood holes, endless holes and clich√©s, and the unfortunate overall feeling of a movie that doesn't have enough money to be a movie that the creator of imagination ... but at least the scene. Haunted house is quite cool. I will pay to go to that haunted house if it exists and don't mind paying the dollar to watch it on the DVD, even if I don't see it again. <br /> <br /> Oh and ** Spoiler Possible bowlers ** But there are wonderful synopsis about the girl vampire in the coffin: "I've been a lazy person. But i've changed "haha, a good one
