Murdered by the leader of the Mettati (Anthony Francis) Derek Kaieller (Dennis Cole) ends up in the showdown, right next to Frankie's brother. But this is Derek's least problem as a corrupt government agent. (And the fecal mob) Col. Burgess (director John Saxon) is using a prison as a test area for a new virus. This is the only chapter that Saxon directed during his career. For men who work with a lot of directors, there is only one person that he has received advice from others that it is a cheap Italian. Of course, it's a low budget. But unable to excuse stilted scenes, gaffes or clumsy performances during the first 15 minutes of his credit. The Crusaders made it a little bloody and he worked in a hilarious nude scene. (Our leader fell asleep during a prison riot for a dream about a female scientist) Cole, who looks like Jan-Michael Vincent, is stronger as well as a tough lead actor and Franciosa, a terrible carpet sport - Give him as the leader of an ancient group The end will take place at the Bronson Canyon, which is the favorite location of Marty McKee. Retromedia released this DVD as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE.
