This movie is really bad. It plays in the paranoia in the cities of the 70s / 80s and makes it into the school's context. I'm not saying that city crimes are not a problem for many people or schools. / Not a problem area. But this bad exploitation requires biscuits. That violence is beyond reality as possible. But in this case it is not a case of social problems But middle class and white elites use it to transform themselves into the most important crime. And of course he knows how to play the system The sound is unfamiliar. Yes. This violence is a serious exploitation which is really disgusting. It is a disturbing cruelty that is created as a social opinion. This is in the same category as trash. Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and more. The only amazing thing is that Michael Fox is poor when he has to do this.
