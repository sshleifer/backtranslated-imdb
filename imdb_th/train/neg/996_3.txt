Revenge is one of my favorite themes in the movie Moreso. "The uselessness of revenge" is one of my favorite themes in the movie. When seeing Gaspar Noe's reversal (2002), I expect to have a more relevant expression of this theme. This film turned out to be a weak effort in which there is nothing to show except for movies that lack confidence and focus. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * The last scene is a rape / torture scene for a man-man. Unreasonable Found nothing less than rape, revenge on women However, this film does not follow this issue. But the scene was pulled out (Which is far beyond the brutality of the first rape, both at the level of which it is a graphic and what it was ritual) was crowned with Dawson's face in an expression of regret or No need to fix anything. "While the rape of her rapist was continuously heard in the background, <br /> <br /> My problem with the scene is not shocking. But one of the confusion about such graphic scenes Try to jump to the audience I mean, do we feel bad about the rapist? Do we rejoice in Dawson's revenge? Are we disgusting all the cruelty of it? Do we feel the moment when Dawson is sad? In addition to failure, this film is a film with more style than content. The characters are thin, boring dialogue, etc. <br /> <br /> Normally I try to shoot movies according to my own condition, but Descent doesn't seem to know what it is.
