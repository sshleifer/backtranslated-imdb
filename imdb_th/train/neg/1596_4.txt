Not one of the better Pokémon movies. <br /> <br /> Two legendary Pokémon come into the story. You will see how strong Celebi is, even if he changes evil for the first time. <br /> <br /> Suicune appears But he didn't have that power. <br /> <br /> The robber can't. There are no strong pokemon except taranitar? Some scenes of fighting with his Pokémon might be better Fog, I think it will end. But she didn't get close I see this in the credit. <br /> <br /> Don't expect anything from here.
