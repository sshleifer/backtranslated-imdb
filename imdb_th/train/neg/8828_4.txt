Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) heads to his local Jindabyne, a fisherman in Australia during the weekend of relaxation, recreation and relaxation. But when Stewart discovered the body of an Aboriginal woman downstream in the river, things seemed to be the worst. The largest number of deaths on weekends is general men. They didn't climb out of the valley and instead go fishing on weekends with a great catch. Then they headed out and reported the body. <br /> <br /> The city and the life of men became a mess. Local media grouped them and accused of traditional prejudice from local indigenous people. Claire Stewart's wife (Laura Linney, the eviction of Rose's evil) feels a deeper meaning of what his husband and friends do. But must fight it through her mental illness. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this chaos Is this young woman's life, which is now a media phenomenon spread out in the morgue sheet Her subsequent murder and dumping was a symbol of things under the city of Jindabyne: black and white men and women, society and evicted <br /> <br /> Others who seemed to understand Something that happened to be two children: Stewart and Claire's son, who was led by half-Aussie species whose mother had been killed a few years ago. The girl lives with her grandparents and tries to let her mother do the best thing possible and discovering a new body. Looks like ?? Strange enough? How to achieve this goal? (Again, the stream of Jindabyne is anticipated) <br /> <br /> Everyone and everyone in the Jindabyne district feel that they are under the water. But they are not willing to dive The water is cloudy and looking around (the symbol here is seen when the nearby lake is used for recreation and swimming. It is said that there is Jindabyne's old town under the surface). <br /> <br /> This movie is interesting if you are too confused. There are too many stories that need to be explored and it is not successful. The thread is too loose. The performance is ok. But the shooting was terrible The camera is shaky, grainy or dark, and just general dirt affects the overall production. <br /> <br /> I enjoy movies that symbolize NORTHFORK as one of my forever favorites in That vein But Jindabyne wanted his head above the water to be turbulent in order to see his own problems which didn't happen.
