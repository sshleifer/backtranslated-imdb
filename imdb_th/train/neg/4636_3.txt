The "secret" is intended for Pickback with the popular appeal of the famous magazine, while the form of labor fraud is tied to the topic of today's parliamentary investigation. However, even though there are B-grade film actors and have ideas about good screenplay But this movie took 73 minutes. It was a cheap jack production along the way. What is needed for poor production settings is some imagination, especially from director Sidney Salkow. For example, shooting in the daytime will help alleviate the continuity of boring studio sets. Stylish helmsman, like Anthony Mann, may do with thick ear materials, but Salkow treats it as just another day-paying exercise. Unfortunately, the traditional button layout of Brian Keith did not work here, being just wood and lethargy. At the same time, the Elisha Cook Jr. figure went up when drunk Obviously, Salkow is not an actor. But you have to give it to Beverly Garland, the little man who performs her duties with vitality and dedication. Terrible that she was not responsible. My advice - skip unless you get a ridiculous bar girl that doesn't do anything other than making whiskey back in the 50s.
