I remember I saw this cartoon when I was 6 or 7 years old. My grandfather picked up a video of it at the mall I remember that it really sucked. Unreasonable story I hate the fox that became a friend of Casper. He's so stupid! Casper cried out if he couldn't find a friend. What? Get more! The only good part and I do not want the sound to be lively means when the fox is shot and dies at the end. I laughed my head away in the payback because this cartoon sucked a lot. The bad news is that the fox resurrected and became a ghost. I hope he is dead I think I gave this video to someone because I hate it. No wonder they offer free at The Mall. If you have children, don't let them look here. They may agree with me that it's terrible.
