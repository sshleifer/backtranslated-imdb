Oh God. The idea that this movie is a thriller is a joke for me. In addition to the point that it seems to be written by the age of 5, the plot of the show and even the scene and filming of this film is disgraceful. <br /> <br /> I don't usually Criticize this movie because everyone has their own style. But this movie may be the worst movie I have ever seen in 2008. I can honestly believe that this movie is not known and I think it would be like this because the movie makes horror genre. Funny /> <br /> I recommend to everyone who is a big fan of thriller or even just a movie away from this story.
