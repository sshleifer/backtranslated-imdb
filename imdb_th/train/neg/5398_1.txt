This self-destructive regulation may make kibosh in Mr. Branagh's career a Shakespeare adapter for the cinema. (Released 4 years ago, not the first change) I just watched this thing. The cable - the holy gods are terrible. <br /> <br /> I agree with the examiner's feelings below that. Said Examining something obvious and gruesome, sad, is an immoral act. That being said, I would risk, if only because of * the love of lost labor * is the perfect reward for those who overrated Mr Branagh's directing abilities in the past. Branagh is a lovely director, always starred (He loves American stars But love yourself more, making sure he gets all the good things) <br /> <br /> The sad truth remains that * the love of the Lost * workers is hardly worse than the scramble * Hamlet * that is full of horrible blood since 1996. Actually, this movie may be more suitable if only about 1/3 length. Branagh decided it was a good idea to update the first job. The bad of Shakespeare to match Cole Porter's environment, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, yada yada. So he put this in 1939, leaving the eighth message of the original text in favor of the standard interpretation of the thirties. (Wait until you see the actors lift the wires up to the ceiling during "I am in heaven") and the actors cast an unknown actor for their dance or singing (including themselves). The result is a terrible surprise that they had never heard before. He didn't call something scary to stop looking at what happened after watching the first issue. I didn't blame the actors. In the transcription of Hamlet "The screenplay is a story!" No one might come out well in the Hodge Lodge: RSC's famous alumni are not more likely than Alicia Silverstone. Who will do this thing? <br /> <br /> Branagh's first mistake is when he thinks * Love's Lab's Lost * is a valuable play. Trust me, it's not It is unusual in the precepts of poets that are expressly written for the court-educated band - not the general audience he wrote. So there are many valuable vocabulary plays (and TEDIOUS!), Referring to contemporary academic nonsense, the parody of Lyly * Euphues *. In other words, the material hardly attracts a broad audience. Hell, it doesn't attract audiences who like Shakespeare's comedy. Can not play the scene without severely cutting the text and "update" violently with the incoming mechanism. What questions are bothering? <br /> <br /> Branagh's second mistake is thinking that Shakespeare's creams can be served with the side commands of Gershang's orange jam. Win Obviously, the idea or hope is an elusive Elizabethan exercise for modern audiences by managing ancient American pop culture that misses their necks at the same time. But again, this raises the question of why bothering <br /> <br />
