This movie is too bad to believe. I saw it during the San Francisco Film Festival 2004, before the movie theater owner got up and told us that half of the audiences left the theater the night before. "World Premiere" I don't think everyone in the theater will understand how bad this movie is. We all understand at the end. <br /> <br /> It's not a documentary, even though it's being sold alone. Dark Angel is a bad biography and is a homage to Bettie Paige, which is half of the film's only old movie production of Bettie Paige. The film is only 90 minutes long and the content of 90 minutes is too short to say the least. One scene will begin. Then someone says "Wow, you're a great Betty. Why don't we create another movie?" Followed by a 5-minute remake of Bettie Paige, which was almost ridiculous. (And more boring) the normal part of the movie At the end of the movie, people laugh every time the movie Bettie Paige is created. It was ridiculous. I hear a lot of laughter in the cinema. But people don't laugh with the filmmakers, they laugh at this movie and the content and structure are bad. This is easy to say that the piece that will get the most laughter is the piece that should be serious or open. <br /> <br /> I know movies are expensive. I have seen many independent films that are cheap. In any way, the film and the quality of this film make it different from anything I have ever seen. The movie seems to be created for $ 12. Wounds, graininess and lack of tempting plot make this an unforgettable experience. This movie makes "Dude, Where's My Car?" Looks like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> My friend and I left the theater as if we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured. The only thing that was exchanged for experience was that we had to laugh about the fact that someone made this movie and thought it was good Obviously the night before was the night of "The world premiere" that the director / writer / producer visited and saw people laugh and walked out to see his movie Bettie Paige's movie was destroyed. They should destroy this movie too.
