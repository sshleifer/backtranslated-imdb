This is one of the most stupid movies I've ever seen in bad luck! I should expect after seeing the first two. But I was still sucked into this type of film with the idea that "They may be able to do this at the moment." No - not closing. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? With special effects ... to let you know that SFX in this movie, at one point the soldiers were shooting at "Raptor" as it ran along the path Despite having less than one second of the screen, viewers can easily see that it is only a human with a tail that is clearly attached to him. Running around is not good, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> What about acting? If that's what you can call it There is a character that I think should come from the south. However, after spending six years in the South, I never heard of this method. Maybe he has a strange disability - can't speak normally. I find it interesting that the character doesn't do anything that requires him to have that accent - so there is no reason for the actor to try to do that. <br /> How is this story? It is quite basic - Raptors escape. People with guns must hunt them. I began to wonder why the dinosaurs in these films always seemed to run into the nearest tunnel system ... Will they not go out for hunting? Oh, at least they have a good feeling of appearing very little in the movie that should revolve around them. <br /> <br /> Other things - assuming you are in the building and you know there are People are eating food Raptors run around it. You decide to take the time to argue who is better - Army or Marine? And then decided to have an arm wrestling match to pay or not How about the silly ideas that they have to follow Raptors - separated into groups of both. Did they ever watch any horror movies (or at least the episodes of Scooby Doo)? In short, this is one of the stupid movies out there. Miss it if you don't want to groan through the movie.
