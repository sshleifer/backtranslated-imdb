I watched this movie, didn't expect much, I got it in 5 movies, all of which were terrible in their way. For the fighters, what can I expect? And you know that what I said was very bad for them. This movie has a few interesting points (And a few more) occasional good-looking video camera views, drummers are like drummers The problem is that it's so boring that what I can think of is that trying to create tension doesn't happen much, and when it's the most boring. (I have a quick thumb. The forward button is ready to be pressed for most movies, but let it go) and seriously, as the band's lead singer looks good because they don't talk about half that he is so beautiful. A little bit, all this and I haven't talked about the murderer. I'm not going to find it. It's not worth explaining. However, as far as I'm concerned, Star and London are the only reason to watch and except London (which is actually quite funny) is not because of their acting ability. See much better Avoid the best if you don't want to see dry colors.
