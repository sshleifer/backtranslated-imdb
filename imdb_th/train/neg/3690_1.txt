Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is a movie that caused him to fall. It was released with a lot of hype but severe failure and putting severe financial losses for manufacturers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to recoup them personally for the damage that occurred Soon after being released, he tried to enter politics. But failed miserably It's a very bad movie with horrible performances, low quality makeup and pathetic screenplay throughout the movie. Rajinikanth looks like someone suffering from certain diseases. I was one of the unfortunate souls that saw Baba on the first day of the first performance at the theater. The audience was bored that they mostly left the theater before halftime. Sorry, I won't recommend this person to anyone.
