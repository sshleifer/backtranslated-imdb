Roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee were kidnapped by intimidation while going out shopping one day and bringing them back to a quiet island where these girls were reluctant to tell the gangsters they visited last time. When they were ten All of this is just a movie that is a long way back about the first time women go to the island and later fight with the same meat-eating family. <br /> <br /> This is a scary thing. So much for everyone involved Point out that I started to feel bad with Hank Worden, a poor person who deserves much better. As far as I don't like "Barracuda" (on the same DVD), I have to admit that this movie makes one look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: One pair of nipples (they may be Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <br /> Dark Sky DVD Extras: Vintage ads for food on various drives. And trailers for "Bonnie's Kids" (nude feature), "The Centerfold Girls", "Part-time Wife" (naked feature), "Psychic Killer", & "Eaten Alive". The DVD also comes with "Barracuda". In 1978
