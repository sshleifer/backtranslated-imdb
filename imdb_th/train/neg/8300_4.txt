This is the sequel to "A Christmas Story" that was originally called "A Summer Story". Ralphie described his family's adventures during the summer when they moved to a small town where no one was. Unfortunately, the hilarity does not occur. <br /> <br /> The original work because of the unresponsive and honest nature - everyone can relate to it. This one is silly and not funny. Charles Grodin's latest film - not surprising! It is one of his poorest roles. I feel sorry for him. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen does little things, everything is a recipe and you have to wonder why they have to bother <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and I mean, come and go - compete with spinning tops or not! Sadly, it's the best part of the movie ...
