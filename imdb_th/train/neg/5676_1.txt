This movie shows clips of live animals cut by a machete and being torn by the skin. I know that these terrifying things happen in the world. But I'm watching a movie from the fact that what I'm watching isn't actually happening on the screen. These live animal clips are not in the movie. But is intended to show people that it is the organization of some organizations that will help the horrible things that humans have to do in other species I also contacted Netflix and other sources to collaborate to bring this movie out of the market !! <br /> <br /> This movie should be removed from the public. People who make this movie need psychological help.
