I have many problems with this movie. <br /> <br /> It has basic information about quantum mechanics which is normal. Although quantum physics has been in existence for over 50 years, the film presents this information in a great way that seems to say that Not really These things do not reveal the revelation to the world anymore. I am familiar with quantum theory and the fact that the particles must be explained by wave equations, etc. It is not a new matter. <br /> <br /> The main problem I have with this movie, however. Is the way these people use quantum theory as a way to provide a scientific basis for magic and spiritualism I do not have any serious problems with magic and mysticism. But the quantum mechanism is not related to these things and it should be separated The people they interviewed for this film started with the concept of quantum theory, and then say that just thinking about things you can fix around you, so we should think positively so that Have a positive impact on the world And make our lives better That reason is completely ridiculous and the conclusions are not based on reason from quantum theory for "experts". Everyone that they interview for this movie has physicists in accordance with the theoretical principles that will not completely agree. They will point out quite accurately that the unpredictability of the world. Subatomic does not give support to the mystical ideas about our spiritual connection. <br /> <br /> It disturbs me. That people will go to watch this movie Because it makes them feel good The main thrust of this film is based on the misinterpretation of quantum theory, and it is not good to justify as an attempt to show the religious organization that has <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, at one point. One "expert" said that since the past history, the most hypotheses that people have made about the world become false. So the assumption that we hold on to the world today is likely to be false? That is not fully followed And even if it was so, I didn't see how it would help his argument I mean, if his thoughts become general assumptions, I think we have to assume that they are false for their own reasons.
