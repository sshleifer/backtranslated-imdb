This movie must be the worst story I've ever seen in the DVD story !!! The story may have been clicked if the film had more funding and the writer would cut the ridiculous scenes and scary scenes that I warned the parents very much in .... but the story was like a loose cannon If there is one thing that is driven by the creator of this film, it will happen from that story, it reminds me of many quickie movies that were released in 1960. Writing and filming is not good. /> The characters that fit in the whole movie are bartenders and beavers. The rest of this movie could be easily created by a middle school child. I rated this movie 1 story because it was really bad and left the whole family with the feeling of being cheated. My advice - don't watch it !!!
