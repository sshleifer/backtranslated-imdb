This is just plain scary. I read this book for school. I do all the tests and look like this! My teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch and it was worse than Leonard, Episode 6, Plan 9 from outside the world. What makes this movie so bad is there is enough reason to want to commit suicide First, it's done on Hallmark. Second, the performance is terrible. Third, it's like completely different from the book. In fact, it's terrible. I ask myself to make excuses. Basically, I would rather watch Basic Instinct 2 than see this. Get my advice. Don't watch this movie. No one wants to see it. It's scary, scary!
