I didn't feel like being raped like I had done with a fascinating Christmas. But Belle's beautiful magic world is still the opposite of beauty and the beast. Like Christmas, BMW hates the audience, though not at the extreme level. It's ugly, insecure, terrible, and very bad writing. No matter what works This is not the character that we like from BATB. They are a group of people with pods. I want to cut it off But after a few minutes, I gave up because no one in their right mind would be serious about this. There are three things that we have here. "The perfect word" is the study of forgiveness. "Fifi's folly" can only be used if you agree that Babette's name is really Fifi and she is a James Bond villain attached to the closet. "(Or" Broken Wind "as I want to call it) should be the most evil group When do evil creatures hate birds? Don't watch this shit - every copy of this video should be burned. BEAUTY and THE BEAST are still classic movies, a wonderful celebration of love, art, wisdom and human spirit
