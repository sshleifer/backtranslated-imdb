Don't be fooled by big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. Their scenes may be filmed in one day. No matter what motivation they have in this film, if you have an actor like James Wood, you should use him to be useful. For me, this is a sign of bad direction passing and passing. The story is not bad. And performances from most actors are above average Cuba Gooding Jr. is a very scary person. He was unbelievable that I almost laughed at his amazing scene. And because this means that it is a serious movie that cannot be a good thing Action scenes are not bad. But they lack a special punch to make it more exciting Need better direction again In addition, the wrong spacing for movies like this The main character spent nearly half an hour in action. For a 90-minute thriller action that is too slow The only rewarding factor is Angie Harmon. She did everything best. Terrible that the director left her. Yes, this movie should be much better with the best director. Andy Cheng lacks much experience as a director to pull it out. And for the action coordinator / stunt of his abilities, you expect to have more exciting action scenes Don't waste time with this thing. Avoid!
