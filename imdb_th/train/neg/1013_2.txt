If you watch this movie, you know why I say "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" hehehe !!! Every time they say "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I laughed, thought "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why I rent this movie"? I can't believe how the Academy Award winner Freeman and Spacey appeared here, while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the WTF screen, Dreaful Timberlake! I think people like Joshua Jackson should be able to do much better! This work is perfect for Joshua Jackson and believes me that I'm not his fun person ... but I like actors more than this robot, not Timberlake. And his girlfriend is shallow, shallow and annoying like hell I am happy when both of them appear on the road. <br /> <br /> The story is ok and I think Dylan McDermott serves his bad guys very well. This movie is fun. But I think Timberlake destroyed it all It would be fun if there wasn't him. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the music is ok. But suddenly, every time the song appeared, this movie became a MTV video clip with flashes, low movement and various things. Something was wrong that I thought the police movie. Maybe they want to create a MTV video clip for Timberlake.
