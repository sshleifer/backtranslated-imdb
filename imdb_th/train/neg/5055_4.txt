Two years ago at Sundance, I liked Josh Kornbluth, who directed the debut - Haiku Tunnel. So I waited for his brother. (And frequent collaborators) Jacob, the best thief in the world This is a drama about children that seem to grow in the low-lying areas of New York. The movie is not in a painless moment. But at times, it is as though Cornbluth works too hard to identify clearly: life can be difficult for some people. And life is not fair. <br /> <br /> The deeper and more important is our understanding that despite the cultural nasty things and anti-social behavior they may lay eggs Goodness and humanity We can shrink in their language and living conditions. But we cannot reduce their intent And in fact, struggling to keep the family under such difficulties, there are noble nobles that most of us hardly admire. Cornbluth grew up in this area and his sympathy for people Clearly, <br /> <br /> When speaking all this, the best robbers in the world suffer from painful flaws. The characters are not very convincing. Writing is not smooth And the plot line is almost invisible And for many of the most disturbing people, Kornbluth uses two black boys to mock rap gangsters during various scenes. For each of his people: but while I did not ask for the possible truth of this phenomenon, it caused me to see a 5 year old boy of the same age and talk about having sex with women. It is an unnecessary shock and is a borrowed interest.
