I just watched this movie yesterday. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend wanted to see Richard Gere only. <br /> <br /> I felt that I wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend. That it was the last time When we go to watch movies, just because some actors / actors are there I hope you will learn the lesson because I have trouble keeping you in your seat. As for me, since I paid, I want to see the end, at least in the hope that there is something better. But I didn't hold my breath and fortunately made me a victim of this movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a black and white film. It's black and black. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost bad. As far as his registrar and every sex offender are showing that they are criminals that cannot be redeemed and the villains among them are really bad. Speaking of ancient thoughts and exploitation from the fear of the United States in general, <br /> <br /> Richard Gere's performance is as good as usual. Unbelievable for this event, <br /> <br /> The film tries to take advantage of popular themes and makes it cheap, dramatic and exciting. They use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap, violent acts of murder, vigilante, rape and torture, which are almost unreasonable. They have wolves attacking people in the movie too - how much will you get? <br /> <br /> I gather this movie, will not come out in the US and will go directly to the DVD. That is something that should be in other countries as well, but because it's Hollywood and Richard Gere, they just have to show it. Believe me, without the Gere, this film is not worth the B series.
