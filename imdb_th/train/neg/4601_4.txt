I don't know anything about the writer or the previous work of the director, so I didn't bring prejudice to the movie. From the short description of the story in the TV guide, I think it's interesting. <br /> <br /> But the unbelievable thing is overlapping. Each round of the plot seems to be an excuse to draw horrible or special makeup. <br /> <br /> The score is professional and Kari Wuhrer looks like a good actress. But the rest is disappointing. It's a positive offensive. <br /> <br /> I won't go through a variety of lectures. But I will give you an example of what I think is a clear excess Before (Wendens) left the deep freezing, McKenna killed Wendt by biting his neck. He now feels that he must destroy the evidence of his participation in the death of Wenden. (What are the police going to do to measure his bite radius?) McKenna wrapped Wendt's head and neck from a frozen bag in it, using an ax and started cutting off Wendt's head. Wender's neck The air was filled with a hard-to-fly nugget, one of which fell on McKenna's head (he brushed it out when done). McKenna then brought the frozen head outside to light a small fire. He created He put his head on the floor, crouched beside him, took a photo of the woman he had just killed and showed them Wendt's head. You always like the fire, right? "He asked. He then put his head on the fire. We have just seen the burning. But we can hear loud noises in the flame. <br /> <br /> I don't want this type of garbage to be censored. I just wonder if anyone enjoys seeing this thing. <br /> <br /> There's no reason to go with the rest of the movie. I will talk about one example of "Uncertainty" Since I brought the idea up, McKenna was kidnapped and trapped in a dark cottage. He knew that he would be crushed halfway to death the following day. (He was invited from heaven to do). What will you do in this situation? This is what McKenna did with what could become the last night of his life. He found a calendar that had been dropped along with the young woman's legs and saved himself (successfully), giving him the freedom medal! <br /> <br /> The monster that looks like Pizza Hut is thrown into an unnecessary event. The camera is usually held by hand and shaky. Conversations have similar lines that "Life is part of SiS, otherwise it will be the best in all possible worlds. It depends on your perspective." The use is made from a wide angle lens that transforms ordinary faces into garments Oil The house exploded with a fireball exploding at the end, while the McKenna hero came to us in the foreground. <br /> <br /> Some of the heroes he is like He killed the first man with $ 13,000, beat him several times with a heavy statue, then a potted plant before placing the refrigerator all over the body. (This disturbs him a little. But not enough to prevent him from paying). Then I hope I will receive a direct order. He will kill Wendt by tearing his neck. He then accidentally killed the wife of his first victim and blamed Heaven for it, even if there was almost a moral calculus. They didn't have anything to do with it. From then on he was honored (Baldwin) still alive. Then, when they were both disabled with less weight, they made them explode deliberately even though one of them was not sympathetic. And we should take root for McKenna. <br /> <br /> This is not a dead cartoon like Dirty Harry, both bang and you're dead. These things are slow and painful. The first one - murder for $ 13,000 - made awkward enough to look similar to what might happen in real life. It is not easy to kill another human being, because Hitchcock showed himself in Torn Curtain, but that scene was not of any importance. <br /> <br /> Some people may enjoy this, especially for older children. Enough to think that pain and death are the only things that happen in the movie Some nasty things on the screen here.
