Friz Freleng's 'Speedy Gonzalez' is the second cartoon starring the character of Robert McKimson's Cat-tails for Two. In that cartoon, Speedy is an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth. But from his second appearance, the famous design has already been used Although it seems to be more handsome, Speedy never developed into a character much. Huge hats, enormous speed and Mexican accents are not classic characters and that is Speedy, all he has to offer. However, the cocky little mouse is very popular and remains a star in a lot of shorts, including the deepest movies from the studio's post-modern era. While these early Speedy shorts were better than cruelty later, which he often paired with Daffy Duck (quite strange), they still left a lot of demands. As the name itself, Speedy was recruited by other mice to steal cheese from them from a local factory that was born to be protected by Sylvester the Cat. Although he added weight to the star, turned to cartoons. But Sylvester's role here can be filled easily by other cartoon cats. His personality is affected by being forced to guess. The role of the hunter This is always a problem in Tweety's comics as well, but Speedy behaved wickedly with gratitude for the arrogance, disgust, and apparent impossibility of his arrest. Old poor Sylvester will be forced to appear with Speedy for many years. Although it follows a pretty basic formula and has the least laugh, but 'Speedy Gonzalez' wins an Oscar and happens to be an unworthy star.
