If you have to judge from the movie alone, the committee that provides the musical "A Chorus Line", Pulitzer Prize and Broadway audience who keep the war horses for 15 years of work are all heavy drugs. This movie is definitely not. <br /> <br /> The thing that anyone thinks that Richard Attenborough is the right thing for this material entirely surprised me. But he created almost all musicals about movement Clay cube <br /> <br /> Not satisfied with the original score as written. Originally, people decided that what the movie really wanted was a brand new song that zipped the movie. So we were attacked by the Oscars (!) "Surprise Surprise". Surprisingly, the surprise of the song was foul and the movie too. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
