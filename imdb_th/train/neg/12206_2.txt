I do not see much reason to see this movie in detail. Sylvester Stallone was once again the author and survivor of the "A Season in Hell" John Rambo, who was chosen by his only friend, Major Richard Crenna, to return to Vietnam secretly photographed American prisoners Camp and come back without involvement with the enemy. <br /> <br /> Fat chance if he doesn't do anything more than secretly filming and sneaking away. Who will come to see the movie? <br /> <br /> It's a celebration of Stallone's muscles. Prepare for his mission, we will see his muscles bulging up. (They are oiled and puffed throughout) There are fasteners on black leather, ugly guns and even ugly knives. The clean black gun is cleaned with loud noises and almost oiled like Stallone's muscles. The bow has been tested and has enough numbers to drive the bolt through the enemy's forehead. <br /> <br /> Stallone and one of his prisoners of war were cleared by a suit or two from Washington. The cynical politician who you can bet has never even fought. With a punch Grammar school Dare you know? Just sit down on the table and drink foreign beer. <br /> <br /> Movies do what they should do. But what it should do is have manners It was intended to keep the legend that was popular in the mid-1980s, with countless MIAs kept quietly in the tragic camps by North Vietnamese people. The bumper stickers are widespread (liberating our MIA). Why are they keeping them? Never had reason But may cause the POWs to become slave labor force - in countries without resources other than labor Or it may be because of their propaganda as a tool to humiliate the United States - a propaganda weapon that Vietnamese people kept secret from the world. <br /> <br /> As a prisoner, Rambo was treated in the Middle Ages. In the north, Vietnam dipped in his neck with pork feces and pulled out of his wrist. His muscles were still shown. Then, dissatisfied with the South Vietnamese man, the Russian authorities were brought in to play as Gestapo officials - "Vee haff vays make you remember." Russia is a person who uses advanced technology, psychology and electricity, not just throwing pigs. > Rambo came back and announced that he intended to drift away aimlessly until "This country loves us as much as we love", resulting in other myths that veterinarians came back from Vietnam to fight and regularly swear that is the reason why I think we have been elected a lot to Parliament and Appoint another person to a high level position Candidates for the three presidential candidates lost in the group that were insulting at least the pointless Rambo floating in the open room for succession which arrived soon. <br /> <br /> Action movies with Javanese. Sayers and Willis and others, walking through the swamp of evil ideals, killing mercilessly, can barely speak. Speaking is a sign of weakness.
