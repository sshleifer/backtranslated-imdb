I watched only the first 30 minutes of this thing and what I saw was all shit. The scene I saw was bad like Edwood's movie. No, it's a hundred times WORSE. Ed Wood has a reputation for being the worst director. But it is not true The idiot that directs this garbage is the worst director. <br /> <br /> American police have a German accent! "Police station" is a desk in a warehouse with a sign "Police station" hanging on the wall. There was a clear fist fight by TEN FEET. <br /> <br /> This police pulled the woman to the wrist and brought them to the warehouse. He told the police partner to wait for the car. Then he came out of the warehouse carrying luggage. The police allies thought that there might be something wrong that his partner might be a bad cop who was killing these women. But he wasn't sure what had happened because he was a moron! The conversation was very stupid. The performance was terrible and the characters were stupid expressions that I had seen on the screen. Obviously, the police partner clearly saw that he had kidnapped these women illegally, and they slapped them and brought them into the warehouse and returned to the car with bags that had bodies in them. Forever do not know what happened! <br /> <br /> The director of this movie is all hacking. I stopped watching the movie in 30 minutes because I couldn't get it again. Must be one of the worst movies I have ever watched and I will not waste any more time writing this review. <br /> <br /> Absolutely worthless
