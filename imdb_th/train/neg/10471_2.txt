Quite frankly, the Omega code is the worst movie I've ever seen for the first 30 minutes. I sat on my chair trying to decide whether to request a refund or not. But since I didn't pay to watch it at first (via), I thought I might be as well. And I don't think it's going to be worse. <br /> <br /> It's done. I'll run through the low point quickly. (Including some spoilers): The scary ridicule of Casper Van Dien as Gillen Lane, an inspirational speaker with two PhDs. Inconsistency classification; For example, Lane, despite his credentials, is a complete nitwit. Then there is a depiction of the fulfillment of incomplete Bible prophecies. We saw many exciting news groups with ridiculous computer printing of translated Bible texts. There is also a terrifying "action" scene: Lane escapes from a difficult situation without explanation and the only time Lane appears to be in danger, it becomes a dream sequence! It's cute for the assignment of high school writing. But it's a forgiving plot device in movies Bad pacing: After opening for a long time, the first three movies will change the scene every 90 seconds later. But there are too many unnecessary jumps And as others say about the past year, no one (Not even the youngest daughter of Len) Age is frustrating. <br /> <br /> There is something good. Movie quality (Like lacking) is high and very attractive The outdoor image is very well done and the shooting in the place adds realism. In addition, there was a short time in the final part of the film when Lane demanded that God (in the end) help him - this thing proved to be very exciting - for me, someone who didn't accept Jesus as a savior. But I like this because it makes me a true scene in the movie. Unfortunately, it can't be understood. <br /> <br /> The characters, the dialogue, the direction and the performances are not good. Michael Ironside didn't do anything and Michael York was strange. I think the producers want to do it. too much If the story is more tight and more focused, and the appearance of the movie is even better Do not pay, of course, to see this. I gave this star ** from ten stars. <br /> <br />
