The bad news is that it's still really scary. I give it 2 because sometimes this kitchy parody looks like a real joke. <br /> <br /> It should be better. "Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker" and progress should be rewarded. Or maybe I might drink heavily when I watch it and feel generous No matter what it is, "2" <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it is too fast. Must use elements from the main theme of Kill Bill I & II and the scenes to fight hacks. They dumbs them down, dirty, interacting and squish all the mess in about an hour of really awesome amateur videos. <br /> <br /> You should smoke the most powerful thing if you want to enjoy it and get this DVD back to the video store on time! You will really hate yourself if you have to pay late fees.
