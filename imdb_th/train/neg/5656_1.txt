Ziab la ta'kol al lahem is a horrible movie. This is just an overlay that doesn't have a clear link. The performance is terrible even with good actors such as Ezzat El allayli. But there is something amazing in this movie. Is talking about sex, liberation of women, nude scenes that are very rare in Arabic theaters, even today I congratulate the director and actor for their courage. We want to see more of this style in Egyptian movies. But with better quality The reason why I voted for this film is not only But is a situation and show only But still lacking professionalism This movie looks like an amateur, we can see many errors on the screen. If you want a good Arabic movie, Ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not a recommended movie. But if you want to support all the unaudited movies in the Arab world, see and make your friends and family do the same.
