Despite the overall satisfactory plan and expensive production But still wondering how the director can make many cultural mistakes Where is the Japanese wardrobe and cultural advisor? Not in the payroll. <br /> <br /> One of my Japanese friends laughed out loud in the cultural nonsense that she looked before. In later conversations, she said "Imagine the Finnish director who created the Fnnish film about the American Civil War using a blonde haired Swedish actor as an allied army and France as the Confederates. Even worse, imagine a red woman Disappeared from the shackles and sports hairstyles in 1950. Perhaps some people in Finland may not know that the hoop skirt is "lost care" or known as the strange Jane Mansfield But in Atlanta, they will not believe their eyes or ears .... and laugh in the corridors ... wonderful stories and photographs must be cursed. <br /> <br /> So ... See the memoirs of geisha that are painful for everyone who is familiar with the cultural differences of real geisha or Japanese dresses and That's the topic of the movie! Hollywood is amazing. In the perspective of making movies, they often get a lot of money while giving details that are embarrassing to embarrass the movie. I think "The Last Samurai" is the movie's success Good Japanese in Japan Memoirs of the geisha are better and worse at the same time.
