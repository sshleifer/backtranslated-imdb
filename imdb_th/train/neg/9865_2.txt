I picked up this movie in the hope that it would be similar to the hilarious "The Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is a highly recommended method). The boy is really disappointing! This film was filmed in a fake documentary style that was famous from the office. But cannot deliver Part of the reason came from a strong performance. But mostly writing and directing. Actually, it can be a joke to use all the ancient ideas about role-playing games. But here it is done in a very predictable manner. At the beginning of each scene, you know what "funny" will be. But perhaps the biggest problem is everything shown above There is no subtlety in this film if there is an explanation. "Laugh now" or a fake 80s laughter track. Cheap. It won't make much difference. In some scenes you can't think of "Yes, I understand why they think this is a joke." But the way that was executed caused a joke.
