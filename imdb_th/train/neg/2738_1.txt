Trash / bad movies are usually not bad because I will find them fun. This one is so bad that I can't explain it - under "Bad". There are instructions on how to start a movie that tells you what to do during the movie. Need to say a dozen commands and a beer can't help me sit and watch the whole movie. One tagline compared to KILLBILL. This one, which is definitely unthinkable and is clearly insulting our intelligence. This tagline plans to tempt you to buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you are considering to Rent this DVD If you are thinking of buying, don't think! If you are unlucky with this DVD, don't play it in the trash immediately.
