For me, this is a story that begins with a joke about Frank's girlfriend when he travels with the stairs and when he sits at a business meeting ... The problem is that when you watch this movie for an hour, you see the imagination / situation. The same joke over and over again It is a prediction It can do more than the TV that you can go out and come back without missing anything. <br /> <br /> I like Felix Hearngren as Frank. But that's not enough even when it's funny. Some styles and messages for our audience .... <br /> <br />
