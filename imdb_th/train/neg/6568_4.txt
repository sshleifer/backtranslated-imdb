It wants to know that the two stars of Meet The People are a pair of movie stars that enter the new television media and become a bigger success and both enter the end of production and have entrepreneurial status on the page. Small screen However, Lucille Ball is not an important actor with the television for Dick Powell. He wants to make a movie like Meet The People and the salvation of his career will come in the next movie. <br /> < br /> I think the only reason Dick Powell made this movie is because Young players from MGM received a special number and he met her at that time. His personal time with June Allyson is better than what we see on the screen. Powell looks boring and can't call any emotions. <br /> <br /> He might be tired of doing these dramas with plans that Stupid as he ran from Warner Brothers from the original show Meet The People, not acting in the book. It was a new series and ran in the 1940-41 season at Broadway for 160 performances. When MGM bought it, they destroyed everything. Like except names and pages The title The remaining scores are combined from various and varied composers. There are no memorable songs. Strange when you consider some sources from Burton Lane, EY Harburg, Harold Arlen and Rodgers & Hart, these people have to make the trunk empty for the material. <br /> <br /> The story looks better than musical propaganda. Most of Powell is a songwriter called Meet The People and he is a shipyard worker who won the lottery with the movie star Lucille Ball. She is interested in him. Both are interested in new costumes. But creative differences make them different until the end That is a summary movie. <br /> <br /> MGM provides a great musical performance with Powell and Ball, which is the main reason for watching Meet The People. The big bands of Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones are here. And the highlight of the film for me is Bert Lahr dressed in a suit of a wholesaler such as Lou Costello in the dream sequence of In The Navy. Heave Ho song written by Arlen and Harburg, author of Lahr Courage number from The Wizard of Oz That everyone in the world has seen that movie, you have ideas About Heave Ho as well. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell's next movie is Murder My Sweet, which he eventually offers at a price that doesn't like musicals and Lucy has to wait. Television before the world can see what she can actually do
