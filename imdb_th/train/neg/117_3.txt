It's great to see my favorite stars 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They look great, but that's it. They don't get good characters or work. I don't understand or don't care what the characters are doing. <br /> <br /> Some of the little girls' roles, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp, are quite good and confident in their little friends. Showing some talent and sadness that they did not perform in a better movie. Sadly, I do not think Dorothy Stratten will have the opportunity to perform in this important film role. Stuff <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have fans, and I was very open when I started watching it. I am a big fan of Peter Bogdanovich and I like the latest movies of He "Cat's Meow" and his first movie from "Target" to "Nickleodeon", so I was really surprised that I could hardly wake up to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a story. Ridiculous that this movie is about Detectives Detectives and customers to get involved with romantically-five years later, Cybil Shepherd Bogdanovich, a former girlfriend of a popular series on television. "Moonlighting" to steal ideas from Bogdanovich. Of course, there is a huge difference in this series that uses a lot of witty conversations as it tries to do with slapstick and a few screwball lines. <Br /> <br /> Bottom line: It's not "Paper Moon" and "What Up, Doc". Very pale version only.
