My friend's heart and I only saw movies from the title. It's cute, even though it's clear about the plot and direction - you know that this movie will happen within the first five minutes. My main fight with the plot is that while still being patiently consistent, they never explain the things behind the characters. A father with an alcoholic mother who works too hard, a sister who is stressed ... that is a bad family. But apart from the occasional mention from the sister, there is no conclusion yet. I'm still confused with the scene with the bottle ... It looks quite random. <br /> <br /> Writing is the second story . Children are not bad actors But their script left a lot. Demanded Unfortunately, what seems to be a cute nook movie was pushed out for special effects, blah, crippled script and a clear story.
