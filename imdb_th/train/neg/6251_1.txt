I can only participate in the first twenty minutes of this low price movie. The most obvious absurdity is that while American prisoners in North Korean prisoners of war were suffering from severe food and drug deprivation without having to bath Continual torture - they deal with flawless hair With the exception of Harry Morgan looked elegant as the major casting and acting is great. Ronald Regan doesn't seem to be able to stick to a single character show. But it turned out to be a combination between the former role of schizophrenia Most Caucasian actors show that North Korean camp staff may be forgotten. But when the Russian authorities acted as advisors to the Korean people, they wore a new Nazi uniform. Speaking with accents like General Burkhalter from the Hogan Heroes. That's just six kinds of stupid. Don't waste time on this.
