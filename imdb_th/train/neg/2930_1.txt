I like English humor. I believe it is one of the best in the world. I like almost all British sitcoms (okay ... maybe not Monthy Python. Some jokes are great. But some things I don't understand) but this gentleman's league is good to make you sick This show performed well in some way. It helps to lose weight because watching this garbage makes me feel like I'm not hungry anymore. This was disgusting, not comfortable, and not even funny on TV shows and I wondered who really laughed at this thing. It's very disgusting. Look at the guy dressed in yellow teeth and urinating on the car ... I mean ... how funny is it about that ??? It makes me want to puke No humor, just disturbing the picture and cheap. The bathroom laughed ... I don't know ... If you like this ... You go ahead ... look at it ... but say exactly. This must have emotional problems. Garbage.
