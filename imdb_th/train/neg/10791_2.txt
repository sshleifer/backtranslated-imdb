The movie is terrible if there is a Turkish movie that you should avoid in 2006. That should be a banyo. Waste time In addition to the cheap pair of laughs, this film is a success, nada, zilch, nil. The conversation is cheap and the sexual idea ends. The director needs to watch more movies before trying to direct himself. Redhead women show examples of what actresses should not do. If you are interested in learning how not to do this thing, a perfect example of a bad show. The only good thing that I can say about movies is waiting, waiting. Nothing good I can say about it. I must not like to write this story so much. Jeez!
