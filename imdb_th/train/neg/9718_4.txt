The innocent man (Steve Guttenberg) stood with the boss's wife (Isabelle Huppert). One night, she saw a woman (Elizabeth McGovern) being attacked from the outside. But she could not call the police because it would make her marriage to the boss of Gutenberg (Paul Shenar) Came forward and claimed to have seen the first attack, only intended to pass on the information received from Huppert. Well - never had a false witness to slander your neighbor as They say, <br /> <br /> This simple effort to help the police catch the murderer quickly turns back. When he met the first victim near McGovern, she quickly caught up with what happened immediately. But agreed to be silent for a moment one (Not that it's important because after all, he never saw the creep in the first place). The plot received a real labyrinth. Survived the arrest of Guttenberg and McGovern, leaving plans to put up with the murderer. She will act as a bait. They will follow a sharp creep in one of his horrifying haunts, and McGovern will act like a doxy that the murderer is attracted to just trying to kill her. But everything will be ok. Look, because not only Guttenberg will watch her closely and not only But he will alert the police a few minutes after she enters this dive. But she will be able to collect useful scepter cases. <br /> <br /> May I ask you to see if the situation is resolved? Elizabeth McGovern has an interesting bone structure. Sometimes she looks like a lower jaw and a small mouth. But she is lively Steve Gottberg has hair on the muscles and that's about it. Otherwise, he couldn't do anything like the character he played. If Isabelle Huppert is able to perform it, it's not clear in this movie. The killer was created and it seems that he wears a mask that has an unusual shape in the Twilight Zone about the greedy heir. <br /> <br /> Not a director, Curtis Hanson. "Whether or not this is a well-done job Here everything looks clumsy and planned down to a small part before the inevitable climax of the uniform. The police in the uniform will be introduced to McGovern's delay and the scene. It's embarrassing. Dick Olsen has a small part as a shopper. He is always a reliable and reliable man. Paul Shenar, as a cuckold husband, has a distinctive face that seems to be built on stage and he works well. <br /> <br /> Connected at McGovern attracted the attention of the murderer she played with the pool. Two hairy monkeys were shot in a bar in Carolina Beach in North Carolina, not far from where I live. How to set up the interior is clear that this is a dangerous and dirty diving spot. Actually, it looks rather elegant on the screen than in reality. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is Hitchcock's territory and tears flowing through the eyes to imagine what he will do with this.
