I can't believe that this movie was not educated. It's like watching a police institution except with people who don't have a clue about what they're talking about and ... wait, there's a silly robot that should be a close friend I can understand the suspension of unbelief. But this is just a complete folly. Not only will there be no plan for this movie. It's like watching a person pretend to be a doctor, throwing a non-medical term as if they were the chief of staff in an important medical facility. Including people wearing clothes that are not suitable for space programs I felt that I was watching the movie "b" in the valley of the girl.
