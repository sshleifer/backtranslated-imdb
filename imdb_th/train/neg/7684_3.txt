This film is only to prove that every movie created in the Hollywood era should not be overlooked. Just because you have a great band performer doesn't mean that this can beat the script that may be written by chimpanzees! Think about it - this movie presents Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall, Charles Boyer, Gloria Graham, Lillian Gish and Paul Stewart and still a bad movie! The basic evidence of this film is not bad - the private psychiatric hospital that the staff is drunk too much for the patient! In addition, sub-plans related to husband and wife who are overworked (Widmark and Graham) have many promises. However, the script was handled with the skill and agility of the drunken buffalo - by raping and walking along the top scene over and over again in the movie. In fact, it is like a drama less and like a terrible episode of "General Hospital" This movie is really subtle !! Actually, this movie will not be! <br /> <br /> While most of the reasons that make this film a scary script But I also blame the producer. For example, Paul Stewart may not be a household name. But this actor has a special ability - especially when playing a gangster in the Film Noir movie. Stewart is also regarded as a bias without bias with a strange European accent - it doesn't work because This is outside of his performance and his character has not been developed and has dimensions. Moreover, Charles Boyer looks ridiculous and completely helpless. Seeing this great romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heart of America looks strange. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is quite scary. It looks a lot in the train crash. But it is not very beautiful My wife and I don't like this movie very much. But felt that it would be great if the writing was competent. <br /> <br /> PS - In the case of imitation of art life, Oscar Levant is one of the patients. In real life Levant wise spent most of his life both inside and outside the institution.
