I think this would be a much better movie if Cajun received a more credible role. My family is from the southeastern region of Louisiana and I live in southeast Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I have never heard the people I grew up speaking like these people. Being shown to be a narrow-minded person behind most Cajuns that I know are well educated, proud and don't listen to anyone when talking about how these people do. Overall, it's an ok movie with great scenery and music. I understand that writers are from Lake Charles and have knowledge of the area. But for the love of everything Chan Chan please let the actor study the language, live among the people you play Before you try to act like them In my opinion, when the actors make you believe that they are the ones that are more fun!
