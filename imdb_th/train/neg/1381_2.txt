Non-violent spoilers are available here. I destroyed this movie to help you not have to be hard to see. <br /> <br /> Jet Li's movies fall into one of two categories: Shaolin movies and movies, which are located in modern Hong Kong. Revolve around triads or triad like organizations Each category has the best and worst movies. `Twin Warriors 'is Jetle's best Shaolin era, while the' evil cult 'is the worst of his` Fist of Legend' while in The past is the best movie Jet Li, the `Black Mask '. No doubt it's the worst thing. <br /> <br /> Jet Li plays the exiled mercenary who has been injected. Making him superhuman "New Life", his exile he plays librarian peace. When his old mercenary team walked out, Jet Li became a vigilante to stop them. He wears a very stupid corrugated mask to hide his identity from the police (and the public) as a librarian, including concealing his true identity with his old friend in the arm. <br /> <br /> Which I saw was dubbed and scary Why did Jet Li hold his hostage, his library and colleagues if he was calm? Have a love story between them? Why is the police chief not interested when he learns about the true identity of the black mask? The story is BAD. Normal. Poor in terms of being a superhero, not good. In the sense that the characters are not properly developed, not good in the interaction of the characters, all filled with stories that explain half the story. And the sequence of battles is a superior way Blood, lots of blood (The vastly cut body parts) Explosions and human-style martial arts in the Matrix Fire style are in this movie. Unfortunately, this is the best movie and a selling point. If you want to see Jet Li playing a super hero in the movie Mission Impossible `Black Mask 'style, given to those of us who left Jet Li fans, it was a real disappointment. This is one of the films that Jet Li has never been to. Jet Li: He doesn't have the opportunity to charm us with his special abilities or the opportunity to impress us with the ability of realistic martial arts and <br /> <br /> Usually, the fall of the Chinese like Ozzy Osbourne would be enough for me in one movie. Sadly, the 'black mask' proved to be an exception to the rules. the Indeed, the film's antagonist, by the way, he dress up his long straight hair and trademark spherical sunglasses. It seems Ozzy Osbourne is more modern and older. However, the villain is not on the screen long enough to make the mechanism valuable. I suppose that the image of Ozzy is intended, in addition to the villain's appearance, he also runs the hideout of Satan. There may be many more that are made from the villainous mechanism Ozzy Osbourne! If only the writer, director or anyone who cares to give the background and develop the character of the villain in this movie, <br /> <br /> `Black Mask 'is the first Jetle movie published in United States after Lethal Weapon 4 and I am glad I am away from it until now. It may destroy all my perceptions about Jet Li as an artist and a fighter. If you want to see the worst jets for rent, "black masks" and "evil doctrine" and make it a feature or two horror, both intentionally and unintentionally. Otherwise, next to the movement that uses the ability of Jet Li and plans to think well and have a 3/9 reason
