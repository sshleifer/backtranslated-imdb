Madhur has given us the movie Chandni Bar, which has been powerful in the past. His next movie, Page 3, is one of the worst movies of all time. Obviously it tells the story of the nobility in India. After seeing the scene in which the man forced another man for sexual reasons with a star in the movie I felt like spitting and destroying the DVD. Incidentally, I made the reason that the film had child pornography scenes and assault. Indeed, I vomited and was shocked when I saw a movie showing a naked boy. Very annoying things, do not need to show the children to see all the nudity. One of the rich likes to kidnap poor children and sell to foreigners, British men in this movie. I was shocked to learn that this movie is a hit song in some parts of India, otherwise Super Flop in the UK, USA and Australia. I am from the UK and this kind of thing makes me sick, should not be released in the UK.
