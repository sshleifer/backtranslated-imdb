I hate plane movies falling ... they all! In fact, I hate them all with passion! First of all, they look cheap and have no crafts! Secondly, they insulted the airline industry and spoke to the audience that all planes were ... dropped out of the sky and broke! <br /> <br /> Why am I startled with this movie? This may happen to all of us and the consequences are even worse than the characters that have suffered from such films ... which is the only cold aspect of the catastrophic yarn of the line. Fly like this I hate this movie because it's like a chaotic movie, 50,000,000 stupid planes before! Freefall is like all other scenes: nothing more than boredom before the scandal drama scene takes place. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have the same traps of death that fly. This: the third Cleaver-esquire family, the yuppie baastard and the flight attendant bitch with a big blonde hair from 1987. Scolding anyone who is the least afraid! <br /> <br /> My second hand is this. It shouldn't be a full movie. But it is a documentary that describes everything about the incident in Air Canada "Gimbli Glider", also known as "Freefall", as per safety precautions /> <br /> My third and final hand Stay with all size airline movies (except Fearless). Why did the steward order the passengers to take off their shoes? (I can understand the high heels and the sharp objects that are loose, but c'mon!) As well as making them safer now! This plane, if they (passengers) don't know anything: know that they're going to collapse. Why do you have to force 100 injured people to fall on the rubber sheet, which may cause the skin to peel and bleed when struck only to walk in their stockings on the scrap field! Is this reasonable for everyone? <br /> <br /> ABC series "Lost" is deeper and more realistic than facing an air disaster. "The plane is malfunctioning - people panic - the feared guardian becomes a land. In the pedestrian zone without shoes and jackets, etc. The old shit from the airport 1975! Freefall is typical of air strikes that I almost expect to see Charlton Heston or Peter Graves explode in both the damn cabin We may see how these bad characters return to normal, instead of those who rejoice in the tragedy that is occurring at their faces. Moronic Lifetime movies are generally cheap and stupid! <br /> <br /> Director "Freefall" should stick to a movie made for a cheap TV with a white middle-aged woman with a silly teenager who makes drugs and has a marriage problem. Wondering ... leaving it with a professional ... You hacked. Why do we have to sit and watch each other for more than an hour and a half as Wannabe Airport in a new format? Like this anymore If this was like the ABC series "Lost", it would be something to watch. But this is some shit Stop changing every disastrous movie to become "Airport 1975"! This is not an "airport". This is a pathetic waste of my time. I will not recommend this movie or the air disaster movie created on TV to anyone who is not even my worst enemy.
