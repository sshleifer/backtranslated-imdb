The House of the Dead is the worst movie I have ever seen between the pathetic 360-angle camera of the Matrix and the wonderful visual performance I sleep. I don't think the director and manager can decide whether it will rain or not because there will be rain on one side of the boat and not rain. I will rate this movie from 1 out of 10 (10 is the best and the worst thing). Jumping scenes from movies to games is really annoying, making you wonder if they're going to waste time or not. I ask anyone who does not see this. It's not worth the time.
