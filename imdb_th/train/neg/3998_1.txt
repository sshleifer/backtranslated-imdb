Can you say "All shock, no plot?" There are many unexplored directions in this film. No history about other rooms than death * Why is it evil? What makes it so? Why the countdown "hour" then there are things that are not explored that hint. For example, we see the camera in the vents he talks about. But when he climbed through the vents without a camera, <br /> <br /> All the ghosts looked "digital" and things "flashed" before slamming the floor, making a loud noise ... When you combine all those things together, it makes the room 1408 look like a high-tech home. <br /> <br /> Oh ... by the way ... Electronic devices didn't work in the year 1408. Okay, except TV ... Mobile phones don't have signal, but wireless internet works well. You can increase the number of interruptions. I'm sorry. But this movie doesn't have anything but "Shocked after the shock" it had done before. Mirror image Things that just left the website Changing the painting of the bloody wall "Oh, it's just a dream ... not like that." And if the room is "evil", why our main character agrees with the death of her daughter if it makes him Stuck there forever? It's not reasonable. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is no background information about "The first book" that he wrote contains only obscure information about "Father, Twitch" and others. What did he say to his father? "You will be in my place." <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a real horror movie. It's a factor that shocked the 100% adrenal gland without new effects or innovations, and of course there is no history of character development, etc. <br /> <br /> My overall impression is movies. All were built in "cheap"; Quite a lot, using one set and two place pictures and nothing but movies, effects of magical reused effects "Seen before"
