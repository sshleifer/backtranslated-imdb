I don't know where to start. The performance in this movie is terrible. I can't remember seeing many 'actors' in a movie that can't be played, not just bad performances. The characters are incredibly stupid as well. <br /> <br /> Then there was action. I believe that even children know when someone is shot. But when someone was shot in Snitch'd for ten (!!), no blood at all. Well, I guess that's just me. <br /> <br /> To make short stories. (Because believe me, I can go about this movie for hours) This is no doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie should be number 1 in the top 100 without a doubt.
