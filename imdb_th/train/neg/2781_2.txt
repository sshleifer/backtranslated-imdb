This film is a movie that tries to tell Thai history which is located in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this movie because I thought it was in line with many Thai movies that I watched and enjoyed one with Thai actors who speak Thai and martial arts frenzy. Is not so This film was filmed in full English, filled with Anglo actors and had very poor production values. It was terrible to laugh. But not funny! Who can we blame for this garbage? Most of the dialogue and scenes are quite poor. Some battle scenes seem to be designed by local high school drama clubs. Most special effects are not good as well. But there are only a few cheap animations that have been put on the screen that gives the magic effect series But when we saw the two armies clash in battle - ha! As a joke! This film has a few beautiful things. It's a pity that they don't show more skin anymore. At least it should be something that people will appreciate. Don't bother.
