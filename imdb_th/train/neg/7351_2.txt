Sometimes you have to watch bad movies to appreciate good things. That is my opinion This one will always be in the movie category that is not always good because all But the performance of Shu Qi is terrible. <br /> <br /> Martial Angel tells Cat (Shu Qi), a professional robber turned his back after she loved Chi Lam (Julian Cheng) two years ago. But her past came to haunt her, while Chi Lam was kidnapped due to the ransom of the security software that Cat's company is working to save her. She calls her old friend from her orphaned day, six women. That Mizza, others, to help that day ... <br /> <br /> I might tell you a brief story, but this is a wonderful story. In fact, all the scripts and directions are not quality. Most conversations are meaningless and have a thin paper-like plot of rice in the water. If I can conclude, take the bad Jackie Chan movie, remove the joke, remove the budget choreography, and you have Martial Angels: a formula that has no imagination. <br /> <br /> Your heart. Due credit and Shu Qi may be the only person who has been hurt by the horrific act because it is her performance that shines through. Ok, you can't say that she's great - after all, she has nothing to work with - but she can dig out her personality. Other than that, only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin made other impressions - although most of these things were flickering and very short. <br /> <br /> In other places, this movie just broke into pieces, scenes and conversations. That is incredibly unnatural and has a noticeable special effect at a cheap price without having to try to clean the edge between the person and the mask of the blue screen. And the direction I saw from a lost dog. <br /> <br /> I guess this movie is too much for the chef. Most budgets were blown away in the enthusiasm to have seven babies on the same silver screen. That doesn't leave much. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the way to create this movie is like a cheap porn movie that doesn't contain pornography. Charlie's Angels aren't like that. In fact, while the sisters can do for themselves, there is no clear thing here. <br /> <br /> Definitely one to forget.
