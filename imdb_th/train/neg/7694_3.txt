If you are under 12 years old, this movie is not worth it. Obviously, it is a budget movie that has actors B and has a fantasy genre that sometimes requires bad CGI. I know it's not good when I rent it. I enjoy laughing in bad movies. I don't know how bad it is. It can be received until after the 2nd hour. Then it will start to burn literally. The fighting style between the normal battles that follow the laws of physics and the battle with the lines. There is no real explanation for the change. It has a plot, but again it's a children's movie. It seems that there are clear moral lessons of the day being broadcast, such as Sesame Street or something. It can be received But better if you speak nine
