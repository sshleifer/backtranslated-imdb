This movie is like real life, which I mean - there is not much going on in 2 hours or more, and there are not many game plans or plots that are not often seen. (Their invisibility is caused by the light of "experimentation". Many reviewers say) <br /> <br /> Not bored. Not surprisingly, Altman controls this song. (Yes, we all love "Gosford Park" but "Pret A Porter" everyone? Kansas City? Dr T. and Women? Aaargh) But the truth The material is the tale of John Grisham and the great actor that you can recognize from the melancholy of your sleep - the film's masterpiece. Not really good And no, it's not "bad." <br /> <br /> It's terrible.
