By the time the film was released, I had seen the Chorus Line on stage 4 times and was expected to produce a movie that had been rumored for a long time. My wife and I are on the line hours before the box office will open on the day the film was released. It's not just a disappointment. But it was a kick in the stomach. <br /> <br /> First, the story is "Move outside", so say, combining scenes that are not in the scope of the cinema. Those boundaries are a large part of the meaning and impact of the story. <br /> <br /> Second & third together. (Define your own order): one of the original songs with dynamic dance numbers removed; Songs that are not in production on stage are added to say what? I'm confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is to appreciate the talent and hard work of the actors. Now I see the Chorus Line on stage 6 times and won't mind seeing it again 6 times before I die. It was written superbly, with great music and a true heart story. If you want to watch a musical which includes an excellent "Cow Call" audition, I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the story of the A Chorus Line, look on the stage.
