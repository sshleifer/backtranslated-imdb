I am seriously looking forward to watching this movie because it seems to be getting attention from the upcoming attractions: Jim Carrey, who is powerful like a god, is the absolute idea for me. As a big fan, I'm sure he's the best person in his composition with credible evidence and what's wrong? Yesterday, my bubble burst a big blow for both men and women because I watched movies <br /> <br /> the first performance. (It was established that he hated his life, he was a disgruntled employee and a camp that was extremely unhappy with an ax to crush God). (Which he was called by God through the phone and receiving powerful power) is a very good thing - Carrey has enjoyed his new 'toys' and it is a pleasure to look really funny. But the third scene was too bad for faith. <br /> <br /> The rottenness began after the dinner scene between Bruce and his girlfriend, Grace. (Jennifer Aniston, who fell out very well in this movie The plot of the device, even though her name is unreasonable) - She thinks he will ask questions. 'But it turns out that he told her (At the knees bent) but eventually he was given the position of his announcer. <br /> <br /> She didn't think so She wanted him to marry her, so she let him watch, even though she still loved him so much, and the rest of the film spent a lot of time fighting us with a pathetic head - after that I prayed. Pleading as well. In order for it to pass, <br /> <br /> I don't think that lack of intelligence in the first two actions (Example one - in Act 2, after he received his power, Bruce came into the singing room. "If God is one of them We are just as dirty as one of us ", blah blah blah) and I am willing to overlook a number of remarkable conflicts thrown at us (for openers, Morgan Freeman - / k / a God - Told Bruce that he could not violate anyone's free intentions But he did this very much) Those options were forgiven - this is Jim Carrey's comedy movie directed by Tom Shadak - it's not The Remains of the Day. <br /> <br /> Or is it Joke When the author loses track (In the scary action scene 3) and trying to change the process to become a comedy (joke). What we get is hell on earth. Bruce recognizes the error of his selfish approach. He realizes that GRACE is to save his life - having to say - Grace and priorities in his life have been severely misunderstood. However, all of this can be transmitted in a much less serious way. This film doesn't have to go into the dumper to create these points. Unfortunately, the writer and Shadyac clearly knew how to edit the story in a clever and light way, so they followed the path that they thought we would not notice. They also caught something that was not surprising to use at the end, with the hope that this would help reduce the bad taste. It didn't work for me
