The only redemption quality of this movie is the real story ... otherwise, this movie is terrible. The performance is terrible and the design of the scene is wonderful and tacky. The story is good, but it's very difficult to watch because of all the horrible performances. I would not recommend watching here ... The only redemption quality of this movie is that the actors are attractive ... especially Ryan Bauer, who plays the drama. Some corrections do well. But there are continuous errors all over the point ... I just got bored and tired of watching bad gay movies ...
