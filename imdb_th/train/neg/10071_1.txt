I saw this movie at the Premier of Sundance 09 <br /> <br /> Because American Beauty is a movie that has something to say, I hope to get a towel. Unfortunately it was a disappointment. In the reality of countless movies that I saw at almost ten dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance movie I want to go out from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Trouble The worst of Towelhead is clearly the origin of the collection of "provocative" related to cultural patterns rather than organic human drama. The screenplay comes from the same novel by Alicia Erian. The famous words of Edith Wharton are in my heart: I never knew a novel that was good enough to be good even though it was adapted to the author's political views. The observation was devastating, especially for Towelhead because of its political views. It was old and simple. If there was a time when Towelhead's male villain presented the image of black people, the ironic treatment of foreign culture, etc., with freshness, it has passed for a long time. <br /> <br /> For more detailed review Any professional reviews are available online. Almost every rate of this film is not good and revealed shallow and distorted tissue. It will be on the other hand. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, amateur examiners seem to be easier to leverage. When you read reviews on this site and similar websites, you will find the ultimate: "amazing" "amazing" "super cool" "shocking" ... it makes me embarrassed to read them but It didn't surprise me. In fact, I met a lot of people who seemed to be involved in books or movies related to racial, cultural, gender or sexual issues that had a deep, dramatic movement, thought full of insight. If you are such a person, rent a towel and move it. On the other hand, if you set your standards higher, you can pass on this safely.
