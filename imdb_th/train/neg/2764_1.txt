First of all, I don't know how this movie makes the screen big. It is not a cheap SCI-Fi movie, but it is terrible. Me and my friends who love action movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR etc. go to watch this movie, hoping that the movie This will be a Transformers with all the dragons that we get is one and a half hours. CG is not as bad as I expected. But the story is terrible, along with acting In general, it's a Chinese dragon back every 500 years ... Does it sound like the new creation of Rain of Fire? No, the plot tries to be deeper than it should be, leaving not only But the plot of the hole But with very little real magic and war between the dragons (Quite a snake) it's just ridiculous The director tried to add a little humor to the failed movie. Me and my friends laughed throughout the story. (Including all 5 viewers) and do not believe that we spent money on this short trailer on TV, made up for most acts while shit makes the rest I've watched many B movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider and others, but I have to say that if you want to laugh, don't stop for an hour. See this story. <br /> <br /> Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I don't drink ... but it can help before watching this movie.
