I can't believe that I had lost five hours of life with garbage. The presentation five days earlier by this author is very fun and I look forward to doing this. But most conversations are not fully understood. Suranne Jones is the main villain since she is not fluent or fluent. But the rest of the actors follow her example The notable exception is Bernard Hill and Ann Reid, the old staker. The manufacturer doesn't listen to production before airing to make sure that the conversation is heard or not? As a result, I think I forgot what had happened and because the original plot line seemed to change according to the standards they and us between Muslims and the rest I lost interest The ending is the perfect anti-climax. Complete fool
