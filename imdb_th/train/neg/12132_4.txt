The three low-aged criminals led by Matt Dillon lead the burglary late at night. They escape, but quickly cross the path with the newly formed police to chase the terrorists. Of course, the police misunderstood that the gang had stolen. For the terrorists, the real terrorists fled and the burglars were forced to take refuge in a small bar. And guess who has chosen the bar as a holy place for the night? <br /> Unbelievable <br />? Certainly, and from there, Spacey received great acting talent, Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen and M. Emmett Walsh. But they all wasted. Mostly because after all the characters were stuck in the bar, what they did during the rest of the movie was arguing. Endless and pointless Long before the conclusion of this film, you will stop the things that happened to them.
