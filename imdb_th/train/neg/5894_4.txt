How many centuries have passed until the horror film about Japan / Asia abandoning the shtick. The furry woman admits that they managed to "Ringo" a million times and often worked well - which just went to show that the initiative. Do not have much demand in the horror genre Easy to please?) However, now I find myself a little restless. It's not a bad movie. But at least half an hour than it should be with a ridiculous length of 110 minutes compared to other Japanese horror movies. OMC has no atmosphere and excitement. In addition, the ending is confusing: there is no reason at all. For ringtones: Miike seems to be a more powerful melody than a little forgotten. Although it has been played a dozen times, but I don't remember - it was scary. Miike's speech for him here is some of the commercial business, so if anyone thinks they might distort "Bijita Q" Or "Audition", they waste time
