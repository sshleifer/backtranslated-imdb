This movie is terrible. Throughout the movie, I felt puzzled and didn't see any points. I had to go to this site and read reviews to understand what it was This movie is not worth it. Not only is it sick and nasty. But totally stupid! Please do not watch until you are one of those who like to watch bad movies. If this film questions the Japanese society and their values ​​and roles, this is a country that I do not want to visit or do not want to know. This is a seriously ill movie !!!!!!!! I'm not fun because it's not reasonable. My girlfriend and I sat there to see if it was horror because that's what it was listed under. It was a total disappointment.
