Spoilers are often the Shakespeare adaptation of Hollywood's theaters. They shot beautifully and honestly with the message. The film, including "Henry V" of Branagh and "Much Ado About Nothing" of 1993, is a powerful work, so watching "the love of lost labor" is extremely frustrating to expect to be left. Sad waste. "The loss of love of labor" is scary! King of Naf (Alessandro Nivola) and his friends have abandoned drinks and women for three years to focus on their education. The plan began to fall apart, however, when the French princess (Alicia Silverstone) and her followers arrived. Soon, love is in the air and philosophy is not in the mind of the Prince. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, you will know that this movie is not quite Shakespeare. Moved intelligently into musicals in the 1930s by Ken Branagh. The story remained there and the screenplay remained. But now it has been sacrificed in favor of the awesome classical musical tastes, such as "The Way You Look Tonight", "Let's Face The Music and Dance", "I'm in Heaven". Weak and strong feelings that they are not here. <br /> <br >> In addition to weak singing, we have received a lot of awkward performances from the stars Ken Branagh and Friends may enjoy creating movies. The title of this But they give us an impressive summary. <br /> <br /> Eight main actors (Four men and four women) were all shocked by their name. It was a tremendous improvement in the truly terrifying Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> In fact, only one person left. This movie is worthy of praise. Len proves that he is a funny genius for many years and in this feature he has added humor to the comedian Costard. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to say. "Love's Labour's Lost" Gentlely praised for Branagh's original story in an old story, but unfortunately that is a positive ending. Weak performances show and sing "Love's Labour's Lost". May be Shakespeare's weakest weakness in the last forty years. Should be avoided such as epidemics and should not be done Branagh's disappointing and frustrating choice, and here, hope that his next effort will be better.
