Every time I rent an action / adventure movie to relax and occupy my mind without anything important. This is the reason I own Charlie's Angels (2000) - not quality movies. But it makes me laugh and makes me relax for a while One day, I might buy The Princess Bride and a few Monty Python movies for the same reason. <br /> <br /> In any case, I rent this movie because I want to be entertained without being challenged. Mostly I got what I wanted. The plot follows the role of the bad Xena chapter and Kathy Long's performance is a community theater. (Not bad for professional boxers and amateur actors) There are a few high points in the Cyborg section. Anyway, they can make some good actors play bad guys. Unfortunately, most of them die quickly. <br /> <br /> Like most martial arts movies With actions and plot (Which is not strong to begin with) deteriorates almost as fast as the show However, the more Kathy Long struggles, the more the director is devoted to her back. At the end of this movie, I thought seriously to watch it for the second time to count the number of times Kathy Long's red shorts were in the middle of the screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, meats are insufficient The movie that will make the curious curiosity worth watching the movie for the second time If you are a big fan of Xena who wants to find something in a few hours - go to the grocery store and spend 0.50 cents on the rental. There is a lot of similarity between acting and this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't expect anything more than a few hours of comedy. <br /> <br /> Of course, except you used to like Kathy. Long's derri√®re. Then you may want to buy a copy.
