I guess this movie is based on some real stories .... It is about two girls who attacked a grown man for 48 hours; I do not see that terrorism comes into play here .... There are some things that are "strange" and "surreal" in movies and two women. (Sandra locked and played ... Ah ... Oh ... the roll of two men hated the man at the handle ... They did a pretty good job. (Although some parts are just above the top). The movie is not good and it's not scary. It's really a day! I mean, this thing is dripping down in the 70s ... It's not bad if you like that ... You know ... Is that right?
