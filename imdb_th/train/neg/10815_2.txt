I love this book "Jane Eyre" and have seen it many versions. Everyone has strengths and flaws. However, this is one of the worst things I've ever seen. I'm not interested in Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gensburg (Jane) is almost able to stand and look at the obvious parts. But she has no feelings in her field I can't imagine that Rochester saw anything in her. <br /> <br /> That brought us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had less emotion than Jane. If possible, two interesting people How to fall in love is a mystery. But it didn't make me interested Perhaps the director (Zeffrelli) may fall asleep during production. <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton (Too handsome for Mr. Rochester!) The more honest version of this book in the 1997 edition of A / E (which is not all that is true in this book). <br /> <br /> Try to find something that is Positive about this movie: Geraldine Chaplain is perfect in her role.
