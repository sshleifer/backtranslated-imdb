... and that is a bad thing because at least if this is a Troma movie, it will have a violent and anarchic feeling that is neglected which may make my score higher. <br /> <br /> So what? We have a relatively tame person (rated PG), warm, low budget (Roger Corman, producer with unknown director, who is still unknown later) Gremlins (1984) / Critters (1986) - Wish There's a little bit of a sense of humor that makes the Gremlins work very well - with imaginative reasons. No doubt, there is no sense of adventure and no violence or nudity that will compensate for it. <br /> <br /> Even though I sure The problem with the movie is in the script - let's try. No one can tell these jokes to make them funny - it seems that the greatest blame must be in the lap of director Bettina Hirsch in the hand. More talented. Munchies can be fun. <br /> <br /> Finally, it starts out like a great adventure movie, Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton). In Peru in Archaeological excavations archaeologist Simon, a bizarre theories floating about the connection between the Inca civilization and alien. For example, he thought he saw evidence of laser cutting in ancient stone works. So they were at Machu Picchu to find more evidence about Simon's theory when they happened in the secret room. Inside, they found animals quickly. After that, they dubbed "Arnold" one of the large munchies. <br /> <br /> They took Arnold home to a small desert town. In California Simon, who thinks Arnold may be an alien, has to go out to describe his colleagues and he plans to tell his colleagues that he eventually has examples of aliens, Paul and Cindy ( Nadine van der Weld) His most lovely girlfriend is left in the care of Arnold. But when they didn't meet each other for a long time, they left Arnold> <br /> Simon's brother Cecil. (Played by Corman in the dual role) The successful snack snack company wants to buy Simon's house and land - they are next to him. Simon did not want to sell, so Cecil attacked the plan to steal Arnold. Things began to unravel from control and people who were determined to go with the junk foodstuffs began to enter the city. <br /> <br /> Read better than the screen summary. The best picture in the movie is the natural scenery behind. For example, when the character is driving around the desert city. The interiors, except Cecil's house, tend to look like cheap and important decorations. They often show that Hirsch doesn't have the skills to block and set images. Cecil's house is quite a deep gem in the style of the 1980s. Overwhelming to the smallest detail and Cecil's stepson is Dude (Jon Stafford), who is funny. Unfortunately, he leaves the movie very fast. <br /> <br /> Whatever the reason, Korman is a fun actor. But he found Simon more than Cecil Unfortunately, Simon became a big part in the movie. Cecil, who is physically different with a wig and facial hair that is ridiculous, not just a "wicked investor" in this movie, he is one of Corman's classic characters who are not afraid. Burnett Show "(1967) A play that is different from" The Carol Burnett Show "which is likely to be successful because director Clark Jones and Dave Powers have an educational approach to pushing the game to the brink of confusion. Hirsch reins Korman too far, and the character was Cecil. Working as it should be. <br /> <br /> There are many problems related to the director, not at least that is spacing and difficult solutions that will absorb possible suspicions or consequences. Very much from the movie Even the scenes that should wear shoes to get rid of the drama - such as when an angry person is harassing an old woman on the street - too slow together to have a lot of impact. <br /> <br /> There are also logical problems that Serious about the story as it stood Munchie in the room where Machu Picchu came from? An example of this film seems to show the answer to this. But it was modified from the last cut The more serious problem is not the same as the reason in the gremlins that have no clear reason to go from a cute, cuddly and scary mammal. It just happened More because PG treatment munchies and violence continue to decline when creatures are in their monster range, they are never very threatening. At least temporarily. <br /> <br /> Recognize that the main part of the movie is not scary, horror, interesting drama or other things, but it's a joke. It was intended over the trick of Gremlins and countless cheating in the wake. The only problem with this is that this movie is not a joke, even though I laugh twice. Surprisingly high percentage of jokes are ancient ideas. Too many remaining materials consist of those who do not participate. When receiving a bad time from Hirsch, it was just downhill. There is a possibility to create a movie that, while posing as both funny and scary, hilarious and disturbing, wonderful and suspicious at the same time, Ala Killer Klowns from outer space (1988). Unfortunately, the Munchies come close. that
