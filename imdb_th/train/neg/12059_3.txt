'80's is not kind to Charles Bronson, the only major actor starting from "Death Wish II" in 1982 and ending with a truly horrible movie from '89. Bronson's screenwriter seems to be trying to make each other with Progressive progression "D..W. II" is left in the imagination that shows the rape and suicide of the daughter of the character of Bronson (rape and murder. His housekeeper is shown in the mold. More disgusting) "10 to Midnight" is a nasty film that makes you want to shower afterwards. There is nothing about exchanging other movies such as "The Evil that Men Do" and the remaining "Death Wish" movies during this time, making a difference between the high camp and the high bar that has shown cruelty and revenge. Seriously I am not sure whether the producer (usually Pancho Kohner) has been shown to be bored with Bronson, an old man who destroyed enough work for the children to be his grandchildren. But a low craft (And the bad script) The movie often destroys the little energy that they create. <br /> <br /> "Kinjite" - the last of these movies - doing quite well, but actually using the cake in the cinema. In this film, Bronson: sodomizes John Warp; Forced Pimp to eat his Rolex watch, allowing male prisoners to rape by other prisoners Makes the speech unbelievable to foreigners among other things that I have forgotten The image that is seen is the rape of a gang of Japanese girls. (Fortunately, this story is not on the screen at all.) <br /> <br /> What are people thinking when they make this movie? What is Bronson thinking when he decides to destroy his career with these horror movies? For everyone interested in his best movies, try out the most movies he created in the 60s and 70s, such as "The Mechanic", "Death Wish", "From Noon til 3", "Once upon a time in the west. "," Red Sun "," The Great Escape "," The Magnificent Seven "," Rider on the Rain "etc. etc.
