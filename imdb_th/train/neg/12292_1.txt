We bring this story as a joke for friends and may be our worst joke to play. This movie is almost impossible to see and the performance is terrible. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff gave substandard performance. The plot is disgraceful and at the point where we feel bored, we wonder what happened It tries to be scary in place. But it's a laughing story. <br /> <br /> It's terrible.
