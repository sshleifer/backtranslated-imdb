Unfortunately, the trailer was better than the movie and I was very disappointed with this boring and unbelievable antique collection. Della Myers was presented in As a housekeeper who is not stable and neglected and is not a wife Motherhood is only interested in the concept of her family. She was chased by four criminals. But she defeats them with a tool box that looks like Batman's utility belt Therefore, the plot is so frustratingly absurd. The criminal gang formed from the ancient idea of ​​an American movie with American Afro-American, Chinese, American and Latino Americans, together with an American boss to resolve political issues. Kim Basinger performed well but their children Too young for women fifty-five years old My score is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Enquanto Ela Está Fora" ("While you are away")
