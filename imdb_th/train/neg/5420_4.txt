WE FAW DOWN <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound style: Quiet <br /> <br /> (Black and white - short film) <br /> < br> Stan 'n' Ollie mingled with a few floozies (Kay Deslys and Vera White) after departing to visit a theater that burns where they don't live! Needing to say that the oppression of their wives (Vivien Oakland and Bess Flowers) is not amusing ... <br /> <br /> OK Leo McCarey's comedy film sets the lecture frame for William Seiter's masterpiece. Of the desert (1934) with L&H, victims of bullying events being forced to tell evil lies Most are very funny, especially the scene where Stan is teased by Deslys leading to a fierce push game. However, some fun was cut by Oakland and Flower, which played their roles honestly, adding elements of dissatisfaction to the situation. First launched in the UK as WE SLIP UP
