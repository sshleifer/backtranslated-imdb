Turkish cinema has a big problem. The director is not interested in world-class movies. They are local people and villagers. But want to be universal This presents a worthless result, like this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has a funny translation in Spanish from Turkey and they have no meaning for non-Turkish viewers Even the Turkish audience after 10 years <br /> <br /> The player, even Ferhan SENSOY, has a worse role than the average person. They act like puppets. <br /> <br /> The movie was filmed in Cuba. But nothing about Cuba Cuba thought like a banana republic. <br /> <br /> Wasted money, wasted time.
