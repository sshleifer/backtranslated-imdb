One must give credit to the director for the way he brave. Courage will be the right word. He not only used all five actors (No speciality at all), but he decided to use sub-effects with scenes that were still confused and boring, and I wasn't joking. The beginning of the movie that you might be afraid of dying !!! However, they promise to FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFFFIIIIINNNNN Having a gardening man walking creepyly is always a good thing. Yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn .... <br /> <br /> If you watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000, you may have seen this. They like to present scary movies, just let you know. <br /> <br /> A great gift for those you hate.
