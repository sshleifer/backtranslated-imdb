In Steve Irwin's list, he is ambitious. He didn't try to be funny and he was just But his movie is not what I would call a movie - I mean, when that guy in his car tries to kill him, he just says the bloke! And looking straight into the camera He put his face in the camera too much! And when the man falls from the car, don't you think he will die? And Terri has the worst performance I've ever seen! Like when the crocodile almost eats Steve, she just says 'Steve'. She's not afraid of anything. It's just 'Steve'. I mean, I hate to listen. But it is not worth watching I love Steve Erwin But his movie is too stupid
