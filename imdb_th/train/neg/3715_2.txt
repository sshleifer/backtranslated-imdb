Blacks became wealthy white people and white people who seemed to embrace hip hop culture and "funny" moments. Most of this film played out of this story. The problem I have is that it doesn't work and almost doesn't work at all. <br /> <br /> Ok, so nobody expects Lance to grab the body like this and start acting like Charles Wellington. That would be too much to ask me to give it, but at the same time it goes too far in another direction. I should imagine that a rich white man is singing rap and doing things completely. Play like he is a fortress of hip hop culture and people just accept him. Sontee who loves him * as a skin man White that is rich * Even though she doesn't care about his money or power? Unbelievable that it's not funny. <br /> <br /> I can't help but believe and I don't finish the movie. I added another special star because it made me laugh a few times. But I couldn't get past what "White people are doing hip hop." All that has never done well in any movie I've seen already. Try it. This is no exception.
