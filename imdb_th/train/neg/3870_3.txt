Under the dense green computer graphics, there is an amazing art and skill of Ichikawa Somegoro. Alas: It disappeared in all the thick, old Edo scenes - with prostitutes, floating on Sumida, rehearsals and performances in Nakamura -za - all exciting and engaging, bringing you back to an interesting and rich era The action on Kabuki stage, which Somegoro is wonderful and exciting, is more complete than the high jink that laughs. The energy skills in the color audience of the scene are more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over and performances. It's a waste of opportunity! One of the best Kabuki actors is still alive and he is lost in the wreck.
