Please take a moment to read all my reviews. I didn't shoot the movie myself - only the current version of the DVD is available. <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> I want to make this movie even two stars. I mean, it is possible to just rank 1 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Here's how: the epic movie adaptation of the novel. Tolstoy's "War and Peace" and the precise fighting scenes in the past, the politeness of the Red Army And adapting to the scene of the novel faithfully will be difficult But it's worth it to sit and read for seven hours - if that's what you see. <br /> <br /> The problem is you can't see the movie - everywhere I know. <br /> <br /> I am trying to see the version of RusCiCo DVD - considered to be the best version available since the characters in the box. <br /> <br /> But it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Transfer to DVD The image is muddy and uneven, which often has bright light. It's almost tolerable if you swing the brightness level, color, and maximum image ... but the problem doesn't end. <br /> <br /> The sound is inconsistent. Can't hear in others. <br /> <br /> And for the language, it's a big problem for English speakers - the options that are dubbed are good actors and some are terrible with performance and some parts of The movie is not dubbed. By moving back to Russian and French randomly. <br /> <br /> The subtitle options aren't much better. Subtitles do not appear under the image. But on the right - concealing some beauty (Or what is left) in the scene. In addition, subtitles are often poor translations. (It's a shame because the script uses pain similar to Tolstoy's true words) and the subtitles seem to be shortened in some way. <br /> <br /> So even if you set the color, brightness and maximum image Turn up the volume and select subtitles * and * English dub. You will still receive annoying movies. To watch and listen. <br /> <br /> Can content be overcome? It may be able to But in seven hours - who can stand for so long <br /> <br /> Maybe someday someone will come in and return this thing - and maybe I'll see a masterpiece - but for now I'm Can't give more than one star to something I can only stand to see about 12% of the first
