I'm cringed all the way through this movie. First, the plot of the stupid story is not related to the story of Parsons himself. Hollywood tried to create a movie based on a funny car. Imagine "Englebert Sings Hendrix" <br /> <br /> Don't take anything about this movie correctly. The name Parsons in the title and theft of his body was used as a springboard for a movie that had a limited budget. The blatant effort to grab a few dollars from the Parsons heritage and the fan base His club, Gram's father, died in 1973. Other world-class characters do not have any identity related to Grams' life or death. <br /> <br /> If you are factoring I suggest you do not Watch this movie I hope i can't It's sad to see some special things being treated, such as disgusting animal food. I swear that I heard Gram turning into his grave while the movie was playing. If you are not familiar with Gram's life and heritage, don't take anything in this movie to represent Gram. <br /> <br /> I can't say bad things about this movie. If Gram is still alive and watching this movie, he will kill himself. Then again, maybe he was afraid if he knew that this movie would happen.
