Where to start How to deal with the wrong conclusion: <br /> <br /> "The origin of the X-Men: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's violent past and romance. His complex relationship with Victor Creed and Weapon X program "/> <br /> In the past, his violence became violent without being guilty. <br /> <br /> His relationship with Creed is difficult to understand. How is he involved? We were thrown from one spot in the opening scene that showed them that the kids were running away to the war scenes that they had fought for a long time and eventually to the present that they were part of. Of a simple government team of assassins. <br /> <br /> Nothing can show their relationship as brothers. There is nothing complicated that has been placed for us to believe that it is true or even love. <br /> <br /> The romantic elements of the movie between Silverfox and Wolverine are forced and sudden. We are quickly thrown into romance until the end before you can blink. After introducing the character, Silverfox was killed about fifteen minutes later. We were left to wonder why we should care about this. Who are you? <br /> <br /> For this element that is at the heart of the weak revenge story, this time, love is not surprisingly explored. It hurried to come easily because it was necessary. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, when Wolverine finds that his love is dead, he leaves her in the forest to rot while he goes out. Finding Sabertooth, being a romantic person that he is like, is not for him. But it is necessary to provide a service to pull the unexpected surprise. <br /> <br /> For the X weapon program, say that after the painful pain has deteriorated, the Wolverine procedure is activated. Eventually he arrived at the house of a very old and comfortable couple. Surprisingly, Ma and Pa Kent didn't panic when meeting a man with sweat in the barn. Wondering whether or not the fate is waiting for them? <br /> <br /> In the previous film and comic books, the main reason Wolverine's memory deteriorated him. The fact that he was accused of coldblows <br /> <br /> Knowing that this is the case ... He wants to remember these horrors or hide it and live a positive life today. His fight against the villains of the world Along with his teammates? <br /> <br /> As told in X2: X-men United, when Stryker waives his secrets, someone says Wolverine will be disturbed if he knows the work they do. Together This movie set up the team quite well. They didn't do much. There is no annoying violence, no heart, no brutal actions. But harassing a few villagers in a foreign country for ten or fifteen minutes that they were on the screen. <br /> <br /> It seems that Wolverine is not a wicked person under Stryker. But he continued to try to bring the leash to Sabertooth, his brother, who is the representative of the violence that we all think of Wolverine as <br /> <br /> There is no conflict between the couple here. <br /> <br /> A fool who will eliminate the conflict of the characters in good and evil. They may give their rubber claws. <br /> <br /> There are many other mistakes in this movie that conflict with the X-Men trilogy, including the famous Deus Ex Machinas script. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Apparently they are the only thing that will make Wolverine down here. Was forgotten that when the agent after the agent was sent to bring him down with ammunition and ammunition <br /> <br /> The other problem with this film is that it tries to focus on Wolverine while throwing other mutants that do nothing. An interesting character is just a dressing window and doesn't do anything for the story. Most of them are in the movie for a maximum of 5-10 minutes, but you think that you want us to see them more and less. Wolverine <br /> <br /> Fred Dukes (Blob but not a cartoon version) can punch. Can be launched Missile tanks with little physical damage But does not affect anything But the ordinary head from the metal waffle head is enough to cause him to be puzzled. <br /> <br /> The glass beam of the Cyclops (which instead of the laser vibration) can burn the building. But when being shot directly in the Sabertooth, it hit him to the ground without causing his clothes to damage Adamantium trench for someone. <br /> <br /> Mutations (Gravity challenged) Gambit instead of using his signature card was created as a crazy gymnast. In a scene with bad editing, he was drowned by Wolverine ... then it was amazing. After a few minutes later he was on the deck that was running to Wolverine. How did he recover? A couple of blocks climbed the building, then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a scratched match, a mystery that could not be explained. <br /> <br /> The weakness of the movie claims that Made from kartu And therefore should be susceptible to characters and flash The idea that this movie is a cartoon movie is subtle and superficial because the truth is not correct. <br /> <br /> Comic book source Wolverine's true source ... is a story that should be worth watching. It's not coating his past sugar or treating the reader with ridiculous CGI. It is a well-built story, and although it recounts and re-adjusts when The visit began with a WEAPON X by Barry Windsor-Smith. The story is more intense and exciting. <br /> <br /> This FOX movie should be seriously forgotten. <br /> <br /> Everybody has that magic gun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
