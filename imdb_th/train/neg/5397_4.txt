I think this is one of the weaknesses of Kenneth Branagh Shakespearian's work. After such great efforts like Much Ado About Nothing etc. I think it is bad. The actor is weak. (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???) But my biggest hand is that they are busy with the work of the poet and cutting some of the performances in the musical / dance /> You didn't do Shakespeare and were busy playing. Sorry. But that's wrong. I love Cole Porter like the next person. But jeez don't mess with Shakespeare. Skip this thing and see "The Book of Prospero" If you want to see the great Shakespeare adaptation of the storm
