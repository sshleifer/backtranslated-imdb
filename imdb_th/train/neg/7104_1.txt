The film producer offered to pay the funeral expenses for everyone who died in fear while watching this movie. They should offer intensive psychotherapy for everyone who is happy with this disease. The young couple moved into the house where women who looked like women from both were living. Extremely boring and very predictable In the end I ended up ignoring anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this in all matters.
