At first I received an interest in this film after reading reviews that said the film warned the critic of Silent Hill. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of Silent Hill is big and disappointed with the release. This movie, I think I will give you this opportunity. Fearnet's heart only shows this movie "Dark Floors", not the full name. So when I saw the name "Mr. Lordi" in the credit, I immediately thought of the band. (I have a few friends in college who like them) but don't think it's important and pushing the idea out quickly. <br /> <br /> The movie is getting stronger. Despite the fact that "The creepy little girl" has been made for Death, but the use of voice and loneliness begins to bring the story together. The tense atmosphere created quickly and all indications point to this film as excellent. While the monster is a true horror star, I can't wait to see if there is something in the hospital hall. The main character finds himself trapped ... <br / > <br /> Then the first monster was shown Up and I found myself being greatly destroyed At the time of the second appearance, I believed in the fact that it had just come from the Megadeth concert and the stupidity caused me to close completely. Intact and the story makes you wonder what happened But that fear does not exist However, I hope that success will make everything worthwhile. Unfortunately, not like that When the movie reached its peak, I didn't believe it, and I remembered the big bad thing in his final revelation ... Lordi's lead singer? Seriously? <br /> <br /> Is that all the movies boiled down? The poor spirit band was expelled from Lordi by the band members? Suddenly, the design of a stupid monster was reasonable. If you are a monotonous person, probably through members of Marilyn Manson or even kissing there as well Not to mention the fact that I'm pretty sure I saw the ending in one of Lordi's music videos a few years ago. They have to make a movie to finish. <br /> <br /> The worst when I know that all the real things I can handle are yawning. I will not "destroy" for you, but I can say. Safely that may be a plot device you've seen before More likely again. <br /> <br /> So if you're not a great Lordi fan, it's not scary. But will not bring new things to the table (Although it is a good job to borrow from other horror movies, mostly Silent Hill) and I can't stress this. LordI is the enemy. Lordi talks about buzzkill. <br /> <br /> In fact, you are better off making yourself afraid of watching music videos. Slipknot, in other words, is impossible.
