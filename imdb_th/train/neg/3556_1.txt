You know that you are having problems when John Cassavetes runs at half speed instead of full throttle in the movie and "The Incubus" is a terrifying and terrible situation of the great actors who have to go through the movement to pay for it. In fact, observing the hammy script and the direction of John Hough's baroque style, we can almost blame him. This film deals with the murder of rape that occurred in a small town with a lot of supernatural control. However, the direction of the tensions and attention came from every scene and Cassavetes seemed to see PO 'ed. The Incubus didn't appear until the final scene was a good creation. But it's not worth waiting for <br /> <br /> 1/10
