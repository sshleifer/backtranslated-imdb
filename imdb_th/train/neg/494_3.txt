Comedy director who carelessly anticipates the "50s classic" movie "Alien invasion", but actually it doesn't get better than them, except of course in the purely technical department. (Good makeup effects) and any deception that is worse than that goal will fail ("Casino Royale", "Our Man Flint" is worse than almost every James Bond movie). Greasy for two hours, you have to ask for peace and quiet (* 2/1)
