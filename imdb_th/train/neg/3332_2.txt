I bought this movie from the boot car sale, so I don't expect it to be the same horror movie as A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977). Probably Quite fun to watch However, it proved to be no fun at all. But instead of acting and general movies, ridicule, such as the way that the 'murderer' murderers killed the victims and all the people killed, was born as a blonde woman. I say this because of the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Three blonde women are in danger, most of them killed. 2) One survivor by crawling in the dark in While being chased by a murderer So now you're lucky. Enough to not have to watch it
