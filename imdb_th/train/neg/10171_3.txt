The comparison with American Graffiti is inevitable, so you save money and time by renting a classic car that never runs out. Speaking of timeliness, there are stories of Bravo, Norm and Cliff competing to see who can find the most unusual in the movie. They will love this movie, everything from some songs and some clothes wrong. There are sly references like 'They paved the heaven to put a car park.' The filmmakers hope to win some smiles from us. But basically it makes me groan. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially intelligent for teenagers. Almost as smart as those in the thirties, when they wrote darn movies. What the characters say is very reliable. Combining bad writing and bad performances into this movie completely failed. Although there are two exceptions, Kelli Williams makes life like a flower child in the future, and even if another reviewer says that Rick Shroeder is quite good, shows that the ovulation style is full of trouble in the end He's in "NYPD Blues"
