I have high hopes to see the adaptation of classic stories such as Arabian Nights, but I was disappointed in the movie that didn't pay attention from the beginning, even though I tried it twice !! > It's a bonus that Caradine is in this movie. But it didn't have much value because the actors lacked passion For something similar, Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras are much better for action, funny moments and overall fun. <br /> <br /> Ok, so Son of the Dragon has fans at Many possibilities Things will wow in terms of martial arts and plot lines. You won't get it. If you just want the kids to calm down on a Sunday afternoon, maybe this will be yours with 3 ninjas.
