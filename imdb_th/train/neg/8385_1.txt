Now I just know that watching this movie, I have lost precious moments in my life. I will not return. Thsi movies are not only bad. It reminds me of all the black sitcoms that have been created. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia thinks about the white man competition. "Dislike" because it has no white actors. Friends, I think you will find the reason why no one likes this because watching dry paint is more fun and fun. <br /> <br /> Please stop making shit movies.
