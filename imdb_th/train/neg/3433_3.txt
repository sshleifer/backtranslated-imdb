It is a very strange movie. You can call it scary or if you sit with a friend it may make you laugh. Strange in mind again and again Unsurpassed shooting, acting worse and the direction may not be there. Special effects are fun. But the song with the flying demon ball will be the most popular song See if you have time to kill But don't try to do it seriously. Should be a tribute to 'Porno disaster' since I didn't see it from the tribute. I can be considered as bad. I should get it 1/10. But it makes me laugh good or two, so I get 3 gore too. If you're nauseous, laugh more. Wondering whether the creator can laugh?
