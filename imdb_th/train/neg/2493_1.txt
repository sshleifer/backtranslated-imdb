A truly scary movie At first I didn't know this was Kiwi's effort. But soon I began to realize that every character spoke with a kiwi accent that was almost disguised under an American accent. Why is it necessary to set n America - there may be settings in New Zealand and then the actors may use their normal sounds Someone in the production team can hear the terrible effort of speaking with an American accent. Bad movie I was surprised that it lasted a long time - how did it get out of the can? Seems to be a terrible attempt in the action movie Segal / Willis. Flick all the money! If there is TAXPAYER money in this trash, I will be a revolutionary leader to bring all the money back to the store. I still spin (get it or pun, reeling!). Why i continue to watch I'm a movie fanatic and can't help myself!
