Are we talking about the same movie? This film is totally ridiculous. The story is disgusting and unreasonable. It's straightforward with DVD / TV movies as well as the ingredients needed for a horrific movie viewing experience: the show is over, with actors performing steps from the remaining plot. Don't explain THE GIRL SHOWS HER T * TS (Why God Why ??) People don't respond to things in real life. I won't bother you with details. It will take the whole night. Okay, just one: If two people are killed in front of you while you are walking down the street, one victim dies in your arms. His blood comes from the wound that his head is around you; "Oh, he went out of the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!"? My thoughts go to Harvey and his lost career.
