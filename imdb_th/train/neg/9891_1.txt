I think the biggest disappointment in this movie is until the end. I expect the actor's acting teacher to come in and apologize for the bad performance. When you consider the powerful model, the beautiful scenery and the effort to create beautiful scenes and stunning images, it is a shame to pay a little attention to the show. <br /> <br />
