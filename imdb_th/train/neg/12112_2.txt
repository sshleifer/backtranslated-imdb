I can't believe that I wasted time with this movie. I can't even call it a movie. It's terrible. Nothing to recommend. <br /> <br /> I like cheap movies and strange flicks, but this makes me bored to death. Bad performances and bad performances are destroyed by curiosity. You have to wonder what these people are thinking when they use the money to create this movie. I wondered what I was thinking about to finish. Who do I recommend this movie to? How did they release this? Is there an audience that likes this type of movie? Must have because you can find it at almost any video store, but why <br /> <br /> should be forgotten
