My interest in Dorothy Stratten made me buy this video. Although it has excellent actors / actors But there are too many sub-plans to maintain benefits Plus it wasn't interesting. The dialogue is hard and confusing, and the story has just turned too much to believe. I am quite disappointed with what I believe is one of Audrey Hepburn's last films. I will love John Ritter for the best of hurt. He is too pathetic here.
