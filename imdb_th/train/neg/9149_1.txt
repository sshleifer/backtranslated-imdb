There is nothing in this movie that shows even the smallest talent. No one has ever tried playing the show before, even the specialties in the coffee shop seem as if they were caught in place. There is nothing that is insulting to the quality of the movie. A lot of 'action' occurs in narrow corridors or apartments with camera technicians packed in the back by swinging the CEO's camera forward and Back between the 'actors' as they perform No stand and no suitable microphone. The sound quality is terrible. Even 'Manos' is still better. At least they have the right equipment. The plot of what is going to be lost in production <br /> <br /> Stick to the home video, especially the 5-year-old boy who is trying to use video features on the new father's camera phone. You will be in search for a long time to find more inappropriate movies.
