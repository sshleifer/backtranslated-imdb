I see and really like the first two. Especially because the second thing is not just trying to do something as good as the first time And it is a story that stands alone You don't need to know the first movie. I like that in the movie "Free Willy". <br /> <br /> But ... The third place is absolutely useless! I try with my friends because we both like the first two. We decided to stop after a good half hour. This movie is a funny part, but for what? Timon and Pumba are funny animals in the first two movies. What the Lion King 1 1/2 for me is: a hard effort to get more fun in the first movie. Which has been included in the story from their point of view, but for what I want to know But most subsequent things are not necessary I guess many people like Timon and Pumba and I too. But for me there are many parts that were created in an effort to be funny There is no chance. It's not funny. At least, for me, Btw. What about movies? a) About Timon and Pumba, or b) trying to get more fun from the first movie? I tend to choose option b and I'm very disappointed about this. <br /> <br /> If you want to see stories like: "The story behind xy" You should see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" by Tom Stoppard and Tim. Roth and Gary Oldman are really funny and don't try to leave "Hamlet" more.
