* Clay * It's a fake! The whole story is fake! No ghost or zombies. Alan is the Lord and his cousin or half brother or brother or something like a castle and his name for himself. So he invested this complex and unnecessary pointless plan. Ala SCOOBY-DOO pushed Alan to commit suicide. Most of the movies are, he keeps the red head and attacks them. He didn't kill them. He went to sleep and the girl disappeared and he thought he was buried somewhere. If he looks at the spirit called Evelyn, he can tell that she is wearing gloves! My God wasted time. Do not worry, go see for rent and if you buy it and haven't watched for sale quickly! Make yourself a favorite and stay away from THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME. I give CRAP-O-LANTERN. With this bad smell
