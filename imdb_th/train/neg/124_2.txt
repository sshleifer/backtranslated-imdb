This movie may be inspired by Godin's Masculin, f√©minin and I want you to watch that movie instead. <br /> <br /> The film has two strong elements: (1) Realistic performances ( 2) Impressive images that are unduly good In addition, the thing that impressed me the most was the stream of endlessness. Lena Nyman had to be the most annoying actor in the world. She was stupid and with all the nudity in this movie ... it was fascinating Compared to Godard's movies, that ingenuity was replaced with folly. I will say that following the ideal difference between France and the Swedish society <br /> <br /> Movies of time and place 2/10
