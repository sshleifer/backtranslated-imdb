Being taken hostage along with a crew of terrorists. <br /> <br /> Looks cheap. (Even by the 80s standards) A slightly boring action movie is a strange career for Gary Busey after impressing as The frustrating villain, Mr Joshua, in Lethal Weapon. He has just moved through his cardboard character here, frustrated and funny as well (with 'butthorn' that is his trademark, put down for the bad guy) but without the content Will support him Henry Silva appeared as a villain on the movie screen. But he thinks this is the Arab leader (In a red beret!) And a scary script that makes the conversation boring, making him laugh He is just one of the actors who have roles in action movies, including LQ. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick who appeared But can not add anything to the mixture After the first half of the year that is boring without any exciting action, things get in the end but it's too late and no one can handle the fun. * * * *
