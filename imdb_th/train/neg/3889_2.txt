I always wanted to see this because I loved the horror movie and had a name like this. I'm sure "The Incredible Melting Man" would be fun. <br /> <br /> It's not really. I mean, the play is not good, fun, the script has a bad line, classic and special effects, it seems that someone sneezes the leading actor, I should love it. Unfortunately, it's very scary between these highlights. I decided to watch the last half of the movie while doing my tax return. That is very boring for this movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you love bad movies, you will enjoy leaving The Fat Nurse and the great performances of the men playing Dr. Ted in order to be fair to the poor, he must deliver an amazingly inappropriate line with a straight face - just like the conversation he had with his wife in tracking men. IM: <br /> <br /> "I Will meet him with the Geiger counter "" Is he radioactive? "" A little bit. "<br /> <br /> Yes, the plot has Dr. Ted wandering about trying to find a great zombie killing machine, armed only with what looks like a mini Dyson. He is brave. Unfortunately, his plan failed when he discovered that there were a lot of goop on the tree. "Oh my God - that's his ears!" Dr. Ted said to the audience. I'm glad he cleared. <br /> <br /> I know I made this movie quite fun. It would be if it lasted only 10 minutes, but unfortunately it continued and Incredible Melting Dude just made a messy thing when he should eat more people in my mind. I think if you are really stoned, you may love it just without pop tarts in the movie because the lead actors are similar to the ones near the end.
