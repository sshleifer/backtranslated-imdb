My flatmate rented the movie the night before so we watched it together. <br /> <br /> The first impression is good because this movie was filmed in a colorful surface and posted. MTV quick sequence, cool angle, sweeping camera movement - while you feel you are watching "Snatch" for a moment .... <br /> <br /> When the plot begins to unfold Actually starting one Feels as though amphetamine is over one tablet Things that are no longer reasonable I hate to spoil the fun of watching by giving some scenes. But then again, this movie is so bad that you don't watch it. <br /> <br /> At first, you think it's a crime. The story in the conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu is incorrect. This conversation does not have any connection to the story. Conversely, Domino's lesbian comes to Lucy Liu's character in the second part of the movie, causing confusion. Let the audience <br /> <br /> I think maybe it's a movie about wealthy women. But the unusual background that became a bounty hunter In any case, that is the message that represents the opening scene. But after that, questions about Domino's character disappeared with the entire criminal story. So in the short term, this isn't a movie about the characters of Domino. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it might be the story of a single robbery. The beautiful blood robbery disappeared 10 million people. Bounty hunters are chasing robbers. Mafia suspects were executed. The hands were removed. Domino tried to decipher why they are now not receiving certificates of favor, etc. but in no way. Slowly, this impression was canceled. <br /> <br /> This time, we are confronted with the sad story of a woman. Afro-American Who is obese, who forged a driver's license at a local MVD and at the age of 28 was the youngest grandmother The late star in the list, Jerry Springer, tries to publish a strange racial theory and at the same time struggles to raise money for her sick granddaughter. <br /> <br /> How does this relate to the main point? Umm, no one knows. Except that the director must explain to the audience that the bounty hunter will collect their accumulated value at 300,000. <br /> <br /> At one point, you start to think: "Oh, it's about society. We and the way the media distorts things "There are reality TV crews driving around with bounty hunters and making violent videos. The bounty hunter is still stuck with many Hollywood actors who constantly lament that their nose is broken and they are dragged around the scene too. But not this is not a movie about the media. They appear periodically in the movie. <br /> <br /> There are also many other subplots: Afghani men, in the liberation of Afghanistan, love stories between Domino and Chocco, a mescaline incident, FBI surveillance ... <br /> <br /> Can all of the above be put into a 2 hour movie? Judge for yourself But my conclusion is clear - it's a real mess!
