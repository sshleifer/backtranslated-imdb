Wow, not only is the movie "New lessons in really bad taste" but still a lesson in "Making movies that are not really good." Don't understand me wrong. I admire the concept of 'Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence.' In the event that you miss a story, the story 'Zombie' 90 'is about a government plane that has toxic chemicals that will crash into the wilderness, causing six chemicals to cause villagers to become ugly zombies. The next thing you know is that zombies all over the city eat people who are still alive, while stupid doctors and government officials are trying to find a disease that can cause these people to eat - so the name "deadly pandemic". Come, what we see is that zombies have a day in all areas of the eye - nothing but separation and disassembly. Since this is a German movie, the movie must be dubbed in English and when you don't laugh at the madness of the zombies, the voice is quite hilarious and fun too. While the user is not mentioned * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER * There is a scene in the movie that crosses the line between what is acceptable and unacceptable. Therefore, the scene in which a woman is carrying a baby. Around in your wheelchair, where some friends and zombies come from and attack them. One of the zombies grabbed the ball and ripped it apart. Wow, that's a new lesson in bad taste. REALLLLLLLLY I tell you with vices
