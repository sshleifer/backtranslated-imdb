I'm sick and bored with these little girls that happened about this movie. It's a CR-over-acted CG. Pure! Do not send Assassin. It is more reasonable to smuggle a violent, aggressive and poisonous snake on the plane! The only reason that people like this movie is because they feel that they need it. It's not "very bad." It's terrible. I want to poke my eyes with a sharp stick and be crammed again. I think honestly that I will be a comedy like an airplane! Spoof! I'm wrong. It's all. "It's bad!" Or Samuel A. Jackson shouted. "Snake on the plane! Okay, I'm sorry. I don't understand it. It seems like a bunch of wimps give more money to the movie industry to create more movies like Triple X and Die Hard. If you spend money to watch movies in the same group of companies that buy CDs William Hung still lives in the mother's basement and the stench of sweaty plastic chairs from computers that play online games and watch pornography. Hurried to the theater and asked for a ticket (Because I wonder if you have a girlfriend) One ticket for stupid snakes on a plane to hell with movies such as Full Metal Jackets, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 Monkeys, Clerks etc. There is no irony in watching movies Well, the real decline of Western civilization, calling this movie as a cult is a real insult to classical classics, such as Repo man or Orgazmo. I used to say here enough.
