Yes, talk about the bad sequel Rick Moranis, starring the terrifying third sequel, "Honey I shrinking children" that are funny and fun. In general, the concept is played in the same way as the first movie. But with adults instead of children who contracted and inside houses instead of gardens to explore the universe If you think that this sounds interesting, try to think again. This movie is the most boring, must be put to shame. <br /> <br /> First of all, the continuation of the series has been completely washed into the bathroom. The only remaining actor in the first movie is Rick Moranis, an actor who plays with his wife. The actor who plays with the children changes. People who play with the neighbors change ... You name it. They try to make us believe that this is the same family. But the result is the least confusing. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this story is a new form of the first person without any initiative. A few jokes about all (And almost never had) and the dangerous situation presented in the movie will be copied from "Honey, I shrink the children." <br /> <br /> The third problem is a special technique. I'm sure this is done with a less budget. But they were poor and worse than appearing in the remaining series. You should be appreciated in fear. These small numbers explore a large domestic area. But you may ultimately end up being the most critics. <br /> <br /> The fourth problem to find home action is just boring. There are only a few things that happen and when they happen, they are not excited. The first movie was amusing because children were dealing with nature, grass and insects that lived there. Here adults (Which happens quite boring as compared to children) dealing with dust, cockroaches and disgusting cockroach traps. <br /> <br /> I don't know why the idea of ​​releasing the sequel to the terrible stories that Exist that has attracted Disney executives, except maybe because they want cash without spending time thinking something new. I warn you: throw away the waste that is free of charge where it should be: get dust on the floor. Place of the shop
