At first, setting the bar is quite high, I think It was the actor William Hert as a killer who was hired to kill a manicurist. We received very little information about his character or who paid him to kill. Of course, now is amazing because there is no dialogue. When returning to his modern penthouse, he sent a package containing military toys that made him smile. But he doesn't care about this and does his business But he is on the night of hell. The soldiers are still alive and are going to war. Drive jeeps, machine guns, tanks and even helicopters! Special effects are good for TV programs and it is quite tense when he hides around an apartment using intelligence for survival. Sometimes getting a high position and no other time. I will not destroy the ending. But when it can be said that it is a slightly twisted twist This gave me hope for the remaining series. But I was in disappointment. All other episodes were rubbish and I lost interest by one quarter. Stephen King's modification is always a mixed bag, and these things are no exception.
