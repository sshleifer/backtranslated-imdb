I sacrificed 5.75 to watch a crappy movie, so I just wanted to know something: <br /> <br /> What was the point where the dog was split in half at the beginning of the movie, the disease didn't do anything. With half divided, <br /> <br /> The thing that is the point of dragging Karen into the shed, she is completely infected in her room and they can lock her in a safer place. > <br /> Why is the hermit running around the forest asking for a stranger to help him when he may ask his fortune teller to take him to the hospital <br /> <br /> Why can't There are no characters that will walk into the city for help when things start to get worse. Are they all really lazy? <br /> <br /> Although Paul is threatened by a man with a shotgun Keep watching him Paul's wife just sent Jeff or Bert back to the house for help. <br /> <br /> What is the point of the box? <br /> <br /> Why did Jeff return to the cabin after he left when everyone was infected? He is a big jerk that will go out from the beginning. Will he not go home? <br /> <br /> If the police find all the problems in gathering children and burn them on fire Why did they throw Paul in half in an unnecessary oil even with the land because the water was already contaminated? <br /> <br /> Who made lemonade from the water in the river? Defect in it Why are the two children unable to use tap water? It is also contaminated, so stupid endings are still available.
