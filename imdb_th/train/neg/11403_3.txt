I love horror movies, low budget 50 years, 60 years, 70 years 80, but who would think this is a very good horror movie? Let's compare it with the names in the haunted house movies. Haunting, changing and shining Or for horror movies that have similar technology, which is better FAAAR (but still far from the top) Demon Seed. OK, I'll be fair .. try comparing horror movies created for TV! Do not go to sleep .. waaay creeping and doing better Lot of Salem, Night Stalker, Night gallery, even if not going to the basement or Crowhaven farm is better * Spoiler * First of all for a good scene like a shower scene. Bloodshed, you have a scene like an open scene .. Oh boy! The rubber hose in the garden is lively to make the teenager playful! Scary. In addition, what we understand about the house .. Obviously, it is necessary to use a video camera to see what happens and is a house that is emotional. Not a spirit or demon or entity. It is a house that "possesses" but by what we are led to believe that an object that does not exist, learn to love suzie / margaret. One scene that bothered me completely, this poor old woman came to tell you that she is your nurse, pouring her heart out, boiling in boiling trouble for 45 seconds and Margaret. What She risked her hand being burned to help this poor old woman who came there to warn her life? No, she stood there and watched! Most performances are better than average for horror movies. But that is the end At least it is an interesting and fun horror movie about an inanimate object that kills people who look at the bed of death: the bed that I eat. The first broadcast or remember that it made them scared like children. This movie is quite good.
