The film has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. It is a curious WW2 movie and serves as a statement about racism. It is worth watching to understand the fact that movies reflect the feelings we have about problems when produced and not about the amount of time they perform. Meaning, this is a 70s movie, not a 40's movie (WW2). There are still some good action scenes of seven black men, seven of whom are led by Captain White trying to capture the dam. The Captain's Center knows that these men are soldiers, not just service companies. There is one scene that may come from the Civil War movie and not the WW2 movie that reflects what is about Lt. Black for German women to peck without The white cheek and Capt. Became frustrated. I enjoy movies from curious spots, since stars and music genres are interesting to me.
