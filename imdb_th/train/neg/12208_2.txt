As a veteran, I was deeply offended by this film. In my opinion, it was a disgrace for those who fought in the Vietnam War. To say that the real SF soldier I know was invaded by this shit is exaggeration If the movie is presented as a wording or even a cartoon (it is), it will get better. But it is serious that most of my people, especially in foreign countries Stupid like listening everywhere I go to Europe in the late 80s. People seem to judge me and Americans in general in this film is unrealistic? Well, let's see cretin, with muscle and one syllable, pulled out of the prison gang to go on a secret mission at SE Asia to release the American POW In the fight that ran, he killed about 500 enemy soldiers with a M-60 machine gun that never lacked ammunition and never got too hot. And he never missed a run with a 32-pound gun that lifted one arm up to me, but I had a headache.
