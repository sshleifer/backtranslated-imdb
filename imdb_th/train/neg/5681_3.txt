After seeing and loving the zip code (Yes, I really love the postage) I decided to try the Uwe Boll film again and I chose the seed because I accidentally stumbled at a local DVD store and it should be one of him better than movies. <br /> <br / > While the first 10 to 15 minutes of this film are very promising and it seems that the beginning of a psychological thriller that is not too important, it falls from there and eventually decays. A typical slasher that I've seen, including a lot of holes, unrealistic emotional responses and sub-performances. It seems that Boll will try his best to get a good plot. But soon after he gave up Maybe he should stick to a joke ?! Some good things about this movie is that he can create an overall creepy atmosphere in which the special effects are better than I expected and the soundtrack fits well with the overall atmosphere. Its general nature made him the last half hour rather boring to watch, which completely destroyed my experience. There are shocking scenes that can do quite well. But they seem to be there for the shock only And don't forget the annoying camera work sometimes Filmed every time The seeds are not one of them.
