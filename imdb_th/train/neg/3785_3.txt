Speak like a true Uighur gang The story is not worse than many gangsters. But never confuses the film with The Godfather I or II or Goodfellas These are ranting to leave a bad hooligan. Pacino would be very good if they could dictate him. I'm looking forward to seeing Abrahams and Loggia, but their great accent makes them fun. <br /> <br /> Ah, the script isn't too hot. Don Corleone will make this story disappear five minutes after seeing him smiling and slapping the back all the time.
