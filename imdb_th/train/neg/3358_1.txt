Absolutely haunting. The original is a creepy psychological thriller and a game that has evolved over time. Compared to this 1999 remake, it's classic. There is no character development here, only a caricature (a slut, a right brain, "I'll take us out here", a very sensitive bookworm friend) but when seeing how the bank looks special Is a "star". I think the character that you can sympathize with is the second issue. Unfortunately, the effect is ludicrous, cherished, stretched doors, irritation, dead children who cannot speak clearly ... and the silly ending that makes you feel like It's a modern butterfly and a rainbow butterfly. I'll use my skittles with my mouth. Thank you Bruce Dern. I like you since "The Cowboys". Stop.
