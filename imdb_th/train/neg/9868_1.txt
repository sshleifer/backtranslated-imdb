I almost never comment on movies. But I saw 5 reviews that sparked the "movie" and decided that I had to weigh with my own opinion. My teacher received this film in the mail, mixed with his institutional screening (AMPAS, also known as the Oscar), and paved the floor with this horrific film-making method. our Show us how not to include movies. <br /> <br /> This film has no plot. The scenes are horribly correct. (It may be due to the technique of shooting in the form "24") and acting (especially the leader who fails to act like a bad actress) is mostly disgusting. There are people who do not really understand the starting point, namely the plot setting. No settings! Halfway through the movie, both myself and others in the class, learn what this movie should be about. The opening of the crane, which has set some murders, has never been resolved, and now that I think about it, it may be meant to be a flash forward with the rest of the film backward But it cut from that Go straight to the next scene without any indication. <br /> <br /> Well, I can really go on. At the very least, this movie gave me confidence in my ability to make movies.
