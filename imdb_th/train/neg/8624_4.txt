The performance is not great, the story is full of simplicity and transparent characters. It's about the impact of the fight between the right-wing voters blocking the right wing on the other side and the Moroccon people living in Antwerp in Belgium on the other side. Is it a political analysis? Is it the story of the modern West Belgium or Romeo and Juliet? This film is not strong enough to answer both questions. (If that is the question of the director), some scenes can act like Ken Loach in Antwerp. In the end, this city was the beginning of the Flemish party, blocked the right wing and was struggling with many problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It's very difficult to make a movie about this situation and this story is not successful. Even so, there is a story telling about the true and very complicated situation in Belgium today. A few foreign viewers who watch should try and enjoy it and realize that it is not an important real movie. But is a social dividing line that haunts Belgium, a country with a population of 10 million in the 2000s. <br /> <br /> Dongen
