My girlfriend and I rented this thing because we thought it might be a good 'Halloween' killer. Young people, scary, white masks ... you make me obsessed We are dead wrong! No pun intended We not only discovered one of the worst movies But also a classic movie too! It is filled with holes of plot and unreasonable. The actors playing Maddy are cute, but that's about it. I give credit because it was shot at a very low budget - I usually support such movies. Not just this one. <br /> <br /> This movie may look good if you're drunk or high. Otherwise, don't bother. If you don't want to lose your rights in the movie like I do!
