Actually, there are many things that are worse than this film. This movie is not Manos: The Hands of Fate or Troll 2 (Yes, I've seen both of them .. twice) But at the same time, this movie is No Alien, Predator or even Alien Vs Predator. This is better.) This movie makes Battlefield Earth look like Star Wars. It's terrible. Watch out for the Razzie Prize. Your biggest competition has just arrived at the cinema. This movie that I'm talking about is the only story that is alone in the dark. I'll try to take you in the order of the steps why this movie is so bad. <br /> <br /> Acting - First of all, I'll start with what might be the best element of this movie (next From the ending credits that played 'Wish I An An', the Christian Slater performance must be proud of himself. He succeeded in proving that it was possible to perform a good role in a movie that was worse than drinking medicine. Ice To say it made me wonder why he didn't walk half way, perhaps because Stephen Dorf was in the movie as well. (Some people he wants But may fail.) Tararade is a bad guy, an actor, but looks good and that's all really important in movies like this, not saying that the performance is perfect. But on average, it is not good and may be the only thing in a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The Soundtrack - except 'Wish I An Angel', the soundtrack is a heavy, pointless and bad coin. Was pumped into the audience's ear Tell a terrifying story (Something that I'm going to soon) 2 expensive and very long soundtrack CDs available for those with musical challenges. <br /> <br /> Director - Directed by director Hollywood's favorite U-Ball, who brought the classic home of death, told us, "Yes, this movie is terrible and that's just the beginning of my horror horror movie." At least it is said to be directed by Uwe Ball. Have to say I would guess that the monkey was abducted from Congo came here and was forced to comment on how the film was made under penalty scare. The director of photography is probably a video camera that is placed on a skateboard board. In the scene where the camera should be stationary, it moves all the time, not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should move while the camera stops for some reason. <br /> <br /> Producer - Who in the world is stupid enough? To bring money to this explosion? I pity the fool ... Sometimes I am glad that he or she has been taught this lesson in order not to waste money and waste. Then the dog droppings are tied in the bag. <br /> <br /> Write / storyboard - trying to analyze that story is more painful Then jammed, picked up the ice under the big toe and kicked the ball as hard as I could after that. But I'll keep trying. <br /> <br /> Edward Carnby escapes from the orphans at 20, where the children go under scientific experiments. He escaped and hid in an electrical outlet where he was electrocuted. (This is the point where it is terrible. I start laughing out loud). Then it will be quickly forwarded. Years later, he is a suspicious detective. He was attacked by some zombies who could not be shot, killed, and continued to move on with life. Later, he was attacked by a crazy monster and discovered a secret that no one knew. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is not really bad. This film expects us to read about 10 minutes, which feels like 100 random messages about unrealistic civilizations called Abskani. This film does not change one after another. A lot of viewers can handle a lot. More and the audience wants to manage more and the audience can take more care This story is so bad that even Double Dragon can do better. <br /> <br /> Overall, I missed this movie. I gave 1 out of 10 but that's because there is no 0.
