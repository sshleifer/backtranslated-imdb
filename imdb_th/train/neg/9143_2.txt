As an actor, I like independent movies. But this movie is the best amateur. <br /> <br /> The boy went to Vermont for government service. But when the plane landed, it flew over the palm tree - the director realized that Palm trees are not in Vermont? Pine trees - palm trees, numbers And likewise for wedding services - beautiful palm trees once again. <br /> <br /> When the boys leave VT, they don't seem to receive tickets in the major airlines because the plane was filmed. Express Do they deliver themselves overnight in the crate? Come see the little details with men like this. Separate the indie movies from the amateur completely. <br /> <br /> Christian brothers are players far more than Arthur with white hair and tattoos. His tribal tattoo Both should have a different role. <br /> <br /> The little character laughs and does something terrible. <br /> <br /> Applaud the director who made the gay movie. But pay attention to your location and Next time casting
