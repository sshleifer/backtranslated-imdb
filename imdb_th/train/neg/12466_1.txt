I can't wait to pick up a DVD after hearing this story. Really disappointing! This is one of the most confusing movies I've watched. There are many characters that suggest some like others, which is impossible to follow. I can't understand how George Clooney received the award for the film because he was almost unrelated at least in the first half of the movie My wife and I quit after suffering for about an hour and stop the DVD. I might think of fast forwarding to see if the ending is better. But after much confusion, decided that the opportunities for improvement were minimal. A colleague told me that the movie "came together" a lot at the last minute or less. I'm glad I didn't waste another hour waiting. I distributed the DVD the following day.
