I can't believe how scary this movie is; I rarely watch commercial TV, but I think "Well, Diane Keaton has always looked good." Everyone involved should hang their heads in shame. <br /> <br /> I know that there are not many great roles for women of any age. Surprised by the development that Keaton thought she could make silk bags from the ears of this sow. There is no character that is torn, unbelievable, and incredibly different. The performance seemed like training in class BEGINNING - I stared at the mouth of horror through most suspicion. "What are they thinking?" Very sad to come here. Don't waste your time.
