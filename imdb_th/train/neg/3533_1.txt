Let this movie act like a death knell for the "big" movie that occurred in the 1990s, known in some circles as The Kyser Soze Syndrome. The little hand of this movie was killed by M. Night Shayamalan and even Ron Howard use a variety of A BEAUTIFUL MIND. However, in REVOLVER, Guy Ritchie director (known in some circles as "Mr. Madonna") has used the Soze norm in a way that is more flattering. /> <br /> Jason's State <br Woodham (whose head is highly questionable) stars as Jack Greene. (Known as "Mr. Green") He may or may not be a criminal who thinks Mr. Gold Or perhaps Mr. Gould is a frustrating spirit that can be a member of the Mafia I'm not sure But I do not care. REVOLVER is one of the exaggerated examples of movies that I have a discontent that has to endure for a long time. Witness the fractured time structure, painful jumps, uninterrupted internal accumulation, and painstakingly illustrated animation sequences. Every style of governance and kitchen sink makes the layout of Quentin Tarantino look calm, smoke, movies and mirrors. I believe that Ritchie is tired of telling this boring story when I watch it. <br /> <br /> This film is full of shocking revelations. But they just come News for Mr Green I want to like green because I always enjoy Stratham as a character that lies ahead of others. Although here he is struggling like a reader to edit in the university's English literature class. His lack of intelligence coincides with the lack of restraint shown by his nemesis Macha (Ray Liotta). Observing the scenery like a hungry man at the smorgasbord Liotta spits crying and smoke through the film in an embarrassing performance. <br /> <br /> There is no qualification in exchange for REVOLVER. It is also a new trend faux leather from Ritchie and may overcome his worst SWEPT AWAY remake in the base. The worst of his films
