'Home Alone 3' is Home Alone's first film that doesn't show Culkin in the same main role and villain. However, the storyline is very similar to the movie 'Home Alone', rather than the two funny villains. This film involves traps. It has a long scene with a remote control car. The whistling sound is consistent as well. But the young boy and the villain failed to really make an impact in this movie (No pun) This movie doesn't give anything new or different from the previous movie, and there is no warm feeling, holiday or sub-story. But was not successful in making me laugh because the character didn't do it for me I will not recommend this movie; It's quite boring If you are looking for a good family holiday movie with comedy, then watch the original 'Home Alone' movie.
