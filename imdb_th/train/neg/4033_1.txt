It makes me very difficult to write nasty reviews. But without doing so, I just encouraged these people First of all, just because the movie is made on a small budget, doesn't make it good or be loved automatically. In fact, in this case, a small budget would probably be the only success in a movie that would prevent a lot of money from being struck on a race horse with legs. Have you ever watched a comedy movie at the theater? Had heard people laugh and thought "What are you ghosts?" Even these twats didn't laugh. My cat showered for the first time This is not a movie. This is a child .... No monkeys made a picture that makes you feel like you are moving to France. Must have a clown in my door .............
