This movie has a bad smell! You will want to come back to spend two plus hours in the process. Sliding doors, along with Paltrow ww / Gwyenth and directed by Peter Howe, do what Melinda & Melinda tries to make it a lot better. The film is intelligent and witty. I care about what happens to both the Gwyenths - or more of the characters that you play - and the performances that support the actors are excellent. <br /> <br /> At Melinda & Melinda is boring. Focus on these little people - minimal Melinda One Melinda is very unusual - her first glass of wine is at 10:00 am - and she can laugh with melodiousness and not in comedy. Melinda II is good but memorable. br /> <br /> Woody Allen's previous movie series worked because I guess he spent time with screenplays and actors. One noteworthy thing for this movie is that he wrote the screenplay in two months: You can tell, and while Chloe Sevigny has the ability - the people around her are not enough to appear at all. The film ends with Chloe Sevigny and others you know that you've seen in other movies. But can't remember who it is. <br /> <br /> very sad
