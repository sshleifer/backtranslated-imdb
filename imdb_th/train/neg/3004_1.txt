It's a terrible movie. Bad performances, bad pacing, poor filming movies, bad directors, "special" effects are not good. You expect some level of badness to hit. But even killing is not good. <br /> <br /> First of all, the past incidents that motivated the killing to happen for 15 or 20 minutes, I think it will not end. They can remove 80% and explain what has happened. <br /> <br /> Then the victims were invited to "Reunification" in an abandoned school that still uses all utilities One of the victims thought this was a little strange. But they were not interested and decided to continue to invade. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the killing was almost counterfeit. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to Watch this movie, except that you want to see the chest and not a very good chest. This movie makes the Showgirls indistinguishable from Citizen Kane.
