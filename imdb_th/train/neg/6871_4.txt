Great concept, wrong. Poor performance, writing worse than before .... After watching the first two, I wondered why it made the second season. The characters are memorable, bad writing. The dress is ok. Special effects are sad, just do much better in the same time frame - Where does this money happen? At first, the interesting start then fell quickly - all the rules of acting were ridiculous. Now don't understand me wrong, I'm a big sci-fi fan and 'geek' - but this show doesn't cut at all. As I said at first, I was truly surprised that the second season - much better, was canceled after one season (such as Jake 2.0).
