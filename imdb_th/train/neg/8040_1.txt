In the student dormitory, the man was sickly killed by a man. His girlfriend, Beth (Dorie Barton), discovers him and tries to commit suicide. She is an institution A year later, she went out with a new boyfriend named Hank. (Joseph Lawrence) and is about to take a spring break with Hank and four other friends who are not interested in beautiful large condos in Florida. By nature, the killer will appear. (Without reason) and start killing again. <br /> <br /> Lousy slasher thriller - an example in the book that will not make horror movies with a small budget. For most beginners of this film is an infinite filler of this six-figure video, with "fun" (more fun than the audience), drunkenness, acting stupid, etc. and there are no nudity in here. at all I'm not saying that horror movies need nude pictures. But anything that makes it lively can help. There is no real death shown (you hear them). It's just a little blood and no blood. There is one really scary - but that's not the end. <br /> <br /> There are a few exceptions that the performance is worse. Dorie Barton is a gruesome woman and Tom Jay Jones is a nasty person like Oz Chad. Allen appeared as Brad and he was scary. Lawrence is very good - handsome and handsome. And Jeff Conway appeared in a small role that performed well. <br /> <br /> The logic ended a lot - after they knew that a friend had been killed. Two girls intend to talk about sex. Baston did not respond to seeing a friend being killed as a joke and what happened to Lawrence? His character disappeared without a trace! Blunt, stupid, no nudity - skip this thing. <br /> <br /> Earn R points for graphic violence and rudeness.
