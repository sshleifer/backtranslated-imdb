When I first saw the cover of this film (The giant insect chases a few nurses) and the name "Blue Monkey". I know I'm not in a big Hollywood movie. I was surprised to see Steve Railsback in this cheese ball flick, which works well in everything he plays. The tackles .... FX is quite repetitive. Not sure why this movie is called Blue Monkey because there is nothing in this movie about monkeys. But come with people, what do you expect ?? It's not as bad as you think .... If you enjoy the black and white bug movie in the 1950s, this is an updated version with no special FX updates.
