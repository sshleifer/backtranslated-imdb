This will give you some plot along the Charlie Brown Christmas. It's one of the timeless classics that teaches Christmas values ​​and just enjoy the holidays. However, this is not possible. It tries to capture the emotions of A Charlie Brown Christmas despite having Christmas playing again. But failed with a lackluster and easy joke Charlie Brown didn't wonder about the spirit of Christmas anymore. But wanted to buy gifts for Peggy China (gloves, $ 25 ... what?). His sister Sally is the most annoying character in the movie. This is one of her jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa. But don't know how to spell Charlie (For some reason he wanted to be in her letter) so decided to name Sam for him instead of Sam's spell. In addition, Sally also played as an angel in the play with one word per day: "Hark!" She said instead Hockey (Harar) If Sally says hark 12 times (sounds strange too) will not kill you. Nothing will do. Peppermint Patty and Marcy are big gathering points. But it doesn't make it better. Marcy is a funny person when she answers Patty, but Patty is another story. She sounded like a boy. (Which did not dispel rumors) and became angry when she had to be a sheep in the drama Obviously she is a sheep every year and is worried that she will forget her line. (The lines that you didn't get) She was worried that she would talk about it twice, one story connected and received the same answer. I suppose that you have to lose short-term memories or something like Lucy and Linus. More welcome (although Linus still has annoying suggestions) but not much airtime. I'm sure Schroeder isn't here. Overall, it tries to be a parasitic original.
