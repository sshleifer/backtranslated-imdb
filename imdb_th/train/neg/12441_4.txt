Some things need to be explained. Mark Ferris's picture is not Mark Ferris, which starred in this movie. I know that because he is my father Please delete that image. In addition, Mark Ferris is also at least one writer. I tried to search for a copy or how to watch this movie again. For many years and if someone pointed me in the direction of receiving a copy This movie is not that bad and trying to compare it to the current world of Star Wars and other high-tech sci-fi. If you watch it, just enjoy it for the passion and humor it has. Turn on the light of being a movie watcher and enjoy less creative and creative movies.
