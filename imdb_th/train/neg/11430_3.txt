Okay, I ask for a new word coin here: polyphobia: the fear of a polyamorous relationship. This is another story in a long film that begins by shaking the audience about three types only, opening up a bit and preaching all. About the necessary methods and the only virtue in finding a single spouse There is only one person in the thousands who understands the happiness that has been loved more than one person and this director is not one of them. Bleh. <br /> <br /> Mark my words: a few decades. From this, polyphobia is becoming a faux-pas like homophobia, but guess who is too close to realize this? Yes, first time: the producer of this film And many more like that Why do you like this conservative and outdated movie? Proud of being open-minded gay, and able to see the fact that we live in an era in which a monogamous couple becomes the next married couple that turns into a swing and synthetic fiber. Open your eyes to your favorite people! <br /> <br /> This is a disappointing chick ball. (But damn I must say that Heather Graham is the most lovely thing in life) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
