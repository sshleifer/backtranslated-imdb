I trembled to think about what people have to think about environmentalists after watching this garbage. Full of slimness enough to make the Starlight store sell new things. Anyone who thinks that this world looks like a silly, stupid person like crystal To be a guideline for playing lingerie in flute in a mysterious mission to prevent the upcoming environmental collapse in the world. But first they have to get rid of the evil aliens who have nothing like refugees from Castro Street. Fortunately, they have a mysterious grandfather. Willie Nelson is ready to help. (Those who look embarrassed by the prosecution, just as they should be) with a cheap F / X tank and a swollen song that is pointless The monotony of this film and the staggering rhythm But that was only a small part of the iceberg that dissolved in this film. Everyone involved in this film should be revoked their union card until they truly complete the course of environmental science.
