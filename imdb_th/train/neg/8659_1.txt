There are some things I can't understand. Like this movie If I had to create a dino that was cheap and really crappy in the Maya and polygons, the crocodile in Maya then cut and pasted into an amateur video clip with a scream Who can believe that the CGC fake dinocroc that is completely out of place will influence the events of this movie? I know B grade, low budget and all But manufacturers can do better than making pieces of crap that no one has ever seen or sitting watching It's not reasonable. Is that really stupid? Will they sit on this? Obviously laughing? No, this thing is not laughing at all.
