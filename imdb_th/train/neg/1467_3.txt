It is not surprising that historian Ian Kershaw, who is Hitler's biographer, who had been a scientific advisor for a television movie, separated this story This film is not as accurate as history. The mistake began immediately when Adolf Hitler's father died at home, while in reality he died in the pub. In the movie Hitler moved from Vienna to Munich in 1914, while in reality he moved to Munich in 1913. I could go on to the end. Hitler's childhood and childhood were too short, causing people who did not know the history of the past to understand the characteristics of irritable nerves. An important person at the beginning of the party, such as Hitler's friend, Dietrich Eckart, or Alfred Rosenberg's "Guru", will be completely lost. In the film, he is shown to be an honorable character who almost insults Hitler. Obviously, the script follows the shadow of Hanfstaengl himself rather than his own perspective, which he gave in his history after the war. In fact, Hanfstaengl is anti-semen and is crazy about his "Fuehrer", but the biggest problem of this movie is Hitler's own image. He is characterized by an unfriendly person who has no charm or charm and orders everyone around him. After watching a movie and wondering how this nasty person can get followers Since we all know that Hitler is a villain, in nature, every playwright is tempted to show Hitler's image as disgusting and not entirely. But the fact is personal. He should be charming and entertaining. His companions didn't follow him because he constantly shouted at them. But because they like this strange guy In addition to all historical mistakes, this film has been well-built, first-class actors, images, locations and design work creating a convincing impression of that era.
