I will not take children under 8 years to see this. With a puppy hanging from a building that jumped through a dangerous machine and listened to Cruella's terrifying laughter to tell the name of certain events that made the young child wonder. Gives a more ominous feeling than a cartoon and has a little suspicious time, including some men who seem to be homo, a stressful time to worry and may be afraid Iron little kids <br /> <br /> I do not know what people are thinking in Disney. But the story and the show are not at the normal level. Cute puppy But this movie is the best point
