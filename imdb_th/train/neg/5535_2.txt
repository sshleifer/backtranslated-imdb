I think the biggest failure is boredom. Poor, really better than boring. This thing doesn't breath. It has interesting facts that have happened in Cambodia. The number of American movies made during the 30th century occurred in Cambodia. However, the conflict is difficult to understand. Even the movement of the military is still a little confusing. Something that dragged to a halt, resounding as a love story Why are these two men pinned to a blonde that I don't know? I think he should continue to use his Zombies (like them) and forget everything about her. The movie has just been busy. The perfect world is one of the main characters following the Cambodian priest through the water to go to a secret place with ancient Egyptian characters. I think they won't be there. A man takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other one is hidden behind some columns. He took two steps. He stopped. He looked around. The other man hid behind the bush. This is a short film. Then there was a dialogue that was shown and not interesting. I have a lot of patience when talking about the movie B. This can't be tolerated. By the way, the more appropriate name will be the rebellion of hypnotism.
