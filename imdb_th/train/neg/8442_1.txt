Gwen C. (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / Netherlands 2005) <br /> <br /> Muria Kraakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties who met her husband (Fedja van Huet), being unfaithful. To confront him She painfully avoided confrontation with human beings, her parents and her sister, so we have the main characters in the documentary film that doesn't do much. We almost don't know anything about her background or motivation. Just a woman who seems to be stuck in the cul-de-sac not only But in a difficult time in her life Obviously she suffers from something. But why do we in the audience suffer too? <br /> <br /> I almost gave up in the theater after seeing this unexplainable mess. These things are boring and painful. Normally 90 minutes I try to avoid losing energy in making bad movies. I will hit and roll with a punch. But in this case, there is a fair warning. Nanouk Leopold on the world receives funding. (Mainly from public funding) for this turkey Obviously there is no script to speak. It may be compensated by creative filmmakers who have only a small idea of ​​movies or actors with an interest. There is no concept. Just define clearly. "I want to do something from the point of view of women" The result is insult rather than tribute to the views of women in life. <br /> <br /> To make things worse, there are no interesting pictures. To be found in this movie I can't think of an actor who can make this story more interesting, but Johanna ter Steege is light (small) in darkness, if possible, without this terrible thing. I tried to imagine Leopold trying to direct Maria Kraakman: "Maria looks at the horizon. We'll shoot you three minutes, just show sadness." The perfect treatment for insomnia. Get a copy and watch late at night, guaranteed to make you sleep. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 1/10
