Investigative journalist Darren McGavin (as Karl Kolchak) comes back; This time he came after "The Night Strangler" again. Police officers and fellow journalists didn't believe or wanted to conceal a supernatural angle. Dan Curtis, the producer, presented the same basic story as his previous "Night" which was successful. Less than understanding. <br /> <br /> Mr. Curtis brings together fun actors, including alumni "Dark Shadows" George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis Jo Ann Pflug (like Louise Harper) as the dancer's head.

In the first scene, pretending to not believe in the existence of vampires! <br /> **** The Night Strangler (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
