Oh dear, I'm very disappointed that this movie is just a copy of Japan's ring. I guess the United States has made its version as well. But at least it is all reused So very sad I really enjoyed watching Filipino movies and knew that some wonderful things can come out of this small country, so I can't believe that this will happen. They were surprised that they would join the imitators. For filmmakers interested in the Philippines: You don't have to bend low to earn money. There are many movie lovers who are watching movies that Filipinos offer and enjoy them!
