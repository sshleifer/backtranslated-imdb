When the movie begins, the narrator reminds us that SCREAMING SKULL is very scary. You may die in fear - and if this happens, free burial is guaranteed. I don't think anyone will die from the fear of seeing this movie. But some people may die from boredom. SKREAMING SKULL is a movie that makes Ed Wood look good. <br /> <br /> Based on the story of Francis Marion Crawford, SKULL is Rich woman But nervous at marrying a scary man Died under mysterious circumstances Once installed in his home, she was tortured by a half-gardener who was shaped like a peacock and eventually had a skull that revolved around the room and made her scream. And for her credit, the actress Peggy Webber sings quite well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, her ability to do that is the highest point of the movie. The plot is quite transparent, speaks the least, and while the actors are okay, scary scripts and unsightly movies, so you'll be ready to scream yourself. It actually takes about sixty-eight minutes only. But it feels a lot longer Add truly awesome print quality and you are there. <br /> <br /> There are terrible movies that they look fun. It is true that THE SCREAMING SKULL has a few Howler - but this movie dragged me so much that I couldn't work more than occasionally giggling and everything above your head. If it's not Peggy Webber with screams, this will definitely be a way to cure insomnia. <br /> <br /> Amazon's GFT reviewer
