I was unlucky to have lost 10 quid in the purchase of the new movie of SS on the DVD: Attack Force. I can now suppress my faith in watching movies like this. A little salt and beer in the evening, dark on the couch, watching a late night filming, suitable for an alfa man like me. I bought this movie. I think I will see a great martial arts. <br /> <br /> <br /> I didn't get that old and swollen. The plot is ridiculous even with the standard. Of SS and to close all the performances of Segal (Such as starting with) is particularly bad In fact, it is really scary that half of his voice was dubbed by people who sounded like nothing like him. SS couldn't do anything anymore. (Suspicious point) of the crew is very scary in their work, they can't record the sound properly. The sound will flick back and forth between Mr Whisper Segal and those who voice the Honda advertisement. <br /> <br /> The smart story is not the point because most action movies work in the same place as this movie. Nothing new there The combination of the usual characters that will die horribly like gunfire and the bad guys who are going to be blown away. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as if you are avoiding the train. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br /> This is a public health warning.
