This movie must be the most stupid and stupid monster movie of all time. It is a complete joke that this story even appeared in the cinema. This is like watching a Loch Ness monster in rural America. This movie deserves to be thrown into the bathroom and forgotten. John Carradine is ashamed of you People involved in this garbage dump must be lobotomized. Wait! Maybe I credit them too much. I am sure that they have received the Loobot before filming. Another way can explain the stupidity and the utmost that this tank of shit has. Don't waste your time watching this life. Do not waste time submitting reviews.
