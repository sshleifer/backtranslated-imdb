I know John Singleton is a smart person because he created Boyz N The Hood. How can he write and direct this? It's like a pilot of a teen soap that will "Escape to school for the first time" A boring parade and repetitive thoughts with unreasonable violence that has been thrown in for a commercial proposal. Who would have guessed that dating rape victims would leave sausages for seafood? The angry and lonely loner will be a group of victims of Neo-Nazis (and must be black and Jewish - just to laugh!). Like everyone involved with this film, just spoiling the story, except Busta Rhymes. Of course, Big Up.
