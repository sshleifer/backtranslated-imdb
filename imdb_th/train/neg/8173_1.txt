One of the most boring slashers ever .. If you can call it I wouldn't watch it if it ended up being a porn movie, which is similar to The fact that you are watching a small group of middle-aged people in the forest is almost unbearable. They created this type of movie for teenagers, so who are they targeting when they make this movie? The part that I like in this movie is the cover and is the only reason I chose to search for this movie that was part of the Suspense Classics 50 .. And after watching other 50 movies in this series I will know that there is no other place. So if you are in a mood that is suitable for a wild slap, I recommend Just Before Dawn and The Final Terror.
