After seeing a movie trailer in the theater, I think it was the original concept of a thriller set in the competitive world of a computer company. Every actor is another message that this movie should be good. But when I didn't go to see it in the first week of the release, it disappeared within 2 weeks. I was afraid that something would be missed. Patiently waiting for me to release the DVD and buy it, hurry home to see a fun evening Expectations on the way home are much better than this movie. For starting the direction is awesome. It doesn't have any ideas at all and the director is involved with himself so he can appear in the movie. I will not hurry to hire him in the future. Secondly, the leading role is completely ridiculous. As Ryan Phillipe, Phillipe's characters are usually cool characters like Cruel Intentions and the Way of the Gun. In this regard, he should be a terrifying hero. Which he tried to show by slipping when he ran Female actress Rachel Leigh Cook and Claire Forlani do not have enough qualifications. But when they didn't perform their best The only highlight of this film is Tim Robbins, in a role that can be created for him, and it's a hot temper and his mysterious way to drag the movie. The last issue is that this movie is another story that fills the movie trailer with scenes that you don't see in the movie and instead shows only in the deleted scenes of the DVD, causing more disappointments, even though some of these scenes are rough.
