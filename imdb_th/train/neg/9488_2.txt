I've seen horror horror movies in my time and while this isn't the worst of the group. But of course in the second half The script starts to close. The young doctor went to the hospital for internship, hoping that it would make him a better job for him and his future wife. Cute? The movie will go straight to the bathroom when you know that something is killing the patient. It turns out that there are demons on the basement that harvest people's spirits. It was the work of 1 doctor, 1 nurse, and 1 security officer in all hospital staff to drag the mental patient downstairs. Doing a ritual that would involve cutting the tongue and allowing the haunted house of devil To come out and steal his soul through the magic of magic special effects At this point, this movie was very stupid. I asked for it to end. There is still one hour to look like the "Tales From the Crypt" episode, half an hour, which sometimes stretches into one and a half hours of shit from Tiny Lister that serves as the best imitation of John Coffey (The Green Mile) With Tracy Scoggins, who plays Ratchet's frozen frozen Ratchet. This movie failed at all levels. I gave this 2 stars for two reasons only. 1) His fianc√© is quite hot. She relieves the pain. And 2) this movie looks better than the current horror movie made from the quality of Wal-Mart's home camera. <br /> <br /> Finally, avoid this chaos even if you have a movie. The Blockbuster story (which I do and I still feel cheated) as a bonus drinking game, you and your friend will shoot every time Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head while talking. You will be drunk for 15 minutes in the movie.
