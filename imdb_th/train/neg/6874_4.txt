Jean-Marc Barr (as Light, The Big Blue, Dogville) directed and interpreted this strange movie, which is the second episode of the trilogy. I might be wrong, but I don't think this movie is part of Dogma '95 manifesto even though it looks real I'm not really sure about what I think about this movie. Every actor is good. They performed very well, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. Any interesting story. But I don't know there is something about movies that I don't like. The sex scene is too long. It started with interesting artworks to erotic parts that I didn't know where it was. Of course, it's not a bad movie. But I will not advise others to see it, whether I tell them that they shouldn't see Do as you want If you are curious and open-minded, try it. You may like
