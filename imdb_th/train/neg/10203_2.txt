Writing is a very sloppy story. The director is fluent and editing makes it worse. (At least I hope it will be corrected) The performance is not bad. But it is not good as well Rather, there is no satisfactory character, at least 45 minutes of the movie, that is a waste of time and an hour or more is not used anywhere near the full potential. It is a good idea But there is still a good idea to lose It may end up with 3 places, but it is still the end of the predictable Hollywood. And the unpredictable things are not good until they are not important The ending is not worth watching at all. Sandra cow left her element and should stay away from this type of movie. The movie looks hasty as well. This movie isn't really worth seeing, and I paid for it. I'm very angry. Maybe I'm more disappointed because I expect to be a very good movie and get a bad story. This movie is not bad. But I don't recommend again. I give 2 out of 10 b / c. I like this idea a lot and I like one character. And it has a very cheap way to conceal the plot hole It's like trying to cover the volcano with cheap adhesive tape. It's not pretty. However, if you see it, wait for the theater or video for $ 1.50, unless you like all the movies you see. I think you like this movie.
