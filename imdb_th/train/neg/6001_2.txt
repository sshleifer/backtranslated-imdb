This may sound crazy even to those who remember this item ... but I remember this was a live performance. I don't think I've seen cartoons, but movies may be. I remember very clearly. The man is in a building that looks like a showroom. He also has a red coat. It was dark and he turned into a red car and this man, on the second level, looked down at him. The car / man turned around and crashed through a large exhibition room window and out into the road. Then drive That's all I can remember. I hope that others will remember this as well. If not, I might still be crazy. But i hope i won't
