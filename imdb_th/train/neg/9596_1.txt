There is no benefit in trying to glorify any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a trash. At first, you may think that you are in the process of filming beautiful movies with eyes ... and after a while, you are being sacked (canvas) FAIL! The fight is hardly the art of acting, it stagger on the edge of the par and the music is not worth explaining. There is only one thing that will create an excuse for this movie to be created. The decisions that the characters do and the way they handle the situation are weak and do nothing but make me frustrated. I think the only reason this movie is about serving fans is by using Yumiko Shaku.
