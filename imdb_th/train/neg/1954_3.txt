First, let's get to know each other first .. Yes, this movie stole many things from 'Darkness Falls' (2003). The plot of 'Darkness Falls' looks like this: The Fanny Fairy, a female killer who hides the face. Her due to disfigurement, killing people who look at her with revenge in the 'The Tooth Fairy' (2006), the disfigured Tooth Tooth (who, yes, hide her face), release her anger for everyone It's a bit too similar to being a coincidence. <br /> <br /> But what to ask is: if you steal the exact story from the movie directly, why choose something that looks like 'Darkness Falls'? ? Of course, it made a few dollars at the box office. But that is a strict matter for the theater experience that this film sent Movies with a low budget and straight to the video will not have the same effect. And it can't be <br /> <br /> While I watched the film open 15-20 minutes, my expectations increased. At least it seems to have some production value. The story doesn't look scary, just tearing blatantly. In the past, the first scene, we received an informal character, including a former doctor who had a secret. (Performed by a person who looks like Busey) and a famous veterinary student (Jenifer from 'Masters of Horror: Jenifer') of Argento. However, after a few minutes the movie slowly drained. It serves all the daunting basic clich√©s, including but not limited to: some old mad men who have warnings that are not cared for, mute jock, buffalo, psychic and stripper with a gold heart One of the biggest problems in this film is that it cannot be attached to the target group. It's like the filmmakers want to change the tone for every character on the screen at that time. When adults are on the screen, it gives a more mature feeling when Starr (the stripper) and whatshisface (jock) are on the screen. The conversation goes down to a more dull level. When the child is on the screen, it feels like the episode of 'Are You Af, afraid of the Dark?' .. less scary only. <br /> <br /> Technically, this movie is everywhere. The images range from quite good to boring levels. Writing is subpar, like most performances. On the positive side, there are some parts that penetrate too much blood. (Including the carpentry scene (And painfully predictable)) and the nail gun scene is quite scary In addition, if you are looking for something sexy that has a short nude scene (but if you want to see this chicken breast, have a better movie to do), besides, there's nothing annoying when it comes to this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of 'Darkness Falls' (actually?), you might try To see stories made in different ways .. but that's the only reason I can see this. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 3/10-AP3-
