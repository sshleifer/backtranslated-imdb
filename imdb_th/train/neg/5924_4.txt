Diana Muldaur appeared on Star Trek for the second time. But this time is a different character No one on the board seems to notice - probably because of me. Regardless of whether this time she was not worshiped by God (See the previous episode) but is a very famous woman with magical powers that allows her to communicate and watch Medusa without being mad. Unfortunately, the person who loves you the most is a few cards that are full and he tries to kill the ambassador of Medusa. (Which is strange, living in a small crate - this is a terrifying way of traveling) and unfortunately Muldayr didn't hurt himself well What will happen next is stupidity and when I saw the first time I felt relieved. Seeing all the men on the ga-ga ship above Muldaur is rather stupid and Spock's performance when he is crazy Do something you like yourself - if you have never seen an item before, choose another episode.
