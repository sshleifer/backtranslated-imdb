Do not watch this EXCUSE SAD for movies. I waste time and money on this, and I feel bad about it. <br /> <br /> The performance is comparable to the drama of high school The script is shocking. There is no twenty-minute plot from the end. (Which I believe that I should have won when) Today there are movies recommended) instead of graphics. But I found that the characters were so annoying that I wanted to see them and everyone involved in creating this piece died in the most terrible way possible. Ten minutes in my life help you escape from poverty in your 100 minutes. Don't do it.
