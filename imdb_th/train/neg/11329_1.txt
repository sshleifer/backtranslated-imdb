Elizabeth Taylor was unable to perform at all, and she was just an annoying and self-destructive person in this movie. This is before she is very fat. But she still looks short and unwieldy Rock Hudson is OK as Bick Benedict, but obviously the actor with more range like William Holden would definitely be better. James Dean proved that he knew how to mumble his way through the movie. All movies are incredibly slow and continue for too long. All actors are too young and lightweight and no one is old enough to convince due to poor makeup. Hudson looked ridiculous, just padded out and Dean and Carroll Baker clearly saw the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10
