I was amazed at the many comments on this show about its reality. Maybe I am not part of the same universe because if Veronica Mars is what it is, it will be in the top. <br /> <br /> The show is chewing the scenery with enthusiasm and plot. There is a hole in which you can drive. The truck passes. That's not what I call true. <br /> <br /> It has a strong desire to "relate" which shows only Rob Thomas and His team was cut. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found it the best for napping and the worst was a bit more annoying. Kristen Bell looks like she is a good actor. But it is difficult to tell with the style that is superior to all performances
