Sean, you know that I think you are the greatest actor in the world. But I can't praise you in this matter Funny, not your strongest set. <br /> <br /> However, it's not all your fault. Some things are too difficult to understand. Alfred Lynch works well But you have to wonder if the line came from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Again, Sean ... I'm sorry.
