The last film of Johnny Weissmuller as 'King of the Jungle' after 16 years in the role of TARZAN and THE MERMAIDS must be disappointed, but his fans are the most enthusiastic at the age of 44, the former Olympic athlete, one of Hollywood's 'Animal Party' has been a young athlete in his childhood and is tired. (Although he was in a slightly better condition in the previous shows TARZAN and THE HUNTRESS). <br /> <br /> Not only Weissmuller is too old for his role. Johnny Sheffield, the quintessential 'boy', grew up to be manly (he was 17 years old), so he was written out of the script under the pretense of 'Going out to school', Brenda Joyce, 35 years old, appeared in the fourth film from her five stories 'Jane' (she will give the transition when Lex Barker becomes New Tarzan in 1949 of MAGIC FOUNTAIN TARZAN)> <br /> Produced by Sol Lesser at RKO with a small budget. Actors and teams take advantage of cheap labor by filming in Mexico. While the location of the Spanish air was absolutely decisive to what should be the darkest Africa, the veteran director Robert Florey used the country extensively to combine diving, cliffs and Aztec temples with the story. <br /> <br /> When the young island girl (Tyrone), the future bride of Power Linda Christian) was rescued in the wild river by Tarzan, he learned that the local high priest (George Sookk, one of the most enduring villains of the film) has truly enslaved people in the area.

Who sang many songs) and the bureaucrats would go out. Angels and priests (The poor cheetah was left behind) After continuous discovery ('God' is only a male prisoner in the Aztec mask, working with monks in milking the pearls of the island's rich pearls). Where quarrels and relief and comic songs by Benjy all arrived Expecting to have a happy conclusion. <br /> <br /> Amazingly, TARZAN and THE MERMAIDS have musical scores from the best film composer Dimitri Tiomkin and better than you'd expect from the movie 'B'. this! <br /> <br /> While the film gives less time than the auspicious time in Weissmuller in Tarzan's loincloth (he will play Jungle Jim immediately, which is a different form of Ape Man in khakis). Related to raising the overall product level, at least above all the confusion that had previously been. <br /> <br /> Tarzan is about to be compensated and become more sexy ...
