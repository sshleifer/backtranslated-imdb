I am about 7 years old when the movie DIRE MONSTROSITY of this movie was released. In the UK, advertised on TV in the summer of 1977 for several weeks as if it were an incredible blockbuster movie. It's the first movie I've seen in a movie theater and I've been delayed for many years. The following week I was invited to watch the new movie "Star Wars" and I refused. To this day I have never seen it in protest that must see Bigfoot! Seriously, even at the age of 7, I was able to tell that I was watching garbage. It's so bad that it's almost unbelievable. Travel nonsense that should not be done in the cinema. However, I am amused to read many years later that the director has never directed it like I was concerned. Avoid all costs !!!
