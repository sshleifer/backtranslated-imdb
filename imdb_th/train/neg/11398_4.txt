I saw this film primarily to see Brooke Burke (as Jill), which I briefly met in LA at a replica trade show in her first documentary. I hope to see you more. But thought she was doing very well Since she is a beautiful and stable TV host and model, it is not surprising. I was left wondering why she was killed and what happened as a result. Maybe I'll miss it. <br /> <br /> I'm not really sure about this type of film, and even though I like actors, I feel like it's for college audiences. I try to open my heart because of horror, not the type I like. But felt that I grew up Seems to be dragging away in some places, making you guess at some places about the evil power that Professor has, and like many other movies that have an unsatisfactory end. <br /> <br /> Write a few scripts I know that this is difficult and may occur with personal opinions, the number of movies you have watched and studied and what you have been involved in. <br /> <br /> In short, I find it interesting. But not a satisfying plot and ending for me if Jill (Brooke Burke) will come back through the portal at the end and kick everyone's ass to end satisfactorily and will get Higher score
