Some people do this movie because they question the credibility of black people in the Old West, Asian people in the Old West or women with guns in the Old West era. Get a bundle and read books. There are no Asian people (Chinese). How many people have a small number of blacks (freedoms) and everyone outside the class of foreigners can access firearms? Is the second revision that you know And as far as the modern language is used, those westerners do not think about the truth about the actual language that corresponds to the era that appears The American people have different accents, using very different words and using many words and phrases that cannot be recognized today. Do not accuse the historical inaccuracies because you are not digging honestly. Maybe you are uncomfortable with what you see.
