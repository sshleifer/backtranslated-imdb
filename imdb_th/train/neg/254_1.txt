How can I hate you? Let me count the ways 1. You try to be funny. But there is repetition and not fun Every joke can be predictable and expected, and when it comes to not inspiring laughter. I want to hurl instead. 2. You try to play the drama. But unbelievable That woman overacts a terrifying level and "bad guys" look like Bill Gates and it's a scary story ... Bill Gates (just imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate someone with a gun, doesn't it work? The lawyer may But not the gun does not fit) for Jamie Foxx and watch him with effort Sending an incredible and sincere conversation is a laughing matter and makes me want to fling. 3. You try to be packed with action. But boring and dragging too often And when the action scene warms up, the tripod must disappear because the scene vibrates over the scene in The Blair Witch Project and I find myself nauseous and again I want to cast. 4. You try to be a movie. Good But you fail, you fail, you fail! I want to walk barefoot across the Sahara desert, full of jerky flesh and without water, no sunscreen and only Meryl Streep for the company. This hell is more cute than the one minute watching everyone in the bait than They will go through a crazy story with Bill Gates for the bad guys and don't even talk about the huge bombs that drove into the car that Jamie Foxx's character had just pushed the CLIFF out to escape. .. Just kill me now or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I won't have to watch a bad movie again.
