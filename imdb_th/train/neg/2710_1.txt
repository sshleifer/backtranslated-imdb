Anyway, they concluded the 60s, ten years that changed our country severely within four hours. And it was painful for four hours They used important events and minor events and they "claimed" it about two families. But you can hardly see the African-American family. If I were NBC, I would be ashamed and embarrassed for broadcasting such trash. The amusing thing is that the happy family that you were lucky in the beginning was tortured in many ways, but was able to attend every 60 major events across the country And the second family is not a factor as well They devoted five or six scenes to this family. That poor son ... please. NBC. Don't make movies about other ages .... Leave it at PBS and the historical channel.
