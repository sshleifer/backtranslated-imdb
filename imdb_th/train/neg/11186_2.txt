I want to watch this movie But one scene that is ridiculous, strange, after that another scene forced me to close it The characters don't seem to respond at all. Consider this: Heath Ledger is walking one night. (Through the cemetery that I believe) when he was attacked by the spirit which he drove away After passing this test, he walked away peacefully and met with friends who saw everything. When asked what had happened, he said "Attacked by demons, nothing serious." As if this was just a thrilling thrill than a little flat tire. <br /> <br /> I closed it when they asked. The devil or something I stop taking care of - Ion ques. The answer can only be released from someone with the power of their death, and the priest watching in what appears to be a vague annoyance when a man is frustrated. And hanged br /> 0 full stars from ****
