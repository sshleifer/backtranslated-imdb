I do not understand all of these positive user reviews. This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen and I am not trying to look pessimistic. <br /> <br /> Eva Mendez is hot but very bad in the movie. But I don't think it's her fault But as a director He can make everything look fake. Their performances, makeup ideas, everything <br /> <br /> The stars that I gave are for bad movie behind-the-scenes ideas. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this nonsense Go to see Fellini, Woody Allen or David Lynch.
