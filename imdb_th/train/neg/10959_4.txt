I'm a big fan of the series and read all 7 books. I want to see this thing just to see what it does. All I can say is that there is only one person who should be able to see this, who is reading the series and wants to know about it. It's terrible and will make you unreadable. Does not mean either But Lucy is too ugly from the movie Are you the daughter of the director? Seriously, I'm sure Beaver in this film jealous of her teeth. She has a pitcher's teeth that will make any animal type a disgrace. The movie loses a lot of translations. CS books do not translate as easily as Tolkein's LOTR books or even Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> One thing they do right! Aslan! Well done, even though other actors with painted faces (Wolf Beaver) looks stupid, but Aslan is doing very well because it's not just the human actors who walk around. (I guess it's like an old horse that is raised or has 2 people inside?) Also, I want to know what children think about this movie. Maybe they will enjoy it? But for adults, safe betting, they will never be CS fans
