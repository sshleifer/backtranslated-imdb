Japanese original movie "Gamera" http://65.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ Original is the movie Gojira (Godzilla) that focuses on younger children in the 1960s. Of course, Gamera is a giant turtle that can fly and throw a flame. The fire that consumes real energy - not as big as some Godzilla models, but is generally the most similar. <br /> <br /> This original movie version has been edited and performed by the famous Sandy Frank and the American Godzilla ( "Godzilla King of the Monsters ")," Gammera the Invincible "received more than misspellings The American scene is not as ridiculous and annoying as the scenes added to the great Gojira, but it doesn't add much to it because it has very little track. <br /> <br /> This movie starts at Bright has a scene that is worthy of character development and has enough personality to create tension outside the main plot. However, when Gamera appeared, the movie began to enter the kaiju movie, which was quite messy. <br /> <br /> The performance was good, even the American add-ons were ok. The director is quite good for this time and genre, and the special effects are not bad for their time (all the thumbnails). Some scenes and scenes are very good. <br /> <br /> Of course. The biggest problem here is that there are few manuscripts about this movie. However, Camera has developed a personality that is unique in his next film, which is most likely to be seen if you are a kaju fan.
