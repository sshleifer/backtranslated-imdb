This movie is totally rubbish. Some mental retardants comfort themselves by doing their best to claim that noble nobles have a working class. Nothing more than a piece of disgusting self-disgusting <br /> <br /> If this type of movie is set in the United States, it will make itself a great joke. And just because it comes out of the 'other side', it makes itself a masterpiece, a great fun for brainwashing and / or brainwashing. West (George W. maybe :) The sequel of the common cold war is a joke. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that if this - like that shown in this movie - was something that Soviet intellectuals had thought for years Perhaps they deserve all the misery that they claim they have passed away, but none! Because like everyone else, I have read and looked at the true masterpieces of the great Soviet intellectuals. For example, something related to dogs "White Bim Black Ear" - both Gavriil Troyepolsky's book and Stanislav Rostotsky's movie - True masterpiece The real life, the real tragedy, the real sad, the pride and dignity, reality, which is one of the best of the Soviet era.
