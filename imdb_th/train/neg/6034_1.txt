Oh, where do I start ... This movie is very scary. Poor writing, poor performances, bad special techniques I think the only good thing about this movie is that it makes me laugh! I'm in the mood to create a horrible movie. But not so! I think it's good enough since I'm not picky. I have watched many horror movies. In fact, it's my goal to watch every horror movie, no matter how scary they are. At one point in the movie I commented on "Blood, corn syrup" and in the special properties that they admit is the Karo syrup (brand name corn syrup ...). ) But it is not perfect to make it good The author should take some lessons or just give up!
