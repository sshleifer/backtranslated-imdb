I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. Especially since Juhi Chawla is here. She is a great actor. <br /> <br /> The film has six stories. It's a new concept flying from Hollywood. So it's not a new item. <br /> <br /> 1 Khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. She wants to be famous and a fan so the journalist is interested in her. But then Rahul (Salman Khan) is Appeared and he claimed to be her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Priyanka Chopra is still a good actress. When she shouted, I felt annoyed. Salman khan couldn't play the cartoon role. But in his serious part, he is fantastic. <br /> <br /> 2 Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla). He is in crisis in the middle of the year and has received much attention from young women. Forget what he has in his life, his wife and children. <br /> <br /> Anil kapoor en Juhi is a natural actor / actor. They are excellent But this story is thin for them. <br /> <br /> 3 Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) is about to marry Gia (Ayesha Takia), but he gets a cold foot and blows the wedding. <br /> < br /> 4 Ashutosh (Joh Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). She had an accident and lost memories. Now she doesn't know that she loves her husband anymore. <br /> <br /> 5 Raju (Govinda) is a taxi driver. He met Stephanie. (Shannon S. Reichwitz), a white woman who loves Indian men But he is getting married to an Indian woman. Raju must bring Staphani to that man. But falling in love with you <br /> <br /> I didn't like watching Govinda's movies. He was annoying and not funny. But in this movie, I like him a lot like he had grown many years ago. <br /> <br /> 6 Oh yes! There is Sohail Khan! He plays Ram Dayal, who recently married Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar). He wants to do something seriously with her. But every time her family comes in <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is not a handsome actor. I like his movies. <br /> <br /> Now this is the problem. This whole story is not interesting. In making one story from six unattractive stories, not making the movie both interesting! Here and there are stories that touch each other. But not important for the character. <br /> <br /> My conclusion Priyanka can't do it! Let that woman in the Bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should make more movies. This role for him is too small. Salman Khan can't show the comic. But is a serious movie Written about his life as an actor This movie absorbs and is a great actor and actor like Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> It's like you have the ability to make movies with Amitabh Bachchan. And you let him sing a lullaby
