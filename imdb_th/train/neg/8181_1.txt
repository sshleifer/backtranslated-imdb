I went to watch this movie (Actually, I watched the Family Portraits, which has a cut-off time + 2 short films by Douglas Buck) at the Mar del Plata (Argentina) festival ... I can't see! I have to close my eyes after the first half of the cut and look every time while By the time my stomach was upside down and I felt that the head was light. I just got out of the cinema for a few minutes after the short start. 2 (BTW, of course, I'm not the only one out of the room). I'm really impressed with the brave people who love it. I don't understand how you can love that type of movie! The shocking and bloody and terrifying images that I saw caught in my head for two days !! I tried to analyze the story. (My girlfriend saw everything and told me about it) and I just thought it wasn't reasonable. I mean the number of violence and things that are no other reason than trying to shock people. And that's not a good reason. I think Nothing in this movie that I can say that "Okay, at least x 'about it. Good." But I guess I won't understand that kind of movie.
