This movie is full of endless surprises! When you think it's not going to be worse, they add more joints and a van with more fuzzy pink stripes and pornographic sex scenes. As you can guess, I was a victim of the original version. We were tricked into watching it. Think of it as a supervan. A host box that promises Lazarus, prison breaks and many more. Who would think that the Dollar Store Christmas gift would be fun!
