I bought this DVD because there is a kari in it and the mpaa ratings say; "Rated R for violence and sexuality, nudity and language" <br /> <br /> which should be an IMO correctly br /> The word "sex" should come after "commas", not "and" because of the dramatic differences in the meaning created. I think many people who watch this movie will agree with me that most sex and nudity do not exist. My first impression when I watched the mpaa ranking is that I would watch the "bright" movie. That's the reason I felt cheated. The wise story is so-so after all that really cares about the story. If the beautiful kari is in there I know I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> This is just my opinion. <br /> <br /> Joseph
