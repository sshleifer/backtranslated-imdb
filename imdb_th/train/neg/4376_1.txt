OK, the plot is waiting for you, I don't have a real visible plot here, just a foggy sex scene that has been concealed by the scene of a photographer taking pictures of beautiful women (some Times are a combination of two people), men rape and killing women and waxing poems about the meaning of life. Moronic special effects, bad performances and strange philosophy, you get what you expect from this famous movie. I guess it must be someone's cup of tea, not mine, because I haven't watched the movie directed by Kazuo 'Gaira' Komizu. <br /> <br /> Special DVD: Director Kazuo Komizu Interview 1 (Episode 2 is on the DVD of a beautiful woman); And Theatrical Tailer <br /> <br /> My grade: F
