"Valentine" is another horror movie added to the slash movie list (think "Halloween", "Friday 13", "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer. ") Of course, it's not as good as the movie I specified. But better than most movies that came out after the first film "Friday the 13th". One of those movies was 1981 Canada made "My Bloody Valentine" which I hate so much "Valentine" is a better movie than that. But it doesn't say much. Story: A stupid boy is mocked and pranked by two of his classmates at the beginning of the movie. After that, the film was moved many years later when those classmates grew up and then they were selected individually. The killer assumes that he is a boy. Now everyone grows up to seek revenge. But can he or someone else be "Valentine" with interesting actors including Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton , Jessica Capshaw and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can with the content they receive. But the lackluster script did not make them fair However, there are some terrible moments throughout <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
