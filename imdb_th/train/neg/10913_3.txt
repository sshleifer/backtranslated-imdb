Marvin (Rob Schneider) doesn't have the ingredients to be a cop, which is his lifelong dream. But his luck changed when he had a car (A terrible car) and was found by a doctor Doctors will have to use animal organs to create new ones. After this period, he began to unconsciously behave unconsciously and became the best police ever. At that time he became aware of his changes and his animal instincts began to dominate his human side. At that time, he met a lovely woman and tried to be a perfect gentleman, which meant that he had to control himself and behave as a civilization. I don't enjoy Rob Schneider. In fact, this is his first movie I've ever seen. However, I can easily say that he is the best person to play. (See his part in Ally Mcbeal. Really funny.) There are some good parts in the movie, such as flirting with goats. In this film, the biggest problem is that the script seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent. I'm sure this movie is okay to watch as long as it's not too serious. But very sad to see this film doing very well at the box office. The Animal is not the worst movie I've ever seen. But not more than *
