This is the worst performance. Buntch grew up acting like a child. No humor. Nothing. Even Sesame Street has a better sense of humor and more adult friends. "Friends" may be the worst thing I've ever seen on TV and I'm sitting. In front of the tube, observing friends "is not good with other contemporary people. The series lacks the intelligence of "Seinfeld" and the excellent self-mockery of the catastrophe that is the highlight of "Frasier". The characters in "Friends" seem to have been designed to make them chase. br /> <br /> The unwise performance is complete without any sort of sequence. The character is a caricature of a caricature and the writing is very complex - even if it is intended. The author may have to be a slave to set a goal that is lower than his ability to not be confused with the faithful friend of "friend").
