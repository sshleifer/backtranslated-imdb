THE KING MAKER will be incredibly successful in Thailand with similar 'The Legend of Suriyothai' box office revenues. (But above) the movie directed by Lek Kitapraporn, after Sean Casey's screenplay based on historical truth in 1547. Siam has an amazingly beautiful visual element. But was disarmed from the script, the pedestrian script and the development of the story on the film The incident involving the image was the arrival of the Portuguese soldiers of fate, Fernando de Gamma (Grand Stretch), whose revenge for this father's murderer caused him to be wrecked, captured and thrown.

Music score by Ian Livingstone sounds like it is an old TV soap operas. But if it is a beauty that sees you afterwards, there are many, and that only makes the movie look worthwhile. It is a film that has a markedly high financial support for special effects and a crowd of actors and determines and shows good intentions. It's just the basic missing. Grady Harp
