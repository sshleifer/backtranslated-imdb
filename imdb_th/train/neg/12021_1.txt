That may be quite serious for me to say that. But sadly, in his directing career, it's true Just see what he has done. They almost made it through the 3-star mark. <br /> <br /> Why am I watching this movie? 2 Reasons Lucy Lawless and Heroes play as Greg Grunberg. Lucy is outstanding in this film. Her performance includes both movies. I hope you get "Blockbuster" and broke into a bigger group of actors. She has clear skills. Greg is not impressed with the style of the TV show. <br /> <br /> The film is categorized as a horror. The only "horror" is a short flashback and they take a maximum of 2- 5 seconds with a little blood in them Personally, I would call this "drama / thriller movie" <br /> <br /> But no matter how interesting the story really is, bad governance, editing and acting. You are not really connected to the actors. Very important in this kind of story. You just sit there without feeling anything. It's like watching a bad TV soap .... Actually, I think TV soap is more interesting. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay away from this movie ... or good. Than Hurst associated with
