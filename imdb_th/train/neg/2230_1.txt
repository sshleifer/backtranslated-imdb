If you want to see karate experts, retarded, mentally retarded, try the Mexican gangs, scrambling hard for an hour over and over again. This is the movie for you. If you don't choose another DVD from 20c bin, which is the only place in the movie. This is the owner. The show was so scary that I had to force myself to watch it until the end. The cover makes it look cool. But is another cheap film, gangsta grade, 2 gram lines and keys, streetz blood and danger. I'm not going to buy or rent this movie until you plan to be drunk and plan a fix and the show really doesn't matter to you. It's the worst movie in the history of mankind !!!
