When I was a child in the 1970s, there was a local theater for children to play Matinees every Saturday and Sunday afternoon. They show this for about a year at Christmas. Me and some friends went to see it. I expect to be a cool Santa Claus movie. What I received was very dubbed. (You can tell) and truly creepy movies. <br /> <br /> Something about Santa Claus and Merlin the magician. (Do not ask me what the two are doing in the same movie.) Satan fighting (some clowns in the stupid satanic suit have horns!) The pictures I have cringe in my seat. I often find Santa terrifying to start with, so it doesn't help anything. The man in the Satan suit doesn't help anything. But the really scary thing for me is the wooden deer antlers that pull Santa's sleigh. When he wound them and the creepy sounds they made and movements - I remember the nightmares about those things! Many years later, I still remember walking out of the theater rather than being disturbed by what I saw. My friends are afraid too. I just saw TV commercials and those nightmares came back to growl. This is an eerie and annoying Christmas movie that should make the pants out of the little ones who see it. Avoid this one - unless you want to punish your children. This will be. 1
