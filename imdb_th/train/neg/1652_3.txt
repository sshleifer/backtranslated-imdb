I will be blunt and to the point. This movie is not good at all. My buffalo movie hates acting, direction, and editing. Amanda Peet has proven that she can perform because she is the top spot of 'The Whole Nine Yards', so she should avoid this film with ten columns foot However, during my childhood I found that this movie was very funny. If you can forget how the production quality is lower than standard, and if you find that jokes are funny And for people who can't get out of the podium, that's your choice My children are not dead and I laugh a little. Even so, there are only 3 out of 10 because as this movie is really stinking.
