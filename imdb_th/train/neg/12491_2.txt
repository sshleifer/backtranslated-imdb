Hm, while fun movies that will encourage the plot to point to a brutal performance, traditional effects (Which is the best) (which made me watch this movie three times in the last six years). The worst rank saw. I'm not sure what the protagonist is. Seen in the dance floor scene Overall, I don't like this movie because only the first 30 minutes are fun, the rest is conversations and confusing images that fail to develop the story into logical conclusion. (Which I can't remember anyway)
