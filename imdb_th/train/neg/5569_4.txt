I try to really like this movie. To see it, all I can think of is "This guy gave me a creep. I will be banned." Also called CODEPENDENCE is capitalized. Is this a real conversation before creating a movie? "We created a movie that makes two people who are chronically depressed and unfit for society into a relationship that makes them lonely and encourage them to complain about how bad their lives are!" Life is the last thing on earth that we find charming in a potential partner is self-pity. <br /> <br /> The mood of this movie is 80-ish; Thoughtful and slow Don't understand me. This movie has only a few moments.
