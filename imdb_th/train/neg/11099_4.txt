The main problem of the documentary "Czech Dream" is that it does not say what it thinks it is talking about. <br /> <br /> Bravely - I hesitate to use the word "Inspiration" - Actions of the roadside theater Vit Klusak and filmmaker Filip Remunda. Two students from the Czech Republic drew significant corporate deception to serve as the basis for their films. "Fake hypermarkets" (equivalent to Eastern Europe's Costco or Wal Mart Super Store) Create all-round advertising campaigns - including billboards, radio and television banners, official logos, catchy songs and product photos. Fake - then wait around to see how "dopes" will appear. On the opening day, they also create a front arch to convince people that the store is real. <br /> <br /> Everyone Asked, "Why is that?" That's a very good question. But the answer that the filmmakers gave was not satisfactory. Essentially, we have been told that the purpose of showing talent is to show how easily people can manage what is believed - even the real thing - just using the power of advertising. And the filmmakers demanded moral cover, claiming that the "real" purpose (such as higher) for the conversation was to convince the Czechs not to give up for all the ads that supported them to join the European Union. Fair enough - especially when people see that advertisers actually agree to show their ability to condemn unethical behavior of lying to customers while demonstrating cooperation in deception. By claiming that it is a form What and does not work in advertising By allowing myself to stick to the camera in these comments, these advertising men and women are filmmakers as well as those who do not trust the main target of cunning. <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> but in many ways But will not be able to achieve the desired goal only For them, they are, and not the people who have a good heart and trust in the end, who fell out as people who are immoral and lacking here, as they make a fool out of the perfect person. Some of them are old and disabled. Distance by foot to the point And all of this is what should be proved? People are "greedy" because they go to the launch of a new supermarket looking for cheap products? Or are they stupid and puzzled because they do not suspect that there may be no real market even if there is an advertisement? Such caution must have a level of cynicism that will make it almost impossible to work in the real world. <br /> <br /> No, I am afraid of showing talent. "Wise. "Offensive Most filmmakers do to make some really good people feel like a fool. And of course, many of them, when they discover the secrets that are played with them, eventually respond with compassion and good humor. I'm not sure I can gather. I will find myself in the position of <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that this movie doesn't catch something similar to being a witness in a car accident. But when the dust fell and the disappointed customer returned to face the empty hand Their home, we can safely declare that they are not people who should feel ashamed.
