I have 2 words for Sean Bean. He is a valuable person in this movie. But even then, don't watch this movie. Although he is as good as the main villain But you don't want to waste time. <br /> <br /> I don't care about the characters. (Except for the little boy) and in fact, I do not care whether the stars that couples cross will gather or die. This film doesn't make me interested or believe that these people care about each other at all. I read a lot of "classic" novels after watching movies and this film made me not even want to read books. It seems that the story is boring. But I might go ahead and read to try to exchange the story in my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doone. The actor who plays Lorna has the same feelings and feelings. See Sharpe. , Horatio Hornblower, A & E has great movies from novels like Pride and Prejudice or mini series such as Forsyte Saga. Try them. Don't worry about Lorna Doone.
