R Balki tried to tell the story that Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabd told him earlier. It is now mixed with adult humor. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and owner of Indian food in London. He has superior power and arrogance and respect for his work, as well as other works as he says. Cooking is an art. Still unable to create Hyderabadi Biryani correctly. <br /> <br /> Enter Tabu, who sends Hyderabadi Biryani, the right created by her to her and soon they start to meet. Amitabh is 65 and Tabu is 35 ?? no problem! But one hitch! Paresh Rawal, Tabu's father !! The couple decided to meet their father for approval of their marriage. But Mitha realized that Tabu's father was much younger than him. And complications begin? Intelligent performances, the three actors are excellent. The script of this film is very tight and interesting. The dialogue of this movie is catchy. But some places you feel that the stomach is not full Sometimes I don't understand the jokes properly. The film also tries to take some time. <br /> <br /> The music has nothing to sing except the title track. The camera works well. Director R Balki should be able to get this role much better. But in the second half he was confused. The father's "Satyagrah" scene was annoying, but Amitabh Bachchan's speech in that scene applauded. <br /> <br /> Overall, Cheeni Kum needed more sugar. !
