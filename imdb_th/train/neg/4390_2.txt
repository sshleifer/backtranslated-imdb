The TV guide describes the plot of SEVERED TIES, like: "Experiments on the arms that have been cut to the point of distortion." So as soon as I thought this would be about arms with my own thoughts as seen in The beast too Five fingers or hands or people who have received arm transplantation in the body Both places have been tried and tested or are more tired and accurate, so I want to know how the producers will approach the story. Actually, I think they are creating an Art House movie like PI. Came to use B&W photography at the beginning of the movie But the creators seemed to be bored with this method after 20 seconds and decided to create a comedy movie that is similar to The EVIL DEAD. I talk a little about this, except that I don't like bad movies and I don't like bonded relationships. It seems really unfair that movies like this use tires that are obscene when the third world is crying because of condoms.
