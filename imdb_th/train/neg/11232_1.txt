It's sad. Although this was filmed with the film, I thought it was smelly than the flicks like Blood Lake, but nothing went out. I like brothers and sisters in this movie. They both didn't try hard to listen to sarcasm when they said something like "My friend will be jealous!" Hey, what a killer, just wearing a mask at first? That's the moron! I don't care about the second half of this story. The part I like about this movie is the sound effects they use when the killer is using an ax. The same sound every time!
