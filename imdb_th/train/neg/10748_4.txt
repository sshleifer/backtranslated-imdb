Nothing to say except Wow! Has someone sneaked into the open field? This happened about 25 times in this movie. (Obviously, it was a strategy that made the directors like it). In the first scene, the producers of hot talk / shooting had to sit in the back seat so that the camera could sit in front to shoot. Shortly after he arrived at the stadium, all 5 contestants showed up and although it was clear at 2 o'clock in the morning, they believed that the sun would set for a few minutes. After about 30 minutes of oil-free trash, we were privileged with the history of the clown that we saw his victims earlier. If you watch this movie, see the woman's chest .. Her ribs go up to her neck, it's disgusting. Most horror action movies occur at night. But without the camera looking at the night, the chaos was forced to happen during the day. A few shots that night made them seem to be stolen from the Blair Witch Project or randomly arranged from the director's backyard. The film is quite self-redeeming at the end, when there is a matrix like shooting out with the clown that we have spinning and watching and laughing repeatedly like crazy. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie. Of course! In the open field <br /> <br /> signed and the answer
