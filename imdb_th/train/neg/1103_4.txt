As a black / latina, I often search for movies that show the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course, when I watch this movie at a video store, I think I will enjoy it. Unfortunately I didn't Although the topics presented in the movie are interesting and relevant But the story was not properly developed The movie has just been dragged and many characters appearing on the screen continue to come without much help with the film as a whole. If the director acts better linking different scenes, maybe I will enjoy it a bit more. Actually, I would like to introduce the movie "Raising Victor" for this movie every day. I'm not too impressed
