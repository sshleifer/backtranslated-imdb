The exchange feature only. This movie has a rather original death scene. In addition, this movie is a big DUD. We have a Kimba Singers, a housewife who has been slowly winding through the local department store in the first 30 minutes of the movie, which doesn't add anything Then the movie picked up a bit because she faced 4 people who used 2 parking spaces on this busy Christmas. They began to chase her after chasing security guards in the area trying to help her. From there, this movie is getting worse. I know it's just one movie and you have to go with the stream. But she had about 5 minutes of cleverness and she couldn't hide or search for someone to help her. But she drove to the half-division, built beside the forest As usual, she did everything to make followers follow easily. But now she becomes a tough mofu. You get points In any case, buy or rent this movie, no matter how much you like this type. It's irrational. You have to ask every question. It's embarrassing for Basinger and Craig Sheffer and the rest of the actors, including consumers.
