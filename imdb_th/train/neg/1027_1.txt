Usually I have something better to do with my time than writing reviews. But I was disappointed with this movie, which I spent an hour signing up with IMDb to let it fall out. <br /> <br /> You would think that a movie with Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey is worth Will be a gambling game ... uh, this movie is terrible Close to impossible to "Suspend unbelief"; I tried. I really wanted to have fun. But Justin Timberlake doesn't allow me Can't blame everything Justin: This movie has a horrible storyline and a terrible time correction. Of course it is "F". <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I have to wonder what motivates the actor. I mean, of course, Morgan read the script before joining. He doesn't see how bad it is. What will encourage him to participate? Money? Of course, acting is sometimes you will see the person you see rather than developing a quality job. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a great actor. He received more time to watch than Freeman or Spacey in this film and struggled to get a bad chapter. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the audience will go: "What happened. Up here, do you expect me to believe this nonsense? "<br /> <br /> In short, apart from Justin, the bad lineup. Proceeded - very disappointing
