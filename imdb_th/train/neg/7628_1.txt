Black and white film, good photography <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I wasted time watching another movie that was "precious" and "very good". There were some good performances Here and setting the background for the plot is good. (Should do more) but it's very slow to grow and never develop It is a base for sex without being very romantic and there are unwanted nudity. Can do more with the main character If you are looking for something to watch with your family on this subject, not a movie, and if not you will have a problem sitting through it. Although this movie is only about 1 inch deep!
