What is shameful is when the story with a low key, fascinating and interesting, can handle your interest from the beginning and then will gradually help you down again until you leave your mysterious head. In the final episode, unfortunately, this is what happened to me at the end of the WHITE NOISE <br /> <br /> It's not Michael Keaton's fault; It was a pleasure to see him return as a movie star again. But still trying to give a strong and sincere performance As a man whose wife had died, he was obsessed with the lost souls in the afterlife. (Not a new idea). Obviously being contacted by her through the funky fuzzy business that you see on the television screen when nothing is aired. <br /> The concept of spiritual communication via radio waves is called. That EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) and a lot of people believe in reality, so I will not express any opinions about what I think so or they Let me say that I was all suspended from unbelief when talking about buying a great movie like this. But what I can't do is not understanding where the hell should happen. Hold on when the credit starts to roll in the end Of course, <br /> <br /> Sometimes there are movies like this that make me completely puzzled. But if the movie fails to make itself clear for me, I tend to think that it's the film's fault, not my own (unless I watch it while I'm too tired to focus or anything). For WHITE NOISE I woke up, big eyes and a bunch - guessing who will be blamed?
