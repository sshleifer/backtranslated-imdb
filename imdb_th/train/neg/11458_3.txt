I can remember Bo Derek's wealth and interest in the UK. (Especially the Sun & News of the World newspaper in particular). All of this, according to her small role in "10" and Dudley Moore, can understand that a lot of fuss is made from her face, photograph, clear blue eyes and her chest <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, acting is and never before! I think they should do one of the three disc collections that you find in the bargain DVD bins - Orca, Tarzan the Ape-man and Bolero. All these movies can be nominated for "So Bad They Are Great "<br /> <br /> It will be my fault" must buy "! If you've read Derek's news or comments, please don't be offended - you always have a weakness for you, and there are important things happening in the world that you have to worry about.
