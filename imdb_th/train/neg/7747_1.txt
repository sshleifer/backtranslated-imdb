The fact that the cover art is painted like those of the old B movies should give a warning about the quality of the film. However, this is not a movie B, it's a movie D! <br /> <br /> There are no known actors and animals - Wow - it's the worst data animation ever made in two decades. Past <br /> <br /> You rarely see the SCAAARY sabretooth shown on the cover. You just hear people screaming, bleeding and dying and you see your teeth or paws from time to time. It's very amateur! Maybee looks awful because it's terrible. Give it to a friend and say: "This is the best movie I have ever seen and waiting for their reaction." He <br /> <br /> The movie is weak to alert Spoiler! This is a spoiler.
