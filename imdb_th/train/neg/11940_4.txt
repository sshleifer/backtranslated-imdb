I would lie if I said that this could easily be a rival to Spider-Man or Batman movies. Even so, it was more interesting to me because it was a moral value. I bought the VHS for the first time when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite. My wife and I are an avid supporter of Robert Townsend and because he uses a credit card to support his first movie "Hollywood Shuffle". Actually, he wants to take advantage of the talent and knowledge of a technical consultant to make a movie. This story is more reliable. But his movie is still fun. Meteor Man gives a sense of Urban Contemporary to the hero. I always feel that if there are heroes, they will not give the same situation that appears in the comic book. Meteor Man is a real hero and There is a real problem: cars are compromised into bad neighborhoods, local drug cartels that use children to distribute, etc. The scope of his mission is in the community quite a lot. <br /> <br /> Things Where I found a genuinely entertaining than the show. "Earl Jones" by James Earl Jones, that's how the community responds to his newly discovered power. Shortly before they had a complete agenda for him It was a joke that they heard that they offered to lend to other communities in which their extended family lived. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is weak. This movie is predictable. Bad and unbroken continuity, but it ranked # 1 with my children. Robert Townsend worked to bring the movie "House" to speak. I wonder if he will be truly accepted as an actor / producer / producer. Ability come true But there is and will be the one who loves him for his efforts. <br /> <br /> One point that pondered about The movie that I find amusing: Throughout the battle with Simon, no one is interested. Call the police ???? In addition, parents, you know what to watch their son fight from the window? My mother will be there, leaving one side to another. Father will load his pistol. Lol <br /> <br /> Rent and try. It's worth seeing at least once, and good for you guys who are fans of Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane, etc. Great job with Robert Jie!
