I am now the only person to watch movies with bad reviews and say "Umm ... it's not bad!" I love The Cable Guy and think that my independent movie, Big Fat, is great Please note that I didn't start to watch this thing in high hopes. But I think maybe ... just maybe ... It might be bad in the way I can laugh. I'm wrong. There is no point during my suffering from this movie. (And I use that word as much as necessary) is that I am still close to being entertained mildly In the beginning of Shaq, Quentin Tarantino looked like Marlon Brando when talking about acting. I hate rap music But as far as I can tell, the Amish clergyman would have made the rap better than him. The main character is annoying and is not a favorite character. Quite frankly, I would like to eat foods that have oily stains from the fetus's blood wounds. The characters are more than watching again.
