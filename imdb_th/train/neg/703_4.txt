College students who are cleared of dormitories that have been branded are hard-to-understand killers. <br /> <br /> Dormitories at the blood drop. (Also known as Pranks) is a mixed bag for big fans The production value of the film is quite low and most of the stories are interesting routines. There are even creepy bottoms that hang around for red herring. In fact, most of the stories that are collected are memorable and record one or two brutal murders. But this film is better done with a very surprising point (in the atmosphere) and a rather strange and exotic conclusion big Stephen Sachs is the best person while he has a good role. In addition, look for Daphne Zuniga, a minor, as an unfortunate student. <br /> <br /> This is a standard B slasher attempt. But the ending is worth the complete taste of ho-hum. <br /> <br /> ** From ****
