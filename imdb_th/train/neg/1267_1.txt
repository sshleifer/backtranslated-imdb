Why me? Why do I have to be slaughtered, like in a story that could cause an interesting storyline! At least if I can warn others, it will be worth it. <br /> <br /> I have to watch this awesome movie for college courses. Otherwise, I will be able to see the conclusion on the back of that thing and bring it clearly. This movie is slow, has an incredibly little character development and is centered on the idea that a creepy little white man looks cool if he goes out with an LA style black man. With the LA experience that the stereotyped of superficial dizziness - watching movies, but please note that this film does not depend on what we think is "The way of life of LA" It is a great example of the product that is produced by it.
