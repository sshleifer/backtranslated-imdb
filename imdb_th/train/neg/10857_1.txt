Try to look at the movie's website rather than writing a script for this movie. It can't go out more than boasting. Original story? They must find a script hidden between the Old Testament or face the legal consequences of using the horn. High-end special effects? So I can do better with Atari 7600 and pitcher ear Stylish movies? Oh, yes, America's most fun home video format is still classic. I'm sure they have little money for this title, so of course, SF isn't really good or a bit bad or plain hilarious. But it is a story that makes this movie a waste of time and money
