This is a great story and is just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We continue to do so) However, although this fact is true But still a movie and a movie website I know that independent movies have a difficult time finding an actor who is good, but the only one that is moderate, even though it's an excellent Ossie Davis. Yet he can't compensate for all the actors (Including those who act as young men). Actually cruel. That received the script was very lamenting But even then you must have a famous actor! I will not recommend this to anyone because it does not work well in all categories. Read some books about the true story of US Mason of the United States because they give the respect they deserve.
