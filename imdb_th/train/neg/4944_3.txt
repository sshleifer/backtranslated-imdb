Why is this item sucked? Unfortunately, this question is the only question because there is no doubt that it will be. <br /> <br /> For those who are not familiar with the place in the show, the Cavemen must focus on numbers. Of the era and their struggle to be in the current era of America and depending on the characters in the television advertisement for the Geico Insurance series. The concept is stable and there are all reasons that can be achieved. <Br /> <br /> I have to think about this for a moment. But then the slogan from the advertisement - something that affects "We are not very different from you. "I have the key to the interest of the program, although cavemen / Neanderthals are a race that is different from humanity. But the title character in this story turned out to be like us who is boring, jerking. <br /> <br /> Maybe my background may be a game writer - instead of a gangster, hacking, writer from the board from California - but this list has a lot of potential and no one knows. Beginning with manufacturers should focus on the fun things that will make the caveman different from us. <br /> <br /> Things that may be funny, like giving them a career, such as a graduate student and clerk furniture shop When will they be attracted to things such as workers, utilities and leaders in the cave park? Why are they playing regular games like squash when they are able to devote themselves to trying to get a hunting license to hunt down with spears? This kind of program can be written by yourself and requires bad writing. Be deliberately made it look terrible and boring. <br /> <br /> Another tedious aspect of this show is trying to draw. Caveman image The number of map patterns relates to the various minorities of humans, gasped! This thing has been done many times and has never been more wrong. And as stated earlier, Neanderthals are actually different races, so using them as a metaphor for stereotyping. The races are both uncompelling and closed. <br /> <br /> The answer is welcome. Me why i'm wrong I want to enjoy this show and I'm sorry I can't do it. <br /> <br /> Michael J. Varhola, Skirmisher's online military fighting game magazine
