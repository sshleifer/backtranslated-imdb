This movie is a silly story. Everything is not good. Why do we, who love western movies, think nine out of ten times when renting a western movie? It seems that if you don't see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner or Tom Selleck stuck on the cover. Most of the main actions of Shiloh Falls occurred in 1892, but the pistol used as a model in the 1860s. Even the filming was not good - in one scene, Field Marshal blew his six-ball gun for about nine times and could not shoot people. Three big people who are only twenty feet away I have to close it after about 15 minutes of this madness. Perhaps those who participated in this film may have learned some things at the Sunset Carson Performing School.
