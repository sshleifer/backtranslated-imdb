There are spoilers, movie plot can be summed up in a few sentences: three people go hunting in the forest. Two of them, according to others, were shot in the head without explanation. The last man can stand in the clear, shout and do anything without getting fired. He will walk through the old factory and there are wicked people walking into his boundaries without struggling. The villains wear black clothes comfortably and look like villains. <br /> <br /> That's the whole story. Everything was pulled out with the men standing in the ring of the door. We waited with him. The long shots of men were bored in the forest and slept. We can nap with them. The image pulled from the follow-up jogger. Women may be redeemed if we see her butt or chest bouncing. <br /> <br /> There is less interaction than Terminator and not because there are many actions The character does not speak And then they had nothing to repeat like 'I'll be back.' If my friend took this picture over the weekend, I would cheer him because it was quite good to understand the control of the camera. Paying for renting this thing is a DVD that is totally unsuitable. <br /> <br /> One funny little thing is that the superintendent said that the local police didn't know they were shot and Treat them like people who walk around with guns. If they shoot, I'm sure it's more fun to watch from movies.
