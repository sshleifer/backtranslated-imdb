** Here is a spoiler ** <br /> <br /> The government continues to develop programs. UniversalSoldier Which is now called UniSol. Now, the military is stronger and can do more damage than before Take steps to ensure your own safety. He enabled and controlled UniSols and started using physical assault. The only person who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This movie has one story. Fighting posture design The story is not good and soon drowned in the fight. No matter what happens and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately for this movie, it's not fun to watch the fight that you know that part of it can't be destroyed. Usually you are quite sure that the hero will win. But you still want to feel the fight between two fighters that are quite equal. Not a place that no one has destroyed and cannot lose Then the fight became a tool to prolong time. You wait until the final battle, when Devereaux finds a miraculous way to defeat an unbeatable enemy. In order to reduce my opinion, more than that, the signs that the bad movies are desperate and great. There is not much because most characters are men. (There are at least one UniSol woman), but almost every woman will show unnecessarily, at least with a single bra. Women led by this But we went through the strip club (To use the computer quite a bit) with more undressed women These moments did not give anything to the story and were there to try to make the male audience with a satisfied teenager. <br /> <br /> So in summary, a boring fight. No more, no less. Maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
