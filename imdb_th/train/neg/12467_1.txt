This movie is slower than Molasses in January ... In Alaska, people who put samples to receive prizes for management, so every 30 seconds have been previewed. I have to wake up the person I watch with many times. After passing through, I felt bad that I woke up. <br /> <br /> Most of the movies were filmed in the hope that something would happen. But nothing happened It's easy to get out of the motivation of the people and the characters are flat and not interested. At the end of the movie, you just hope everyone will die. Everyone runs around, whether insulting, insulting or poor, and often all three. <br /> <br /> And worse, we look at one or two additional features to understand and understand and everything. We see people who are satisfied with society. If they spend time with the movies they slap on themselves, it may be worthwhile to watch. <br /> <br /> I was expected to get the excitement of '24 '. I received a lecture. About social awareness through Sandman's blurry eyes
