I expect to have comedies like the movie "Big Mama", but this movie is a joke mixed between drama and strange love stories. <br /> <br /> This movie has three stories: the first story involved. With Madea and she accepts foster children The second story involves a woman engaged to a rich man who is insulting her. The third story deals with the relationship between a single mother who has 2 children and a single father. <br /> <br /> Actually it's a very funny movie in the movie. There are also many distorted messages in the movie. For example, Madea won a foster child with a belt. (In a funny manner) to convince the child to stretch out In fact, the child turned himself. Obviously it was paid to hit the child. <br /> <br /> There are plans to deal with child rape. (With the consent of the mother) has a scene with the old man ogling the girl associated with them (ogling happens at family reunion). The movie jumps from the plot to the plot to keep you unbalanced. Always Is this a joke about love or drama? In fact, nothing ... except wasting time and money.
