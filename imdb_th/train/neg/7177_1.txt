I love the original "Kaligula", despite all of its shortcomings, I must say that this trailer remembers the deepest. <br /> <br /> Listening to Jovovich speaks in an American accent. The lazy "Mmm cuhligyooluh ..." I feel sick. This dress doesn't look Roman at all ... It seems like a Hollywood mansion in the backyard and a Roman costume looks like the cheap price you bought at a suburban clothing store. <br /> <br /> "Charm" Adriana Asti looks like a fifty-year-old Spanish woman who is completely scared of her, as though he didn't know it was a movie trailer. <br /> <br /> The performance must be the worst I have ever seen. With most of the lines, I heard random actors screaming. "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!" Annoying and terrifying sounds <br /> <br /> Random sex scenes are filled with 40 or 50% good trailers and scenes with actors / Famous actors like Gerard Butler (screen enthusiasts in The shadows for all three and a half seconds) do nothing but look uncomfortable or go out on top with their small lines just by dragging them down with ridiculous deliveries. <br /> <br /> Courtney Love's, partly composed of her face, like herself, is a big prostitute, full of doors against the murmur about the moon or something. You can't tell because she's drunk or high or just stupid. <br /> <br /> Karen blacks annoying ... laughs randomly and screams in a way that makes you frustrated. <br /> <br > Helen Mirren ... She's in the same condition and she comes back to "Caligula". Contains ... "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I especially "love" (and by love I mean hate) the line of Ennia "Caligola ... j00 not maki me * discrete things * .... * * * * * * * The reign that year was greater than the birth and death of Jesus. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is a bad thing. The worst, the most exploitation, self-willing, arrogant, mocking, is the "art" I've seen. Although Gore Vidal hates Kaligula, he should not show or name this garbage, no matter how much they pay him. (Unless it's a billion trillion yen) The worst example that ever existed.
