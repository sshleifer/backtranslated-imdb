Just a warning ... This is the worst movie I've seen for many years ... I can't watch it until the end ... It's a waste of time ... I'm really sorry that Snipes ended. In this movie There's not much to say about it. Scary performances, incredibly bad lines, everything. The only reason I would recommend you to watch this movie is if you want to see if the movie should not be. Just to tell you that there is only one scene: the police are searching for sniping and they are surrounded by buildings, helicopters and cars.
