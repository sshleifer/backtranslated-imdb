I believe that war movies should try to convey the fear of war, avoid ideals and respect the basic military principles. Zvezda is hardly the first. Zvezda is a Russian war movie. I expect nationalism, feelings, images, beautiful poems, lush green marks, slavic cheekbones and brutal Germans. What I don't want is an innocent love, a stupid war scene that is unrealistic, and using an improper soundtrack in a movie that avoids all historical or political references. (Stalin, Nazi Holocaust) just to end, but despite insulting the feelings in our history about "Liberation of Poland" opportunity not received as a movie But not propaganda
