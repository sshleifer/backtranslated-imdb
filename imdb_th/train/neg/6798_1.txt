This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Everyone involved should receive all the shame. Ice-T is pathetic. The conversation is terrible and hokie doesn't start to explain every actor's performance in this movie. Plot stole heavily from executive decisions. But compared to Air Rage, the executive decision is the content of the Oscars. I have never been disappointed when watching movies. The wrath of the air should be burned with the ashes that were trapped in the grave in order not to see the light of the day again. Anyone who has ever seen should take a shower and clear the stench of horror from them. The best part of this movie may come from the ending when the credits are accumulated. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T should stick to rules and regulations and others in this movie should retire early or commit suicide. In any way, they should not try to be in the movie again.
