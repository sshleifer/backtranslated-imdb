It's a very scary movie! The idea of ​​fighting robots is cool. But the story is ridiculous, human actions that are ridiculous, non-existent performances and special effects. I think it should have been created during '80 -'84 and was surprised to see that it came from the 1990s, that is 5 years after the aliens! OK, many people say it's good when considering a low budget. But i just think It seems unbelievable. I wouldn't mind seeing new creations with modern special techniques and completely rewritten stories because I still like the idea of ​​a big robot that hit the shit out of each other
