The Danes tried hard and extensively by shouting all of them and being mad, causing the water to burst into themselves and rolling on the ground too much. I do not understand his comparison with cartoons and rock stars. Just because there is either going on stage or something? He said that every comedian wanted to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was really like that when he was still alive. He has a few good jokes such as Burger King. It's a joke that people shout at. I also like Reese's jokes. If Dane behaves badly, he may be more fun and I may give up to eight points higher.
