Whether you watch the regular version of this amazing or the MST3K version, you will be impressed with the most GALL participating in this production. The filmmakers insulted the audience's intelligence from one end to the other, and apparently didn't care what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Everything about it is the cheapest. Even cars in the 1950s, dating back to that era, seemed to have been pulled out of the garbage dump. <br /> <br /> "hobgoblins", as you know, "awareness" with hand puppets that are not good and Stuffed toys; When people are attacked by them, it's clear that the toys are being caught in his or her body. When the reptile escapes from the security guard, the two cameras will show (Or did not show) by aiming at the soldiers as they looked down and turned their heads as if they were looking at the past hobgoblins. It is reminiscent of the scenes in the movie "Tangents", in which two people are standing. In the ruins of the future world, explore the ruins and we do not show at all. The budget constraints mixed with the most inability mean that you will not have anything to look at, so try doing that "set". Laugh at the "Club Scum" is a restaurant that is obvious. This house seems to be a vacant house - it may be possible to rent or sell - which the production company filmed for an hour or two to shoot. "The spacecraft" is something I am ashamed of when modeling a model at the age of 10 years <br /> <br /> Inspiration of the characters is unreasonable - Kevin is rejected by his worthlessness. Of the girlfriend because he did not make her "Proud of him" I am sure that this purpose is to make their compromise. Oh, touch at the end. But a man who truly respects himself will tell her to go to hell and leave her. Nick comes back from a 2-month military training (yes, good rules, cut hair, Nick) and seems to prove that our country is being protected from sadistic animals. Kyle is a fanatic. Sex phone customers in red shorts who dream of night with armored spandex But he was too weak to be gay One of the girls is rude and the other is sleepy. <br /> <br /> And hobgoblins? At the end, they all returned to the grave where they lived for 30 years. Why? Who knows? Who cares? Watch this movie and marvel at how to create primitive movies in our modern era. When you have an idiotic script, an incompetent direction, a bad actor, they will be rejected from the drama production in high school. D. Wood, Jr.
