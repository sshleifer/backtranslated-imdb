I never finished this movie for a reason. It's scary and that's just acting. I'm not even sure that this movie is about anything. It's not reasonable and the violence is terrible. I mean, usually I like nudity in movies (laughs), but it's sick because of what happened. Every character is annoying to me and it is full of loud screams and the camera shakes in different parts and it looks like the sequel to Blair's project But without quality This is one of the worst movies I have seen for a long time and I want to give my time back. I will not recommend this movie to anyone or even consider it (N)
