Revolt of the Zombies is not the worst movie I've ever seen. But it is quite far in the list When the trip was sent to Cambodia to find secrets for creating zombies after the First World War, one member decided to use his knowledge for his evil ambitions And he succeeded at least at first Triangle love makes the story more complicated The conversation is a little better and the storyline is unbelievable. (Not part of zombies But is related to "love") and while I am not a student or a movie expert But it seems that the camera work doesn't help much Good
