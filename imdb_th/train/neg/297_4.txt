For this album, this movie is interesting. But did not have a novelty Back in 1998, the movie starring Talia Shire called The Landlady almost the same. But there are younger characters. <br /> <br /> The story that Amanda Lear had a bad life. Eventually she was released from the house that was blessed under the guidance of a doctor, who had a habit of mistaking her ... who she used in the wrong way and killed a poor man. (Now it's real) The doctor gave her the mansion before she killed him and buried the vacuum in the backyard. After moving in, she fell in love with the core named Richard, who had just married a blues singer. If you've seen The Landlady that you know, you can kill or try to kill anyone between you and Richard (including the principal). <br /> <br /> Most thoughts come from the previous movie. A close friend, the same idiot who stuck his nose to spy on a guy with a popcorn bowl. There are some original materials. Beer bottles are cruel. The highlight of this movie is Amanda's beautiful breasts, in a hot spot, rather confusing, but not wasting all the time. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
