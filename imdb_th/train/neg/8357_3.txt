Oh man, man! It's really scary! But this is a pleasure from my childhood, even though I hate to accept it. They always show this movie on my basic cable system. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (At the edge of Cupertino) We have this thing called The G Channel in our cable system. And they show the same movie over and over again Wanda Nevada is one of those movies. I fell in love and love with Brock Young and loved her adventures in the Grand Canyon. In 1940, the script did not make sense. The direction was not good. Carole King plays better than the last credit Maybe you have to hangover to enjoy this flick literally. And hey everyone knows that there is no gold in the Grand Canyon!
