Back in the days before Tenger Avenger, the king of the concentration camps at Troma Films, tried to take the high road (OK, quite low - low - low). To create a straight slasher image, I'd like to think that seeing results here is something That makes them give up every excuse and go to mock their own cares. <br /> <br /> Splatter University is another movie for those who punish themselves in the audience. As it winds through two separate casts and countless pointless subplots, it actually becomes painful to watch. Let's see if I can conclude. <br /> <br /> After learning that dangerous psychosis has escaped from a local hospital, the action moved to a Catholic university. (I can't remember the name But to honor the name Let's call it St. Splatter.) Students are lifeless and sullen and argue lazily. At the same time, new professor Julie Parker proves that she is completely incompetent. Children deal with unfaithful relationships, unwanted pregnancies, tricky priests and ways to avoid working in class. Julie talks to a creepy girlfriend, flexible management at St. Splash, counseling with unmarried mothers. There is nothing that will mean something that is cursed or resolved in any way that has meaning. Oh and every time POV shot comes in and stabs a woman in death. But don't hold your breath waiting There was a Red Herring killer, and then faced with a sad revenge against the killer, then returned to the hospital and accumulated credits. <br /> <br /> Walking Slowly, irritability in the audience, which has been helped by the lack of correctness, sound quality, canned coffee and improper conversations. And the most worrying thing about this movie is the freeze of women-men in this movie. I paid very well to see if someone had jerked with a pregnant girlfriend or Lothhead Lothario who played with a roommate of a girlfriend or a creepy priest. No justice
