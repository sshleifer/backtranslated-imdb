But another film about a group of less intelligent people on a road trip that strayed from their original travel routes, whether they are shortcuts or in this case, to visit interesting places In running down The results as expected are not as good as it should be, since the side of this list is the dwelling of the villagers who have been devastated and mad at fleeing inmates in prison for many years ago. The father, who is clearly a professional photographer, just stops and takes pictures of the place only to find that there are people. Many members of the family walked out to see various attractions just to be scared. When they thought they were traveling safely, the van tires exploded (surprise!), Allowing them to seek refuge and accommodation in a small town, which we know that that strange person lives alone (surprise!) <br /> <br> This movie can be played as expected with a family that is stalked and killed by strange people. There is some struggle in the family. But these may be the worst scenes in the movie. Nothing is original from a distance here unless you count all the inappropriate soundtracks played in some scenes that destroy the atmosphere and mood of the movie. The performance is not as good as I have sometimes seen by everyone involved. (It's quite bad when your actors are released by actors from "Camp Blood). The special effects are lousy and the ending makes me want. Punch my television. <br /> <br /> Still, I enjoy this movie. But I feel fun with this movie But I felt that it was so good Even the pleasant entertainment when I passed the ancient comedy scenes, horrifying performances and wonderful special effects, even though the ending would make me feel cheated and angry, especially because this film is not a good thing For a start, <br /> <br /> The bottom line I can show countless movies that if you see you seeing this, the difference is that those movies Users would be better, though not a complete waste. But this movie is quite bad and Not scary from afar. <br /> <br /> My grade: D
