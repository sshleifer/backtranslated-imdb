This story has a different angle that makes me amazed enough to buy a VHS that has never been seen before. That is a mistake. <br /> <br /> In what might be a very good story - about people with disabilities at the hospital and their personalities - became a blasphemous television drama with characters that Unique /> <br /> We have "Bloss" (William Forsyth), a white person, an insulting class who speaks f every sentence and is very disgusting. They don't give him a name in the movie. this He was so fun to be around. Then there was "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipes), the flirtatious Snipes who had to like a quick arrogance because he played a lot like "White Men Can Jump". Helen Hunt plays the cute "Anna" and who has an affair with an affair with the characters in the movie "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). <br /> <br /> Yes, that's the thing. That is warm, friendly and feels good It dissolves my heart. See these good people. But if you are one of those people who love unbelievable characters in the pictures shown by lazy people in lazy movies, you might like this! Increase the political correctness in Hollywood and go there! Everyone wants more
