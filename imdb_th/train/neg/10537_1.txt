Now, what can you say about the adaptation? Barbara Carland <br /> <br /> There are amazing actors in this story (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) but they're reinforcing money. <Br /> <br /> Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert appeared in two more episodes in Cartland epics - Anthony and Hugh Grant (which looks embarrassing) and Gilbert and Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> If you want to see " "Carland's adaptation that can be viewed by Bonham Carter is an option for (" A Hazard of Hearts "- a mechanic Cool name !!) Gilbert is the weak link. But Bonham Carter is really beautiful and suitable, able to act and the rest of the actors play it with a tight tongue and tongue (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)
