*** There are many spoilers. It's not that it's important because everything is serious about patents. *** <br /> <br /> Oh my God, where do I start from? This is the first time I came home from the movie and said "I have to go to IMD and write a review right now. This is my civic duty." That is the badness of this flick. <br /> <br /> * Start talking outside. * But let me tell you one story first. To start, I'm not Harvard-art-major-film-noir-weenie. (In fact, I went to college at the other end of Mass Ave in Cambridge) which is really smart, with no rich people and trust funds. Which should make me straightforward in the population census-cartoons-books-love-wandering-love-cartoons-books and I still hate this movie ...) my viewing preferences are provided For high-level film work, including Die Hards, Bond Temple, Clerks and The Grail. I hope the Titanic never sinks for a lost life. But we are not under the garbage dump of the movie And the only reason and the only thing I can see the disgusting French art movie is that if there is Emmanuelle Beart in his youth and often not satisfied, I also give Maximum Overdrive one of the few 10s of its worth here on IMDb to God's benefits So I was ashamed as if they were coming, so I did not criticize the film because I was looking for the standard of film excellence - because Elektra stank like a three-week dead goat. * End of talk * <br /> < br /> OK, there are many bad things that I have to try to categorize here: <br /> <br /> MS Garner: One of the interesting reasons that men want to see this movie is to see. JGar Hot Strength (I do not know why my wife and I), I think, between this and "Finding Nemo" story behind the movie is sexy. Do you know that the red dress you put in the ad that looks boring every time you see? You saw her in there twice - the first time, the last time, the rest of the bummer. In general, she seemed to Morrissey to look like he was a woman - frowning clothes and many black clothes. Which led me to a period of incredible expression. JGar showed in her performance - from "pouting" to "pouting and crying." Oh, God. You think she was forced to date Ben Affleck. Hmmm ... Something like that ... or waiting for ... <br /> <br /> Bad people / GAL: They show the ability to express themselves and the performance you expect from Grapefruit. Slightly grapefruit At least next to JGar's performance, it's not too prominent. The role of a man is to stand there and be large. Another role is to stand there and have things out of him and the role of that woman is to stand there and breathe or kiss people. They managed to pull these amazing things away. The main bad guy has the most difficult role of all - he must at once a) appear angry and b) appear in Asia He did well in this matter. I think there are five bad people / gal, but my brain starts to block the film's part in self-defense. <br /> <br /> TWISTS transforms this movie with surprising stories about Speech at the National Democratic Conference, think like this - my wife, who is in the United States for half a year, speaks a little bit of English - whispered to me when the first woman appeared on the request sheet. JG and I swear to God Do not do this: "She goes home to kill girls and dads too." And this is before Father appears on the screen. Now my wife is not stupid. But she did not associate with Mensa for her gift as well, and she had no risk for Daredevil or the type of comic book. And she figured it out in. 00015 seconds without production and no previous data That is the obvious clarity of this film. <br /> <br /> Unevenness before seeing the foolishness! OK, so have a big friend in this movie. He was able to take a shotgun and explode it as if it were a lint, and he was able to take the electra to the chest and then the metal. But JG jumped on his head and exploded? An Achilles noggin? agreed! That is the stupidity of this movie. <br /> <br /> Ack. I started to feel that there was a hemorrhage in the brain, so I had to stop. But you have been warned If you have to tread yourself to protect yourself from watching this movie, do it and if Armageddon is about to come, please let it be> before <This will come out on DVD.
