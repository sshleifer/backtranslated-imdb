All movies that have Karen Allen's nude scenes and I'm still bored to go out, that is the foul! <br /> <br /> Karen is stuck in Paris and befriends a handsome and handsome French man who is having sex soon. Of course he is married. ("But Kylie, why must be a problem") What is interesting is the clash of cultures. (Believe it or not), just boring. I walked away. <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie might be a lot better after I left. But it must have been a lot better to make up for a rotten start. <br /> <br /> My advice, if you find yourself on this run, don't walk to leave Save your time and energy Most definitely save your money. Unfortunately, the manufacturer does not save money.
