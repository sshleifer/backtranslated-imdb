Let the Saints keep us because this movie will not help. <br /> <br /> People who have access to mail to Gibson and tell him that we want to produce honest Beowulf. Something like the epic poem that is the basis for modern Western literature. <br /> <br /> The latest version of Beowulf (since 2000) makes us wonder two things.

Worse and want 1 br / > <br /> There's nothing worse than before. Some people will look at this and misunderstand about the poem. How can the industry that Peter Jackson convert literature into movies can cause mistakes? I mean, really, the Roman forum as a model of Herodot too. <br /> <br /> And please him with a helmet? Reserve me. This is an insult to <br /> <br /> / hjm
