This movie is a sad story about this woman who thinks that her ex boyfriend, whom she loves so much, may have died. But his scientist's father just spelled him into a cute shark Like beauty and beast It may use ballroom dance scenes and maybe some singing candlesticks. But there are some pretty basic plants instead They made this woman really itchy, so she let herself eat by sharks - men instead of scratching through the whole movie. The scientist is a good father who tried to reunite his shark son with the woman he was engaged in. He also provided them with personal time for sex. The guy is an ugly and ugly monster and doesn't want anything with him. She gave up with love! Just because he is a shark! I think it's sad that you have to do is kiss him and he will return to normal and they will live a happy life forever. But it's not like that movie
