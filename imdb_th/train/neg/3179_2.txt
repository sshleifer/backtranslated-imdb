I accidentally watched this movie yesterday at the cinema. I have hope for this movie because I like Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and the book that is the basis of it. The movie started out okay, because at first it seemed to be a good thriller. Very quickly, even though this film is messy with the plot that is not interesting But the characters are unique and there is no one in the audience that has been cared for (such as Marjoke) and the horrifying corrections This film fades into a black bit that is too long, a messy event that jumps back and forth and many scenes that do not add anything to the story and may be easily dropped. After suffering through the story, you will be treated to one of the worst endings I've seen for a long time. In addition, it should be said that the film has many clear sex scenes, which you may be used to watching many Dutch movies. It's hard to talk about the good things about this movie. About a third of the audience walked out of the theater halfway through, and I didn't hear anything after the movie ended. Avoid this movie at all costs. It destroys any faith I leave in the Dutch film industry.
