- The movie team is shooting a horror movie in an old house that has been cursed, which, over the years, seven people have mysteriously died. One of the crew found an old magic book and it seemed to be perfect to use in some of the rituals in their movie. It is reasonable that the spell in the writing book is better than the script used. But when reading the book, the outside cemetery came to life immediately. Now actors and teams face real dangers. <br /> <br /> - IMDb will show 90 minutes of work during the first 60 minutes. Nothing happens. Spend too much time with movies in movies. Should we be afraid of the horror movies they're shooting? We already know that their movies are not "real". These fears are unavailable. <br /> <br /> - There are some fun things about The House of Seven Corpses. The performance is bad. " Most of these actors have problems playing elementary level. The score is very poor. It is reminiscent of the 1970s television drama and without atmosphere When talking about the atmosphere, apart from the short time at the end of the movie, no one talks about it. The logic of the characters is all. But does not exist Even in movies, you expect the character to behave in a certain way. Here I don't think I remember one scene where the characters didn't choose the most irrational road for them. And finally have the first 60 minutes of movies that I have already spoken Can you say that you are bored? <br /> <br /> - I didn't rate The House of Seven Corpses below because in the case of this film My two favorite things are the beginning and the end. The opening sequence name represents the deaths of seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the movie. And the final scene of a large staircase while zombies make the movie team more effective (The accreditation) Overall, although these periods are not enough to make a good movie
