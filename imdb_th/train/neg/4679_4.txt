It's a scary movie. Don't understand me wrong. Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors. But apart from the few interesting scenes and stories, the film was mostly used with submariners hysterical submarines shouting, crying, crying and sweating when something was wrong. <br /> Do these things with help. That is simple to make sure that the audience still understands what happened (The scene where Denzel Washington explained to the radio repairman that he had to be like Scotty in Star Trek) was a joke. There is a stupid thriller that is not worthy of the show. <br /> <br /> Let us just hope that the real US Navy is not in the hands of this movie. <br /> <br />
