If you read a book - don't set high hopes if you haven't already - go and read it and never watch a movie. It is strange to know that Toby Young is involved in writing a lot. (As he claimed himself in the book's script post) because this film is very different from the book Exciting and entertaining that combines philosophical ideas with philosophical ideas with ordinary funny satire. Understand it - it achieves perfection. This movie is full of bad jokes and cheap, suitable for sitcoms and has lost a meaningful message. <br /> <br /> You better not see it.
