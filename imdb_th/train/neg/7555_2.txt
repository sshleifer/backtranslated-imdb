Don't let the evidence fool you - this is a funny movie. One problem - it shouldn't be a joke. The story sets you up nicely for an end that never happens. Moreover, the setting never explained. You will leave the theater to ask, "Right?" I give 2 points just because there is a short time that promises. But the decoration makes you completely flat. Nicholas Cage works as well as it should be in the role. But he has very little work, strange habits and interesting turns everywhere that has nothing to do with movies Give this one out in the video before losing money.
