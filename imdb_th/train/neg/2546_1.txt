This movie is an idiotic effort from action movies. The tour bus to Las Vegas is attacked by a white hijacker group driving a Buggy. They drive out into the desert and steal all valuables. The story changes all the time. One minute, they are looking to kidnap the daughter of a wealthy farm. Next, they are looking for a $ 90,000 collectible stamp.
