In fact, I was surprised to have a good rating, which is a pseudo-Christian anti-Christian documentary. Now I respect the opinions and beliefs of my own men. I do not believe in Christian doctrine. However, anti-Christian propaganda is a different issue. <br /> <br /> The film has the correct score. But very few and expressed in a biased context I do not recommend watching In fact, I think everyone should see and decide for themselves, whether they believe it or not. And this is an opportunity more than a Christian teaching director Seems to be a personal malice in a Christian school that affects his childhood It also shows that most Christians are misunderstood as being innocent or not being a radical person in the meantime. <br /> <br /> The director uses the movie scene from the Passion of Christ without receiving allow Old school and presenting historians and writers who are anti-Christians. In fact, I found that the headmaster was the most in the world and thought that his attitude was completely justified. I also very much doubt that any Christian believers who have been interviewed have been consulted later or even before interviewing the purpose of the investigation. <br /> <br /> With this speech there is a new fact that interesting Found here and with traditional ideas about the question of Christianity But the way in which all these ideas were created is often a disgusting, unprofessional and highly biased matter.
