This effort is like a glittering TV movie ... I don't remember this story being released in the cinema ... If so, it must die quickly. Watching DVDs with comfort in our bedroom, it's obvious that this movie has no meaning ... Ed Lauter, a greedy art critic? It's fun to be ... I have never seen Ed since "The Longest Yard" ... Everyone who was shown by numbers led by Baldwin, except for Pompeo ... She has no charm. And seems to be sleepwalking through most images ... Pompeo's daughter has one dimension ... she plays every scene like a cute little puppy ... the slowest delivery of a 3 year old child at me I've seen ... <br /> <br /> The chase scene makes me and I have a headache ... Fast cutting and overhanging angles ... If you're going to shoot chase scenes in Barce Lona, you may want a few WIDE shots to take advantage of the beauty. The backdrop to your right. The whole story is unbelievable and very engaging. But wait, we like it more than "The Life Aquatic ..."
