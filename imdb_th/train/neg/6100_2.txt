Effort (This is not a review of good intentions, about the final product), this film is poorly written, exaggerated, and badly directed. Obviously this has potential. But the story doesn't exist in this movie. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton is a human. She has passions, desires, love, pain, shame, weakness and self-doubt as the rest of us. You will never know from this film about the actors' performances. In fact, it applies to every character in the movie. But in Barton's case: every sentence is a word The epic above words, as if from a humanoid robot In fact, the only scene that played well at the board meeting and I knew that was because she was speaking! Every thought that she has is unbelievable in its context and she happens to listen to ideas that seem like they spent the whole life of searching for spirits on the spot. For example, when she saw a wounded man, she began to describe the needs of the battlefield and to protect the soldiers and put white flags, etc., while playing in the movie. Thinking of a good idea in a matter of seconds. <br /> <br /> In summary, this film robbed Clara Barton from her fight. It robbed her of her humanity, and it reduced all the prices she had made because the script was written with an ancient idea. The author does not know Clara Barton and it seems that he wrote his script from the Britannica Encyclopedia article. (Yes, they have people who have returned), but hey, technology is good! (Who cares)
