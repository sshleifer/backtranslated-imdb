Ben Stiller did not act like a reaction. And he did very well He depends on the comedy that happened around him in There Something About Mary. The scene that stood up was just because Stiller tried to keep the face straight. When he faced Mary's other two partners, he was the most unsightly person in the room. But that scene is hilarious. <br /> <br /> In Accomma, Polly, the recipe is broken for reasons that are hard to understand. Stiller is surrounded by many comic abilities. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best line, which is too small. Having said that, Hoffman relied too much on physical humor, did you know that we are having problems when they go to fart jokes for laughs? The basketball scene at Hoffman Hacking was completely overplayed (although it caused a single situation in the form of an opponent wearing a shirt that caused a smile. However, it seems that everyone is shown in soap bubbles with very little reaction. Hoffman's character and Stiller may play more intimately. Aniston responds to Rachel's role again. But the stiller is not Ross It's a situation "Joey and crush Rachel" more <br /> <br /> Polly is a rom-com with the number as it is. You are not rooted for the character. With a little more work, we may have a deeper story. But in the end, the failure of this film came from bad writing. Looks good if it appears on TV on a slow night. But you will regret having to withdraw cash to see
