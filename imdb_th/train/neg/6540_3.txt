I can't believe that many people are comparing this movie with Argento's. His work is more imaginative and wicked and fun. <br /> <br /> The director lacks the ability to create. True tension, murder scene - and come face to face with it. That's what this kind of about - not interesting. It's not hard to guess who the killer is and I don't really care when it is revealed. Not memorable movies and gothic atmosphere in the 19th century, which has been highly praised, does not attract me. Many actors are quite good. (Especially the headmaster and sadistic girl who is the younger student parent) gets very little to do. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a disguise of incest, Zadoma Sukis and lesbians But surprisingly, they add a little spice or suspicion. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
