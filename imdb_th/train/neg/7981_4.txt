Rookie suffers from a lot. There are random musical songs scattered throughout the film, pointless and slippery, enough to make Jerry Lewis blush. Nun and Leut didn't know when to leave. It takes one full hour before the story is sent to the main plot and the characters will be destroyed. After that, they started playing Japanese sailors with daily standard parody images. It's a shame that the funniest piece of the movie is when Nunan and Levitt are playing with stupid Japanese people. But it was quite tired after switching between two characters Then it ended immediately. Even Julie Newmar, who was naked in the towel, could not save this thing. <br /> <br /> There is very little charm in the movie and it takes more than half an hour. The story just crudged and trying to set up funny and failed situations next to Martin & Lewis. At least Deano was charming and Jerry had an animated face.
