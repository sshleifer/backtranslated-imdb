This is the most boring nonsense I've ever lost in an hour. All I can say is thank God for only an hour. More than half of this film is a video from the original "Crazy Criminals". At the very least, I can see the highlights from the rare classic exploits because of some of the reasons that challenge reality. My video store has "Criminally Insane II" only, but the rest of this movie is the worst video and filming performance you've ever seen. Why does my video store have this and not genuine? Why does this really end in a video store? Why do people rent it and not burn copies immediately when they see the real horror? - AAUUGGHH - Why is God? <br /> <br /> If you don't see the annoying fruit in eating candy The whole bar in the scene is remarkably slow. Or the character that was stabbed to the side (without asking) many times on the back or the only person who had killed a brain cell about poisoning his wife Eating moron flies or just wanting to see Crazy Fat Ethel dancing with a bloody knife in the garden: Don't watch this movie. Repeat: Don't watch this movie. Don't rent this movie. If possible, do not walk through the shelves in the video store with copies of this movie setting. You can still save But now it's too late for me ..
