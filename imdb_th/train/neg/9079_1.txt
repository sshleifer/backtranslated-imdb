What are people talking about? I have to watch a movie that is different from you. I was tired of walking out of the theater. What happened to this I laughed once and was not that difficult. Anyone who has a green light, this movie should be taken out to the street and hit. I always find things I like in movies, but this is crazy. "Slackers" makes "Not Another Teen Movie" seem classic. It was placed there with trash, such as "Body Shots", "Con Air" and "Conspiracy Theory", which is one of the worst Avoid all costs! I think the studio will give money to people as they leave the theater to be a sign of apology. But my fear that didn't happen It seems that I won't see that money for another hour or two.
