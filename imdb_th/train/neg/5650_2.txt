William Shatner in a small size can bear Unfortunately, instead of letting his character have a slight irritation and in moderate fun, it has been seen that it is appropriate to expand his role and overdo it. Just as happened in the original Star Trek series, I guess I will not understand American humor, which is often 'above' in order to receive messages through. I vote with my feet I didn't watch the program anymore, which was a shame anymore because the remaining actors were good. It is a pity that the excessive role of Shatner affects the work of James Spader, but most people show how society is going. I guess. I did not travel in the same path frankly.
