Unfortunately, people decided to spin the best horror movie of all time in my book. This poor copy stole a lot of content from the first three movies to imitate how people die and what will happen in the future with the main characters and it tries to cram three movies into a failed story. It even failed to create a terrifying atmosphere that is good for one. (With the exception of the strange exception that the impressive choir singing brings back memories of old movies) <br /> <br /> The only thing we can appreciate is that there is Not yet as Omen V.
