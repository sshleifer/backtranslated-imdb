Very bad movie with a good time or quality. <br /> <br /> It started with Linda Blair's pregnancy that ran along the path to escape what might be a monster or someone with a shovel. Not sure. She jumped through the window and woke up and we saw that she was very pregnant. The level she had conceived was very different in the movie. <br /> <br /> She and her annoying little boy and mentally retarded that I thought her son had traveled to an abandoned hotel on the island. Italian horror film director finds the most annoying little boy to be shown in their movie! On this island, David Hasselhoff and his German girlfriend are innocent. (You know how German people say that they will love Hasselhoff ...) He is taking pictures and she translates mysterious books about witches. I think <br /> <br /> Traveling to this island is a couple. The elderly have bought it and real estate agents and women, I think. Is their daughter Obviously she was an architect and Linda Blair and the boy were children of an elderly couple. I guess they all travel to the island together. But it seems that Linda and the boys are different from others (may be filmed separately). <br /> <br /> The hotel seems absolutely neat from the outside, but it's not used for any good results. Seniors in bad makeup and black robes appeared to the boys and chanted something in German, which he eventually recorded his Sesame Street tapes. <br /> <br /> People began. Were killed in their dreams Or being sucked into hell or something Some gore scenes are available. But not enough to recommend movies Although the copy that I watch is not cut on the box But the death of one character, which looks like the veins are cut Most scenes show the reactions of other characters because we don't see anything. The most scary scene is the scene in which a man or a demon has a messy wound from the mouth that rapes someone. He looks particularly disgusting. There are scenes that are laughable and painful that Linda Blair has. I hope the horror movies will cast them. They will do original things with her role and let her leave the shaman behind her. (Except the annual horror meeting) <br /> <br /> Italian tradition that claims to be a sequel to something unrelated. This is AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2, that is, it is the sequel of Casa 3 - Ghosthouse, La (1988) - No (that is still a better movie) La Casa 1 and the second is The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - not related to Witchery and La Casa 3 (and There are also Casa 5, La (1990) AKA House 5, which appears to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series. House and House Series: House (1986) House II: The Second Story (1987), The Horror Show (1989) AKA House III and House IV (1992) The Horror Show It's not really. It claims to be a sequel. Therefore, it must be changed in order to cause less confusion. (Or more) Oddly, The Horror Show is AKA Horror House and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House. 2 Is your head hurt?
