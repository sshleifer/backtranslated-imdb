I have to add in the event that someone reads this thing and has not received it completely. These other investigators are not joking. This is the worst color film you have ever seen. When the movie began, I didn't want to believe anything like this, actually making the world see. <br /> <br /> They are not just But when they say that it looks like a movie in the house, it really does, like "director", bringing a hi8 family video camera (before DV cameras and editing without using a computer). (Lighting, sound equipment, etc.) grab students, good-looking actors, go out to film No script, just create it when he walks along. <br /> <br /> When I watch it, it's on my mono TV so I only have one channel. (Left-right speaker) At first I thought I was wrong. The movie was silent until someone talked for a few minutes. I woke up and switched to another channel and suddenly I heard the music and sound effects. But did not hear the dialog They record sounds in different blood channels! I mean, there are movies that look funny. They are good people. I'm not sure if this is one of them. I mean, I will accept as a filmmaker. And watching bad movies will make you want to go out and prove that you do better, you know? But watching this makes me feel sorry for anyone doing it. <br /> <br /> Not as good as they are actors. It's the only good thing about this. I think the chick is hot and is disappointed with her very short shower scene from T and A from her. What will you raise from 3 or 4 but alas if you want to make a movie? But it turned out to be a shit thrown in free naked pictures Working for Roger Corman
