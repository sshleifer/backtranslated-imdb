I've seen this movie and another story, Trinity, is my name and I find that this is worse than the first one. I don't know why they made another movie. It's silly and pointless. Sorry to say that I have all of them. I sat several times and it still made me have to shut down 5 minutes in the movie. I like the movie Terence Hill and I like Bud Spencer, but this movie makes me stick to the wall. If it has a different story, or at least a story and a joke, it might be fun and worth the $ 5 that I spent on buying the entire movie. But you make a mistake, so I will say that save your money and don't leave this movie or something that goes with it. Believe me in this matter.
