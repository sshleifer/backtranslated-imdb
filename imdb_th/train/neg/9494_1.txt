The only thing that surprised me more than the number of people who like this movie is directed by Clint Eastwood, which is a work I admire very much The leader doesn't have any chemistry for sure. I do not believe for a second that there is anything deeper than the desire between them. The story is not real. Add an arrogant conversation, many schemes and an incredibly slow plan that leads to nowhere and you have a real foul. Kay Lenz's nude scenes may be worthwhile for people looking for gourmet food. But otherwise this is a huge waste of time. My thoughts when I watch this movie is that it should be called "Cheesy".
