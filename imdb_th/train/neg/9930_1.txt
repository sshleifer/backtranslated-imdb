The merciless and painful painstaking attempt to cultivate Bart's sheriff's personality from Blaze Saddles to become his weekly sitcom. This is as bad as some people say it! <br /> <br /> Laughter acts to remind viewers who are not using funny things. All of this is intended to be a joke and a really hopeless way of laughing! <br /> <br /> However, it's quite interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. trying his best to disguise himself as Cleavon Little. His shame is shown through every scene. He had a lot more fun in the HBO El Diablo movie than he was here in this cheese sheet. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the best and most fun thing about Black Bart is the name of his horse!
