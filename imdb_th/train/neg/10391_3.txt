I've watched the movie Gator Bait, and this is almost the same. The woman was sexually assaulted by a group of men who had deteriorated and demanded her systematic brutal revenge in each person. What makes this film different from those? (Although not very far) is that sexual content is not regarded There are many full naked pictures throughout the story. But not seconds that it's sexy Some scenes of rape may look a bit wide. But that is because the film tries to increase the needs of the audience to see that this woman wants revenge. <br /> <br /> This is a weak movie. In order to preserve other interests besides managing our natural desires to see this woman receive revenge on her attacks I spit on your grave, not a movie that you expect to receive morally seriously. But I am glad to see that due to the large amount of violence that leads to female leadership, it does not mean that T&A movies <br /> <br /> Film B is famous for nudity and sexual behavior control. Teen and while I Spit On You Grave is a movie B and has more share than nudity The nude picture doesn't drive the storyline. On the other hand, the only thing that makes this plot is absolutely necessary to take revenge on the rape group. These men are a non-destructive evolution, as in the movie Gator Bait and the biggest challenge for writers seems to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them. But the reason for this movie is nothing more More than the movie B, which has no meaning because it does not send any messages, but is a response to the needs of the audience to see the gangsters who have received what they deserve. <br /> <br /> One problem This makes us have to go through sexual assault. Surprisingly, the first half of this movie is the most nude part. (Although not very much) but it is the most painful thing We gave up even a little when we watched women get revenge due to the deaths of two details that they were clearly impossible. (It seems fortunate that the man in the lake at the end felt an overwhelming desire. The motor vehicle on the boat and pressing his penis against the propeller was like that while the woman shouted the last word he had and pulled the rope) but again this film fulfilled the desire for revenge that the first half was full of We <br /> <br /> (spoiler) You know that this is all movies that have to be done because it will end at the last minute that the last man was killed. The woman didn't live happily. After that, she didn't write the book. She didn't leave and didn't go back to the nightmare place. She just boarded the boat and motorized around the lake while the movie stopped in the track. But wait, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> Oh and have you read the slogan? If you decide to waste time watching this thing, try and find out if there is any man who is burnt or burnt I'm really looking forward to them ??
