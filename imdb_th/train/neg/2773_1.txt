He is a slim figure, a magical flying magician. He was thrown here. The rest of these people cannot leave playing junior high school. There are no monotonous conversations and special effects being called as often as possible. <br /> <br /> It's quite easy to see that some people in Asia have coins and want to build vehicles for tourists.

Or may be a director or writer who needs credit I guess any occupation that has this movie is in the certificate. <br /> <br /> Do your best to be a master and don't watch this movie. One hundred people who thanked Turkey for not being able to eat this turkey. <br /> <br /> One funny scene was not intended. The King's brother appears on the King's scene? Asian actors that are more handsome and short-lived (Bad actor) Brother? Europe, six feet (such as a bad actor) has no excuse for this.
