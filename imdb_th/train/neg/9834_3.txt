One of the more "Lone Stars" with more knowledge by spending time developing characters and interacting and doing business. The opening scene (literally) for the character of the gambler, Kansas Charlie (Eddie Chandler) and his friend, John Scott (John Wayne) Rodeo Oh (saying that Roh-Day-oh) has a passion for this movie is their adventure as they try to do their best to find Mexican Juanita and later they pursue Mary. Corman Perky, whose brother is an inevitable evil And of course, they were wrongly accused of two crimes and had to be jailed before escaping and being disputed at the end. <br /> <br /> The highest point is Scott continued Her grocery store and knocking the stairs, she stood on so he could catch her and grab her as she fell. It seems to be a little contemporary for Westerners of the 30s, but sounds better than it actually is. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the exciting action elements that we find in other Lone Stars are gone No Yakima Canutt, the use of cheap and bad stock footage of riders falling from the horse without George Hayes. Stooge - like boredom - two plays between Scott and Charlie and Charlie swinging at Scott Scott stomped on his feet and punched him. (Repeat twice!) The skilled Paul Fix doesn't work. Eddy Chandler himself here in his big star debut isn't really convincing that he is a side player with him. The villain looks too old and too fat. Chandler, who spent his career in more than 300 films as a Mary Kornman Meatloaf from his twenties "Our Gang" (see 'Mary, Queen of Tots' 1925) is cute in the scene. With John Wayne but that's about it The seeds of a better Western lie are buried here. <br /> <br /> P.S. A short, colorful version that looks good, moves very fast. It will end if you blink more than once. Fortunately, the infamous scene with Eddy Chandler was cut off.
