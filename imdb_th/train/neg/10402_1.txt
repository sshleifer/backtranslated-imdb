Hmm ... Shaking me. The original began in 1990 and I found the movie to be fun. However, they made a second and third shake. Trust me, those movies started to fall after they finished the first movie. Only God can answer that question. "Why, in the name of the gods, will they create another one in the dive in the movie?" Tremors IV can not be considered a bad movie. Well, because it lives more than that While I was trying to sit, even though it was, I noticed that my eyes started to bleed and I had hoped that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the TV and kill me They think that dressing up for people who are staring in other movies, as if we were from the west, will make this movie better? Honestly, I would not recommend buying this movie. I mean there is a cheaper way to find things that burn well.
