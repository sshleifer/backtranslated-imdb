Maybe I can't find the DVD menu selection for PLOT: ON OFF. Obviously the default is off. When the credit started to roll, I couldn't believe it was like that. But the beautiful character, I feel that it is dirty, cheap .... <br /> <br /> The characters are drawn in a very wide rhythm. I think myself to be "Roosevelt Democrats" but will appreciate a little deeper. <br /> <br /> Of course, the problem may be with me. I see that others seem to be searching for meaning or text in this image. Alas, not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes me not "1" is a beautiful scenery for both humans and plants.
