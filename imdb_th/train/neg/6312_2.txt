In the last 20 years, most British films about the gruesome poverty of the United Kingdom and our youth did not have the opportunity to live a good life while they lived on the streets of England. The British film industry is obsessed with the idea that Trainspotting, this is England, Kidulthood, Football Factory, Kes and from London to Brighton <br /> <br /> Bullet Boy is just another British movie that has been added to the list. The main character represents the desire to go straight. But he still insists on hanging on the dead rhythm that carries a gun and fighting with gang members I was never confident that he wanted to go straight because there was nothing to stop him in education or trade. In fact, it will be a breath of fresh air if he goes straight and we have characters that change his life. But he takes his time to help a friend try to kill someone I do not feel sympathetic when he is shot by another teenager at the end of this film, which is sad because at the beginning of this movie I like the whole family and the desire to succeed. I believe that the Creator missed a great opportunity to show the world that success belongs to those who are willing to fight for it. <br /> <br /> I know that the purpose of this film is to try to draw realistic images of life for black teenagers living in the UK work area. But we didn't have enough of this film in the UK. With that same plot It is not time that these talented writers and writers will give what the youth desires and show them that the better life is near. <br /> <br /> I applaud the Bullet Creator. Boy that doesn't load full movies Of unreasonable violence to try and succeed through the shocking factors (such as Kidulthood, Football Factory) Not happy to finish this film or any other subject that I have mentioned.
