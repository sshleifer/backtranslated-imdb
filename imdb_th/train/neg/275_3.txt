It is incredible to me that everyone can comment that this film doesn't preach. Not only preaching to oppress But ridiculous as a step Looks like it feels like a child 8 years old is punished by having to write. "I will not become a fascist" on 100 blackboards. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that it was created during WW2 and intended to condemn Hitler's courage and suffering. Scary that he brought (Which everyone will applaud for the whole heart) and I'm sure it captures the mood of the day precisely But it was presented in an immature and clear form. The big hammer failed as an art work perfectly. <br /> <br /> The only good performance from Paul Lukas. Which brings sincerity Acted as a brave anti-fascist And Lucille Watson as a wealthy grandmother who gradually came to realize how dangerous the world is. Although their unproductive parenting will cause them to face all kinds of hardships, children are shown to be ridiculous as small robots that behave well. They don't look like real humans from a distance. And Bette Davis, the best actress. This is one thing that I have a noble family every time she is on the screen. All of her words, she used every gesture to convey how she was a savior and understanding with her husband and the great reason he fought so that she had to be late to receive painful electric shock. If you dare Allowing doubt or shading on the surface of her drawing. <br /> <br /> So yes, this is a very important movie.
