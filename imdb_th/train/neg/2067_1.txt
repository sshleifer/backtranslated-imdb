Straight to the point: "The Groove Tube" is one of the most horrific, ridiculous, and unfounded movies ever created. This "comedian" is a void of things that are similar to the traces of wisdom that are in the distance. Until almost impossible to understand that it was made even a little I said that almost because there were fans of everything after that. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even "good", not good or "fun". Not good. Putting this movie at the same level of entertainment as "Plan 9" or "Robot Monster" will be a crime against those movies. Movies like this, you can watch and kick out. But this movie is terrible, badly done, acts and writes scripts and is incredibly stubborn that there are no signs of "camp" or "schlock" to be found. <br /> <br /> Although this was created Before the Saturday night in the premiere, the comparison may not be avoided I'm not a big fan of SNL, but this movie is worse than the worst SNL you can find. And that man is not good In order to prevent male viewers from going out, Shapiro wears a pair of breasts every time, but the chest that has been badly taken since 1974 won't wake anyone today. In fact, this movie is not well built and is a sleepy attitude. I wonder if they will make everyone excited in 1974. <br /> <br /> A man named Ken tea. Piro made this movie I swear to God. A ten year old boy who uses a video camera can make something fun and smarter. It is not really serious - this is a truly unbelievable movie, "jokes" and "jokes" are young children that even the little boys who like to watch porn at dad at night will not laugh. > <br /> I will give this movie the only story - the last sequence of "dancers" that the men (Shapiro) on the streets of New York dance to dress up as the best in this horror movie. It is not that the "dancer" sequence is great as well - it has an unwise moment as Shapiro tries to fill the time for all the songs - but actually it's quite remarkable to watch. Part of the following scene in which the police began to dance with that man is the only trace of intelligence in the entire film. It is not surprising that Shapiro will place this order - again, while himself is not excellent, it can overcome other things in <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this movie will be completely offensive. How can a true human be a pointless person? The name of this movie should be "Ken Shapiro's Craparama". It's amazing that this thing was created. But many talented filmmakers couldn't come in. However, I would say I'm betting on geniuses that NYU will love this movie. All junk.
