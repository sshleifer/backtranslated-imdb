Not the best movie to watch today. I read a lot of reviews about Shining and expect it to be very good. But this movie disappointed me Good sound and environment But there is no story Don't have a terrible moment I expect horror horror movies But without horror movies that don't have The only scene that I feared is that during the scene changing the act of "Wednesday", there are many fragments in the movie. Most things are left unexplained without anything linked to anything The story does not tell us about women or other scenes that may be a good movie to watch in the 80s, but not for the 21st century.
