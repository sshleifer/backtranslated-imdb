As a fan of BSG's first two seasons and BSG Razor's outstanding features, I hope this release will make the franchise back to its original glory. I often have no problems with science fiction, which is mostly a dialogue driven by compared to the bonanza, the image of special effects. If the script is tight with the original ideas delivered by good actors, you can create a subtle movie using only a small amount of CGI. This prequalification does not contain any of the above mentioned requirements. The virtual world created by teenagers, terrorists, both absurd and unbelievable. This scene was used to increase the level of limited release, not that teenagers would not love virtual holes filled with sexual and violent music and heavy dance music. It is part of a teenager of the same age who has a deep understanding and reason or political and religious commitment to create future software or become a suicide bomber that confuses me. These children certainly do not come from this world. This movie plays like a TV drama with only the last 10 minutes, which is a little interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz makes his cyborg receive reconciliation from the robot through the student's firmware upgrade, if not Fun But this old concept shows better and more believable in The classic "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff Caprica tearing the only interesting idea from the old Hollywood horror movie No wonder! Overall, this movie looks polite & not original & insulting by using CGI to recycle Caprica from BSG. I wonder if I will watch this space soap when it premieres in the Sci-Fi channel unless I suffer from Insomnia, which this show will be the exact treatment. Zzzzzzzz
