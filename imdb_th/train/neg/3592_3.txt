For fans of the series, I have to admit that the Hidden Frontier wasn't that bad. But this series review cannot be referred to as a series fan or not. The initiative in itself is commendable. Creativity as well I think these people are a normal job and an enthusiastic heart of Star Trek, but all this work. Pull all these resources Taking all this time and still having those shortcomings Is about to burst laughter all the time And most characters are just reading their lines Directors should be aware of the fact that "Retake" is not just a dictionary word. But I can guess that this series was created in the style of "Two Takes Frakes" which directed TNG episodes and many movies. I couldn't help. But think that most actors are general trekkies without having to go deep into the assumption. <br /> <br /> My biggest concern about the whole project. When they decide to spend a lot of time and resources on this series - why don't they use it in the right quality? The use of fast time formats with low, low resolution can damage the ability, even when "higres" is considered poor quality compared to the standard quality series that has been launched using the Xvid codec. More detail and file size will help improve the experience intensively. If the problematic band is a problem with the installation of a heavy rain track, it can be fixed. <br /> <br /> We hope that the team will decide to clear the series and may release it on the DVD for the project. Have quality deserved
