Before writing this review, I went back to reviewing other people's opinions first. This film is especially disappointing because it has two favorite dancers. Gene Kelly and George Chakiris have a questionable rating from Michel LeGrand ("Wuthering Heights," "Ice Station Zebra" "The Thomas Crowne Affair "") The dance is exaggerated, without commitment and not original. The forgotten song is a joke. Even the costing didn't flatter. Only the correct shooting captures the right emotions and spirits. I'm glad that other people like "The Young Girls of Rochefort" even though I certainly can't.
