I saw this movie in 'Sneak preview' and I have to confess honestly that I don't like movies with Meryl Streep so much. This picture is the worst. Half the theater didn't return after halftime. I can not blame them if this is not true that there is no need in the second half of the picture. Before the movie moved forward in about ten years, I was expecting credit to appear.
