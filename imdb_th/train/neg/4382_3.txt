"Black Emanuelle", the fifth book that I have ever seen, may be the most interesting plot, as well as the brave female journalist, is investigating the white slave / prostitute racket that took her from San Francisco. To Rome to Macau New York hometown! This film is a story of a veteran in the past who has a completely different role: Ivan Rassimov (appearing here as head of the UN committee for third world countries!) Karin Shubert (as a feminist journalist) And Don Powell (Rassimov's driver) <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this type of movie (As shown during the night) is heavily modified and is a graphic scene (described in "Stracultr) that Asian slave traders have been brought to him by being sodomized by dogs. There will never be seen here. !! Is still a harrowing sequence in this film when politicians, politicians, playful, tricky, two girls (Including nature, Gemser and Shubert) attended the midnight meeting under the New York bridge along the group of bums (this is how he got their vote, get it!) - with his high society friends looking Looks creepy. <br /> <br> The most ridiculous element of this program - aside from Gems, she likes to take off clothes completely every time she enters the house. (Even in the presence of strangers) - She traveled to India to interview the rogue / philosopher (George Eastman acted like Christ!) Who found the way to prolong the coitus; Of course, when Emanuel called him up, he decided to cum quickly ... !!
