No one is a big fan of Geroge Macdonald Fraser's Flashman document than I am. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see that Richard Lester was a Royal Flash director because I saw him doing the Three / Four Musketeers with Fei. Raser, which I think is quite good. <br /> <br /> I don't have a royal flash. <br /> <br /> I am 12 years old when this movie was released and I didn't become more enthusiastic since I was. Have read all the Flashman documents that were published until that time and were intoxicated with A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (I still live, but I never received a chance after that) <br /> <br /> something disappointing (I saw it again when I was about 20 years old on television and it was even worse.) <br /> <br /> There are no sharp conversations in the books that were sent to the screen. Flashman's funny character seems to me to be wrong in the same way that anyone imagines a high school student trying to mock it. The duel and fencing is scary and not bad. <br /> <br /> Looking back at this more mature look br> If you read the book and didn't watch the movie, I can say that The movie ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg becoming fast friends and playing the game. Rudi recently invented: Russian roulette. <br /> <br /> The pitiful betrayal of everything in the book about <br /> < br /> My opinion will be more direct if f I have watched the movie recently, but I'm glad I couldn't. <br /> If there is any chance that Fraser has read this, I can say that I think he is a genius - maybe May be the greatest cartoonist of his generation But depending on my appreciation for the work, it is hard to believe him. Wrote this screenplay because he made all those horrible Roger Moore James Bond movies
