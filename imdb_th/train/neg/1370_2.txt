Warning ****: This is a spoiler **** Why do I have to spend many years looking at garbage quickly? This movie is an impressive collection, bad writing, worse governance, we haven't shown yet. <br /> <br /> And of course you can predict the whole story from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Hero experts fight fools, dishonesty and incompetence. One avalanche was shut down and buried all the living heroes, despite the dangers of all kinds. The damaged partners that cause all things are spanning the whole life with his reward. The second avalanche deviated bravely from the trials of the treacherous experts. The evil servants in the end turned out to have a heart as well. A teenager with a problem falls into the arms of her ferocious stepmother after receiving help from her, etc., etc., etc., etc. On and on, <br /> <br /> In fact, there is little reason to warn the destroyer. You may make the whole storyline if I give you the basic ingredients. At the very least, I did not close the mark too much and predicted what would happen next. <br /> <br /> Then we didn't talk about the error based on facts. <br /> <br / > I agree with the previous reviewers that even though there is a redemption feature, sometimes even though it's a bad movie You will be hard pressed to find any in this place. I think I gave 2 out of 10 pictures for beautiful scenery, but that's it. <br /> <br /> It was a time when this movie made me groan.
