I saw this movie in the cinema when I was a kid and always remembered that it was my first experience with being torn from horrible movies with good ads. Very good ads but I discovered later Whether it has an explosion every time or 'Special effects' in all movies (about 4) and even something that isn't in the movie There is a plot about aliens. But aliens have never actually shown in the movie as much as I can remember. Obviously it was the case of someone who created a cheap movie designed to trick people. I guess my world of innocence will end that day when I find that there are bad people there who create bad movies.
