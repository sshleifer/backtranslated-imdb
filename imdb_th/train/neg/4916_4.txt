This 1970's hit movie is not very old. But honestly said that it was not good when released But it was a very popular success, perhaps because the idea of ​​the love of a deceased child had to draw the attention of an audience full of television broadcasts of the Vietnam War. This plot is pure music because it involves Oliver Barrett IV, a Harvard-exempt hockey player who met and fell in love with Jenny Cavelleri, a Vassar music student who is proud of his background. Work her The father of his old school disagrees with Jenny and in the typical act of rebellion, it means that a young couple is married in a hippie ceremony. He entered his dream job in New York. But she was seriously ill and died from a terrible disease There are some techniques of creating a contemporary film, staged by director Arthur Hiller, but nothing can hide the old and boring stories at its core. The inevitable ending made me especially in love. <br /> <br /> Both Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw became a star with this movie, Oliver and Jenny, but can't explain it. Unable to convey the depth or complexity required Interesting character At least O'Neill was a sincere child in his weak challenge, but MacGraw was made of wood and had stains in difficult behaviors to see what Oliver saw in Jenny, besides the sarcastic face of you John Marley (Two years before finding a headless horse in his bed in "The Godfather"), better than when Jenny's plainspoken, Baker's father, Phil, like Ray Millland, is Barrett. Too many familiar Frances Lai paterfamilias became a parody of themselves over the years. The print quality on the DVD is good. But the only special thing is that the comments are quite effervescent by Hiller. The most interesting thing about the trivia is that the author Erich Segal (who is the movie with this book) thinks Oliver is a mixture of roommates. Harvard's two people he knows ?? Vice President Al Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones who participated in the movie as Oliver's roommate.
