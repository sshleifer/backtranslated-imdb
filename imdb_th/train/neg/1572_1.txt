Is one of the worst movies I've ever seen Great performances, laughing action (Obviously, the car is traveling slowly) The cruel script, unsatisfactory ending and unsatisfactory direction make the movie hash. We know that Judge Reinhold is a good actor. But he should be ashamed of this scrap There is no tension inside the car, and when the character stumbles upon a moment of hope, they laugh like a madman without reason for some reason, even 'five ing' when they see the bridge falling In addition, the chain of events that brought these people to share the reliability of the same car species Obviously, depending on the actual event, right? If so, the truth is stranger than fiction! Unfortunately, it was shown improperly.
