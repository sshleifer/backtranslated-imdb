All of these accounts may be interesting movies. Presented by the great Cradle Of Filth starring Dani and served as "The future of British horror" I expect Chandon's Alex festival to live up to the hype. <br /> <br /> I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything about the movie. This is funny or inappropriate. Setting the anthology of this short story happened for death. (And much better) in the seventies and eighties Accepted the idea of 'Patient room' cools my spine. But as most movies were left with bad scripting and acting, <br /> <br /> Chandon was unable to write the conversation. Every sentence with the police's main inspector is filled with swearing and insolence (police 'generally on the formula' funny, well I'm sure I've seen elsewhere before ...) No Chandon, you're not Tarantino. Or Scorsese teeth It sounds bad. Add a laughing OTT show with a dodgy cast. (Don't understand me wrong, Dani Filth is a great singer and musician But the actor he didn't belong to) and the performance was too big for the veins to explode Let Bruce Campbell every day. <br /> <br /> The visual effects look terrible for those who have a vicious CGI. (For the sake of goodness, Peter Jackson did better than the budget) and the filter that was overloaded - used! For the use of Cradle Of Filth points that are often wrong ... People should sue. <br /> <br /> The basic problem of Cradle Of Fear is that it is serious. Try to create an atmosphere and stir up terror. Scared and Disgust within the target group Too many good horror movies made in the seventies and eighties. Do this better with superior blood effects (such as maniac, zombie eaters, beyond, suspicion, etc.), performances. Cradle of Fear in my heart is outdated. <br /> <br /> I hope Chandon can learn from the horrific ghouls of this film and take action to create a horrible quality horror. <Br / > <br /> Good luck next time
