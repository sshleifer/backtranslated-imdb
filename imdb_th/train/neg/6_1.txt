From the beginning of the movie, it felt that the director tried to portray some of the things I meant, instead of telling a story that defined the style that should be done in this film. The type of movement he wants to create and write the story to assemble it. And he failed in this serious matter I think he is trying to create a stylish movie. The way I think this movie wastes all time and effort. In the director's credit, he knows the media that he works with. What I'm trying to say is that I watched the worst movie. At least the director knows to keep the continuity in the movie. And the actors also have good performance
