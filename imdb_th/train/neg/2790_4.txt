Julia (Christina Copeland) travels with Stephen Harris (Steven Man), her husband and Alex. Their son son spends a few days with her family in Savage Island. Which is their own island Both are expected to resolve their problems over the weekend in remote islands. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven find two strange men at the pier and when her brother Peter. (Brendan Becker) arrived. He explained that his family lived in the squatters of squatters. Peter's careless smoke pot while driving the truck at night and turning off the headlights to show off However, he ran to the youngest son of a fierce family. But in the dark he believed that he had hit the beast Later, the Savage family claimed that Alex was the compensation for the lost son. Young families do not accept trade and they start a serious war between families. <br /> <br /> "Savage Island" is a very low budget movie with stupid screenplay, amateur movies. The story with flaws is totally ridiculous and there are many unbelievable situations. For example, two men would leave two babies with their babies alone on the road at night with the threat of a crazy family. The logical steps will immediately go to the continent and bring the police forces to help Peter. Then the young family disappeared. Julia and Steven left their cars on the continent and their homes and friends and no one chased them? Peter calls Julia, Alex, his sister when he arrives with the ship at first. There are many flaws in this flick that I can use to write many lines about it. I believe that this movie was filmed with a home video camera. A good actor deserves better material to work. My rating is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ("Island of Blood")
