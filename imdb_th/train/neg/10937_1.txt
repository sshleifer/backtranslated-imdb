Every time while the movie is ready to be scary, I feel compelled to warn people. If I work hard all day and I can save my life But only one from watching this movie, my happiness will be great. <br /> <br /> Where will I start the conversation about pain? For those who have started editing music every five minutes, there is no character development. All characters are fixed rules. We have people who swear, fat people who eat donuts, stupid foreigners, etc. The script feels as though it was written when the movie was shot. The production value is so low that I feel that I'm watching a high-level video presentation. Ever had a director, producer, etc. Have you ever watched a movie? Halestorm is getting worse and worse with new arrivals every time. The concept of this movie sounds very funny. How do you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a relatively legitimate actor? But believe me when I say this thing is very wrong
