This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Again, I made a mistake in buying movies because of the synapse sound on the back. It sounds cool and the cover looks very cool as well. (After buying this and the movie "Malevolence" that I review here as well. I've learned the lesson.) I love horror movies that happen in the woods or in the desert or on farms. This should happen in the forests of Texas. But may be filmed in the director's backyard The production is probably the worst I've ever seen. The actor is certainly the worst. The story is not related to what the back cover says. I also tried to sell it to F.Y.E and other "mom and pop" stores that bought used DVDs. That is a pathetic excuse for the movie. I've seen bad movies before (such as Troll 2) but this is definitely a cake. I don't think there will be any worse movies. "Troll 2" I'm wrong! Don't buy this movie until someone sends it to you without any charge, but you shouldn't leave it. That's what I'm going to do !!!!
