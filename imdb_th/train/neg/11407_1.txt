This film is a perfect example of a wonderful book that was destroyed by the movie. I love Jacob, probably the worst movie I've ever seen. There is no story. The plan disappears and the correction is terrible. Above all, the music straight from the synthesizer and it sounds incredibly terrible. Bridget Fonda's performance is appropriate, but other people's performances are completely amateur I would like to introduce this film to people who are studying to be producers to study how not to make a movie because it is a scene filled with bad scenes. Read books and don't waste time on this movie.
