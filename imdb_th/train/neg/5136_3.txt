Fall into the movie category of "The way too ridiculous in the negotiations and actions that must be taken seriously" while screaming, if you know what I do on Friday, thirteen or after, my girlfriend knows that they do not. Well, Scarecrow is not. Evil Dead sets a high standard for comedy horror in the budget category that Scarecrow is out of place. <br /> <br /> Wondering that there is no experience immediately when playing because there is no sign Disturbing noises or vibrations in the chassis and cockpit of the plane in the air. The visual representation of 3 men repeatedly just screaming for the story arc. But nothing happened Even if a man is a scarecrow But there is no explanation. <br /> <br /> Knowing that this movie is too serious because of your own good may cause a smile. I can't remember that Joe Bob Briggs used to preview the scarecrow. But I believe he will not bow down However, with more than 6 IMDb scores, many people disagree.
