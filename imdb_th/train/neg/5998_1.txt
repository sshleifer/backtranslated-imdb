The basic formula for the original set is; Bring someone to take the audience to like them and cause them to be in serious danger. This formula works for 32 episodes made between 1964-68. <br /> <br /> Now we move forward 40 years to 2004 .. We have been introduced to Alan Tracy, a school boy. A rather diligent college with his friend, Fermat, a knowledgeable child. They were drawn by Lady Penelope in Ford Thunderbird, her pink color, to the paradise on the family island. Tracy lives during the school holidays. Almost immediately, they were left in the care of Kyrano and his daughter, Tin-Tin, while the adults went to help John from Thunderbird 5, which had been damaged by a scene accident. This is part of The Hood's plan to take over Tracy Island so he can steal Thunderbird's machine ... <br /> <br /> To rob the bank <br /> <br /> Yes. The plot is soft as before! <br /> <br /> The conversation is repeated, the show is made of wood rather than a puppet. (Fiberglass) Any effect But special and Hans Zimmer score ??? Barry Gray's glorious theme is only a little sparkling through Zimmer's lackluster music. The rest of the score is clearly forgotten. In fact, part of the score was broadcast the following week on the radio and didn't know! I am not interested in seeing the moderate effort of Busted with the last position. <br /> <br /> For justice, Ron Cook works quite well, like Parker, he and Sophia Miles when Penelope wasted. With the right materials, they will receive stoppers. CGI work is what I would call leadership - 5 years ago. <br /> <br /> The change of the main vehicle is wrong. At least now, the original series is moving as if they were masses. <br /> <br /> Another pain point is that all production seems to be one of the long product positioning from the car. Every car that Ford created The Tracy Freezer at Ben & Jerry's was produced. <br /> <br /> My son (9) enjoyed this movie. But the relationship between Spy Kids and 'Clockstoppers' goes straight to his age group. When Star Trek hit the giant screen in 1979 with 'The Motion Picture', a new life full of franchises continued. 20 years or more In this film, Frakes missed a golden opportunity to do the same with the Thunderbird franchise. <br /> <br /> I predicted that this movie, like 'The Avengers' and 'the Saint' before that. Sinking into confusion within 6 months by allowing the original series to be in a 'classic' state
