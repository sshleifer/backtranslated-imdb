I think this movie should be shocking. But the only way that it was shocking is the way to make it terrible ... and it was for an hour and a half of torture Moreover, for the audience rather than for the characters in the movie (The five girls) <br /> <br /> Sure, the main characters get their blood pieces in a bad way, which is basically quite good. Movies and I (usually) like horror. I have no problem with violence in this type of film. However, the violence in this film does not have an end. It is not a phenomenon other than it is a strange thing. It is very weak and it is boring and too fast. <br /> <br /> The bad thing. the best (If the above is not good enough for you) About this movie is that they tried to imitate Blair Whitch. The project was filmed with a cheap mobile camera, but (again like this) did not have any end in "Blair. Which "of course, there is an explanation: they have a camera looking for a Blair witch In this movie there are no other explanations except: "Hey, you want this story to look like Blair Whitch !!" The sound in the movie is also something that makes me feel depressed. The girl screamed madly so many times that you can't speak out. In addition, there is no attempt to make it better, smarter or more intelligent. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a soundtrack which is as bad as the rest. <br /> <br /> My advice: Do not watch this thing under any circumstances.
