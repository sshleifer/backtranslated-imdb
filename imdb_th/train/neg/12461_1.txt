Contrary to most comments about "Syriana" on the IMDb website, I and my family found that watching this movie on DVD at home is a waste of time and space. <br /> <br /> In short, this is Movies made from scripts that writers are too smart Rather than trying to tell a complicated story in a clever and clear way, it was assumed that most of the vague and difficult pitching would be interconnected. Different 30-second vignettes of different stories from a dozen or so. The audience made for clear and excellent viewing. No, it can't. What makes great viewing is clarity, precision, plot and story - and characteristics - which have a starting point in the middle and end. <br /> <br /> The presentation of this kind of movie is similar to The dim sum experience in the Chinese restaurant - with ingenuity and cleverness in the ultimate sense. <br /> <br /> Thank God for presenting TV and DVDs of Hollywood movies and British movies in the last decade. 1940 and 1950. The directors and actors knew the value of the storytelling, the use of words and expressions that were meaningful. <br /> <br /> This is the only DVD that this family will not watch. next
