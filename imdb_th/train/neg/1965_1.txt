Apparently Stephen J. Cannel decided a few years ago that he would expand his horizons and duel with horror. The result was "Dead Above Ground", a disgusting piece. Now, I noticed his name in relation to this particular film. I'll take it back. But no, I didn't wear my glasses and so I missed it, damn I wanted to bring those people together while shopping videos. The first question is who will be the target group for this matter? It's almost like a "scary" child movie, but then again there are babies that don't have upper parts and some wounds and bad words come here and there. The main character is so cute that you want to see someone, whoever goes with them with some kind of farming. It seems that a man will open a bed and breakfast with a former checkered witch, killing a child who keeps the teeth of children living there. May be something that a real estate agent does not mention Of course, in the present day there is a little girl around to remind the real girl who is now there that there are bad things going on. It can be done and there are two Bubbas that are squatting in that place when the new owner takes possession so that they will go out for revenge as well. All of this has the feeling of garbage made for cable for children on Halloween, except of course, things that are not suitable for small children. But there is only confusion like this. Boo large and hissing at Anchor Bay for placing this thing as well. When considering their usual music program with a good release, this is a new low point United Kingdom received a set of girlfriend boxes, we received "tooth fairy" seems fair 1 in 10 of all garbage
