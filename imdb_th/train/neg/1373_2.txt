This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I often watch a movie for some production. But the more annoying behavior of more than half of the characters made me appreciate Any part of this movie <br /> <br /> The most common thing is to assume that the building designer is a mistake because of falling down. <br /> <br /> In addition, the attempt to skip the avalanche style is not effective. Running 10 feet into some trees is not effective. Alas, here, as mentioned earlier, that the stupidity and the stupidity of some characters. That is ridiculous In an enclosed space with limited oxygen for four years old, can tell that starting a fire is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> However, about 5 minutes of the movie will redeem itself and be appreciated. However, if you have a modest intellect, you will find that this movie is most difficult to tolerate. <br /> <br /> It makes me embarrassed that many quality stories are not produced. > <br /> Oh, I'm talking about the last five minutes? Well, to let the hook, you have to look further to see the latest avalanche techniques. Absolutely worthless
