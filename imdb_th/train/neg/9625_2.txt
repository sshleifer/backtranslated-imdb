This film does not have imagination in place or in action. But these are just two things that come to mind after watching a comedy called "No Energy" A story about picky about risk managers. Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller) analysis of his new wife, Lisa (Debra Messing). Unfaithful to a diving instructor. (Hank Azaria) After one honeymoon day When returning home, Reuben and his close friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) went to a party and ran to Polly Prince. (Jennifer Aniston), where they went to school many years ago. <br /> <br /> ***** Spoiler ALERT ***** Polly, forgetful and sloppy, and live without Worry, which is the opposite of Reuben But they started the day and Ruben began to change as a person when he began to try new things like salsa dancing. And eat spicy food But one day Lisa came back and wanted to marry Reuben. But he doesn't really need But Polly decides to leave because she doesn't believe in the marriage that will start. <br /> <br /> This movie is John Hamburg's second directed effort, who wrote two screenplays in general in "Zoolander" and "Meet the Parents", but these two films seem to be classic movies compared to movies. this story It's easy to say something that's not funny. But I think with this movie it's easier to think about why. This film is completely and completely predictable from the beginning to the end in every scene that looks as if it were just because of the absurdity of the screenplay. Hamburg, who wrote the script, seemed to write this without thinking of trying something different, and sometimes he tried to create the same energy as "There is something about Mary" but instead of seeing incredible events Does anyone think that a blind ferret is a joke? If you make your easy! A few times during the characters in the movie, there are mysterious emotional speeches which should summarize everything. But what they accomplished was clear exaggeration. Stiller works very well. But sometimes he should work less and better times to come to him because this film is not working as a comedian or romance
