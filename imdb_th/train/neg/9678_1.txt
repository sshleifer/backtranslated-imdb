I'm sorry to say that it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although it is visually attractive (For example, the use of color is a very amazing thing) but it is boring and disturbing (see father / son's sexual intercourse) <br /> <br /> There's nothing more than music that's totally absent and if you think Those great soundtracks by Michael Nyman (the composer of most of the Greenaway movies). Then you can imagine the difference that it created. <br /> <br />
