This film is about a British prisoner of war from the Second World War who escaped from a camp in Germany. <br /> <br /> I found "The Wooden Horse" frustratingly boring. This story is exciting, paranoid, and fueled, but there is a simple "wooden horse" telling. It is a collection of simple and bad events that say there is no suspension and excitement. The first half clearly says how prisoners of war dig up the tunnel. But the events are simple, there are not enough mistakes and shave close to give me an advantage. In the second half of this movie, even worse, they just moved from one place to another without chasing cats and mice. And the characters may talk less and have more action in action movies! I was disappointed with "The Wooden Horse". It lost the potential to be a great movie.
