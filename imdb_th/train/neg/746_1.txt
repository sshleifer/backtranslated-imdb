Save $ 8.97 that you will spend at Walmart to buy this DVD and watch the real movie of Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> I'm a filmmaker and a big fan of HG Wells. I have to buy. Hope to sit. Down and watch the good entertainment for three hours But it took four days to finish the story because I couldn't stand to watch more than 10 minutes each time. It was horrible. <br /> <br /> It was reported that Timothy Hines had a budget of $ 20 million for Produce this Where is it going? Did he use it most to buy a new home? His retirement finances? Or what? Let me start with the really good thing about this movie. It is not true with the book and there are good performances there. I can respect the actors who are trying to make this movie noticeably better. But good performances are obscured by the horrifying fast ... and I mean the terrifying special technique. All movie school students can do better than CGI. For me, most of them seem like "Stop action" Pitch the card that is used more than complicated CGI software. The $ 20 million project should be used. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for amateur post production at Applied to this film My partner and I sat down and created a version of our Ferry scene using software that cost less than $ 1,500.00 and within a day there was a five minute scene that looked better and more realistic than Hines created. I used to watch movies with budget. Less than $ 2 million looks much better. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the special effects used in the original King Kong are more complex and better than the special effects of hi. In the film In fact, I have a much better appreciation for Attack of the Killer Tomatoes because of this movie. Today's technology doesn't have any excuses for movies that look like B-Movie in the 1950s, unless it's the intention that shouldn't be in this project. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with DVD transfer. The film is very twitching, showing the creation of amateur movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to say that I produced a $ 45,000 project in 2003 with special movies and effects. This movie /> <br /> I would like to recommend to everyone who appreciates good filmmaking or those who are fans of WOTW to leave the film on the shelf and watch Attack of the 50 Foot Woman instead of it. Will be easier on the eyes
