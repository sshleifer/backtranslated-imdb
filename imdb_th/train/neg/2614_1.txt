The sequel to the creation of Disney's live action in 1996 from 101 Dalmations Cruella deVil (Glenn Close) was released from prison after being "lost" by being dominated by a psychologist named Dr. Pavlov (ugh!). "Treatment" is broken when Cruella hears Big Ben's call and she returns to a crazy mission to make herself the perfect coat from dalmation. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Much Many levels begin with the fact that it is a movie. "Thanksgiving family schlock" designed to absorb the little money that is available in the Disney market. Glenn closes Cruella beyond the limits. With what she had to endure in this film - an endless crippling cosmetic script, baking the cake at the end - I hope they give a big salary. <br /> <br /> (talking about you Going to find a fur coat factory, a bakery with an assembly line, Rube Goldberg and a candlelight restaurant located in the same building - while you are at the climax of this film? The film should be a real dog They acted as "Macaulay Culkin's" in this movie, pulling "Home Alone" stupid to the villain. (Biting them in the target, running through their hands with a trolley bag, spraying them with icing, etc. etc. Nausea advertising) I have to admit dogs are fairly good performers - better than humans. <br /> <br / > Gerard De Pardia died completely in this film as the French fur, two men "dog lovers" who have received new training from previous films. But with different actors - completely boring When they had a spaghetti dinner at an Italian restaurant, the movie would be cut between two lovers and their dog at home. See the dinner scene from "Lady and the Tramp". "Please do not go there!" I expect human beings to make words in the dinner scene "Lady and the Tramp" - while Charlie Sheen does it in "Hot Shots: Part Deux" - doing "kissing spaghetti lines. "Press the ball with his nose, etc. <br /> <br /> And don't let me start with the annoying parrot with Eric Idle's voice. <br /> <br /> That set was nominated. Oscar and the set in the movie * Well. But they are the only thing good in the movie. The rest of it is an unbearable wreck.
