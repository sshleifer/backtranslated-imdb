Nintendo !!! You #% $ @ ERS !!! How do you do this with me? I can't believe it ... This movie is worse than the first movie. I went to see this thing at the theater with my brother because my mother forced me to tag it. Oh ... God ... Where do I start? Marvelous storyline Surprised voice, animation SUCKED, ending, really sucking If you like this movie, you must be shocked and for Futuramafan1987 Those who say that this is the greatest movie ever, you are a simple and simple tool. This is not a movie for everyone. But being a ten year old boy with a crack with Game Boys who thinks Pikachu is God, I still cry today, thinking of the horrible movie of this movie .... and then there is the adventure of Pikachu. .. Don't even start from the horrible movie. In all truth, it is one of the most boring experiences of my life. Don't go to see this story at any cost. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Go out and search for every copy of this movie that you can do and burn it. Burn them all, then perform a good movie rental like aliens ... or Bowling For Columbine ... or even return to the future!
