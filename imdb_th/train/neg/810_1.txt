If you are one of the people who find comedy movies on television "According to Jim" This will make your world tremble. And let me add glory to prove good talent, good writing and charming stars are what you want in other networks besides ABC, which likes the air that is not as interesting as Jim Belushi's performance last year Year after year> "K-911" is a German puppet of a large shepherd steaming brown "Thank you" for every genius who loves the first movie. It is something that fans of this film and Belushi deserve. Jim, jokes and alternatives to Jim's projects have never been far from his ability to standardize the blues. Look for him to try to show his various talents in every project that he attacks publicly, like an angry zoo chimp. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Jim's work, this movie is your reward.
