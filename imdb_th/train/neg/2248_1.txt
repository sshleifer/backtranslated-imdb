This movie is a large steaming line. <br /> <br /> I don't know why everyone feels that the Garland / Mason model needs to be reworked or why Striesand is the first starred choice. <br /> <br /> For that matter I don't know why our people (American gay) Most of them think that Striesand is some treasure. At the very least, in my opinion, she has a professional pinnacle with a girl joke and something more of Dr. Bogdanovich. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favorite and rent a Judy classic or Even the original (Good movie in its own way) but please please please skip this stinkpot!
