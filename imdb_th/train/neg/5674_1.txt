Lord, what happened? Uwe Boll movie and positive comments? Wow! <br /> <br /> Pleased to know that most of the positive comments came from the beginning of Boll's work as I mentioned in the previous review of Uwe Boll. But watching his movie in the hope that someday he will do something really good. I mean .. It must happen one day! <br /> <br /> Alas, the seed is not that day. I do not know how to start with the weak effort in the horror movie Seed. The thing that must be remembered by people is that all the illnesses in the world are like that because watching the various actions of the patients in the video or in Network ..... or so, Mr. Bolle believes I still can't use my life why the image of animal abuse and killing is needed during the first 10 minutes of this movie. I understand the idea that Seed (Assassin) is a poignant and fun to watch things ..... But I do not understand why Mr Boll thought that putting real videos in this movie would work. May cause us to panic? Hmm ... I am one who is not nauseous and able to handle seeing anything in the movie. I do not think that will take advantage of the cruelty of animals that provide the least entertainment. If you try to shock me, it doesn't work. It reminds me of how busy the world is because this kind of thing happened and because Uwe Boll was allowed to continue to make movies. This kind of context may apply to movies in the 70s / 80s (Cannibal Holocaust) but not to the current market. <br /> <br /> In this way, we can step into the fact that Uwe can handle Feeling right about everything like BloodRayne 2. You can tell that there is not much money floating around the production. <br /> <br /> As usual, Mr Boll is not really interested in creating a pleasant story. Satisfied because we were treated tediously from the police officers who watched the videos of the victims of the Seed during the first 25 minutes. Each of these videos ended with the separation of parts. title It's boring and very boring. I will not comment on the scenes of toddlers because it is ridiculous and is another cheap 'shock' factor. <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit through the first 25 minutes, you will be treated to the staff. Police passing A very dark house to catch seeds The light here is terrible and Uwe has an old style of failure that 'I didn't use a stable camera' that he had done with BloodRayne 2, watched as the police died in a stupid way until the point that Seed was stuck. This scene was very stupid. You had to look to believe. The police told the seed that he could shoot him. For some reason unknown, the police did not shoot him because Seed is a sickle that kills children and adults. You probably think that in this chapter, there will be more reason. <br /> <br /> From here we get Treatment of stupid forced scenes By the police buried the seeds that are still alive (And they know he is still alive .. why not shoot him at the head ????) followed by the seeds coming out of the ground and then killing the women randomly with a hammer and kidnapping Of the police family <br /> <br /> Every thing I try to cross to you here is just plain stupid! It's not even a stupid Hollywood horror movie. Just plain stupid. Uwe Boll can't direct it directly. **** Everyone with Oz will agree with that statement. Anyone who watches this movie and finds it fun in every form or style needs to look at themselves seriously as a person. <br /> <br /> Again, we will be treated badly, directing the fire. Produce a piece of crap UB script
