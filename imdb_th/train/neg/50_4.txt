The movie "Horror", three stories that have men in the house that invite viewers to not go. "Going out" and (unfortunately) gave us three stories to prove why <br /> <br /> The first story deals with children. A couple in a car accident met with two bugs. It leads to two predictable twists. Even so, it's fast (about 15 minutes). Violent. Works well and works well. Predictable but fun. <br /> <br /> The second involves a guy running after stealing a lot of money. His car broke down. He was attacked by a dog in a nearby clinic. Very clear, poorly done and very slow, even in 30 minutes it is too long. Although good performances, <br /> <br /> The third person is almost scary. It deals with beautiful, lonely women and looking for Mr. Right. It has a beautiful design set, great erotic feelings and a good sex scene, but (can be predicted again) and not scary from a distance /> <br /> It ended stupidly. <br /> <br /> All the first ones are worth watching. Adjust for one and then close
