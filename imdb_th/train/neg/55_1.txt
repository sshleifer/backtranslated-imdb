There are only two movies that I will give 1/10 with the smelly and "The Man at Fell to Earth". I remember seeing the protocol at the cinema in the early 80's when I was in high school. Script to insult others (Including the intellect of high school students), it made me lose completely with the "scary" rules of people who were shot in the bottom Goldie Hawn should be charming. But it turned out to be ridiculous and wise Then there was a disgusting map about the Arabs, followed by Goldie, winning everyone by throwing the ball, raising a child, a democracy. The performance was terrible, including Goldie Hawn. I couldn't stand watching another movie that she stayed until IMO. She exchanged herself in everyone. Saying that I love you. This is the type of movie you do if you don't want to use the effort to write a screenplay. Worst.
