After watching an example for this film and discovering Spike Lee being directed, I was excited to know about this event. I didn't live at that time. I didn't live in New York, so I expected more history lessons. What I received was a lot of interesting sex shows and movies that were worth about 30 minutes which actually involved Sam's son. I guess this movie isn't about Sam's son. But it was interesting in the summer of '77, the label I'm disappointed. <br /> <br />
