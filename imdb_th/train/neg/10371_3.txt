Or "Marlowe At Sea", another story that insulted old movies with bogeys It's quite talkative. Bogey plays the same character as Marlowe's movie. Always in control of the situation. Never worry - no matter how dangerous the situation is, call "skinny" and "thao" and other nonsense. Only "true man" is an alpha male in the movie. The man is the head of Gestapo - but he is only a fat alpha man) and - naturally - a attractive young woman, everyone who arrives, he cannot resist his charm and wants his penis inside. how many hour The ancient characters are all here. Bogies should be the same type of cynicism about reforms, as in "Casablanca", and naturally they tend to deny money or other valuables when presenting them - but it's suitable for cynicism. How to mock him? It wasn't so he couldn't mock. Falcon needs both ways: the character is both "A lonely person who is cool" and is also a humanitarian with good meaning. I don't think so ... Bacall made her first peaceful "baby" routine, and there was a lot of exaggeration. "Sexual innuendo" between her and bogeys; These conversations sound ridiculous according to today's standards. "Just wearing a bag and blowing a whistle ..." Nonsense ... She is 19 years old, but this thing looks older and less attractive than the female star of the day. The face that is full of her bones, with its sharp features, is nowhere near the glow of de Havilland's feminine beauty. Myrna Loy's cuteness. Dunn Bacall is more suitable for playing vampires, not femme-fatales (In real life, she was like her face: Hollywood bitch). There was a scene in which Bacal broke into tears. Not suitable for her character. There are two or three bad music numbers. But my fast forward button is ready. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biography" in Bogart, Bacall, Huston and others in Hollywood, contact me by email.
