Fans of animal documentary films have to endure many horror movies. Blood Surf joins the list of stupid horror movies about the ridiculously large animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. The crocodile is very successful because we have to overcome the obstacles through 'Crocodile' (directed by the disappointing Tobe Hooper) and 'Lake Placid'. Blood Surf is worse than other movies and? Moreover ?? It likes to be very exaggerated. The saltwater crocodile should be 90 years old, longer than 30 feet (!) And kill for fun! In this film, he creates fun for himself by swallowing stupid surfers and dumbfighters to find new excitement by surfing in crowded areas of sharks. The only thing beautiful about this movie is the tropical location. Although it is a completely inappropriate place for movies like this, lakes and nature look amazing. All other aspects are disastrous. With relatively little blood But everything looks fake and laughing Serious painful conversation to listen to! You won't believe what these actors say! I know that surfers should be a mentally underdeveloped group. But I hope that for their own benefit, they are not that stupid! In the first part of the movie, one character refers to Jaws as a "mechanical toy", but the crocodile here looks less realistic than Spielberg's big white shark, at least 10 times the visual effect in 'Blood Surf. 'There is expertise and the massacre has failed to make an impression. I will not say anything about acting too much because it is secondary to the movie. The girls look sexy in their wet shirts and girls beat back happily while running away from the beast. You guess right: Blood Surf is a terrible movie. It's terrible. It's fun again, but 'funny' for all other reasons than James Hickox intended.
