Misunderstood by the horrible lie on the cover "Fun like an American pie." My girlfriend and I sat in front of the TV to wait and see. Funny ... and this is not the only one. You may not laugh once if you are not one of the people who are aggressive like Jackass. It's not an erotic movie which at least seems to be something about sex ... <br /> < br /> So what is this? The plot is erratic, not related to a man who wants to lose his virginity. (Center on the initiative, I remember "losing" one) and his fellow gang The remaining characters (Like a girl) just came and went without a reliable reason. Come on, there are dwarves as well (easy: "The dwarfs are fun, ho ...") The show looks very like a TV. .. <br /> <br /> Scary movies Amateurs that produce poorly and above all are not funny. Children and teenagers will like to watch with friends because of the jokes that swear and sex. In addition, do not consider renting this movie.
