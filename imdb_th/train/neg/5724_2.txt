I agree with the latest reviewer that this movie has a very poor performance. Yes, there is a lot of blood and some nudity. But it was obscured by a slow storyline, meaningless and dumb ending Where should I be filming: Chinatown, Canada or Hong Kong? The hostel is a very good movie and I would recommend watching instead. The technical nuisance that I have with DVD is that if you close the Spanish subtitles, they come back after a few scenes, then you have to go back to the main menu and close again. In addition, do not waste time with deleted scenes because there is no sound, and it looks like a picture from tourists.
