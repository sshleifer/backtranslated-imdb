Lame plot and two-dimensional script make the character look like cardboard. No need to say this, making it difficult to feel sympathetic to any character, especially the fianc√©. He looked and acted more like a cartoon. In conclusion, I think you can say that it's common to what you created for the TV series. It uses ancient ideas in every book. Classical musicians who are tortured to break through and play salsa. An independent fiance who is engaged in a personality "bean counter" that you don't love. I won't write them. Otherwise, it's a spoiler. Dance is ok. But nothing special I've seen the worse 3 stars for good music. This band is really tight. I saw it on YouTube. Luckily I didn't pay to watch it at the theater. I also felt a little shocked by the many great reviews that this movie had decorated.
