scary Movie! It must be with the real smelly person who has been nominated for a Golden Globe. They brought the story of the famous Renaissance woman painter and destroyed it beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they use freedom and facts. If the story is good, it will be perfectly good. But it is a strange story - with every story, the true story of this artist will create a better movie, so why are they coming up with boring scripts? I think there are not enough naked people in the original version. In the end, it quickly came out with a summary of the artist's life - we could help ourselves for a couple of hours if they liked the rest of the movie with its compactness
