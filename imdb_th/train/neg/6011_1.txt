I didn't expect much from this movie. But Oh, this brother is stinky. <br /> <br /> I found this gem in a huge crate of a great $ 5 DVD at Walmart (elsewhere)? Cheap like this one, I feel torn. Special effects have a high-school look in them. The camera works with shaky legs and light, sketches and performances. It's a perfect example of 'Christian school'. Who can imagine that The long and tedious 'prayer meeting' by the production company after seeing a quick return - people who do this duty must have a serious anti-biblical feeling to an inappropriate manufacturing company that does this. Think of their anguish when they see their $ 914.86 investment increase as smoke. <br /> <br /> Some people ask why Christian movies aren't good - maybe the movie makers Xi'an must watch GOOD movie and trying to copy What makes them very good Convincing stories and characters, less waving arms and mania. Oh, and stories that appeal to everyone - not a true believer, that is, stop sermons recorded for the church. For example, the Omen or Prophesy series, great movies with interesting stories, excellent movies and intense music. No arms, waving hands No sermon. <br /> <br /> If this movie has a laugh song, it should be much better.
