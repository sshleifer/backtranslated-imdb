This is a disappointing movie. Considering the content --- the military life is good for laughing --- and the stars. It's a ridiculous story, a couple of the best. Steve Martin is much more fun and it seems that Dan Aykroyd should stick to the drama that he might follow in the lead of Robin Williams and someday win an Oscar
