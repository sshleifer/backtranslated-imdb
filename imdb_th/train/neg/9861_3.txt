I only sat through this thing at GenCon because it was quiet and I could take a nap. Wasted time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Katt? WTF? Is the woman playing Flo and Abe Vigoda busy? <br /> <br /> Indeed, it is a piece of garbage without water. The characters were stereotyped without meaning (I think ...) and most of their wooden characters seem to be on auto pilots. A situation called "hilarious" that is described in other so-called reviews. Sometimes I hack for writers. <br /> <br /> I'm confused that anyone can find this worthwhile, seriously. I give only 3 out of 10 because in order to get 2 or 1, it must be five hours or more. Kelly LeBrock
