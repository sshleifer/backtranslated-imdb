SAKURA KILLERS (1+ outta 5 stars) Perhaps in 1987, this movie might look cool ... If you have never seen a ninja movie. * Good story * Before Cheesy's 80s song, cheesy conversation, cheesy performance and sequel to the arts Wonderful fight The coolest scene is the beginning ... When Chuck Connor is playing golf on the beach ... many black ninjas try to sneak around him and it seems that he intends to hit his ball ... Suddenly he Reaching out in the golf bag and ... No, I won't let you down ... If you are unlucky to see this movie, you will thank me. Many nonsense stories about stolen or videotaped videos A group of white people who have been trained in ninjas because "Only a ninja can fight with a ninja" or something strange. These seem to be no better than after training ... Oh, this movie moves quite quickly. The fighting scene may not be great .. but they are rich ... and the excessive sound effects are good for a laugh.
