As long as Spaghetti Westerns proceed, I will take this man who cannot die on the boring side of the genre. Not that this movie is particularly bad. But it lacks the ability and flash of other SW I've seen. Guy Madison has the best role in the lead role. But lacking the special abilities on the screen needed to pull out With one notable exception, the remaining performers are not particularly good. The direction has not been fulfilled and there is a short time that I have never seen before. There is not much to feel excited. <br /> <br /> The exception of the actors I talk about is Rosalba Neri. She is one of the brightest spots in this medium. Unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: IMDb page for this man can't die wrong. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson, but she is a Melin character. Neri for men named John Bartha is listed on IMDb credit for movies)
