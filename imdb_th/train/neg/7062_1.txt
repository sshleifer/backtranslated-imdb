OK, maybe it's the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This story doesn't make sense. No plot. No character. No show. Nothing. <br /> <br /> This Is what I thought when I first saw it, maybe 28, 2003 ** Caution This is a spoiler alert It was a story that I complained about the badness of the movie: <br /> <br /> Okay, so the movie started and the characters were introduced. But no character description As far as I know, the main character is a new story for this school. But does not seem to It appeared that he lived on his own ... and that he was a foster child ... and that his mother was a crazy alcoholic who still lived with him. Clearly, all of his friends do not have parents and live by themselves. <br /> <br /> Now that we have reached the main point, this madman is separated from the hospital and is rampant. Now, our main character is obsessed with this man and intends to focus on him in order to make it into the movie. I think I have to miss the main elements of the plot here, there is no reason for the main character to be hooked. Even though it is an unreasonable issue, why all of his friends who suspect 5 minutes before him come and do what he wants. <br /> <br /> So the movie continues. Running a disaster in the school blah blah blah but waiting for a moment ... Suddenly everyone knows that the main character is using the 'performance' here. Wait, the madman doesn't specifically tell the main character, don't do that. Wait? It should be anything. <br /> <br /> Another important planning element has been crossed ... The madman should not be mad ... Everyone says he is not crazy. But when the story continues, he is very clear from his thoughts. But I think the news people say that he is not ... Hm ... <br /> <br /> Now, this movie is approaching. What is the hell? But answer any questions about the main character only But it didn't answer any questions about crazy men Are these people in the same situation? If yes, there are basic stories that are unlikely to be possible. If not, the point of saying that "That is you in two weeks" ?? <br /> <br /> * The end of things ... * <br /> <br /> That's what I thought at that time. That's what I thought of right now. It's been down for 6 months. And if I can get it for free, I may give it a chance again, but I doubt I doubt it very much.
