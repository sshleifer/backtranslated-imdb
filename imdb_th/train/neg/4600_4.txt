I have read all these reviews here about how good it is. Jeez, this movie is predictable and very boring. The show is mostly below average, especially by Mckenna. I have not seen a more pathetic attempt to make someone "bad" in the movie. Oh man, this movie is something that is down. I also read here, probably a classic cult. I know that there are followers of the director. But this movie is just an average movie. <br /> <br /> The script is mostly lame. The performance is crippled. The film is crippled. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this movie should be a guy in Office Space and he is in this movie for about 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> 4 / 10
