Geez, as a gay man living in New York, I can tell that I have never seen the weakness of the gay culture shown in this movie - and I'm glad it !!! This film is broadcast on TV across the United States. There will be a fantastic anti-gay backlash and I can't say that I will blame them. People in this film do not represent the average American gay or even the American Trandgender. On average, what they show is a real nightmare. The immature character combination is a shocking and racist racist feeling. (Anti-white) is clear and unstable - society cannot blame those who choose drugs, unemployment and denial of education in the "actors" section - these actions are not hopeless But denying things that are similar to personal ambitions and willingness to do something from yourself
