Trying to understand something that is tasteless, as if the SENTINEL is quite difficult. There are many problems. The result is terrible and full of holes planned. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas is shown as Pete Garrison, an intelligence officer who "gets one" for Reagan while he is trying to live. Many years later, we found that Pete assigned the White House family, most of which was the first lady protector. (Kim Basinger, LA Secret) The problem arises when we see Pete's close involvement with the First Lady and the immediate threat to the President (David Rasche, UNITED 93 ) When Pete failed to test the polygraph, he separated as a dissatisfied representative by researcher David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series). <br /> < br /> While the assassination plan for President Pete found himself People are their own people as his first lady, and she was reluctant to tell anyone about their love for each other. (Which is why Pete failed to lie in the first place) but Pete is really innocent? Or is he just trying to buy time until he kills the president? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent assassination attempts while working from intelligence? <br /> <br /> One of the greatest and overwhelming problems of this movie is that there is no reason for the reason. Behind the presidential threat No matter what the movie should be about? Who would think so! But the audience won't let the reason why the murderer wants to kill Prez. Hmmm. Someone forgot to put it in a script somewhere? <br /> <br /> And the new partner of David Breckinridge (Kiefer's), Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S method) is? It seems that she will be put in a movie strictly as a dessert. What is your purpose again? Do you do anything other than looking good in tight pants and low-rise shirts? <br /> <br /> There are many problems with the sentinel's basic location that is ridiculous. The action is too easy by "what ...?" The answer is sure to be spoken by an unfortunate person who will watch the movie.
