I can't believe that they will spend $ 17 million on this movie. Surprisingly bad performances, scripting and surprising effects that you can do on your average PC. Planning an unbelievable story ... What is a reporter? Not only that But the message of this film is very unbelievable that you came out feeling as though they were trying to smash your head with a full size cross. This film will preach to the choir and make everyone laugh at ridiculous money. If the creator of this film wants to convince people to Christianity and show what true faith means, they will use the money to truly help people who need it now. Really listen to them
