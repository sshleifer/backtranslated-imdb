Redline is a great story for Fast & Furious without qualification for redemption. There is no need to have a complex plot with many twists and surprises. But it needs something! This is a porn movie, equivalent to the story and dialogue, consisting of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end. Except that this thing is worse because you don't get your money Incredible bored scenes that are incredibly boring and rubbish from expensive, beautiful cars that almost received a negative rating from the movie's appearance Of course she is hot. But who is desperate for women who are screened? I feel like the director sitting there with a hat full of dialogue and plot and shake 8 balls every time they change the scene. There is no serious person who competes or knows anything about it. Watch this movie and enjoy the race scene.
