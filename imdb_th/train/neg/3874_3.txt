This movie can be predicted so all the time that you hope that the obvious suspect is innocent. However ... it can't. Mary finds evidence that is incriminating in his place and she still trusts him? And what "baiting the trap"? Without a trap, she faced him. He said "Sorry, I have to kill someone." He left and that was the end of it. They tried to use other suspects. (Just like one older woman at the end) but they are completely underdeveloped. Actually, every character is underdeveloped. They don't have the depth and the settings are just plain weird ... Those who go out on a recycling plant? It is lacking and nothing develops well. For example: when she leaves his place after having a beer and he finds a picture and she runs out and he catches her and they have sex in that car ... what is that? Her reaction was not shown. In the car, she acted like she was raped - but then what we saw was that she took a bath the next morning. Booooooooo.
