Back in 1967, one director didn't know about the galaxy far or near. He tried to create a movie with the name THX and others. Shortly, this is George's newly produced history. I'm sorry that it's cute just to protect it. This is just a promotional advertisement for directors, actors and al. It has little artistic value. It is a brochure The leading actors playing George did very well, like the characters Leia and the Dart Dart characters. All the other is a normal commercial waste. But even then it's done. I guess The rest of the film is just a repeat of the water to kill the time I guess. Brochures only
