How many fake "slice of life" movies have to be created? <br /> <br /> Raising Victor Vargas is a self-conscious effort by director Peter Solett who has received Hollywood attention. There's nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with this movie, in particular, it doesn't care about the audience and the pile in every monotonous word in the book "edgy" Hollywood Independent. <br /> <br /> It should be "real". Left to shake the camera "style documentary", except that no documentary would shake the camera with the purpose ... <br /> <br /> It is "frustrating", so do not waste time with screenings. <Br / > <br /> It's "hip", so let children use swearing words like Al Paci. no in Scarface ... <br /> <br /> and so on, etc. What you left is a very self-conscious effort to impress Hollywood, which will not impress. To everyone outside the "rare" indie crowd that seems to still be mentioning
