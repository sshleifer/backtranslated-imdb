There are many problems with this movie. But the most important thing is to try to do too little. The basic story is quite good. But the money was not there to do justice The budget does not really kill this movie. Stuart Gordon (writer / director) has written credits about 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', which is a box office sting. However, this film has serious cash reserves from Disney. Actually, this is a good example of when to not make movies. If he waits for the next few years, the technology will be more affected. (Not to mention he will find a company with money)
