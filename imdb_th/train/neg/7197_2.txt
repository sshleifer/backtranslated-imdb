OK. I think the TV program is cute and there are some related tutorials. So when my children decided that they wanted to watch this movie, I decided to tag it. I hope I will stay home and watch TV shows instead. <br /> <br /> The fact that humor is stupid and not original is the least problem for this movie The plot is next to non-existent. The characters seem to be in a vacuum, and the worst is that the gadget doesn't have any lessons at all. For justice, my youngest child (age 8) likes to watch movies, but people who are older (10 years old) think it's ridiculous. (He is too old for children's humor. Br /> <br /> In general, I like Disney movies. But this one lost a mile It's okay for a very narrow age band (say 7 to 9) but don't miss it for others.
