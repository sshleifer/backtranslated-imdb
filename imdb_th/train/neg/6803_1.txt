When I come to the IMDb board, I'm always bored when I see the post. "The worst movie ever" After watching this movie * I think that soon I will create my own post !! <br /> <br /> Opening title: excellent, some lame Like on the gas stove (yes, focus on fire = explosion = action movie is very tight !!) <br /> <br /> actor: I think Ice T is a cool rapper even though Is a good actor (Sometimes I confirm that "sometimes") but Steven Siegel is like the police he plays ... beyond the description, the rest of the actors are ... Um. I don't know if those actors were hired. Where to come, but jeez !! I think my dog ​​should be a better actor than them !! <br /> <br /> Story: Hijacking.original Can't it be? <br /> <br /> Action scene: The first match of this movie is an explosion. I told myself that cool !! At least there will be a good fireworks .. I am wrong. The rest of the movie is mostly filled with low rent stock shots taken from the Air Force ... <br /> <br /> Conversations That was hilarious. The music was pure shit. Finally, it was happy. (I mean, I'm happy at the end because this movie is over !!!) <br /> <br /> My cousin who is watching the movie feels happy (I'm 22 years old, 42 years old). I'm going to shoot a movie and burn it. Maybe the next time I'll watch it ... (Who says never ???)
