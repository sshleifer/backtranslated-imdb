This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. (Yes, it's worse than Dungeons and Dragons and the movie starring Kevin Costner) Chris Rock looks awkward throughout this movie. Not even it seems that they tried to show Chris Rock as a great comedian. But he was unable to transfer his ability to the film, which may have only two laughs, stressed in the whole picture. <br /> <br /> If you haven't watched this yet Should avoid like an epidemic Going to make something more creative and interesting, such as watching the weather channel or watching the dry paint on the brick wall. <br /> <br /> For Chris's efforts, I gave 2/10! <br /> <br />
