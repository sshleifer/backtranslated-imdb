Chemical leaks make people become zombies. It's up to two doctors to escape from the plague. It's Andreas Schnaas movie so you know what it should be. Bad performances, special techniques that are extremely scary and don't have a budget to talk about. The dubbing was ridiculous with capital R and the most sad thing was that I felt compelled to write one word about this excretory less than ten lines that were forced. My only original review: Shit won't fly, so I have to fix and go in the bad. But I don't know if I can or not. So .. Wait. I think I might have enough words or lines to pass this examination. Which one is cool, I guess So in combination: this movie sucks the ball. Don't watch. <br /> <br /> My grade: F
