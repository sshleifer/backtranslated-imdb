There are two points that I have to make clear from the beginning. First of all, we all know what Oscar this year really is about this year. It is an institution's way of showing people that they are not racist and never before. They want to clear all preconceived notions about themselves. Secondly, it is pointless to talk about acting because it really is different. But it's fun to write about it This is the year I am bored with the Oscars! I will not watch the program again. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crowe won the title "Gladaitor" when they truly won, it should be Ralph Fiennes for "Sunshine". If you haven't seen the movie yet and you will see "Eyes Wide Shut" when not received. Nomination And as far as this year, there are bad choices everywhere! Baz Lurhmann was not nominated "Best Director"! Are you kidding? !! "A Beautiful Mind" is for "Best Make-up" ???? "Training Day" has been nominated ?? This movie is terrible and it seems that Washington didn't open the show, all he proved was that he knew how to use four letters! That's what h won for! Removing the language and I bet he almost played himself! I like "Gosford Park". I really do, but why do I have to nominate 7 items? How will they not let the Altman on this planet! I mean c'mon, if there is just rewarding people to get rid of any bad feelings Altman about? This man has been in the public eye for 32 years and has no Oscars! There are many things that bother me about Oscar this year. But I'll stay with it as long as I don't have to watch the program again! The highest point (and only one item) of the program is when Woody Allen first appeared in his prize list. That will go down as one of the greatest moments in his acting history.
