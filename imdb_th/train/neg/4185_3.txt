I gave this movie 3 stories because it's worse than the cult movie that deserves. Article 2 Isn't it reasonable for you? No need This is another vampire movie that has no stupid plans for me to use the new words to plot an incredibly silly story at Space Cowboy (Along with a cowboy hat) fighting the vampire competition in the space of the Moron The only good thing in this movie is Natassia Malthe, with the amazing beauty of Norway. God, I hope Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers will stop taking stupid roles in dumb movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest is good! I know Mr. Ironside from many movies. He has performed in 164 movies today !! It is true that he rarely plays an important role, but still!
