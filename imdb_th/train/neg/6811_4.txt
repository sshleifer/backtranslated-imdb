The first time I saw this movie in the cinema 11 years ago, I like it very much. I still think that directing and movies are as good as music. But in fact, the script that has existed over time has bothered me more and more. I found that Emma Thompson's writings were immersed and unfaithful to the original books; She reduced Marianne to be the second side of the character, too old. Eleanor was too intense - she gave this movie. Many times 'focus time' herself. <br /> <br /> I understand that she cut out many characters from the book. But leaving one scene that Willoughby in the book was redeemed? For those who are red and cherish the book for a long time before the movie is something that is hard to digest. <br /> <br /> For actors, I like Kate Winslet as Marianne. with But she still pulled it out gracefully without having too much feeling. Alan Rickman was excellent, quite young. But he played this role beautifully and Elizabeth Spriggs, she was absolutely fantastic.
