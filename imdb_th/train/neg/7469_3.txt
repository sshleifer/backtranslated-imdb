The script for this TV series is terrible that even A. Hopkins, at some point, has to play like an undergraduate drama student in order to live in his dead character. I do not know if this is the purpose of the director or not, but Hopkins' Noano doesn't think of anything but nonsense, fear and lack of self-esteem. But why do movies about him Mussolini is a little more reliable and his long path is as if getting closer to the truth. Edda Mussolini is ridiculous. (Not because Sarandon But because of an inefficient script) while she must be the main character of the alleged family drama Watch it only if you enjoy Venezuela's TV series.
