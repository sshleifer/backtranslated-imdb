Why do millions of people watch and love as children and create complete jokes? They asked why Hollywood did not make money like it used to do. Because they dumped garbage and paid an enormous amount of money to the actors to be a garbage collector and asked us to pay 10 dollars to see the garbage The TV program is something that is a good person in a bad situation where the good boys of IL come out on top. It's not missing from the wind but it's fun. Hollywood can't happen to the original, so they can bring good things and destroy them for $ $$$$. I just hope this movie will make less than 10 times the cost To create The only person who can enjoy this shit is someone who has to drive Lee. The audience is the victim. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. See the replay of the TV show instead. They are still up 20 years later.
