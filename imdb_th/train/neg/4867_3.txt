What we want! The Hollywood movie theater was re-created with Eddie Murphy again in the second, after THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996). This shows why we have exhausted our special ideas for creating quality movies, ladies and gentlemen! It has some signs of hope for a pleasing and delightful animal image that can show and speak to humans. Things are even worse, unfortunately. Bathroom jokes and sexual references kill the funfare piece of "family" immediately. Even parents and children see examples of advertisements in The Family Channel, which are followed by anger and disgust in the theater. Sad to say that this is a more advanced pre-Millennium era. But enjoy it while it lasts There was an error with all new DR Dolittle. It doesn't have a plot to feel too flat. I also hate the annoying sounds of Chris Rock !!! We need more dubbed voice talent than celebs who pay too much for not declaring bankruptcy. I must agree with my local newspaper that gave this to the top five worst movies of 1998. Then again, the original version was not good at all. Murphy's next project may be PATTON if he is not careful!
