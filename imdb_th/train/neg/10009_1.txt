This film is a giant burden. Paul Schrader lost entirely in his own bad screenplay. And his directing is a ridiculous thing that should be, as he does not actually sleep during the process. <br /> <br /> The worst is Woody Harrelson, which I normally like when he is. Properly cast, he plays the role of "The Walker", a male homosexual man in DC who plays as a social friend with a bored wife of the elite in Washington. He probably didn't have more dimensions if he was cut out of the magazine and bounced back in front of the camera with his "Southern accent" ice cream stick, which was the "off the rack" version that fell from beginning to end. As if the heat and humidity of the southern region still absorbs every ounce of energy that he has, it is boring, but he is not the worst accent in his "fan" movie, played by Moritz Bleibtreau. Impact on Middle Eastern accent, some of which are quite bearish, so he could not send a bad to him. He couldn't roll the r, even though he was a German. But in real life he speaks many languages ​​- one of them is Italian! That is a good reason to choose other people, not you, right? <br /> <br /> From the story to the screenplay, directing the camera's work to the actors of the actors, bringing this movie is not good from the beginning until end The acceptable time in this film comes from three actors: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only three people can pass the film with dignity. In fact, the three were excellent, even though they were trapped in a really bad movie. Sorry, nobody is good enough to exchange this endless flaw. If you like these three actors, see them in other things. This movie is not worth your time.
