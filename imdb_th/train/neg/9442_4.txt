I tried to like this slasher like I tried to enjoy all the slasher movies. I mean, killing irrationality with a little nudity and some suspicion, how can you make a mistake but Unhinged. The main problem is the terrifying performance of the three main women who landed in the house. As if they were under sedation and it made me not interested in their fate This film is intended for suspicion and disgust. But sorting the numbers makes them worse It is a shame because if the film proceeds better The story and characters look creepy and have a dark and humorous time of interaction between the mother, woman and daughter in the old house. With good nudity and occasional neglect, just not enough to give the movies that want to kick The ending is quite twisted and scary and makes this film so much. But sadly it's too late So, in my opinion, one thing to avoid if you don't really like the vague slasher movie. Have sufficient potential But this movie gives too little value
