So don't think of renting this store because this is one of the bad movies. Do you think JJ Abrahams wrote this movie? Basically, I will be flushed to the bathroom and will have to come back. Fans of "Shrek" completely scary. May enjoy, but "Wallace & Gromit" fans may turn back with disgust. Why don't they do it in oil or soil? I mean CGI animation ?? For AARDMAN movies ?? !! Obviously, Aardman sat around while they let DreamWorks do everything wrong. Wrong !!! Almost all the characters are scary, except for the outrageous frog that is suitable for the villain in the movie. But everything about this movie is DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I almost fell asleep with the boredom of watching this movie. In fact, I was sleepy with the boredom of watching this movie. It was terrible, but fortunately it wasn't as bad as "Shrek".
