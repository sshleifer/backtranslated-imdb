The movie that has been waiting for a long time .. but it has made me and my friends who have watched this movie on the first day .. from the example it looks like action movies But it turned out to be a joke But one thing that deserves to be admired is the performance by professional actors. They have done a good part of this movie. A good performance, but I don't think I can record a movie. .. India is shot beautifully. Kerala Rajasthan (Ladakh) all have saturated colors. However, the way that the true beauty of these places is shot, makes me want to know where those places are and when I go there ;-) <br /> <br /> Action scenes are shot like No one can do it. They use akshay kumar very well but do much better .. <br /> <br /> Animation is the worst thing I have ever seen in the latest movie (90s movie There is a better animation scene. I guess (The first scene that the car is falling 'Flying should be a better word than' road to the lake. <br /> <br /> And the movie name is mentioned almost every 20 to 30 minutes to make sure the audience doesn't forget the movie name that I guess. .
