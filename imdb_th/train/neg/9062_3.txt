This film is different from that which does not show the gay pattern that I have ever seen. But that doesn't change the fact that it lacks the story altogether. I am sure that there are many gay people who are happy to see themselves appearing on the screen because the black gay characters rarely see and when they are characters, they are not fully developed. But how difficult would it be that the author would have to write the story with the beginning, the middle and the end? Or that is a story that focuses Does not seem to have a purpose for this film, and even though it is a low budget movie But there is no excuse for lack of stories or plot
