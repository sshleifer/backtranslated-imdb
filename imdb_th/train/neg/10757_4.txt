I just watched this movie on DVD last night and decided to review the comments this morning. It looks like "I, Robot" has confused the important viewing community in IMDb (and caused insults and calls. Many names as well) <br /> <br /> I found this amazing thing like this. This film is not great. (Or even good) but not bad (Or really bad) what the movie really is ... depressed, depressed, that the audience of movies in the United States is ready to add interest to ancient ideas and praise them as exciting new works This movie as "Tire retreading" written all over it since the plot (A combination of Asimov and the current uber-action) to Smith's character (mocking the genius of the spine of titanium) to special techniques (borrowed from Matrix and others ) <br /> <br /> "I, Robot" is a sad story that could be the perfect action movie for today's audiences: superficial plot, fast-paced dialogue like crazy and adrenaline. Smith is a normal person, but we know Said (He seemed to be the last attempt in Hollywood that didn't succeed in creating Bruce Willis black). The story has a lot of holes in all sizes. But I don't think most people who are attracted to this film have enough analytical thinking to observe. Perhaps Blockbuster meets today's standards, but the movie B is very much compared to the real winner.
