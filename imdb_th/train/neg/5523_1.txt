Georgia Rule must be one - if not the worst movie I have ever seen in life. This movie has a surreal feel that makes me gasp "What?" Out loud at least 7-10 times over a two-hour period of grueling <br /> <br /> Advertising in commercials about Three generations of women - Jane Fonda is the ruler of Felicity Huffman and her daughter Lindsey. Lohan, as a great young woman who plays the role of the protagonist, thinks that this will be an ancient idea, a light-hearted flick of growth and family together. <br /> <br /> Talk about false matters Worst advertisement <br /> <br /> After many animals do "funny" things in the background of the "important" scene and don't have to talk about five minutes, focusing on the old woman coming in. Doctor's office Weekly to change her diaper or the fact that this movie is about Lindsay Lohan's character that has been sexually abused by her father improper In the most strange, surreal and strange way, if Garry Marshall wants this movie to be a drama / comedy, then he should watch The Royal Tenenbaums to the side of Junebug and others and others. <br /> <br /> How The only thing I felt was that I was able to let the reader understand the horror genre that Georgia Rule was under. It can be said that the movie The Virgin, 40 years old, is about the main character who is single because he has been sexually abused since he was a child. But instead of changing the movie more amazingly, laughing, laughing and comedy will follow with the whole reaction of the characters that are fake. Humans do not have human lives that pretend to be interested. <br /> <br /> Throw a parrot. The yellow color Dermotronie is the most flat and dimensionless character that will be cut from this poorly written script, along with the male characters who leave all his religions. Beliefs and morals are with young women with the same tanned skin that are not interested in anything like him, including unnecessary driving scenes, unrelated scenes, trying to make a relationship and you have Georgia rules. <br /> <br /> I found that this movie is an insult to people who have problems with filming, script writers, actors, editors, etc., which are more capable and unnoticed. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie: My rules <br /> <br /> And if you have to drink enough before hand
