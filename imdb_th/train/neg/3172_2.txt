This movie is a badly made garbage. Sometimes I like romantic comedies. Good viewing is like eating ice cream as dinner. It's not something you'll do all the time. But the experience is so satisfying that you can ignore your foolishness. This movie makes me think that I'm just stupid to continue to sit all the time. It's all about screaming to do at a cheap price. It seems that they get too much light at some point where it is washed away. It's proud. CGI, cheese and weak sets as well. <br /> <br /> Writing is clunky. I know you always expect to. There is a problem with the plot in the comedy about the ball screw. But you don't usually care because you laugh This movie isn't funny as you sit there and wonder about unbelievable coincidences and completely unreliable behavior. The event was placed in the movie to move the character from one scene to the next scene or to show the exhibition. Of course, this is how every movie works. But you should not notice that it is not beautiful. That is the word that I should use. <br /> <br /> Almost no one in my favorite movie. I don't care who will end up in anyone, as long as they are still away from me and I don't have to listen to them talking about it anymore. Why is the coolest character in this movie the character Paul Rudd wants to be involved in complete madness, posing and control played by Eva Longoria? In addition, most of the characters involved still choose the most boring solution in every situation. The straight man claims to be gay for five years to go out (and bathe) with the woman he is attracted to? The best time they can do is to talk happily for the same schmoe that he shared with his sister, who is mentally ill. Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive and attractive women. Maybe they might find something better to appear on the road.
