I recently had evidence confirming my suspicions. The 14 to 22 children group put the DVD "Titanic" on top of large home entertainment. There are only two people who have actually seen it before, but they all have seen the times of Kate Leo and Celine Dion many times until most of them feel that they have watched all the movies. Shortly after the epic began, they began to be restless. Some people asked others - "Call us when the iceberg appears." One and a half hours in the movie, only two women had watched the movie before. Still there They started shouting: iceberg, iceberg They came back to see the collapse of the Titanic. They sat open, greeted and deepened their mouths. Like I thought when this movie broke into the first scene, what is this? One and a half hours waiting for the blood to fall But what remains of it For example, Dr. Sivago has similar working hours. But think how much will happen in this movie at the same time. In "Titanic" Leo teaches Kate to know how to spit See the face and hands of the creme de la creme that is supposedly in the first floor dining room of the boat. See historical details if you can find them. The story is so slim that it is necessary to introduce guns and firing in a sinking ship. The true sinking here is the standard of the movie. All efforts will focus on special effects and the opening week will end. This movie became the highest grossing movie of all time. What do I know?
