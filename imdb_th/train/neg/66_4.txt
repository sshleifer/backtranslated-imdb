I thought I was fascinated by this film because of the sound of the story and the leading actor, so I gave the opportunity to the director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldier). Director Francis Hare (Jeffrey Rush) He is forced to run away to form a gang and fight with them to clear his own name and family. That's all I can say about this, because I didn't pay full attention to honesty. Starring Orlando Bloom as Joseph Burns, while Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart Joe El Edgerton, Rachel Griffiths, as Susan Scott Ledger performed quite well for valuable things and movies, with moments to watch, especially with the fight. With a gun at the end But I can't say that I enjoy it because I don't look at everything. Okay!
