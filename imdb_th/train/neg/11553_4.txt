Francis Ford Coppola had a brutal brain shortly after directing "Apocalypse Now" which made him unable to make a good movie? <br /> <br /> You have to wonder what the director of "The Godfather" and "The Conversation" are thinking about when he created this movie. It makes Kathleen Turner a vehicle. Starring playing as a woman who travels back in time and makes her teens know the things that life as an adult teaches her and Turner, the soldier she does with her. But this movie can't be recorded by anyone. <br /> <br /> It doesn't have any style, and the director expects that even if it doesn't have anything there. <br /> <br / > Grade: C-
