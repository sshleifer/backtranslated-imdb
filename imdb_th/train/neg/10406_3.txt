Warning: This check has a small spoiler. <br /> <br /> The writer of the first Tremors is not a thought. I am a big fan of the first movie, and the first two stories are quite good for the fare. Tremors 4: The Legends Begins is a very boring movie. Where is Grabck? <br /> <br /> Because of lacking. Relative Graboids for the first 90 minutes. I believe this item in this series should be "Character education" Unfortunately, there are no characters that are interesting in this movie, except for Billy Drago's character that has too few lines to do too little. What is recorded in the second and third films is the appearance of Michael Krause as Bert Gummer. Whenever there is no action on the screen, you can be sure that the Burt Gummer will be interesting to listen to and / or watch. However, in this film Gross plays as Hiram Gummer, a poor and boring agent. <Br /> <br /> On the positive side, when Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) are on the screen, they look good. But it's about as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> I was impressed when I saw that the Tremors 4 were in the 101 minute program. But after watching, I'm sure this movie is 15 minutes long too. There is a long, boring conversation and no additional plot. Is there a rush to create this movie? I think that doesn't have more time and should be spent with this chapter. <br /> <br /> I think I got a gold mine when I saw 4 Tremors sold together with .... Tremors !!! Fortunately, I thought that paying for # 4 was given the # 1 free after watching Tremors 4. I like to think that I paid for the original and received this mess for free. I can't imagine paying a dime for Tremors 4 for Serie fans. It's the best thing to forget. Tremors 4: The Legend Begins Even though <br /> <br /> Tremors 4: The Legend Begins scored 3 out of 10
