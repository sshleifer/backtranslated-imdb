I remember when I saw this movie for the first time. I was in the sixth grade when it happened. Before I saw this, I listened to the original Broadway recording and I liked it a lot! But when I saw this, I was like that! This movie lost many songs from the stage drama to sing loudly! Who decides to do everything ?! <br /> <br /> I'm really a fan of Gene Kelly. But this movie may be the worst of the musicals he has ever done! This film looks more like Hollywood than the beautiful Scotland. Who then decided to cut all of Meg's songs from the movie! <br /> <br /> I'm happy to bet that when they see this movie, Lerner and Lowe may wonder: "Who in the world decided to do this with our masterpiece? Saying that if they do, they may be crazy about the fact that Hollywood changed their great music into a rather empty movie. <br /> <br /> But you are In movies that lack a lot of content. <br /> <br /> So In short, if you want a good movie based on the musical by Alan Jay Lerner Frederick Lowe, and this is not it! <br /> <br /> 3/10
