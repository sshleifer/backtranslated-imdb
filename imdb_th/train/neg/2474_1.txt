As I watched this movie, I thought it was okay. It would be better every time ... I was wrong. 92 minutes of complete waste. All seriousness apart from the best part is that Wendidigo finally appears, which at the end and you can't see him And the tail tip is really stupid as well. There are too many parts in the movie that you think something is going to happen. But is a drop down The worse is the more Wendigo's talk. Wendigo then has to make things worse. You can't tell from this movie.
