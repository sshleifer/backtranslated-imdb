I am a black man living in Black City. That being said, I have a major concern about Tyler Perry's work. I know that some people who are there feel the need to praise him because he is a black person and trying to convey a good image about culture But I honestly believe that Perry White is this movie with NAACP, Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson all over his ass. <br /> <br /> I was forced to watch this movie, both hell. In recent times and repeated viewing has caused my blood to boil. The characters were written and performed poorly. A terrible joke. I must say that there is a joke. I'm just going to destroy this huge sh-t. <br /> <br /> Madea = suck. The characters may have something that is attractive. But it is not anymore When the only thing she seems to have done is to strike the child and threaten the adult with violence. She is less than useless. She doesn't need it. <br /> <br /> The situation with the wife who is dancing with her fiance is horseshoe. If a woman is afraid of her husband until death, why do you try to escape when he is in bed? There is no reason for her to leave when he works. The character in this arc was so annoying and stubborn that I hoped that he would throw her out of the balcony and be excellently ticked when he couldn't. <br /> <br /> There are two lovers One bus driver asked a woman to threaten her while he was walking around. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it when she agreed to go out with him more. But what happens to the cake is that the grown man is reduced to throw the pebbles at the window. I do not use this word lightly, but the woman has only two modes. Victims and psychopaths No matter what face she shows in these two faces But has one constant The driver will not receive anything. He married her without sampling. - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then there was a family scene. Here we have the burden of the mother, which includes implicit prohibitions, crushing for the sake of crushing too much muscle shirt, b-ball plus the good taste of Maya Angelou when those babies drag their bottom Outside and calling the meeting, I am wrong to hope that their oldest heart will be claimed. All this shit happened at the reunion in the group, laughing laughter, and then they pressed the bell. When they do, everyone will do what they are doing and head to the brutal talk of Pavlov's dog - WTF !! <br /> <br /> You have the last five minutes of the movie. In that, we saw an improper fianc√©, managed by a long-known victim and around a bad actor. There is a sudden wedding where blacks dress like angels and hang from the ceiling - WTF !!! The only reason to see this far apart from testing the limits of pain is the hope that the second villain of this story will take her to send her. Guess what it will not happen But Perry uses a solution that challenges the testes and plays safely, finish the movie with forgiveness Every aspect that this movie sucks Don't let me start with Tyler Perry's other film. I'm just saying this. In my opinion, as a black person, Griffith's legacy lived sarcastically, being doing this through a black man who would be praised for doing what was born of the nation. Sold us into the river I just hope that Perry's movie will be a fool, so I can kick them in the nuts. Thanks a lot my friend !! Will you follow this story in 2009 as a joke about rape and slavery in America's colonies?
