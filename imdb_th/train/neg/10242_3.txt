This film was created by a group of white people who went to school together. There is nothing unusual except that it seems that it was created by a group of white people who went to school together. 90 percent of white male actors are the same age. It's almost like watching many men at the boys camp that turn on themselves. The movie has no plot. It repeats the same action of a blood bath after a blood bath. There are funny scenes and a bit funny, but they do not exchange the monotonous monotony. <br /> <br /> The graphic cartoon scene is used to cover things that are beyond budget or resources that must be made clearly. Everything that can't be done with white people running around on a bloody beach is made with cheap animation. <br /> <br /> I went to watch this movie after seeing the trailer. Which made it look like Tarrentino. The sample scene was as good as it used to be The rest of it just repeats the same funny worldly jokes. It works sometimes. But it is boring after the same thing comes to you over and over again It's like the lack of Satuday Night Live over movies. It's a popular comedy. I can see how interesting this idea is. But in this movie about America's apocalyptic, like Medevil England, in reality Wheatlry says that the idea came from that era. He plans to do part 2. I think he thinks he is a Tarrentino or maybe makes a parody. <br /> <br /> At the opening event in LA, Wheatley said he will bring the actors back. In Episode 2, he was asked if he might consider more diverse actors on the next page, which he answered yes, yes, of course.
