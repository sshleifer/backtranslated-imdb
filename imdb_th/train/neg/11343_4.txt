1st View 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith): Drab and the sequel, not as exciting as the sequel to the original animated film called 101 Dalmatians. Continue, which it ended at first But the problem is that it plays a lot like the original One of the great things about manuscripts is the rhythm of the story, which doesn't have Animation is not exciting for Disney, and what we get is the same character that goes through the same story over and over again. When Disney will stop us by doing sequels and things to do, etc. etc. It may be possible when we stop renting or buying a moderate fare that they have placed.
