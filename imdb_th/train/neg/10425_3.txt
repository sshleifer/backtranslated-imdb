This movie is very good. You - but in a way that tells a story that is not only good Stella is very rude and has never learned anything. Her husband is a headless and incredibly narrow mind. Never learn better this is real? In any way, Stella understood that her daughter was ashamed of her manners and dress. But could not understand that she just wanted to make everything neat I do not think so Stella is a good woman and a very good mother. Taking yourself so that her daughter can be linked to a nasty bigoted snobs. <br /> <br /> What we see most can be normal sometimes - people with beer or two are enjoying. Playing the piano, playing the dance - but it's a bad thing "I can't let our children live like this!" Reserve me. <br /> <br /> This story tells one thing to me that the laborers who are not resisting cannot hope to create the highest level. And that is just a load of hogwash
