Suppose that is a simple word for even the filmmakers to have a chance to understand: this is a very stupid movie that has boring scripts, even weak animations and stories about the original as pins You will have to find ways to entertain adults with mentally or mentally slow children. They may laugh, especially if they leave their medicine. There is a special insult in this nonsense movie - the filmmakers clearly see that not only But thought that a stupid crazy boy that could enjoy claptrap at a cost of about zero effort But they don't have to worry about breaking the sweat Gag here and there. Adults may feel fun. This film frankly sues me gracefully. Humiliated for you, low bow
