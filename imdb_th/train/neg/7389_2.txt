I bought or at least watched the movie Seagall. Every story, he came out with a good number of movies, then told a poor story, a bad camera job and the person who passed him almost lost me. When a few movies ago he remembered how to make a good movie. Now he has forgotten again. This movie is very dark. (At all levels you are interested in) There are many slashes & occurrences here without the intended purpose, unless it is a warning to the soldiers. <br /> <br /> Seagall may stand in his various scenes as before Come Too dark to say and use the voice of others Sadly, an interesting character is a bad man who kills a soldier to escape from his arrest and then destroys the place. Ok, since when will we put the armed guards in the cell with the prisoners? However, this bad guy, at least, is very colorful and focused. Have a lot of blood if you like the king of that thing It seems like I'm a bad person, tearing the same stain every time. I'm just glad they didn't suck blood from the victim. I returned to my summary. In general, it is a horror movie disguised as an action movie 6,2006.
