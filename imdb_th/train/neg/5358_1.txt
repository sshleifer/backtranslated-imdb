Obviously, all the good reviews posted for this movie come from insiders who are involved with the movie or those who know someone who knows someone. Well, I do not know anyone involved and I saw the last cut and it is pure garbage. The only thing that happened was ambition and many came from horror myths. (Not on the screen for a long time) as if the filmmakers had created this film over the weekend during the horror meeting and had actors like Todd Todd, Tom Savini, David Hesse and Michael This is the X-Files wannabe type shot-on-video Cheap, special, with excellent performances from actors who are not actors with more ammunition than acceptable in the 21st century. There is little or no action. It is an all-in-one dialogue that attempts to explain a complex plot. Ther computer FX is funny. But there is not enough to make this movie fun in the MST3K. After about 8 scenes that have nothing but talk, you will find yourself reaching to the fast-forward button ... and not letting go. Absolutely worthless
