This is one of the movies that "So terrible" that you often hear But never seen! Which is different from the Troma movie that is badly intended and filled with camps (And I'm not amused) This movie is 100% pure and serious. <br /> <br /> However, with features like deadly killer robots A solid gold dancer on an acidic journey and a magical first pair that calls lightning and transforms into a good witch of the East. The evil that makes the circle full of fun. <br /> <br /> See enough because of that.
