I just read a book about the work of Anita Loos and the photos in MacDonald's TCM magazine in her fairy dress look very good. (Impressive wings) So I thought I would watch this movie. I have never heard of this before, so I have never thought of this before. Thought it would be a lovely beginning with Eddy as a playboy and MacDonald as the secretary he didn't know The scene in which she appeared in a party dress in her simple fairy dress with a halo and wings that did not cooperate, which is unlikely to happen is loved. I was still with the movie when Eddie went to bed and imagined that she was a true angel. But soon after that it began to fall apart for me. Eddy continued to "sleep" throughout the film, so it was a dream. Things that happen from there aren't important because they just dream. The rest is a less plot and pointless. I have to force myself to stick with it. And the last number that MacDonald changed from a musical number to a musical number in a mad hallucination is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> If Eddy "woken" faster and the original story continues or he Really married to an angel I think it's a lot more interesting. I want to see more of her true characters. <br /> <br /> There is not enough musical numbers to be called a musical. The first few songs are good. But the jittery numbers that McDonald's showed were like nails on the blackboard. Completely wrong for her opera sound Yet Eddie and McDonald's still shine, showing that they are celebrities.
