Separating this movie is like shooting a fish in a tank. It's too easy So I will challenge myself to accept the positive side of Little Man. First of all, I'm impressed with the special technique. It seems that the head of the Marlon Wayans is attached to the body of a small person. I never doubt a minute. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I love the unexpected pendant. David Alan Grier plays as a restaurant singer. Annoying and translating "Havin 'My Baby" and "Movin' On Up" are valuable. John Witherspoon, who played Grier's father in the Boomerang era in 1992 (if you remember him, "interlock" the mushroom belt with Mushroom jacket) Now playing Vanessa's father in Little Man. It's fun. <br /> <br /> Outside North from the movie White Chicks like to believe it's just stupid when doctors could not tell if it was a 40-year-old man, not a child, he had a full set of teeth !!! How is it possible that no one seems to notice that it is not a child? Little Man is so bad that Rob Schneider is a cameo and please if you're stupid enough to pay $ 8 in this movie, at least do me a favor and don't take your children. This movie has too much sexuality. For small children (jokes and innuendo about sex, going out, eating out, etc.) and I am embarrassed for parents who take their children to screen for screening. If you insist on watching a stupid movie, at least help your child be hurt and tortured.
