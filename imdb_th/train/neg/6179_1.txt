This movie is the worst movie, the second story that I have ever seen (first as a Ghost Rider) without plot, climax, conflict or other details needed to convey the story This movie is just an excuse for Toby Keith to express his manly side. I wasted my time watching this movie. The best part must be the ending credits. If I was Bert or Roper, I would cut off the thumb and throw them to the producer. Anyone who is in their right mind gives the opportunity to Toby Keith to perform in a documentary film. In conclusion, don't waste time watching this movie. It may be the only thing you regret.
