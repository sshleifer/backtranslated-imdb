This movie really, I mean, really, really. It has a very big plot and a 30-foot dragon can be inserted. No need to talk about dragons, which is inevitable that the computer will create the worst image ever had in this movie. I mean, when you see something like this, you have to think "Wow, there are people actually making this movie, then letting it out that requires courage." I'm sure they don't work in the movie business anymore. <br /> <br /> When I hire movies This story is not on DVD, so I (Reluctantly) took it out. The first thing that appeared was the Lord of the Rings trailer for two towers. This is a very clever movement. Put this example on the video. It makes me (reluctantly) give the movie 1 star. Otherwise I will give the star a zero. Perhaps the manufacturer, although attracting Dean Cain's star (I think that's how you spell it) will attract people. (Uh, go to the video store, that is) <br /> <br /> Next, they use a split screen technique (like in the Hulk) to (I assume) to compensate for the cruelty of this film in pieces. On the box cover, we see our hero and dragon pictures. The dragon looks like a dragon in Dragonheart or is it just me? Either way, the dragon in the movie seems to have been rejected by the Gremlins 2 and the CGI of the Nintendo video game villain from the early 90s (probably worse). In addition, it's not a dragon movement that looks for prey - it's like F # # cking. Boring - right leg, left leg, left leg, right leg, left leg - dom, dom, dom, dom DOM, DOM F # $ king DOOOOOM! It makes me angry Perhaps the filmmakers think that this thing is exciting and will have the same effect as the jaw. Why not try Dragon POV shot, either way? It's a joke like watching Weebl toon. <br /> <br /> Dean Cain gives a very dazzling image in the movie. (Probably because he accepted the fact that this film would end his career). Don't expect Superman here. The first time I saw this movie trailer, I thought it was an extra game for PS2. <br /> <br /> For the story, it's terrible. My 5 year old brother can do better. What when he didn't try to lie about why he was confused in my room while I wasn't there Oh and I just mention that I'm F @ # KING. Hate people who do this incredible stuff. Stupid, foolish. CRAP ATROCIOUS FILM? !!!
