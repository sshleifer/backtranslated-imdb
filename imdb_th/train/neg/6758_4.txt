Probably the most beautiful woman in the acting business and the sexiest woman, Debbie has performed well again here. Although her work in American Nightmare is superior But she is still worth watching in this movie. <br /> <br /> The actors are full of typical Melrose Place types, the extracting features and the glamorous curves that I have never seen before. In addition to Debbie, Laura Natio is the only actress I have ever seen in a similar Delta Delta Die. <br /> <br /> The planning center around the arrogant group in California. Starting with Debbie Roche The They told her that they had a killing club and said that she had to kill people to be accepted. Debbie doesn't need anything more than being accepted by these wonderful people, so she quickly kills people and now the group has to decide what to do with her after she loves jokes. br /> <br /> Violence: $ $$$$ (There are many options! Debbie Rochon has spilled blood all over her, and all the murder scenes have happened in front of you. Gore hounds will be fun!) <br /> <br /> Nude: $$$$$ (many as well ! Debbie Rochon has many nude scenes, as well as many famous actors and actors. Pool parties seem to be an excuse to make everyone naked, both male and female. Julie Strain also has a nude pendant as well. The characters disappear after the first five minutes) <br /> <br /> Story: $$ (may receive higher votes because the story is interesting and unique But the story acts as a filler during the nude scene. I understand that B-Rate movies often use nudity. But this is too much demarcation line. <br /> <br /> Performances: $ (The performance is the minor standard to say the least. Rochon is always at the reat, the best B-Rate actor in the business Easy today But her character in American Nightmare is superior to Danny Wolske, working well as Debbie's sexual desire, but other actors have nothing to write)
