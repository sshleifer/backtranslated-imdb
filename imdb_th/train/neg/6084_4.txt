It may be that a man who is called slid may suffer irreparable damage on the cutting room floor. Maybe someone might want the director to cut one day. But I seriously doubt <br /> <br /> James Garner decided to pay in the western market of spaghetti, and in doing so, many Americans come to fill it out. Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley and of course we have Vic Morrow, who both wrote and directed this movie. <br /> <br /> Garner often plays a satisfying gangster because of him. Play very well But he played seriously and did well in movies like The Children Hour and Hour of the Gun. He was able to successfully separate from his normal part. But a man called Sledge cannot count as one of his accomplishments. <br /> <br /> He has a role as an outsider known as Luther Sledge who has a high price on his head. After Tony Young's partner was killed in the hall and Garner used the appropriate Eastwood style measures, he followed from the living room by John Marley. <br /> <br /> When Marley used to be in a nearby land prison and it seems Transport that gold Placed under the lock and the keys that are in the rest, stop for people who transport things in normal work Garner brought his gang together to steal. <br /> <br /> Here, the movie is totally out of the wall. Normally, the robbery movie will show the protagonist who has planned in order. Of course, that's the case in The War Wagon, which other critics claim. But this time, Garner decided to break into the prison as a prisoner of American Dennis Sovereign, who pretended to be an American and caused a breakout when the gold would be robbed. <br /> <br / > That is too much to swallow If picking gold is easy, it should be done for a long time. But I would say that for those who like blood and courage in Western Italy during prison breaks, there is enough for three movies. <br /> <br /> That's not all. Of course, those outside the law and us. have Another blood festival before the movie ends But at that time, the whole movie lost a lot of connection. <br /> <br /> The best singer of the Thirties Allan Jones received a credit rating. But for my life I didn't find him in the movie Perhaps the Donkey Serenade choir might make this better. <br /> <br /> Can't hurt.
