My friends and I went to watch this movie without knowing what to expect. But hope for the best When we came out, we received a little more notification of how the story of this movie was. Even though it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, I don't recommend using your money to watch in cinemas. There may be friends for rent for you. (It's not worth the rental as well) If you really want to see it, <br /> <br /> When the movie is so complicated that you don't know what happened until Five minutes ago there was not much that can be said in defense. The performance is better than you expect from this movie and some shots are good. But it sank under a bad plot and bad script. <br /> <br /> This movie Actually, it's terrible that as soon as it goes out, I go and buy a ticket to see a good movie just to pay off my mind. I suggest you all skip the first step to see a good movie instead.
