So disappointing! The score from 6,1 here on IMDb creates a little expectation. But oh i am disappointed The first thing that made me a crazy person at the university. Yes, I know that teens can be kids and others, but why are they in movies often showing that complete mental retardation? There is one character that I think is okay, but he / she (not revealed here) is killed before the end. Other characters are not executed and even the hero / heroine doesn't do it for me in a positive way : The plot is quite good and the top scoring productions for this flick Rutger Hauer stands out in a small role, but it fails with a polite and resolute character. You just stop taking care of them after 10 minutes 4/10 (and being generous).
