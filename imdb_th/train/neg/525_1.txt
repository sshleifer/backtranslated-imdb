I watched other opinions and felt thoroughly amused when I found that only those who worked in this movie commented. I mean, I hate to say bad things about amateur production. But if you make a bad movie and want to comment, adjust it slightly down. "Groundbreaking" is slightly above. This is a college production work that is located in Boston, which is not successful in most amateur college movies. It is what you expect children to do in a non-creative action movie. It's quite funny if you're willing to stimulate it. Not what you will see until you are a student at Emerson College.
