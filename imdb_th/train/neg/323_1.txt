This movie is terrible. I can't sit without doing anything else. No plot and no issues I was disgusted and for a movie about a comedian I couldn't remember a funny story or genre that should be worth explaining. Politicians without special skills, speaking technical terms, can not be entertained. <br /> <br /> So how does this happen? No quality control in movies? Seeing girls in bikinis is a distraction in this terrifying experience. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine Adam Sandler, who is famous and appears in good comedy, can survive have He's not funny at least in this movie, so it proves that writing is very important in effective comedy.
