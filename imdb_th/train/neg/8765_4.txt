I watched this movie with an Indian friend on Christmas Day. The summary of this film is to avoid JP Dutta, write, direct, direct, create and edit this movie and not do any of these work. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Pakistan's efforts in 1999. In order to capture part of the Kashmir dispute area from India. In truth, you have received a hint from the film that the Indian army had trouble seizing the area from the division Pakistan Division which occupies a high area But instead of having to be an interesting and heroic story, all of this movie makes the Indian army look ridiculous and stupid, which I know is not true. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie almost. A passionate Indian audience and want to like this movie clearly. But found himself laughing in a scene that wasn't a joke. <br /> <br /> The script is really awesome. It gives the impression that Mr Dutta doesn't know anything about the work of the army and uses bad war movies for reference. The result is a stupid and repetitive script. <br /> <br /> The acting from the headmaster is not the protagonist. But considering the chapters they received, I thought it was hard to criticize them too much. For supporting actors, what I can say is that I hope they are amateurs. <br /> <br /> The correction is not good as well. It is quite difficult to follow what has happened for a long time and the music will end immediately when the scene changes. <br /> <br /> Good thing: The movie is quite good. The fact that movies do not receive color correction (The color balance is often significantly different in the scene.) In addition, a few songs in the movie are quite fun - at least in the first half of that chapter. Unfortunately, they take longer than they should be <br /> <br /> And the worst crime of all? This regulation lasts for four hours. There is here enough that a good editing tool almost squeezes 1.5 to 2 hours of good movies out of what has been shot. Unfortunately, good editors do not work in this movie.
