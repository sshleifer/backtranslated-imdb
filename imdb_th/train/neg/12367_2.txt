Loony Tunes has invested (at least) twice in the future. The first time is "Duck Dodgers", which is the most wonderful time later? Hmmm. "Loonatics Unleashed" efforts are not done without virtue and may be considered as a good product, if not the quality of Warner Brothers. The cartoon WB welcomes its cheeky humor at least to attract. The interest from adults can be as much as children. While these superhero walkers can't fail to convince adults to walk through them, <br /> <br /> The location of C This is a typical six people (two rabbits, Tasmanian devils, ducks and roadrunner and coyote) live in the "planet city" of Acmetropolis and receive magical powers when the meteor collides in the world in 2772 The confusion is that this name represents the number 2772 from the 21st century. Lovely but very stupid. <br /> <br /> In each episode amid mildly fun. Fight with the most villains. In most cases, these are the types that appear in the normal adventure series, even some parts that are better. As with many ordinary superhero series, this person uses villains far beyond the context. And of course these people are the only characters that laugh? Of course, evil laughter Why are the villains in the adventure of the heart always predictable? Is always laughing at every opportunity? The movement of this sort seems to leave laughter only in the villains and (sometimes) their subordinates and / or subordinates. <br /> <br /> In fact, this producer missed the bet at The best of them from traveling the superpowers of the characters sometimes depends on their previous abilities. But sometimes not The problem here is that we do not see enough stupidity. Lexi and Ace have natural biological energy weapons and do not have any personality that can be described as "Bugs-like". What we have here is "Teen Titans "that are stupid and boring, including" modern "animations," watching "animations, but with animals. <br /> <br /> Other mistakes of the program creator are (or are). The villain, as mentioned above Previously this is not a fantasy, horror and evil laughter too. Surprisingly, the writer missed a clear technique to create a villain from the WB character that has stock and the protagonist. Adding fun might be that, say Jupiter Sam ?? Like The Fudd, still hunting rabbits? Like Tech E. Coyote, which is actually transformed into a neurological villain? And others, the sadness of the opportunity that is not given. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all this production goes into overtime (That is the 2nd season) However, we can rejoice that there are new things for the 14-on-9-9 crowd. The rest of us can hope for Duck Dodgers season 3.
