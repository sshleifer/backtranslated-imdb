Note to George Litman and others: Mystery Science Theater 3000 riff is "I don't think so. * Breeder *" <br /> <br /> My favorite riff is "Why do you look 'like' him?" Just for complete absurdity and "not right!" Above all, I would say that we have to give credit to the MST3K team in trying to ridicule this television movie. You can't create fun conversations. Bill S is a good playwright. In contrast, this production is terrible, even though he doesn't like it. The junior high school drama club can do better. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend you to buy books and read 'Hamlet'.
