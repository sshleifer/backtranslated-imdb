See it in the Gay and Lesbian Gay Film Festival. <br /> <br /> What can I say? With my better decision, I like it But for me, it seems that the performance is a bit weak ... (Mostly I noticed this from a teenager's family.) I mean, the script is not the protagonist starting with But the actors didn't make me believe in the relationship. <br /> <br /> The plot can still be predicted. <br /> <br /> Nonethels like it. Not challenging or not satisfied The characters are cute to each other and I don't count for fifty minutes. <br /> <br /> But I don't recommend.
