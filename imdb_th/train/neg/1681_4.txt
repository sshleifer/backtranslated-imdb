Freeway Killer is a madman who shoots people on the freeway while yelling a bunch of mysterious songs on the phone in the car. Police believe he is a random killer. But Sunny, the young blonde heroine, played by Darlanne Fluegel, found a former police model, played by James Russo and they joined forces and bodies to find the villains who had done with their spouses Starring Richard Belzer, this movie has a period of time, especially if you like car chases. But it's not a good movie. Mostly, try to see if you're bored and see The Hitcher, Joy Ride or Breakdown. Otherwise, stay away from the highway.
