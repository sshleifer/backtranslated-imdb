We have STARZ's free weekend and I switch on the station to see what happens. It's this movie. Howling II: The performance is very bad. But the eye candy is excellent, Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as an eye food mentioned above. I laughed many scenes that I saw. <br /> <br /> Friends wondered why I didn't want to watch horror movies. If they watched this movie, they would know why. I'll be thrown out for laughing so hard. <br /> <br /> A few notes: Reb Brown, Ben White player, used to play Captain American in a story created for the television movie Marsha Brown. For this song "Brown sugar" Mick certainly has a wonderful taste for women.
