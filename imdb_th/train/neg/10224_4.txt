Spoiler <br /> <br /> Okay, in conclusion, one line says that all of Melville's "Le Samurai" is traditional and has "Leon" elements and they are better - much better. br /> <br /> In "Samurai" Alain Delon is a solitary / professional killer who keeps the bird in the cage and steals the car for the scene!) Even the ending is the same: Samurai seeks death. With dignity and being shot with an empty gun in his hand The world changed, he realized and there was no place for the samurai in it. <br /> <br /> Delon doesn't kill many people like ghost dogs, but I think Jarmusch likes "Leon" a lot or even "Desperado" by Rodriguez. This thing too And let me guess: that girl will become a professional like a ghost dog (Eg Natalie Portman in "Leon") <br /> <br /> So what is Jarmusch thinking? Where is the original idea in this movie? <br /> <br /> I can't see the point of copying carbon (cellulose). <br /> <br /> Score 4/10 by Macaulay Connor.
