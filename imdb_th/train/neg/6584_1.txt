Is the only film I can watch at "Nordische Filmtage" this year at LÃ¼beck. This year's festival will be remembered for a low level forever for me. <br /> <br /> This movie, which has been Declared to be Erotic thriller, nothing more than a shit that's sick! Sorry, but the language does not have the right words to describe. <br /> <br /> First of all, the actor is not the best. But even better actors will not be helping movies like. Synopsis: After the first 15 minutes, it is quite clear that John was sick, a neighbor girl, not real, and he killed his first girlfriend called "sex scene". That there is nothing other than disgusting (Bumped together until the blood flowed for me, nothing related to sex) but unfortunately not the only offensive image to show Everything has been copied by other directors, such as Lynch, but of course there is no kindness. <br /> <br /> So to summarize all the movies and to save other viewers' time and money: men lose their girlfriends. The boyfriend returned home. The man killed his girlfriend and became mad after that. Men imagine girls, but crazy neighbors. Men have nasty sex with one of them. (Or so he thought) In the end, he realized that he was mad and his girlfriend and her new lover lying in his apartment all the time .. bad stories, bad actors, pictures that made you Want to vomit ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 (1 point for the fact that you know how you can understand Norwegian if you learn Swedish - at least one benefit in the evening - and You are not three Can select 0 points here)
