The only word you have to fear is more than Joe Don Baker. If you think of watching a movie, Greydon Clark, and if both of them are there, run away for your life. However, this is a very funny movie because they are really serious about themselves! It starts badly and falls down from there. The scene repeatedly. Good and Bad and The Ugly like a penalty point will make you roll on the floor with laughter. Yes, he is the best sheriff in Texas. As far as he can He created his own rules, doing things in his own way while wearing cowboy boots. You want to see a movie that is not good but funny, right? Go ahead. It's your movement!
