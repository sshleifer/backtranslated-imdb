I read another review that commented that the category is an endless circle of Marines that killed people killed, used drugs and talked to trash. <br /> <br /> I don't agree because of this film. There is more than that, but it's the way I can see what this person is trying to say: this doesn't have a real plot - which is the point that I agree with <br /> <br /> It is rock-like. That he is the best he wants Dong real war would not only lead to death. But also shows how people who survived the wounds are like that Unfortunately, this movie seems to "praise" this aspect and the final scene of Grand is way too good to be an Oscar Hall interpreter. "To create a lasting image" for my liking. <br /> <br /> The problem I have is the stone and other filmmakers of his family, that they do not understand the simple concept: the drawing of cold blood like The greatness that the war did not prove or even reflected back, whether it was an unfair or immoral war. We have seen the same thing that has happened now with Iraq. In the event that you miss this point, let me talk honestly to you: If you see how cruel the Second World War is and how the devastation affects the lives of the surviving soldiers, you think it's a war. Is that not fair? If that fact does not make you believe that it is an unjust war, then why depicting the horrors of Vietnam makes you believe it's wrong to enter the war. In that case, <br /> <br /> Personally Then I did not support America's decision to go to war in Vietnam. But I do not apply "This war is wrong because people die and suffer." Theory I do not think motivation is often wrong, just because of the war itself. <br /> <br /> This thing doesn't tell the truth. That the ending or "twist" of the last big one is a bit stupid However, this is not the first departure of the stone. Stones Wall Street is a great movie until 30 minutes ago when it caused a mistake. JFK is probably one of the few films that Stone has done very well. <br /> <br /> But it is not important for this because it has very little plot. That point in this movie And this is the reason I give a low mark It's almost a ridiculous and boring story - unless you fall in love with the pain.
