In comparing this dirtyness with a low-budget porn, it is an insult to the low-budget porn. The animal scene is meaningless and does not represent this man and his crime, even in the broad sense of abstraction. The conclusion on the back of the DVD box says in some parts that "dealing with the terrorism of BTK Killer is amazing." Denunciation will suggest that you be told the truth of what happened or how or why. These things are not true. I am an enthusiastic serial killer and have seen films that are crappy about them and frankly, this is not one of them. This isn't about the killer. BTK saved himself for a moment and a few coins and rented Dahmer instead of the serial killer. That's right and true. However, if you just have to watch this movie yourself, watch for free at your local library and then you will still feel cheated.
