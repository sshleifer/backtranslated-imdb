I just want it to be known. I don't usually give a movie rating below 5, but I was very excited to watch this movie. The movie trailer that was bumped on TV for many months made me really want to watch this movie. The night before, I saw that it was in FearNet on Demand. I got popcorn and sat down to watch movies. <br /> <br /> The story seems interesting enough - some friends are wondering people. Subway station. There is a photographer obsessed with the missing person. Where are they going What happened to them One day, the photographer saw a connection between some of the photos that he had taken and was obsessed with the butcher following him. Yada Yada This movie has a way to suck you even if the plot is highly predictable. "Oh no, it's dark. Look out behind you." I say quite bored with the cheap excitement. <br /> <br /> The plot, although predictable. "This is a good thing until the end .... then it's stupid" Jack_skellington_freke Speak on the message board And I fully agree And come to the spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Let's see. I hope it's a crazy killer. No, it is a secret society that has kept animals alive for centuries. Woo. The traditional way is unrealistic. How boring is it? <br /> <br /> 3/10 Come to Lionsgate You have an amazing movie But this time sank
