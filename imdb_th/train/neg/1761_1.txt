For the first time, I realized that "1" ratings should be reserved for the worst of the worst. This movie received from me because as a critic pointed out that it was not bad in the face of one-on-one consciousness that could make it a comic or cult worthy. It just misses the mark in every count. ** There are spoilers possible. ** The conversation is incomplete Continuity is a very painful thing. Daniel just finished talking about the lost love and with his last words, the flamenco dancer began. What is the shock of her name? (See, I can't remember the name of your character at all, even the name of a forgotten actress) when her husband (Baldwin) first told her that her friend was a bad person. Cars and motorcycles pursue everything right. Vegetable wagons disappear. Car collided Motorcycle down the stairs People are almost attacked. But no one noticed Oh, that's right ... except for a man who was stabbed many times, apparently stumbling upon the edge of the road with a knife wound, and apparently the car approaching did not notice him there. /> <br /> It became very amazing for me that this movie can be created. There is a lot of pressure in the movie industry to make money. Do you think that people in Hollywood think that creating a good movie is worth watching? Now there are new ideas. <br /> <br /> My advice: don't see this movie. Don't rent a DVD. Do not look on the cable. There are many other things you can do that will make you feel more satisfied.
