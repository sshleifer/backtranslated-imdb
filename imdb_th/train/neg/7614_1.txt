This may be one of the worst movies ever produced. <br /> <br /> 1 The most exciting part is the beginning, where men are walking ... and walking ... and walking (spoils How to walk) 15 minutes? <br /> <br /> 2 Not to mention, there are many problems with the lights and almost as if they were shooting night scenes during the day. <br /> <br /> 3 The performance is TERRIBLE. Meet the community theater (in Mexico) ... and then take those who turn away. <br /> <br /> Please, for the love of all the sacred things, do not rent this movie. If you know someone who owns it, please apologize. The director should be punished through a war crimes court because of doing this to the public.
