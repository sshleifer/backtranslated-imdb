I used to have a fascination with cartoons back in college when it was created. It has the charm of "Get Smart" very much, although it has errors, but it's fun. <br /> <br /> Naturally, I'm interested in watching the movie version. That was before I saw it. I want it to never be done before. <br /> <br /> In addition, the lamentation around (Who in the world, even if Broderick is close to this chapter?) It just can't score. <br /> <br> The effect is reasonable and may be the only thing I like about movies; Seeing gadgets that are in progress! What is missing is the story and treatment that makes it funny or charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original is a strange cartoon with a very cheerful attitude. It's fun. The animation is gloomy and too serious. If there is enough serious or crazy plot to make it look like "Cartoons on the film" It may be fun. <br /> <br /> Because it already exists, it should not be considered as part of "Heritage of gadgets"
