At first I was happy to know about the new Superman movie. I would be good but not good. <br /> <br /> It's a bad copy of Richard Donner's work, but Lex is a villain. No longer makes anything even play by Kevin's spice. <br /> <br /> The evil plan is like Donner's first forced movie. <br /> <br /> The script is predictable. And simple (Everything that Luther found in a museum or an old woman) <br /> <br /> The story is wrong. It must be a chapter of Kevin Smith and maybe better. <br /> <br /> I hope to be a sequel that doesn't have Brian Singer and with a new talent director to do something new. Not a copy. <br /> <br /> Everyone reads you later.
