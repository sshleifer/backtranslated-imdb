If you read my reviews about SyFy's "Dinoshark", you know that I can appreciate the low-budget schlock in which movies created to watch these television can serve. They are stupid ... they are stupid. ... but they are still fun in "Very bad. It's good." The way, therefore, still hit with guilt for liking (and suggesting) the undeniable hokey "Dinoshark". I sat down to see "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy". SyFy's original movie about a half-hammered monster. Half of the people. With the SyFy Channel definite formula for creating lifes, movies, B and actors including William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how can it be a mistake? That's my surprise. Actually it lacks the mark ... not much but enough to make me not recommend. Why? First of all, the giant monster of it is a hybrid of a hammer-man's head that is shaken by the military gangsters as the main villain of the movie. Although the hammer head will increase the number of bodies, but he (or it or what you call things) arrives just before someone is chewing and leaving behind. The rest of the film is a filler, with our heroes fighting with such soldiers. For me, it's not as interesting as watching a hammerhead to eat people! <br /> <br /> Please read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
