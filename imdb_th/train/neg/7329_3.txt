After watching this movie, I felt that the tempting thing had to drain my frustration a bit. Selma Blair is a great actress today and Max Beasley is quite charming in "Kill Me Later". The story, while not original, definitely shows some promises. There is nothing important, though ... so <br /> <br /> I don't know how she is. But the director Dana Lustig has almost no ability as a director. She slowed down the image, accelerated the image up, reversed the image, using an awkward camera angle, using annoying color filters to make a quick cut. Millions of dollars jump back and forth in the timeline. I can't remember the last time I saw the job. That is not capable of directing this movie Her ego must be big enough to cast performances and stories and set her direction in front and be a center for audience members to observe. It's packed in the neck. <br /> <br /> There are a few good scenes in "Kill Me Later" which shows what should and should be. Unfortunately, when things started to show promise, Lustig would dig into her bag at the school of trickery. It's a shame because Blair and Beasley have good chemistry and you can tell that this movie has a really good heart. 3/10
