All I can say is that before watching a movie, I don't have an indication at Annemarie Schwarzenbach. Is or the story of her life .. and I have to admit that this movie hardly gives access to this information .. and even Did not succeed in persuading me to do research by typing a few words on the google website; However, what I can say is that actress Jeanette Hain is great with her facial expressions. She plays very well and shows a deep mental depression as if it were real. > <br /> This film script takes place in Turkey and Tehran, including Afghanistan .. But trust me, I'm familiar with the area. It's about Arab deserts in Morocco .. Turkish people and Persian people are totally different from faces and cultures. <br /> <br /> I think creating movies like this - documentary type - thorough research on all these sub-elements is required ..
