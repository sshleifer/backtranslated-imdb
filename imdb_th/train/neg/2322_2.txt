I searched for a video store everywhere to find this movie, a huge Elvis fan that I was and I found it to be a huge disappointment. Kurt Russell has "Elvis moves". Most of the imitation sounds are great. But the voice of Elvis singing did not work for me The sound doesn't match the mouth of the mussel, and it's hard for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me that it was clearly visible. There are also many surprising differences in movies. Those who don't know much about Elvis may think they are facts. This song was sung by him faster than recorded in real life when he got his first guitar wrong. I'm sure Jesse Garron, his brother, was buried in the grave I know it's just a TV movie. But they skipped important events such as special return and dragging some scenes too long If you want to watch a good movie that shows Elvis in his main rental, that is how it or Elvis's other concert. Hearing and seeing the true Elvis preform is the only way to truly see his talent. (Great statement, I know, but still ... go out and rent a good Elvis)
