After watching the movie, I was really shocked to see a very high rating on IMD. <br /> <br /> 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' is a classic adaptation of children who love smooth stories. slip The protagonist, Mr. Fox (or 'crafty'), as he tries to steal one 'last one' to steal from Boggins, fearing Bunce and the correct beans, one short, one fat, one lean or the other. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm m in my late teens and never being a fan of Roald Dahl, but I like his content well. Read a few books of He was a child and saw Matilda and Char lie and the Chocolate Factory over and over again However, this movie fights for the audience. Is it aimed at children? Adult? I'm not sure! Many jokes 'Will be bored with children, especially when Mr. Fox visits lawyers, such as or complaining of being poor In addition, the audience of children (I suppose) is expected to sympathize with the characters who steal and kill chickens. I do it for the food chain. But you see that Mr. Fox bites! Of course it is a little matter? And the plot ... is boring I am with the hope that it will improve. But I became increasingly frustrated with Mr Fox and his son Ash because of stupid decisions. <br /> <br /> Humor at the same time fell. I laughed once or twice, even though I remember a special joke. I think part of it is a flat and unbelievable sound. The voice actor has no sense of rhythm in the cartoon, instead focusing on the delicate humor that is applicable to certain types of media. George Clooney aims to show that Mr. Fox is charming and sleek. But his voice doesn't look like. Meryl Streep doesn't show any emotion. I didn't realize that Bill Murray had a role until the credit ended and Ash was twelve years old in the fox. Last year he seemed to be 30 years old. <br /> <br /> I love animation especially stop moving. But the acting style actually made me a little The characters have height, thorns and lack of warmth in the design. They move very smoothly, and often the animation is jerky and strange. There is also a feeling that the 'mixed media' is outstanding due to the addition of two-dimensional elements periodically and unsuccessfully. The characters look directly at the camera and talk. It's very awkward. There was a moment or two when Kylie looked straight at the camera and did not move his eyes. It really makes me crazy. <br /> <br /> Mr. Fox has great potential. A lot of people still like it - see comments. Maybe it's not for me
