The biggest thing that led me out of hell is that they said Zues used DUTCH but she was speaking German with him. Both languages ​​are totally different. It's like "He used the French command well" and began to speak Spanish. <br /> <br /> James Belushi gave more feelings than being a comedian. That role doesn't suit him, even if it's a joke. <br /> <br /> For many things that are fixed / predictable. General comment or return. <br /> <br /> If you don't see those things, I think it might be a good movie to see if it's been on TV. But I would not recommend renting
