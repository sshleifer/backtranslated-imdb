I don't know what the producers of The Shield are trying to do. But the result speaks for itself: The Shield can't be overcome Actually, the performances were combined so badly that you couldn't see the show. For example, the amendment cut away from retaliation before they were fully affected. <br /> <br /> I don't know the intellectual reason for that But it robbed all emotional impressions. <br /> <br /> I'll give you one point of the shield for the ambition of it. But that's all I can give. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see a lot of talent. Actors lose their gifts in something that is not good.
