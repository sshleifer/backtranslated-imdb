I have a copy of this story in the VHS. I think of them. (Television network) should play this thing every year over the next twenty years. So that we can not forget what happened and we remember not to make mistakes again Like some people put the director's chair that they didn't This movie Rappin 'is like a vaudevillian song for those who can't sing or perform. This movie is so much fun as trying to teach 'blind people' to drive the city buses. <br /> <br /> John Peebles just got out of jail and he headed back to the old district. In giving time to crimes that are extremely necessary John headed back to the old road and was greeted by a dog, an old girl and his housemate while they were dancing and singing all the time. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this if I feel sensitive Some people smoke cigarettes that doctors prescribe as glaucoma. In any way, this is a bad command, action script and production. (I never thought that I would sit down) satirize the slum life with 'Hood'. Although I think that the story has been redeemed through the fight scenes, gangs, scrambled and dancing numbers, his friends are interested in their neighbors Want to help the ghetto from being destroyed and cleaned. <br /> <br /> Forget the spoon. Sonny Mario should win the Oscars compared to this rap. If you find yourself wanting to laugh yourself, stupid and shy, three-quarters, be sure to drink first. <br /> <br /> And please look responsibly. (No more lucky stars next time!)
