Why O 'Why! ... Do I choose this one? Well ... I want a simple game in the summer and the cover looks cool. <br /> <br /> Sure I should know each other better. This is a really bad movie. And it's embarrassing when the creator knows it's not good and try to cover up by adding sexy / beautiful women and some sex scenes together ... people don't cut it, do it <br /> <br /> if you Like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very good, good to play and funny: rent Lake Placid! (That is the order)
