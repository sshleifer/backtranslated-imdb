Warning: It has spoiler. If the movie starts with a sex scene, then it is a bad movie (see example 300). This confirms the above inserts. The second scene is considered the center of rotation of all actions. The truth that we know that the ending makes the movie boring. Moreover, other plans are revealed when the story goes back many times. And this makes it more frustrating In order to continually compensate for the lack of doubt, we have learned more about character imbalances. And oh yes, they have a lot to show For example, Andy (P. Hoffman) is a more addicted person. He cheated more on his wife. He plans to rob his father more. His wife is unfaithful to his brother again. Sorry for the death of his mother, right? He is a serial killer more than this, etc. etc. There is not enough space to write here ... I wonder how he can have a good job And why his wife didn't leave him first On the other hand, I enjoy the performance of Hoffman. <br /> <br /> Even here, PSH will record the rest of the $ 7 that I use for this absurdity. Why is it ridiculous? Because there is no reason why I have to pay attention to the nasty characters? Another insert is that the movie should have a sympathetic character. (At least satisfying) <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of sympathy. For example, we should take care of the suffering of widows without knowing anything about their parents' life before the crime.
