Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), a filmmaker who wants to live in a NYC apartment that is deeply dependent on his mother to help rent. He has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica. (Jennifer Bell) who may be married or not married But whoever Aldo Paul will love in his movie When Al is expected to receive a financial contract for the financing of his film from a stranger named Joe, he thinks he has received it. That is until Joe takes Al to adventure to steal a Porsche to be a part of financial support. Will this film be created before Aldopo is completely without a spine? And Angelica will be shown in the movie? This is in the opinion of horrible movie viewers. The script was abysmal with a plot that wandered deliberately in almost every line of her and Buscemi, even though it was satisfactory. There are many offensive content and nasty characters to boot. Finally, the production cost is also very bad, causing the movie to look at the second rate all the time. If you have time in your hand, it is still a good idea not to use this opportunity in movies. But if you are a glutton for a proverbial punishment, go ahead and see what curses the Beals look beautiful after all.
