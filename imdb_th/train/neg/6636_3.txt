The worst and least natural show I've ever seen. Which may not be surprising that the dialog box that is clunky is weak for one note character Add to the right production cost and you have a movie that doesn't look like it is for the television. No one expects anything from movies throughout their lives, especially the old film. <br /> <br /> Clever plot. It is possible to guess what the rest of the movie is like by just watching the opening scene. Surprise, the only female character who gets attention and a mysterious stranger falls in love.
