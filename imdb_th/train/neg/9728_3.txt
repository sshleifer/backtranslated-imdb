Tobe Hooper made a great movie, so I'm sure this isn't good. I didn't read any reviews and tried to watch this movie with humor. Sometimes it makes me laugh. Sometimes I almost fall asleep, sometimes causing me to almost cry for Hooper. <br /> <br /> I rate this 3/10 because of "horror" in the 1990 movie and Many interesting or funny things happened there throughout the story. I think "They can't add things in this movie ..." But they do. <br /> <br /> Some people say that this is a clone of Ferrers'. It depends. That idea, but all this is a combination of fear, comedy, strange religion / divine things, funny blood, easy results, drama, awesome performances, unbelievable scripts .. and more. > <br /> * Spoiler * Subject:: The government is trying to create The final weapon that uses nuclear energy or something and fails during the process of child birth is for two people. When the mother sings for the child after birth, both the husband and the wife burn, and it is very surprising. The government buried all things and allowed this child to be among others and after that, another year, this child grew up and realized that he was born for a reason and that he could burn things with his brain. Then the government realized that "Okay, now he can set fire to use it." They took him to the hospital as usual, which is a nuclear poisoning that they will use for this man. They can kill him. No, they can't shoot him! ..And of course I can guess enough to say I promise that there will be 100 other strange things in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you want a good laugh
