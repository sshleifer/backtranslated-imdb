"Look, I know that this thing may suck now. But the pain is temporary, the movie is forever, no matter what you do now, is burned as celluloid all the time and for thousands of years "?? Robert De Niro <br /> <br /> At first, this was the movie for Steven Spielberg, the director hired many screenwriters to adjust the screenplay to suit his theme. So we have an incomplete family that has been insane in the form of a recent release from Robert De Niro prison, as well as "Jurassic Park", "Poltergeist" and "War of the Worlds", a family group that Uncommon together to defeat the beast, the beast that was created from his father, a lawyer who failed to protect De Niro during the trial. <br /> <br /> In the style of Spielberg, the father killed the animal. Strange that destroys Bake the kitchen and get rid of his sin immediately As well as Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Samiel, Tom Cruise and almost every "father" figure in the Spielberg region. Father returned to accept his father's position in the form of Like bittersweet soda like Spielberg likes. <br /> <br /> Eventually he left the picture and the project turned to Martin Scorsese, who at that time was trying to try a commercial hand. Increase The result is the worst movie in Scorsese's film work, and ironically his most luminous <br /> <br /> The artist's failures or mistakes are often revealed. To see the inner workings of their art When the story doesn't work, the characters won't connect or the picture isn't boring, we find ourselves in this core ?? The remaining remains - what the film director is about. <br /> <br /> Now "Cape Fear" is a movie that doesn't exist, so we won't find a connection with the rest of the results. Scorsese's movie work me! "De Niro shouted," The movie theme of Catholic redemption is a cookie cutter. "Although what the movie did, it revealed the language that his movie was stuck in. See how Scorsese's camera beat back and forth. He zoomed in with the door knob and the window madly to try to pull the tension and his character loud and shout. But more importantly, see how this film has no spatial meaning. The boat showdown at the end of this film takes place on a clear sound stage. The parade on the street is boring and does not occur in a bigger context and the family house seems to not appear anywhere. There is no geographic feeling for anything in the picture. Scorsese is unable to shoot space or create an intergalactic environment. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is that Scorsese's camera must be bound or tied. Always attached to his main character In order for the world around the characters to be meaningful, his camera must focus on the characters. Resnais can take you around French hotels. Welles and Hitchcock can dance you along the streets and buildings. Scott can create a view of the city in the future. Lucas can give the alien desert planet. And most other directors can create a sense of space by a textbook set "Shock, medium shock, wide shot" but Scorsese couldn't do it. Without poetry, there is no tangible feeling in his movie He's about all the characters. You break that rope, throw away the boxing ring. A taxi, a taxi. You look out from De Niro and everything falls down. He couldn't separate himself from the filming style of this documentary, which was necessary for action movies. <br /> <br /> Scorsese tried to solve this problem too. "Gang of New York" area and scene became the main character. But even this spatial experiment has been sabotaged by the power of Daniel Day Lewis. The actors drawn Scorsese's camera unbelievably into a butterfly-like tube> 5/10. B Basically, this is a movie that looks ugly and rude. See glazed drawings, inattentive attempts caused by tensions, special techniques that are stupid and hokey fistfight. But we have Robert De Niro to get slack. De Niro, who surrendered him to Scorsese as Christ with a tattoo, made this film a wonderful scene. In the romantic scene with the little girl Juliet Levis, he put his thumb on his mouth and kissed her. The rape is a symbol of a woman running away from both provocative and disgusting by the attention of this man. <br /> <br /> De Niro's acting makes it deliciously above the top, cannot be copied by the scoreboard. Sasey You have to have some opera and baroque sounds like De Palma to do this job. But Scorsese? No, <br /> <br /> worth watching
