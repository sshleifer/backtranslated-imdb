First of all, let me say that this thing must be on top of my boring movie list. Nothing and I mean nothing in this exciting movie from a distance. Most of it is very confusing and when you proceed, hopefully it will end !! Some people want movies that make them "think" throughout the story, which I say ... "More powerful for you" !! On the other hand, I just want to be entertained. Which brings me back to this smelly person. Entertainment is not This film is stupid and completely time consuming. It seems that most of them agree. Most do not have any reason, and by the time you think you have a scene that can be thought of as having a scene with another prong scene and .... Well, I guess you'll see what happens Avoid this one. Bad .... Bad !!
