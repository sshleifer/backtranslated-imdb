Honestly, when I first heard of this show, I was probably a good idea to create a program that made Muslims use their own racial jokes. But it's the opposite I realized that acting can help people understand that if Muslims use such words in real life, it doesn't mean that it's a terrorist matter. It also shows how people give bad names to Muslims because they play in their conventions by watching regular shows. People will realize that even though there may be bad Muslims, they don't have dogs. Saying that we are all bad Once a day, just like Amair, how difficult is the plane, and he uses words like "bomb" or Yaser that we will explode. Competitors and people are using the wrong way. Being a Muslim, I know that things like this do not happen. But they do and many people think that the bad thing about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq, the wrong thing is not that. People will see that we are treated badly by watching this program and may make them think that action is I'm glad that this kind of program is aired. There are many items that Piotr, a Muslim, as a terrorist, many people find that they are funny with my opioion. Fun of unfairness, but done frequently and makes Muslin's name very bad.
