It has many advantages. Morvern Callar is both an advantage and a disadvantage. She is a very mysterious, exotic person. Is it your way to deal with the pain of the lost person that makes her far away and inaccessible? Or is she a critic, calling her a revolution? Personally, I called her unusual. <br /> <br /> Morvern completely removed her. Getting rid of her boyfriend without thinking of telling the family or using the money he gave her for the appropriate funeral, she splashed out on a selfish Spanish trip. It seems that she is devoid of human greed. The only element that makes the audience see her human side is her best friend that she goes on vacation with her. Although at the end, her friends will be left and Morvern has nothing to bind you to humanity. <br /> <br /> Even if managing to make Spain look depressing and gentle, while the image of the director in the UK is great. That this movie is not involved at all It took less than 90 minutes but felt longer. They try to make Morvern look interesting that will attract your attention. But don't do anything to you, just make you more alienated from you, to the point that you don't care about the characters or movies
