In general, I like to watch Burt Lancaster's movies - especially when he has to dabble with his impressive screen in Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest power, which is his attraction, is sometimes a weakness. His greatest moment, as he rarely gets anything, underplayed anything, and this is the lack of subtlety that truly interrupts the Rainmaker creator. Now I understand and That his character intended to be an actor But the way Catherine Hepburn falls under his magic cannot be completely explained, she should be clever, but it doesn't look like when Blarney is thrown on the face. Screen! In addition to this, the story may be one of the most scary movies I've ever seen, and it's too obvious that this is a drama based movie. It seems that most of them are filmed on the sound stage instead of the open western as they should be. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is a very exaggerated movie.
