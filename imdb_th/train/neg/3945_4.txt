My Name is Modesty is an economical movie that tells the story of the origin of Modesty Blaise. Not that this movie is terrible. But not what I expected or hoped for While I was aware of the character Modesty Blaise for many years, I was not too familiar with cartoons or graphic novels, so I entered this movie as an outsider. That may be the cause of my disappointment. I expect more action and comedy. This movie is driven by dialogue. I think I'm looking for something that has little value. My Name is Modesty is a serious movie that is serious. There is very little, if there is a "moment", the light of the show, at least from Alexandra Staden is acceptable. But there is nothing outstanding, as others comment, she seems to be too weak to fully believe in the role of the name The action scenes in my name are polite, one of the weakest points in the movie. I never bought the idea that this woman could handle a group of trained killers. <br /> <br /> I hope Quentin Tarantino will move on. I believe that this concept has great potential and I hope that it will be like that.
