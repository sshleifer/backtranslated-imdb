I hope I won't write this review. I am a Christian so I waited to watch this movie in anxious manner. It looks very good - Christian movies with a reasonably famous star and an interesting plot. (Not that I bought the Bible code myself - you can make it say anything you want. I do. But believe everything in the Bible So I sat on the edge of my seat, enjoying the example when the movie came in and managed to destroy my emotions in a matter of minutes. I have to bite my lips to stop comments about writing and performing horror while I'm in the theater. (I will be torn apart by the clumsy people who are quite clumsy. But in general, the scene is high and gasped The tension scene, I'm sure.) However, when the final credit begins to turn back There are many parts of the movie that I like - some unexpected things, mostly some really special effects. (I do not count those visions that do not work well) and some interesting technical tasks - fade out the types of things. Unfortunately, I was clearly impressed that if I read the book about revelations with monkeys and setting up monkeys in front of the typewriter for an hour, I would get a better chapter. And the music is beyond magic (Even Bond fans who like magical music in action and intrigue scenes) So I wish I could be like everyone else in the theater - like someone who came out crying and suffocating because it's so incredible. - But I'm not a person who can write a script by a writer with more words. The shells in the Bible and the Christian seal on it I want a good plot and a convincing dialogue before I can enjoy most movies and this is not there as well. I'm sorry, but I won't recommend this movie to anyone. And that is a tragedy When will we see intelligent Christian fiction? It must be there somewhere ...
