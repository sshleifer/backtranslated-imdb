Pros: Akshay Kumar's performance (is it just me or is this guy dealing with AB in their movies?) Some scenes that touch in the second half <br /> <br /> Cons: Hours 1st place, all (the joke is smooth to say the least), all the scenes related to Rajpal Yadav, the main stupidity in the decision of AB to get me here. possible (To break their relationship beyond repair) is a better way for him to eventually take Akshay in charge of something like WTF? He thought that Akshaye was too soft to bear the fact that his old father would die soon due to cancer. But think that insulting him will make him stronger? I am the only person who doesn't see the reason here or not. The biggest flaw of the movie easily. <br /> <br /> - Akshay becomes a dwarf. LMAO !! We said that he finished 1st in college every year and graduated with a master's degree in business administration. But when it's time to support himself and his pregnant wife, he becomes a dwarf. Haha !! How to apply for a regular job in your field Or where is your life not in danger? This is an incredibly stupid writing. <br /> <br /> - The ending. I don't like shit like this. Everything was pushed into our neck to feel sorry for the character of AB, which I couldn't. Everything makes me think of Srk in KHNH too (which I hate). "Please apologize for those who are sick." Shit has already opened the course. I feel like shit more than sympathy for the old man. Can't see the last minute or about 20 minutes. Because of this, it must be quick to forward all things. <br /> <br /> Below: Waqt is too stupid to be a good movie. The obvious director of Wipal Shah has set a goal here that there is a chic and emotionally fragile old age that doesn't care about rational stories. Give a good picture of the fancy dress song, a scene full of glycerin and star power, and they will laugh like this happily
