I'm a big fan of Troma, but I can't understand why they bought the rights to this movie. It's very boring. I feel like I'm watching for 3 hours. "But what Satan didn't know was that he was stuck with the annoying traveler." Well, they don't seem to bother him in the movie. About this movie is an actor who plays Satan. I like bad movies. But it's boring
