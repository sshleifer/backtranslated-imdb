I made a few reviews about IMDb and this film is outstanding in a story that I have never seen in both movies. It was very foolish and didn't do anything even though I tried to pass - even if I tried it. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem of this movie. In other words, the better the movie is, the less you see him in the movie. Think about it - the producer and Young Frankenstein are great movies and they rarely get in them. But movies like Life Stinks and Space Balls are filled with Mel and are movies that look cute. (Yes, I do not like Space Balls - but this is not the place to talk) <br /> <br /> Secondly, in addition to anal cancer and mental retardation, I can't think of a less funny topic than a stray This is just a comedian break. Imagine the FUNNIEST (?) Scene in this movie. Mel creates a yell with Leslie Ann Warren in the trash !! And how funny is this?
