The movie written and directed by Neil Young "Greendale" is more than 87 minutes of music videos set to be a doxen or composer's work. The movie relies on Young's lyrics, which have a strong political criticism to tell "stories" as the actors perform the scenes. <br /> <br /> Let the humorous and rude performances. The effect of this image is equivalent to Young, who burst his own homemade movie and released it for public consumption. Although there are stories that allegedly ran through the film But we don't really know what happens mainly from the appearance of the film that has no polish, lack of dialogue and inefficiency in the show. All that we have received for eighty-seven minutes is a group of older hippies, quietly passing through an uninterrupted storytelling while Young's music plays endlessly. The whole thing became a tedious exercise in self-indulgence. "Greendale" gave Hollywood movies with low prices and bad names.
