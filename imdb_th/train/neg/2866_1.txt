No words can explain my most hatred for the horrific actions of the killer. BTK rated this film one of the ten compliments of the truly catastrophic excuses for this film. From beginning to end, there is no single highlight. All things are horribly combined, scripting, acting, plot, lighting, direction, performance, reality, acting just to name a few. There are a number of scenes that laugh out loud, truly, for the brutal ways that everything is combined. This review may seem like an unfair and disgusting attack in a low budget movie. But not in this case Just thinking about the movie that I just saw makes my blood start to boil. I never knew this before. I was almost tempted to recommend BTK really because it truly stands out about the pathetic and frightening ways. I can honestly say that every year of my filming is the worst thing. MOVIE EVER I spent more than an hour in my life with this useless garbage and was happy to jump off. The nearest building earlier, if I knew I was going to zero from ten
