This movie should not be a movie theater. Although now more than 10 years old, it should not be financially supported and is a huge damage to the Australian film industry, which is producing great movies like "The Dish" Can't show, music is .. to be revealed, not music, that story doesn't exist and tries to sit down. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. Is a waste of your time completely
