When I saw this on TMC, it was fresh in my heart. Obviously, while stooges are the dominant stars, they don't really do the show. First, they are divided into 2 groups: MoE as "Shorty" and Larry and Lon as nomads, so there is no full teamwork. The love story that plots about fuel is not interesting. Two women are the only ones who have the ability to perform. There is another group of musical actors that is not offensive unless you consider their efforts. In a joke to be sad Boring music, they drove to the ranch and then, depending on the horse, wearing a stupid western style was foolish and there were a lot of horrifying movies without the camera-attached followers This method is evident after Curley's first stroke and his reduced energy level. Vernon Dent appeared earlier in an unchecked role. I love everything they've done, including things that are not Curley, but this little dog is very cute.
