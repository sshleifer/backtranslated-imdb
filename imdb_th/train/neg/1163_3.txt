Fragmentation of fashion, education, incredible characters, examining the different personalities of two college roommates: talented star basketball players But without discipline, and smoking We never learned why these young men were friends. They may share confusion about the world and places in it. But nothing seems to be the same. Jack Nicholson, who co-wrote the movie with Jeremy Larner from Larner's book, didn't introduce us to the characters that were clear and he didn't set the scene to help us identify who on the screen . There are many satisfactory performances here. (Especially from the newcomer William Tepper in the important role) but most images do not have a format (probably intended), sketched or unsure. Bruce Dern plays as a basketball coach, driving like Karen Black as Married female elderly To grow Post your character's influence over the tone of the film; His script didn't help anything, and it was unclear whether we should sympathize. Small, random working hours (The supermarket fought between Tepper and Black, Dern visited Tepper in his dorm room, all scenes in the court), but the third act of the whole picture was a ruffled mess. Hoping to place the most important b-ball game along with sexual assault. Nicholson does not show his style of craft (And he didn't get points for the chutzpah because the scenes of these events were ugly and ugly) when the director went out of the way to tear his actors. He had to ask motivation to do that. "Driving, he said," finally gave the power to negotiate. The audience could forgive the filmmaker for making decisions and tastes. Unfortunately, the daze comes more and more puzzled from the rest of the movie. * 1/2 from ****
