The young man killed the girl without reason. The man's brother was jailed for being an accomplice. But soon escaped When fleeing, the innocent man seems to kidnap three victims and he soon ropes his girlfriend into the room. If this is not good enough, the situation will swirl quickly. <br /> <br /> This film has many good aspects and bad things. The most prominent feature is the female lead actress Emily Haack. In addition to the fact that she is nude in this film, she offers herself as an actor with a strong ability and character. I do not see the reason that she cannot use this experience and turn into a career in some way. I'm sure she is a brutal person. <br /> <br /> In addition, the filmmakers are very brave, nude (both men and women), Coprophagia and extreme anal violence are not avoided. I like my horror movie to push the boundaries slightly and this film doesn't care. They jumped over to Gomorrah gladly. Maybe too much But I think they achieve what they are looking for. <br /> <br /> But now, negative. The first and most noticeable thing is that this movie has a very low budget and the quality of the movie is shown. I can claim that the plot is appropriate, good performance, and in some scenes, movies that are of lower quality actually make the film more disturbing. (Gives a more realistic feel) so I won't scold that there will be low level equipment What I will scold them is to use a bad option in the shot. There is no reason I can investigate (In addition to making the movie plump) there are many pictures of cemeteries. I don't really know why and I started talking honestly because it was long and pointless. <br /> <br /> I still have a problem with the name. The idea here is to deceive people to think that this movie is related to the classic "I Spit on Your Grave". There is now a line that seems to imply that the main character is the daughter of a woman from this movie. And the pattern is very similar freely (Women get revenge for men) but there is no strong connection and the reason for choosing this name is for the video shop customers to think that they have received the sequel. This is a hoax and dishonest. <br /> <br /> My last major complaint is that this plan is not reasonable. Not even a little Women were killed at first without reason. Prisoners in prison find time to kidnap others to torture them without reason. (Because they were wrong with his girlfriend) The same man started out very well without explanation. Similarly, the female leader (Haack) transforms ordinary people into cruel and sadistic people without reason at all, and towards most people who have little meaning to her, wrong but not worth being tortured. ) <br /> <br /> Don't let this title fool you or claim that this movie is incredibly shocking. Yes, some scenes are shocking. But most movies are boring and make you want to take a nap If you see this in a video store or on Netflix, just continue searching. Or rent it and we can sit around to ventilate for hours You have been warned
