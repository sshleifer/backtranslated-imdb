This film is for the history of F.B.I. while Knott's Berry Farm is in the old west. A model that has been punished unreasonably by the Federal Bureau of Investigation against crime. Hoover's hand (Does he have anything else?) Throughout the show, with quality actors reading the script, character sets, sound effects, cheap effects and lighting, 101 and Jimmy Stewart, 20% of high-capacity characters All known in the mid-50s with ridiculous or humorous hints from the 'Amazon forest' to the 'backyard barbecue'. Everything is filled with many sound and background stages. Even the gunshot is canned and familiar. I imagine that Mervyn LeRoy will be drunk every night. Except creating interesting external images (few images) that are interesting
