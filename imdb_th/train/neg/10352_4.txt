Recently, I recently discovered that the Madeleine L'Engle novel has become a TV movie by Disney and ordered a DVD. This book is my favorite book when I was a child and I read it many times. <br /> <br /> Even though there are some young actors who do not look like characters as described in The novel by Meg, which is a favorite (If too beautiful) at the center and Charles Wallace, who is believed to be a genius child without irritation. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is likely enough to do well in the relationship between the main character and In the scene Unfortunately, non-human characters appeared. The adaptation began to unravel, and when the children left the world, all things were broken. Alfre Woodward looked very young and terrifying, like Mrs Whatsit that was unusual (think Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright instead) and the face of Kate Nelligan is a unique and unreasonable mask. She had to visit Faye Dunaway's plastic surgeon last year. For some reason, they made her look like Glinda from the Wizard of Oz when she should resemble the wicked witch of the west. <br /> <br /> In the end, what makes this story the worst Impact and artistic direction I understand that this is a TV movie, but CGI seems to be able to do something 15 years ago. Mrs National Centaurs Whatsits is a disaster as Chewbacca likes to fit the Aunt Beast, who in this novel is an animal. Elegant and elegant, instead of Bigfoot, as shown here I can continue to do almost every art option as a disaster. Probably because there is not enough budget to do justice. But because of the design, lack of imagination and good decisions. <br /> <br /> This thing must be used by Spielberg to bring his first film. It is a shame that the current popularity of the adaptation of children's literary fantasy series that no one thought would be adapted to A Wrinkle in Time and as a sequel to the large screen makes it a deserved scope.
