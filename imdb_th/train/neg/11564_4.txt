Italian horror / suspense movie about a wealthy British boss who sailed for pubs and taverns for girls with red hair like Evelyn, his late wife. You know he must really love his wife because he took them to his house - a large rotting castle - and made them free. Then tortured them, whip them and kill them. The most bizarre aspect of this movie for me is at the end of the movie. We saw this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as the hero of this film. However, soon under the guidance of young uncle Roberto Maldera, De Teffe sat down with a woman he met at his uncle's party. She moved in and the strange things began to happen with Deetiff's fragile mind. He began to see and hear the dead wife, and finally just look at the title if you still wonder. In addition, family members and friends began to die in the most brutal fashion. Poor Aunt Agatha (She looks like she may be younger than De Teffe and they have a wheelchair and try to look old). Meet her fate like a fox. The other man was injected and buried alive. And of course, there are all explanations as to why Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia did a pretty good job: The setting in this film is perfect for this film, although trying to convince us that England is The most laughing thing There are no actors who look in English. Many people have dark black hair and Mediterranean skin and wear clothes that the British will not be caught in the car driving in the wrong direction of the road. But all of that, despite the efficient shooting of the crypt scene and I like the wonderful resolution as well. And of course, every movie that has Erika Blanc, extremism and heat will always be an advantage. There are sexual distortions. However, which I found quite shocking to the idea that torturing a woman is quite good and healthy in order to alleviate one of his spiritual demons. C'mon
