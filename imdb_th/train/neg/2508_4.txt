About when they released this movie on DVD I know that some people say that WB is releasing this movie because of the movie The Dreamgirls, but how can you accelerate the release of movies that are in your catalog since 1976? The DVD release of this movie has no special features. There is no 5.1 DD sound to WB. You can do much better. The sound and picture quality in this movie needs serious help. <br /> <br /> Looks like the WB didn't give much time and attention to this movie because it was a black movie and I sold it ok They can keep the CD without having all the songs on the original CD. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this DVD for purchase. Yes, because it is a classic movie, but WB has to add more special features. Take notes from other films, The Five Heatbeats or The Temptation. You may only see both performance and sound better than this DVD.
