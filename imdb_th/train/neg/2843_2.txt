Yes, Sakura Killers is a scary and scary ninja movie. But it is an incredibly fun game This is mainly with the great presence of Chuck Connors, who was charged as an actor in the movie. But really projected in some scenes only I think he should be an Obi Wan Kenobi type ("Buster Ninja", exclamation box), but his "wisdom" is ridiculous. "Move without thinking" ??? My friend said that this is a sign of mental retardation, not the highest concentration. <br /> <br /> But actually both of them, Sonny and Dennis, have a terrible conversation like 'Brooklyn' while we call The Colonel Tend to shine in comparison In particular, watching Dennis's logic about 'Genetic articulation' that Sakura relates If you know anything about cloning, you have to laugh. And yes, this is an important plot point for the average person. <br /> <br /> Sakura Killers are rare gems. I will not destroy the 'trick' for you as well, except that it is the perfect set for Sakura killer. 2 Chuck Connors Terrible died :-( Because he has a gentle way to blow the ninja away.
