There is no denying that the first Azumi movie is a commercial product. It is a popular adaptation of the manga and has attractive young actors and of course not lacking in the budget department. But it is more than entertainment for what it is and I can't deny that I really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> "Azumi 2" lacks everything that makes it a great original. The first thing that should ring the alarm bell is the lack of a great Ryuhei Kitamura at the helm. It seems that he will not only But with his flair for vision and kinetics only But still has style, beauty and most importantly, its heart While at the beginning there was a simple "hitlist" plot, but this was a mess of stories that had too many boring characters to stab each other in the back many times. Sympathy or poor things Gone is the mutual influence between the leading characters. Azumi and her friends are often reduced to a group of young people who argue in the forest. The classification does not exist; If anyone looks really interested in living and who will die, I will be shocked. Like the villains here The final battle - in fact, all the battles - without any tension. The fact that they were badly choreographed and not thoroughly mentioned and not talking a little and Far away - was created from true aimlessness The bad guys try too hard to be a camp, and even if they gather together, they are not at the national level of the traditional comedy of Pete Burnsian of Jo Odagiri. ## ## Large spoilers at the end of the paragraph! ##### <br /> <br /> Aya Uto tries our best to speak and she can treat her hair in good condition during the movie. Now, Azumi is a full-fledged killer, meaning she can wave her sword in a slow motion. Unfortunately, now the characters are cultivated by the mysterious Man With No Name style. The style of Ueto looks even more inappropriate. I know that this should be a point. But this, combined with the inefficiencies of other people in the film, the stupidity of the plot and the stupidity of the film generally means that it is impossible to stay behind her character at this time . Less than talking about Chiaki "Remember me from Kill Bill" Kuriyama's performance is better; It was enough to say that she "turned" from good to evil as a subtle matter as a firefighter. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is just a big disappointment. Doing better than ten times in the first movie Lazy, not satisfied and seriously boring
