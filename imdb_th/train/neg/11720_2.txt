I read in the documents that W.Snipes broke down, so it's not surprising that he will be involved in a low budget project, such as a contractor. 90 (Van Damme, Segal Lundgren, Snipes) Here he starred in cheap action movies shot in Bulgaria. (We should believe that the place is London, like the only complete moron to buy). The story is one of 1,000 other films: Special forces retired. The guy is hired by the government again to do a wet job - after that the government wants to get rid of him - the good guy gets after killing the bad guys. (That is, spoiler or not, can't guess!) Movie stars: Little girls (Eliza Bennett) perform better than other actors !!! One star for her and one star for the eye candy. Lena Headey makes 2 stars for the die-hard Snipes fans!
