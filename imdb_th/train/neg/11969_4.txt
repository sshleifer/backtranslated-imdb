If you like to be entertained, don't watch this movie. If you want to see the war hero, don't watch this movie. If you want to see good performances and great screenplays, don't go to watch this movie. If you like the typical Hollywood war movie that ends up when it attracts public attention about the grandeur and elegance of the war, watch this movie. Otherwise, don't waste time. I am always interested in war movies because I think that if done well, they can teach us about the qualities of a war that is conflict and worthless. This film shows a group of people running around in the countryside, saying the worst nonsensical words, doing the most predictable things and protecting those who are oppressed by certain forces. This movie is a shameful story for making movies and going to the United States! Can you imagine being a person from Europe or Africa or another country and watching this thing by saying that this is something that Americans are real? No wonder everyone hates us! Please, please do not waste time with this garbage. If you have to wait and rent 4/10
