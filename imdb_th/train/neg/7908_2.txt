I didn't expect much when I saw this at the Palm Springs Film Festival this weekend. It was another alternative when two other films were sold out. Still, I still have hope. It sounds like "Bride and Prejudice" (LA falls in love with Indian beauty, parental conflict, blah blah blah). B&P is not perfect. But it's a fun movie that has both laughter and favorite characters. <br /> <br /> "My Bollywood Bride" doesn't have that. The show seemed arrogant and approached by numbers. The characters have ancient ideas, stories that seem to be written by junior high school students. Technically, really disturbing me There seems to be too much talk. I mean a lot I know that sometimes it's necessary. But it sounds like half of the film was filmed in the closet and it became a very distracting thing. <br /> <br /> The two stars are quite generous.
