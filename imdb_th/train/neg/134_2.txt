This movie in the far distance is very smart. It is a theme song with every horror movie ever created. Valentine makes ZERO try to be original. What is Valentine? It was a group of people who gave the same crippling message to others last year. Nothing is original on Valentine's Day. <br /> <br /> I only saw it once, and in one look here is some movies that tear off. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4. Horror movies Other morale that someone is killing someone. <br /> <br /> I know that there is more. But my mind slowly changed into a puddle, so it Can't grab it quickly. <br /> <br /> Valentine has no chance to be a good movie. Why do all horror movies have murder? "Surprised". People you don't care about because of their emotions change every scene. One minute, a beautiful girl turns into a demon B-ch. Then she is an unsafe woman and continues, and son etc. <br /> <br /> Normal horror movies (In my book) will be recorded by blood Valentine again, no this thing As if they were trying to make a PG-13 but failed so they left the fix. <br /> <br /> Do not see this thing too inspiring, tearing off unless you hate yourself and You want to die <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
