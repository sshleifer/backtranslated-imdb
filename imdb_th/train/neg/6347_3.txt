I may have always watched the movie Woody Alleb because nobody knew when he would return to his past greatness. Only one or two wonderful moments or lines can make it worthwhile. Sadly, however, this film didn't score any points, saying that Tart made me sad and slightly guilty. I'm sure my reaction is like all other Woody fans, but who can say? Maybe it's time for him to concentrate on his Clarinett, which in my opinion is quite good. Saying all of this, I'll still go to see Woody's new movie that will come out in the future. There is always hope and I will still love and respect The WOODY !!
