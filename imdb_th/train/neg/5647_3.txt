We bought this series on DVD because of all the glowing reviews we've seen here. I gave three stars because there may be a little doubt that sometimes acting, supervision and writing are excellent. In fact, they were excellent. We didn't see the propaganda that was sent smoothly in the series. If anyone looks at it wisely, we will see a hymn of the right-wing leftist belief announced by the Fox News Network (Faux) to avoid distributing any spoilers. I will refrain from pointing out all cases. Dozens of short summaries about the plans found in IMDb will reveal everything from torture to gun control on the right side of the network so that "Infomercials" and calling them fair news with a lovely plot twist in the world. We watched many shows and eventually quit with disgust when they proved that torture was used by prosecutors. Max Gonzales is a clear example of why every type of torture should be used in the name of protecting all of us. The series also manages to erase both male and female gays in a delicate way, using them as a plot device that represents the wicked. All in the complete song of a completely different religious right wing. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as evidence that America lost. The way in the beginning of this century As a student of history, I will show the character of this program in the league with propaganda produced by Goebbels for Hitler and propaganda produced by Hollywood for American audiences during World War II. <br /> <br /> So if you Want to use this as a teaching tool to help your students understand that profound propaganda can be done by all means Just be sure to buy a copy that is inexpensive, so you can avoid the value of the most accurate wingers at the Faux Network, the manufacturer of this imitation.
