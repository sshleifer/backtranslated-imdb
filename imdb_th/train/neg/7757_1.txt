I have suggestions for people who make this movie as well. If you are going to create a movie like this, make sure you get f / x to spare. Still don't get the list of actors playing in it. Another thing that all of us see Jurassic Park, so don't copy it blatantly. All in this movie was sucked, sucked f / x, acted sucked, not original. We talked about the performance for just two seconds. Carradine, who had the highest career in 1984, when he made "Revenge of the Nerds" (which was actually a great joke), he wasn't on the list He can do his duty. He should say that he doesn't wear this bag. He should do what Mark Hamil did after "Return of the Jedi" and went quietly at night. He made his mark as "a fool" and that should be like that. I understand that he has expenses. But it can't find any excuses for this bag I've called this movie yet. OK. I just want to be sure. If I'm an enemy, I'm sorry. I just wasted 2 hours in my life. I could spend some time doing useful things like watching paint stripping and I felt cheated. I will close in that note. Thank you for your time.
