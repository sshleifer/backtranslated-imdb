I was bored with this movie. I felt that I had to warn others. This movie has no story, story or purpose. The film began after the introduction of "Scary" in the intro movie, which now all moviegoers are familiar with. So we can ignore the start completely We will soon be introduced to an important actress and from this point it is clear that you have lost a lot of income and it's better to look static. (If you don't see the white noise - EEK) The show is humiliating and they should all go back to the pantomime from where they came. Having said that even the best performers in the world still have to struggle to watch this movie from a distance. Their bad performances contributed to the disaster. Unreasonable violence and what I can guess is that the writer's words are "unusual". Another person who may think of themselves as artists can result in movies that will test your patience. It wasn't until my fellow watchers turned to me and said "We have watched this thing for 45 minutes" I know that the film is as thin and tepid as a cup of tea without tea bags. Obviously there is something missing and unfortunately not the audience. Instead of saying that the movie is gone, let me tell you what it is: Dumb Blonde (Surprise, Surprise), The Victim, Bad Monster, About 2 minutes of story ... and credit > <br /> Need a silver lining? Hmm, the blonde girl looks a bit worn out in some scenes. But expected to want to see her face torn into the rest of the film!
