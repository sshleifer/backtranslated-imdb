OK slasher movie. A very stupid slasher movie. <br /> <br /> We have your teenage model coming into the house. We got too many FBI agents to see Dirty Harry. "So what is the secret .... Function?" We get about 4 different camera images and scenes that are not reasonable. "Hey man, I'm fixing the head of the springer" (((That person is the part that I like in the movie)). Suddenly, a preacher tied on the sofa watching a movie about his house being killed Go to the middle of nowhere, police Suddenly she was in the church wearing a wedding dress. I swear that this is the most stupid slasher movie I've ever seen.
