Poor This is what happens when the director comes to work because someone pays him. <br /> <br /> Good intentions, places and great settings for movies that have a great proportion. But terrible performance! I swear in some shots that you can see special things on the background, stare at the camera or watch actors because no one tells them what they should do when they hear "Action!" The fight scenes are terrible. You wonder - are these people really? They can do more damage, just hugging each other in a slow scene. You will see people on the battlefield walking around or standing still, waving their hands. <br /> <br /> Focus only on actions in the foreground. That is unreasonable and uninterrupted. It seems that there are random situations in time, sometimes not The conversation is dumb, love is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in Hong Kong action movies. <br /> <br /> With a budget of 40 million and you can see every dollar invested on the screen in the best case. The end result of all this great effort is a shiny circular laser disk in a thin cover. On the shelves in the video store
