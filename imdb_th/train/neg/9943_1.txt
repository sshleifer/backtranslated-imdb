The cover (which has a man carrying a terrible pellet gun) makes it look like it's a martial arts movie (hardly). <br /> <br /> I think it's interesting that the movie's real name. This story is a Trojan Warrior (a Trojan, a condom brand in the United States). This movie is full of homosexuality. If you like that kind of thing, this movie isn't that bad. However, consider these points: <br /> <br /> There are a wide range of actors and legs in many scenes (one scene, even though every actor has an erection of his pants). This is a flashy shower such as lemon, peach and red. From the perspective of the filmmaker, this film is the queen of inspiration! Many characters have many characters standing near each other, sometimes touching while they chat. Hero's cousin likes women and every man in the movie tries to kill him. Is there a message that the filmmakers want to convey? <br /> Can I go into the fight scene? (Yes, the personal parts of someone will be caught in the fight once.) The martial arts scene is short and unimaginable. There is no new thing here, just your standard movements that you see in the old Chuck Norris flick. There are also chase scenes which may be the first low-speed chase scene on the film.
