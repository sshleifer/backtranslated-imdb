This is the biggest garbage dump I've ever seen. Don't rent! The creator of this film should be a band from another movie production. It begins with the plot of what it is and slowly fades away. I think I want to see the color that is dry. The actors are scary. The storyline is faded, fast, filming too much to do. It's not a good thing to talk about this shit movie. If you rent this movie, you will lose money. I enjoy Lamphun National Film. But this is a waste of time Learn to write, learn to do, learn to produce and learn to lead. I felt that I should sue these a-hole, which caused the film to lose money for rent and time lost
