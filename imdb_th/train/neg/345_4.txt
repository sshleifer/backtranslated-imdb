This is not Mandy Schaffer's latest film. Someone does something! :-( <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This life might be one director. Don't blame the actors. They are ok, even the younger ones. The brother did very well and he didn't go into the movie until halfway through. Please help Mandy put on the movie a bit. She's too beautiful to bury her career in childhood. Ya 'breakin' (not obvious. First, the way in which Traci still appears at the right time for viewing See what you should see and never see a very annoying return. Hollywood: Please stop the perfect time luck for the villain who will be exhausted when Climax arrives. Stupid Use a weak plot device anymore. If your script isn't good enough to stand up without doing so, don't build it. <br /> <br /> The second carmen won't fall en for a trick. Traci's fake injury secret draws her. Tracy, writing / directing worse. <br /> <br /> I can leave this movie. But mercy forbids it Actually, I didn't hate it as much as everyone else has. It doesn't have many reasons to be created unless it is a vehicle that shows Mandy that is cute. Oh, and for anyone who doesn't think she's sexy ... the characters aren't well written. But how do you say she is not sexy? One of us needs glasses and I don't think it's me. <br /> <br /> More MANDY (not to be confused with "Moore, Mandy" - even though I want to see you again as well ;-) < br /> <br /> PS I mention I hope Mandy gives me more movies? <: - D
