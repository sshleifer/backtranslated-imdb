There are many things wrong with the characters in this movie - Brenda Song is one of them. I don't believe that the woman is a lousy actor - I can't really do it. I believe she received a bad call. She should be "ridiculous, rich girl" and while it's funny on the TV program she plays, it can't even laugh from me here. <br /> <br /> Both ways I should know what to expect when I sit down to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't that bad ... At first, Wendy's reaction continues. The chain is completely natural. I mean, how do you feel if a man who claims to be a reincarnated monk chases you around, instructs you to wear a medal and confirm that you have to fight with "Great evil" and save the world? Which leads me to another point I know that this movie is all fiction. But there are also founders in Chinese culture. It seems like "warriors". Everyone in the Wendy family is a woman. Fix me if I'm wrong But I wonder if the monk would be alright. Of course, maybe they may work. But did not give any explanation. By doing so, they contributed to many magical efforts in empowering women made by Hollywood and the media. <br /> <br /> That's okay. <br /> <br /> Wendy's character will become More resistant when the movie continues Yes, she is a teenager and is near the reunion - I mean, who wants to fight evil during the return home? The problem is when "Evil" began to appear on his own. Wendy seems to be not as it should be. She is extremely careless, even with someone like you. She still doesn't care about her training. I will use this dialogue as an example. Shen: "If you do not win this fight, evil will dominate and everything will be gone." Wendy: "Oh, talking about pressure. So, "Yes, Wendy came to try dancing when you should practice correctly. Shen let her, but his character had an excuse. Better than he cooperated with her more than he couldn't, and she didn't practice at all and made the couple killed. <br /> <br /> Oh, talk about anything. Shen also told Wendy that it was fate. That he had to die for her in the fight as he had for her great grandmother (I suppose that part) <br /> <br /> Make Wendy's action. Br> <br /> As the scriptwriter will get Wendy's homecoming and "This great battle" on the same day. Do you know what Wendy does? Do you have to guess? Yes, she goes to fight because when she tries to travel to return to the priest's house (which Shen is stuck in the body of her coach and teacher because she "feels strange to fight the old man") tells her that Shen has gone. Fight alone, so she went to help him. <br /> <br /> At first we saw a half-satisfactory fight. Until finally the great evil came out of the body of the rival for Wendy's homecoming and created his own true center from the fragments of the bodies of his ancient warriors. <br /> <br /> Do not ask <br /> <br /> Anyway, Wendy has been "panicky" all. From then, Shen went and protected her from this man - forgive me who forgot his long Chinese name - and managed to make. I was killed. <br /> <br /> Wendy Caught Shen when he descended for a long time. <br /> <br /> She screamed the name of the article. <br /> <br /> Now ... It's not good that Wendy will become a force. Far too fast No, I won't let it be excused because it is her "fate" and she has "inner power". <br /> <br /> Since when she learned to heal? Not the worst ... since when can you revive someone? So Shen raised from the dead Then Wendy and he fought with that man. <br /> <br /> He easily lost his way. The worst part is when they jump together and kick him at the same time and he is exiled forever. Then the monk praised Wendy about her sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Two things, # 1: The screenwriter and director didn't know that the fight was needed. "Finesse" a little more, right? # 2: What sacrifices? The fact that she didn't go home? Because women do not cause sweating or bleeding I mean, now, this movie is TV PG. I want to see someone get hurt. <br /> <br /> Ah ... I'm working. <br /> <br /> I know it. Listen As I should give this movie according to my opinion As part of the criticism, you must know what is breaking down. You don't have to try to look for something bad. But if so, you must pay attention This movie has a lot of bad things. But there is a joke that happens when you never expect to have anything better than at first. <br /> <br /> So I think it's right. Not that I didn't say that it wasn't right. Everyone would stop anyone from watching it.
