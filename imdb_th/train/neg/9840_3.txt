Independent alchemist, Christian Slater drama - This is a development toy that made me look forward to spending an hour or more in "discovering" the gem of a movie. I was disappointed. Julian Po never passed away. This film is self-conscious. I found myself unable to suppress unbelief for a moment. Exaggerated theatrical performances, exaggerated theatrical performances, overreacting drama, over-acting theatrical performances, clear drama directives - you get the idea. <br /> <br /> There is no need. Comparison of sliding hammer symbols And it was hard to feel much for Julian Po because we didn't know him much Nonsense fans, annoying townspeople, stupid priests, big children - why everyone, especially those who have lifelong ambitions to get to the seaside
