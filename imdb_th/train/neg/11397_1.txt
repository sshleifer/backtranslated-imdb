This is really scary! It has a terrible storyline, bad behavior, and is like an amateur that creates an evil death. But not good. <br /> <br /> It takes all my stubbornness to pass this thing. No need to go to the bathroom. I wonder if I will be back! This makes Hammer House of Horror look like Hollywood's great backdrop. <br /> <br /> The only thing worthwhile for this movie is to find beautiful women that never end. Not bad among them! <br /> <br /> If you want to drink beer with your friend after drinking beer for one night, this person is for you ... avoid such an epidemic!
