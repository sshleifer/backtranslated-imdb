I am willing to go with the original intention _Cruel._ It goes with the story and still be true to the characters in my favorite stories However, in my opinion, this film is a new format with the same story and no clear options. I didn't care what happened to them honestly. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons is not CI) is their character and their interaction, not the event itself. I'm not clear until I read IMDB that this movie is meant to be a prequel, especially since the name has the number "2". But decided that it must be a companion Above all, I must say that this movie read to me, at least like the obscene Les Liasons. I'm not impressed
