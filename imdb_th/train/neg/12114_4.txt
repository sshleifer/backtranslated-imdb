Strange people who live in the city go about their lives. There was a man who licked everything, a trash can, a corpse that found the body that he brought home with him, a crazy young woman with a doll dressed like her, someone who wanted to clean women in their wrong way ... wrong. Usually in extreme cases, this picture in black and white movies is better without color. Monochrome brings the edge out of two steps from the feel of the movie at home. Like the movie Troma, this movie is fun and well compatible. But most are strange because of the sake and soon become boring because you see the settings, you can guess how long it will take But it is enough to not be fun (Even if I don't see the cleansing process). Worth the shoot. If you don't have anything to see again, and you're waiting for the next Golden Girls outfit to come from Netflix.
