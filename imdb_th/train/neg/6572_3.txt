In my opinion, the title of this film should be changed from "Only the Brave" to "All About Lane". I watched this movie a few months ago and was disappointed with the results. Although I admire that the director created the movie about the 442 year old man, which is a story that deserves a mention in the film industry for a long time, the performance in some movies is quite outstanding. Lee is great. However, the director should not make himself the main character in the movie. Sorry, Lane is not just a movie actor. Sticking to what you do well - Gina Hiraizumi's drama performance in this movie is also scary. She should not be given the role of speech and her face is not suitable to play in the Queen Nisei. There are other actresses in movies that are naturally beautiful and have excellent performances ... Why don't they show that role? Another important issue of this film is the action scene. The Japanese-American soldiers do not look like they are fighting German soldiers ... Receiving this is a low budget feature. But because this movie is a war movie, it is not important to show the real battle? This movie is a worthy attempt. But not worth the big sale
