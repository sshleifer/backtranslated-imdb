I have a very hard time doing this through this process. It's slow from the outside and sometimes wondering if the plot of the movie will come to life. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be slow and I wonder when it will end Usually I am a person who likes good indie files every time. But this didn't satisfy what I was looking for. <br /> <br /> Looks like they tried to make this movie a lot. At one point, it seems that political change, which I'm not a fan of movies If you are looking for a slow-moving movie without a plot without it, this is the right movie for you. For me, I felt that I wasted 2 hours when I could do other things.
