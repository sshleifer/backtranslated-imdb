After about half of the time, I was ready to give up and close it. But I endured This is a movie that tries to be a romantic and failed comedian. Bad acting - worse than acting in the T&A 80s movie. <br /> <br /> There are many humor that has failed miserably and the movie is predictable. 100% Maybe if you are a teenager, this movie will attract some attention. But for those who have watched many movies, you will know that this movie will come out in the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time will be spent on the pain that is waiting for the end of the credit. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time watching this
