Why have I never seen or heard about this junk movie before? It is up to my alley with teenage blood. A laughable plan and an atmosphere of irresistible 80 cheese hanging around for some reason. No one really cares. All were killed by an unknown psychopath. Newly recruited teacher Julie Parker is involved when everyone she contacts, whether dead or acting strange, this movie is terrible! There is no reason or connection and every character is not the same meaning. For example, a woman was killed and her body was dumped in a container. Then, and without reason, the story moved three weeks ahead. But the murdered girl never mentioned or even missed Not even her boyfriend! The show was pathetic and there were no nudity to enjoy. The killer's revelation is quite funny because the creator seems to believe that it is a traditional twist ... not a man! "Splash University" is one of the worst horror turkeys ever.
