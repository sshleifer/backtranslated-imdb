This is just another movie that you find on TV all the time, which shows offensive behavior of disgusting women in a sympathetic manner. Along with other nasty movies such as "The Burning Bed," "Enough" or "Monster". This film uses a disgusting crime and tries to show the audience why she is not a bad person. Let us take a break! This is my question for filmmakers: If LeTourneau is a man and Vili is a 12 year old girl, will you make a picture that is sympathetic and attentive to this person? Answer: No, <br /> <br /> Imagine changing sex in this movie and you will see why myself and others here think that this is a worthless debris. When changing sex, there will be no attempt to sympathize the villain. But we should be treated to see the image of an evil and ugly man who chases a young girl. His contemplative behavior connects him to prison and his brainwashed victim suffering from Stockholm disease. The only reason LeTourneau did not receive the same treatment in this film is by relying on her sex. <br /> <br /> We call LeTourneau Spade as a simple pedophile. Not just ifs and ands or buts. Criminals who are in prison and deserve our insult and insult. But not our compassion or sympathy
