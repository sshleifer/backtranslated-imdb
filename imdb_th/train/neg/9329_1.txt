One of the worst movies I've ever seen My only idea is: "How do I get a refund from the Hollywood video?" This is not a worthwhile method. Four dollars or any dollar. I think it is an attempt to cut the Mexican movie or Vin Diesel's but It failed miserably to do this. <br /> <br /> The performance is terrible. What better way to do with their time? Nonsense story We call the actors before it can be predicted. The Mexican accent of the female lead is exaggerated, insulting, worse than cartoons. <br /> <br /> Jump over.
