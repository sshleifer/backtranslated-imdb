What can A-Pix do right? This film is seen on the TV in the mailbox format. Because A-Pix doesn't believe in pan and scan, we see all the scenes on the left shoulder of the screen, speaking to the right shoulder. Of course you don't get lost much. This film is incredibly bad. It is very difficult to enjoy movies that the characters scream at the top of the lungs during the 80% of movies without reason.
