When watching the little man, you will spend time trying to find various plot slots. And that is not a good sign because this movie should be a funny movie! You should laugh at it !! But you may not. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the little man is the concept of it - it's too ridiculous to accept. (Even though it's a funny cartoon), so when the loud voice works and is the best joke It seems to be more than ten times dazed. <br /> <br /> "But it's a joke." Some of you might scream. Is true But there is no excuse for a stupid plot. I think if you see a baby with a man who grows up in the face, don't you doubt that? And if Calvin wants to hide the diamond badly, why doesn't he put it in a nearby layer instead of a random woman bag? And how can a qualified doctor know that Calvin is an adult? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about the plot. It's about laughter." You may scream. This is what is seen, there is almost no laughter in the little man, and that makes the stupid stupid plan more prominent. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch Wayans brothers comedy with suspended belief To attach to the white chicks, because at least there are a few good laughs
