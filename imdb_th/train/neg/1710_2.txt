Every time a group of friends with a low budget But with enthusiasm and ability to create a low-budget masterpiece that leads the world of horror by Raimi and the company doing with The Evil Dead, Jackson and pals, succeeded with Bad Taste; And Myrick and Sanchez made a coin with The Blair Witch Project. However, director Todd Chee and his friends were destined to indulge forever in the darkness. If the Bloodbath zombies were something to go through Lessons on how not to make cheap horror, miserable efforts (About the disaster of carnivorous zombies is a reminder) While many people today, access to most video cameras should not be used. That is their queue to try to make a full-length movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that the sheets aren't really interested in the frame. (The camera angle and some of his movements are pretty good.) But quite a) He has a punch script. B) He has a punch actor. Which means that the last film is extremely skilled and unlikely to be fully watched by anyone who is not a zombie filmmaker (like me) or a member of the actors and teams (Eg people who give good comments to movies) <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath is aimed at blood drilling and sheets. (Which currently has 34 unbelievable names under his belt as a director) leaving his path to please with trash and Blood was thrown at every opportunity. But while these moments have undeniably good luck, they are unbelievable and boring soon. <br /> <br /> So to conclude that this is a really bad movie, except two: < br /> <br /> At first it was the biggest single cylinder in the history of movies, as Jerry Angell, who played Larry (including many zombies), the beauty of his Barnet. (Coupled with the pulling tent) is the only reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it has 'Poor Zombies Poor': Carnivorous Carcasses Waiting for Victims Before jumping out of the hiding place to start a weak attack, which requires almost no effort. Known for lurking behind the door for hours to wait for someone to open 'Poor zombies hidden' sometimes hiding behind a low wall or sitting in a church that stands as a member of the community. <br /> <br /> This bad thing will get 1/10 for me, but In celebrating Jerry Angell's continuous lock, I will increase my rank to 2/10.
