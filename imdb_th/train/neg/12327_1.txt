The previous reviewer said that the movie isn't a bad thing, anything?!?!?! This film is an honor to hurt children. Oh, but Sylvia Christel naked in there. So 5 stars out of 10 stars. Why not 10? Because the movie work is "Pain", the nature of the shock of the child is "unrealistic" and the fat friend is "frustrated". The reviewer does not show any offense that American movies in the year. Fri, 1981, with images of children who have sex with mature women I accidentally watched this movie while in a hotel with a showtime. For me, even if the fat friends have made a storm and deserve an Academy Award, I still have to give this movie only 1 star. Howard Hessman of that TV is shown in the movie at the same time as he appeared in WKRP. extremly But don't use my word for it!
