Spoiler: A group of people with aggressive behavior and family encounters Script them to say and do things that people never do, at least anyone is appropriate. The hero falls in love with the woman he sees when his partner at the bookstore on the day of meeting, unaware that she will appear as his brother's girlfriend at the gathering. He tried to postpone the claim of her brother. But she knew that our hero had clearly fallen in love with her, provoking him mercilessly by wearing stretchy sexy clothes. At one point, she took off her clothes and bathed with him. He tried to close his eyes. His heart cracked She thought it was funny until she suddenly decided that she didn't want a brother and left the group. <br /> <br /> This movie really dragged viewers, coughing and restless through the long haul. Writing is not smart and unbelievable. We almost walked out. But always thought there was something going on that would make things more interesting, but nooooo all the lovely comments had to be written by shills that paid out to the poor lure like me who saw shit like this Compared to Little Miss Sunshine ??? Jeez, the disgrace of them, writers, actors, producers and theaters that let this terrible thing come to the screen!
