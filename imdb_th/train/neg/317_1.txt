HAS is the worst movie I've ever tried in the first 15 minutes. Nothing will make me interested in this movie. I went to relax during that time and had plenty of time to devote to movies that were fun. The condo we stayed in had this movie in stock - they had to get it from the store for $ 1 or something. <br /> <br /> If you like Adam Sandler, this is not another thing he did This started with bad evidence and worse than before. Nothing funny, even in the distance. <br /> <br /> I've watched many movies, including some stories that I didn't care about. But if you decide to waste time on this movie, don't say I didn't warn you.
