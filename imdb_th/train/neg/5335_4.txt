It's been a long time since I saw this comedy and I forgot how stupid it was. I will put it in two of Elvis Presley's worst two films. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, a half-breed Indian bull riding who returns home in Arizona and a broken cottage that his family lives in. His parents played by Burgess Meredith and KT Jurado and his old Indian grandfather was Thomas Gomez. There is nothing in the three proposals that are funny or otherwise. The government invested in the family livestock. But they lack cows Elvis sang a few worthless songs and was pursued by a madman and her mother. This is just a real collision of disorientation and a dilapidated environment in practice, with the smell of manure and does not make this easier. However, one thing that makes me confused is that Elvis seems to have a good time in the movie. It is hard to believe when considering that he was very upset about being stuck with a large number of moderate movies.
