This time, the hero from the first film became a human, and this time, using fists and feet combos with the best universal soldiers and computers that went far and prepared to rule the world I'm pretty sure it's a Double Team, which makes everyone believe that Jean-Claude Van Damme is no longer reliable in showing action-based flicks. However, this is something that tarnished his credibility forever, while Universal Soldier: The return is not boring like Double Team or The Quest. star The sequel to this story was created for children who like professional wrestling. When I look back, even the action scenes are not so exciting, so this movie is worthless. In other words, the clunker in Van Damme's assembly <br /> <br /> * from 4 (not good)
