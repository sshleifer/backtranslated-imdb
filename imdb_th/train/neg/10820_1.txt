What is Franco Zeffirelli thinking? Hollywood is responsible for this imitation, or will I feel comfortable with the idea that people who do not speak English in the first language just miss the classic point of Charlotte Bronte? I do not think I can improve the comments I read below, so I will paraphrase it: "Jane Eyre is a very good book. The writer should read it sometimes." To tragic mistakes Unfortunately, the actors because the script writers left all the best scenes A dialog box that lets you understand Jane and Rochester, having a meeting of minds and sharing fun ... removed from the script. Marriage proposal, fortune teller ... and half-wheeled congratulations, feeling sincere towards Jane as a fairy goddess from Old England. Help Rochester in despair ... Get rid of <br /> <br / > Unfortunately, Safe Ferrelli felt the need to rewrite all At the end of the novel and Jane's interaction with the river family But could not forgive him by removing love from one of the best love stories ever written. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favorite and go find a mini-series. 1983 (?) With Timothy Dalton
