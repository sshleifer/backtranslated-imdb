La Sanguisuga Conduce la Danza or The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance because I believe it is a common English name, located at 'Ireland' in '1902' at the Count Richard Marnack Mystery (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart). Evelyn's work (Patrizia Webley, while Patrizia De Rossi) and her other three friends will soon leave fellow actors working Cora (Krista Nell), Penny (Lidia Olizzi) and Rosalind (Marzia Damon as Caterina Chiani). His castle is located on a small island off the coast. At first Evelyn hesitated. But was persuaded when Leo Valeriano fell on the stage as well. When Count Marnack told his guests that both his father and grandfather had cut their wife's unfaithful head with a knife & ceremony Feeling uneasy when Evelyn appears to be the exact opposite of the current Count's wife who has not escaped too long ago ... In addition to having to worry about strange servants, it turns out that people want to use it. Cut the head off ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was written and directed by Alfredo Rizzo & is a complete sum & send shit from start to finish. The first thing, first, start to criticize the name The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance. Check that topic because when I do, I feel quite cheated that there are no vampires or blood sucking in any form. Anytime, anywhere & of course, don't dance or dance, so don't expect these things. What you should expect to be 'giallo' boring and boring and pointless, which takes more than an hour before anyone is killed and the mystery of any murder begins in the first hour. Of La Sanguisuga Conduce la Danza & not interested in what's going out there The best way to imagine it is to think of the porn movie. The most boring softcore you've ever seen, then cut out most softcore porn movies, and that makes the actors not. Good dubbing, bad conversation Of soft and lesbian sex and nothing else Yes, it's really bad. The element of mystery is nonsense. People do unreasonable things without clear reasons and the end of 'too complicated' twisting is not as good as the other. The Sixth Sense (1999) This isn't! <br /> <br /> Director Rozzi works well & La Sanguisga Conduce la Danza actually has a good look and feel, despite the obvious low budget, I mean there is a scene that he showed. Saw that the 'storm' raged outside the black and white castle! So the movie will jump from bright colors to black and white whenever it intersects with the storm and comes back to color again! There is one very hilarious scene that the maid and her friend discuss the breasts and she let her friends feel that they are full of compliments. This scene is very funny & very strange, so there is no porno fee 70 that doesn't. Well, will be negotiated by embarrassing! With the slightest nudity & sex / lesbian scenes that are very tame Forget about blood or blood because there are no separate heads. <br /> <br /> Technically, this movie is quite good, scene design and production are impressive, even though it's not that big. The work is efficient enough. This film has a good sense of color & filming is good. This film has been dubbed as difficult to comment on traditional performances. But the voice actors are terrible and the dialogue is worse than usual. <br /> <br /> La Seung Guadalajara Danza is a terrible movie. There is no feeling. It has no story for over an hour. It may be the most misleading name ever. & Is really boring and boring, with the 'twisted' ending that is silly, confusing. As far as Euro horror fans have a lot better movies, please don't waste your time on others. This is something to avoid. Note: Trivia: (& Prohibited in the United Kingdom) Nazi exploitation / horror horror films of SS Last Days (1977) AKA SS & The Beast in Heat directed by Luigi Batzella and he has a role Quite a lot as Police detective in La Sanguisuga Conduce la Danza
