Comedy Central has succeeded in writing original programs using professional cartoons, Chapelle's performances, Mencia's minds, The Daily Show and Colbert Report, which have been very popular with both professional and comic stars. Show is a solid program because Sarah Silverman is one of the best women cartoons in the business. I expect to get good things when I follow the progress. <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed. <br /> <br /> There is something gentle, funny sequence, but because the star is Silverman's ability, the performance should be much better. It's just a pilot and hope that the next week's performance will be better. If not getting help from her in the form of a better writer for acting
