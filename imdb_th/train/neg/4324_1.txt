The fool Griswalds won the game show T.V. "The Pig Award" and all flew together in Europe, where they managed to cause a foolish disaster after one more time. In the turbulent and worthless sequels, this money can dance a lot. The 1983 film Harold Ramis is a lower-than-average misunderstanding that an inappropriate family has traveled to the horrific "holiday" in America. At this time, Amy Heckerling ("Look Who's Talking") is Who controls what becomes a "comedy" disaster that will bother you more than make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Hughes script (with Rob Klane) is scary and you wonder why Like of Chevy Chase and Beverly. D'Angelo cares about projects that do not exist. Like Anthony Michael Hall and emoji China with Coca sense to reject the offer. Even though every authority, Michael Palin was unable to raise the level of action that anyone could call entertainment. <br /> <br /> Still, I can't think of "European Vacation". Successfully enough to guarantee a second sequel! Of course, it can't stand like this. You know, I haven't seen the national Lamphun list that is worth the annoyance. <br /> <br /> Monday, December 26, 1994 - T.
