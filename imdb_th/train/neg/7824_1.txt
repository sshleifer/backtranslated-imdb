I watched movies last night and I want to like it a lot. My expectation for this film is increasing since I heard that it was being created. Some days I see something exciting and some days I feel disappointed. <br /> <br /> But I am my girlfriend. I have high hopes for this movie. But in the end I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> While I love Richard Donner's movies, I don't like their nature sometimes or the changes they make to the characters of Superman and the power of He <br /> <br /> singer, but chose to The worst element of the Donner movie and put it in his version. <br /> <br /> While Lex Luthor is slightly darker, he still has nothing more than a shit. cheat He's not smarter than when Gene Hackman plays with him. Kevin Spacey tries to play Luthor for the best, but eventually he is the victim of low writing and extraordinary conversations. <br /> <br /> His followers are more dimensional. double Indeed, most of them do not have dialogue in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** The spoiler in front **** Kitty Skies is almost the same character as the character of Tesma She appears to be evil and cold, like Lex Luthor, but she proves to be the only supporter after seeing Superman in trouble and betraying Luthor. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment in the movie is Perry White. I'm not a big fan of Perry White in Donner's movie, but at least he has a soul. After that, he spoke and made an experienced journalist who cares about truth and good stories. Langella's Perry is nothing but a stooge of the company. He wants everyone to focus on stories that are related to Superman because they sell documents, even though other papers do the same thing. He doesn't really care about the story. The real mystery, like the power outage and the things that Lex Luthor has now left his prison. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Langella is that he's a fool! Some actors may be quiet and discreet and still have low waves that let you know that the water is still deep. Frank Langella is a pool. <br /> <br /> Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. Once there are no memorable lines in the entire movie. Not the actor's fault His movements are intended to look elegant, as well as the slight movement of his fingers that affects the way he flies. But it still looks like a choreography and self-fabrication. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane, while not writing well, Kate Bosworth performed surprisingly well. Unfortunately again for the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and writer, she is very knowledgeable as a teenager in Dawson's Creek. <br /> <br /> James Marsden is my favorite actor in this movie. Because he looks like Superman is even more than Routh. Without any superpower, he was able to find the message of Lois Lane, fly the plane to Luthor's yacht pick-up location and help Lois and her son <br /> <br /> The only moving moment in the movie is when they All attached pantry is flooded with water and the boat is sinking. You see them gradually being immersed in water. You know that Superman is about to arrive at the last minute to save their lives. But you can't help but feel sorry for them. <br /> <br /> As I said before, the plan is very haphazard. Which is different from the singer who says that this is not a movie about a superhero coming back and trying to find his place in the world As soon as he returned, the world welcomed him back with open arms. Lois is the only one who is not happy to see him return. Even Luther is happy to get Superman back because it gives him the opportunity to adjust the score with the Iron Man. <br /> <br /> Superman shows that it may be one of the boring heroes. The most in the universe A large green meteorite was stolen from the Lex Luthor Museum from the prison. He now has the knowledge of Superman's power and weakness, and he is unable to connect enough points to hole. That Luther <br /> <br /> From this movie, the only thing Superman is good for lifting is really heavy. The whole sequence of operations is incredibly predictable.
