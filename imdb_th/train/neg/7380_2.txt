What I have seen makes his video broadcast directly in the past few years, it seems that his popularity in the early 90s is comparable. > <br /> The secret biological lab is creating new drugs that jack up. The human adrenaline system, to the point that they become psychopaths or something. Seagal should stop the infection or the end of the world ... or something. Seagal must meet every team like Jellybeans. The time I was looking for him to order a new face, so it was difficult to follow the character's development and I knew Steven's athsma prevented him from shouting at the lungs. Was he dubbed by the people who sounded like he couldn't? Usually plotting movies and action scenes can help it not waste time. But it wasn't close As I said, it was a horror movie that had a lot of blood and stabbed legs rather than straight. The problem is that it's not really scary and Seagal looks out of the place completely because the infected person should have the speed of light movement. But Seagal, 40 years old, 280 pounds killed them all with bare hands? I guess the lonely highlight of the movie is the first 20 minutes that the new member asks Seagal to come to the strip club with them. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
