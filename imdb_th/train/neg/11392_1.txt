For many years I remember reading about "Trouble With Tracy" on Guide TV CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6 am! I spent two hours driving north of Toronto and we couldn't get the CFTO but you know what it is - we always want something we don't have. <br /> <br /> Well, I know that I am What Want and what I want is to see that "What is the problem with Tracy" about this? Is there a beautiful girl in the role of an actor? Have nude pictures? Is there any suspense? Is it funny? Would be good if there was a promotion. At least I know where I'm missing but not! The mystery made me mad until the CTV CKCO alliance created a new transmitter in Wiarton, Ontario and began broadcasting "Trouble With Tracy" at the same time as CFTO .... Saturday morning at 6 am !! One Saturday morning, I woke up and turned on the TV at 5:59 and I finally saw that "Trouble with Tracy" What is it? "Trouble With Tracy" is that it is the content of Canada and is stuck in an unhealthy spot, so no one has ever seen how bad it is. Showing a talented Canadian, Steve Weston died a few years later, but many argued that he "died" effectively the first time he appeared on this program. When I saw it for the first time on the Saturday evening and felt discouraged back to my bed, one of my parts died.
