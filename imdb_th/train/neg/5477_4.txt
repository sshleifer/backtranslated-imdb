Bring the sciFi original movie together in alternative history / new updates and you'll get the "Aztec Rex". Clearly, Hernan Cortes, before conquering the Aztec empire, must conquer Tyrannosaurus Rex and her spouse first That is the driving force of this movie. When seeing the plot, it might really suck; The fact that it's just the type of suction is the tip of the hat to the writer. Have a little problem For the start, Cortes was played by Ian Ziering, although with a black wig, but Ziering as Cortes still has the same confidence as Axl Rose played at Gandhi. Mexico's Aztecs here seem to be played by all Hawaiian bands. Separation from each other, the T-Rex looks fairly good, but every time they are shot, they just release the CGI and they die too easily. I think if the T-Rex lives in real life, they May be overthrown or at least injured by basic weapons in the 16th century, but it took some things out of the movie There is also a graphic scene of the T-Rex swallowing people, which is surprising. But in this context, I think they work well. There are many action scenes and colonial angles all over. But did not make the dinosaur angle different from the latest SciFi Original dinosaur movie "Warbird". (But suitable for standard sciFi original) 4 movies that give a moderate rating
