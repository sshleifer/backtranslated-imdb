It has been pointed out in a post that is now deleted from other IMDb users that anyone who may see "The Medusa Touch" should be warned about the scene reminiscent of the terrorist attack on that day. September 11, 2001 in New York, but I hope everyone who reads this message will consider this warning. Despite the interesting pedigree (producer Elliott Kastner, producer "Harper" and "The Long Goodbye"; Producer Arnon Milchan joined the filmmaker who was nominated for the "LA Confidential" Academy Award and the screenplay. I met the actor "The Medusa Touch" for the unintentional riot. It's a terrible director, writing and making a messy story. It's trying to take advantage of the telekinetic 70s thrilling genre. Many failed movies, please consider underrated "Carrie" and "The Fury" (both directed by Brian DePalma). He was both excited and excited about the two stories related to the same story.
