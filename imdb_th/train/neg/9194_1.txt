First of all, I'm an avid zombie movie fan. I love all Romero flicks and enjoy creating Dawn of the Dead again. So when I hear all the critics around this movie, I'm still optimistic. I mean, critics hate Resident Evil, and while it may not be a particularly wonderful movie, I enjoy it, if not because of the fact that it's just a fun zombie shooting game. However, this is truly ridiculous. Poor dialogue, half-way plot and video game scenes inserted into the movie. Anyone in the right mind thinks it is a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use loose words) My favorite is Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name threw the initiative out of the window, you can see in his performance that he knew he was in Scary movies and he might do the best. Others act like they are doing Shakespeare. And i may add In general, the only reason everyone should see this cruelty is if you are a) a big zombie buff and must see every zombie doing or b) like playing MST3K in home games, watching with friends and preparing for Unintended laughter <br /> <br />
