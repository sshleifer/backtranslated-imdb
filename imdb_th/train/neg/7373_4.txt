I don't know if the rest of you will watch Steven Seagal's movie, but I watch them because as stupidly as they can at least laugh. Why do you rate this movie 1 in 10 from making copies when that is what makes this movie a cult favorite that you can laugh in madness? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Attack Force is not a great movie. But I felt that it was worth it to Steven Seagal's vehicles as well as his other movies. In fact, I didn't think it was one of his worst things by shooting long distances. For the most part, it is a half-linked plot and is mostly exciting as the basis. The ending really sucks. But even then there was a fun element that was worthless In the end, the story itself didn't deliver what was promised, but I actually thought of acting like (If I may use the big words) and the rest of the production delivers what Steven Seagal fans actually expect, especially Seagal is the ridiculous person we have to expect and the rest of the actors back him. Well, without showing any comments at all. People. This is what Steven Seagal movies do. Deal or better: laugh at <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
