How did the audience react to the new "adaptation" of Shirley Jackson's book, which was promoted when it was not a newly created 1963 movie (actually enough)? This: Those who are big fans of The original book or movie will not think much about this ... and those who have never been touched as well, and those who are big fans of Hollywood's popularity towards "Special effects" is the first and last word on this subject. "The movie is to love it. <br /> <br /> What I don't like about this modification: <br /> <br /> 1 It's not. The real modification of the book From the articles I read, this movie should cover other content in the book that the first person never joined. And that seems reasonable. There are no movies that can cover the word for the word unless it is the length of the STAND! (And still not at that time) but there is something in this movie that has never been mentioned or implied in the movie Remind me of how they decided to kill the black man in the original version of THE SHINING. I don't like it as well What the press release of the SHOULD movie says is ... "We have received the basic idea from Shirley Jackson's book. We still keep the original name of the house and the names of many leading characters. (But not all) but after that We decided to write our own stories and what the heck we watched the changes and shining and ghosts for the first time and decided to throw them as well. "<br /> <br /> 2 They lost the theme. Of the neuroscientists, by meticulously inviting the visiting guests, all of whom used to have a brush with their past paranormal to check the house that seemed to be "Born bad". No, this "doctor" took everyone to the house under the wrong pretense of education. "Sleeplessness" (he invited them there to make them scared to death) How they reacted to their fears ... which he mentioned never told them that they were part of the test ... good people) this doctor who has no same name is different from the professional Dedicated to the original movie at the time Bode return date <br /> <br /> 3 directly contradicts the statement that was used to promote the film. "Some houses have just been bad." This house was not born well. But quite bad because of what happened there ... and this time, Neil unraveled the mystery (the shadow of change). The only problem is the mystery that is said to be incoherent, I'm sure it's still Probably a mystery for most viewers ... but then there is no mystery at first (Not in the book) because the house is not good to start with as the "victim", the first person to die before watching. <br /> <br /> 4 ways that Luke's personality shows is ridiculous. complete He should be a playboy, one day to inherit the house. (And it's a real skeptic "History") ... and this time he is just a wine that doesn't sound good, can't sleep (remember that he can't sleep) and is a liar that must be done. <br /> <br /> 5 I was annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to create a verbatim scene. (The scene with Nel's sister's family and Dudley's small opening speech ...) to go out into the imaginary flight that made me think these other movies are more than THE HAUNTING. It's like it. Can't decide what to do. <br /> <br /> 6 I miss Nel's storytelling throughout the story. The original is like a Gothic novel in the way that most stories tell in the first person through Nel's eyes and we are always in her secret. Completely unique touch is missing in the new version. They also tried to create more heroines. Nel was originally not a bad person But she is a bitter person (Can you sacrifice her 11-year life with a selfish old woman and a poor sister?) And she likes to groan and upset .. This is almost too good to be true. This is no clearer than the important point of the film that the writer had watched GHOST too many times. <br /> <br /> 7 They changed the history of the house and it had too many occupiers. No Abigail Crane (Hugh's daughter with many legends in the original version) has no "companions" and no nursery. There is no "grace" (wife of a traditional doctor) and Hugh Crane's wife dies in a different way. stark These changes changed the story too much. I don't know if this film producer should be happy. Shirley Jackson doesn't walk on this world anymore or they should ... be sorry (if you get my drift !!! The haunt that you can imagine is not a playful thing too !!!) <br /> <br /> In summary, I would like to leave you with some words from the original look (instead of "home" for "movies". That's right): "This 'movie' should be burnt to the ground and the ground is sprinkled with salt! "My favorite movie of all time is still like that. No competition from this list
