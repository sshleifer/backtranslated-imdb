Performing other reviews, however, did very well. Brad Pitt dealt with the annoying and disgusting Austrian climbers. Other performances are also available. The story may be sensational, but it misses - one never understands or cares for the characters shown and therefore the story Which may have been quite dramatic, unable to attract this audience. <br /> <br /> Beautiful scenery and amazing real-life movies. The world in which we live - but I did not try as I might have involved themselves in this regard. As a fan, Pitt was undaunted. (I consider him one of the 5 most recent actors of his generation) I expect to * love * this flick - and it makes me cool. <br /> <br /> Failure within me. But I always point to the creative end of this film - the direction of writing a screenplay, production, editing - somehow they make me lose. It's a shame because it's great. <br /> <br /> Great performances, amazing stories, beautiful filming - it should be very beautiful. It's not worth it to watch. You yourself - but don't expect too much and maybe you won't be disappointed as I am. Most of it is boring to me.
