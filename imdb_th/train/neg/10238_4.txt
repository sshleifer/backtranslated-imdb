This movie looks as though it may be a good starting point. But never guess The director is talented and has a good camera angle and artistic ideas. (As typical of the Asian director) but not knowing how to create or tell a good story The story is scattered and seems to go out in different directions throughout the movie. In general, the movie will not match the description of the press release. However, the performance was very good. All the actors give good performances and Jude Law is outstanding while he is always there. It's terrible that he chose to make a weak movie.
