To Richard, I know that we all love you in home improvement with Tim Allen. But seriously, do you have anything to do besides Air Bud's sequel? I think Tim may give you some roles now or even be his personal assistant. I know it looks ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Everyone will see you around Tim. You will get a role with Bob Vila more often, but you come back for 10 minutes with Golden Retriever and smile. That there are not many scripts But you can add I mean come Tim owes you one person. <br /> <br /> But actually this movie didn't do anything with Airbud. On the other hand, fake talking puppies have a wider angle than seeing a sport dog. Better original And Richard Gan, you know more than anyone. <br /> <br /> This is the movie "F"
