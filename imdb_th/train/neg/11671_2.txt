I must say it's a foul! (I give 2 points) <br /> <br /> Look only when you are insomnia. <br /> <br /> There are many chewing scenes and interruptions. This movie. No doubt, not revealing the shocking secret that is not a threat to the well-being of the heroine. A few conflicts, a slight increase in noise - it's quite beautiful. The secret is anything that cannot happen to anyone - the last "secret" revealed in this movie can be entirely predictable.

You can assemble the remaining parts together. <br /> <br /> Even the scene with a mysterious man threatening our heroine doesn't step to the point where you are afraid of her safety more than two or two. second Why is he still hanging for many years after Cassandra's death is a good question? <br /> <br /> There is also a question about the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant, honest butler. That seems to do everything - cooking, cleaning, serving food, answering the door, etc. everything except the door lock clearly - because that's the only explanation for <br /> <br /> There is nothing that will make you hold your chair's arm and lean forward on the edge of your seat because there is no "hold" tension. In this movie - just a revelatory, revealing, pathetic that is thrown out occasionally. <br /> <br />
