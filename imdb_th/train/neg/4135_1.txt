This movie is terrible. I have to fast forward a lot to get good stuff. Haha. What a bit good? The only bit worthwhile is the ending. (People who used to watch this movie will know what I mean.) I expect a lot from this movie, like Hell, to find the dawn of death. Meet Freddy vs. Jason. The story is a forgotten thing. The actors are used very badly and the director is thinking when he does this. This may be a good thing. But I turned out to be the most boring movie I've ever watched. OK, so what happens if there are some T and A? I went after being stabbed with blood and I was bitterly disappointed. Don't expect this movie to be good. But if you want a bad horror movie, take a look and see if the horror movie shouldn't be done at all.
