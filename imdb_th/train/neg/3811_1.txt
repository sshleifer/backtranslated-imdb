I hate this shit every Friday, which is part of the tgif that is open and constantly sucking big with stupidity every week. If you want to see something funny, see "Don't want to say", starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage. It's a really funny story, showing why no one is doing an actor's career well after doing a television program. This show makes me feel bad. I hate those kids and Bob Sachet has to jump off the bridge to do this nonsense. I've seen something fun everywhere, but here I write 10 lines! Watch 'Full House' to see the least humanity available in art and entertainment.
