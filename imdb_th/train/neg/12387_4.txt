Lipstick is another failure of glossy films. I try to think of one good thing that I can say about movies and I have trouble finding something. I guess the red dress at Margaux Hemingway is worn at the end of the movie It's the best part. Writing and scripting is not the worst thing I've ever encountered. But it is much better The lipstick looks very comfortable. This set is very shiny and looks good. The actors are ok. I feel like the character of Anne Bancroft is the only possible character in this movie. It's a sad story that Chris Sarandon lost time with this story.
