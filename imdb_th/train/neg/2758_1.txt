I give this story 1 because there are no negative numbers in the IMDb rating system. This movie is awesome. It is a very bad act. The story is written badly. The action is unbelievable. I suspect that even though Salvation Army will not fight as well as the troops do in this movie. I didn't even write a spoiler plot because this movie was not good enough for the plot spoiler. In writing comments about the story is useless. If I compare this movie, I have to compare it with the Reign of Fire. However, even though I don't like Reign of Fire as well, that movie is at least better than this. <br /> <br /> Some people in the theater go out first. Which the movie will finish half way The only reason I'm not is because I don't think I will do it. I hope to get a CGI feast and fight expertly. But that's not what happened. The martial arts take a total of 30 seconds, and that comes from the exercise routines that were made during the previous scenes, which is very disappointing. CGI is not well done as well. Think of one scene During one of the previous tank battles, the soldiers were shooting at ...... There was nothing. Some people forgot to refer to the animations in that movie, so the road was so bad. all I still think that the voice of the bad guy is voiced by Imotep from the movie The Mummy. There is the same thing that resonates with the resonant sounds that occur. (Someone owes royalty here?) Since I talked about the fight scene, I would say yes that could be considered a spoiler. But for the teacher, I think <br /> <br /> don't go to see it. Don't buy a DVD when it comes out. You have been warned
