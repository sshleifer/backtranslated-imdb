What a crappy thing! Worst of the worst! This movie provides entertainment like bullets. Plot that has no ability. What a stupid plot. Who wrote this script! Ever had a script for a stupid movie or director, just accidentally pressing the record button on his camera and deciding to create a movie when they went together? This means being a movie for children or funny or anything. My brother is in 6th grade and he and his classmates have just made an amateur movie for their school project which is superior to this lovely movie .. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. No excuse for this flick!
