This movie is terrible. CGI is CGI. Drops of gray are very cheap. The crocodile looks like a large gray stain. The worst is that there is no effort to make it walk or it seems that it is still alive. Most of them are CGIs that are shot in various scenes and you almost expect to see CGI moving hands smudging on the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects I have ever seen, and I have seen terrible Sci-Fi Channel movies. <br /> <br /> In addition to the lack of effects Special Consists of general budget actors who may serve as waiters / waiters at local restaurants while they wait for their big break. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this film is when the villain tries to rape the sexes. Kate and the giant crocodile jump from the water to the second floor of the villain's headquarters and pass through the balcony and pull the bad guys away. Kate and instead of bumping into the building (and crushing Kate) Croc then flew back to the same corner in the water. The laws of physics cannot be used with this movie or special techniques. At least there is honor among the crocodiles.
