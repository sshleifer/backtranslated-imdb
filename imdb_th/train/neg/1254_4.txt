I've seen and liked the original movie and expect from more remake. <br /> <br /> Well: the effects and make-up are good. There are no complaints about scores and pictures. They are adequate and the performance is ok. (Tim Roth is great. Other executives are good. The action scenes are exciting and fun. <br /> <br /> Bad: Escape from the monkey town is terrible. The characters are in the circle and suddenly there are some places in the city center that have escape tunnels. In addition, any escape route leads to everyone's bedroom. <br /> <br /> The story is cut down to include as much action as possible. I like action scenes But the original movie has more texture and deserves more respect. <br /> <br /> Finally, the ending is completely ridiculous as presented. There is no reasoning. <br /> <br /> Without seeing the inevitable sequel
