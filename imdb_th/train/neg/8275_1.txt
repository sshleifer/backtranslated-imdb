(First of all my English apology is not good) Of course there are only movies starring Jessica Simpson that can only include serious goofs like this .. I am a Norwegian and I feel offended and shocked the creators. This film doesn't take time. Research on American filmmaking / Norwegian. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when talking about facts about this country. <br /> <br /> So I posted a revision from my dissatisfaction: - This country is called Norway, not Norway - "Da" is Russian, not Norwegian. - Norwegian priests have never used those black covers with white paper on the neck because Protestant churches are distinguished by far - it is true that A traditional folk costumes. (Which we use only twice a year) The movie is like a German dress - I don't understand "Norwegian", which is called in this movie .. Jessica doesn't feel anything .. "Norwegian priest" No one. Can understand. <br /> <br /> The only thing I remember is the Norwegian flag (and the Viking hat, but it's a model that people think about Norway - Viking!: Oh) <br /> <br /> Well .. I guess the person who created this movie will not In this comment But at least I cleared some things and got rid of some irritability ..! <br /> <br /> I'm proud of my country and I will love if people in America have less wrong attitude. And more accurate When they talk about this country <br /> <br /> That's all .. Lenge leve Norge!; P
