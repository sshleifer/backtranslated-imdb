In other good checks loleralacartelort7890 said, "The truth is that Americans use aluminum alloys to prevent radiation. Secrets are not well known and the exact specifications are secret and why it is a secret: why do they have to reveal it in At that time, if they were in a space race with Russia, it would be very stupid to reveal that they had new technology that could prevent the crew from "This is not completely accurate. There is (and) no" secret "to prevent radiation. In Apollo, the design and construction of the Apollo Command Module is open to the public for a long time. It uses a lightweight" honeycomb "of Aluminum and stainless steel All outer surfaces (Except for the course window) is covered with a heat protection sheet made of phenolic resin which is thicker below which is facing forward during the entry-exit of these materials. Actually * better * To stop the radiation that we have in space (Charged particles) rather than lead, which is suitable for stopping the ionization photons such as X-rays and gamma rays. <br /> <br /> Space radiation is a clear problem for long-term space flight due to Risk of large solar flares But it was not a serious threat to Apollo astronauts The command module provides reasonably good protection over a short period of time (1/2 hour or more) through the Van Allen belt. All of them have dosages to let us know how much radiation they receive: no more than 1.5 rem and often less than 24 men flying to the moon (12 people landing) 18 people still alive There are only two people who died of cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died from a heart attack, pancreatitis (Ruza) and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). Is a very good record for men now in the late 70s (Shepard will be 86)
