... badly deliberately ... <br /> <br /> This small gem was shot into the big screen MST3k, while clearly the movie didn't try hard. (Hopefully it's their goal. However ...) This movie is still not good. Hell, it makes the Leprechaun in space look big, budget ... <br /> <br /> In the short term: paint a muscle car. My color!
