When I popped in Happy Birthday to me for the first time, I checked the timer to see how long this film was. I was amazed at the length. Both movies, animations and horror films have a common basis: the attention span of the selected audience and should be at or about 90 minutes. Moreover, you will lose a lot of viewers. <br /> < br /> This is 110 minutes or 20 minutes ago. It's a big problem for me. I want to say that half of this movie has been cut. But I was too kind to say Go ahead and watch and tell me that there are many scenes that can be solved even if it is a movie It takes time to try to be a great mystery that "the elite 10" is killing the remaining friends. Most of them are not only But do too much But they zoomed in on the face and said "It's this guy! Not! It is this girl! "You will spend more time with cameras that make you misunderstand more than enjoying movies. And don't let me start acting. <br /> <br /> Okay, I started. I had to laugh at first, trying to remember if Melissa Anderson played a blind character in a small house in the grass field. (Later, the research proved my suspicions were correct) because throughout this film, she looked truly blind. She should be the best in the group. But turned out to be the worst thing. Other staff, apart from Ann (Bregman), were also very bad. But she took a cake happily Slowly and more quickly, there is a revelation about Virginia (Anderson), the main character, the former and her psychologist, which is a bit more personal (and on call 24/7 / obviously). Big shrink While the death toll has increased, <br /> <br /> The funny thing is like "The disappearance", the first "best eye" that disappeared. Of course, they gave a few seconds to say "Wow (that person) will not escape" etc. But then they return to Their sexual path And speaking which may be due to a horrible script or maybe because I lost interest in the 30th minute but it was really hard to track who likes who in the group because everyone seems to be a sexual partner The next person or someone may be worried about MAX by other friends and best friends in the next scene. See: creepy men who keep mice / mice in their pockets ?? Truly ?? And is the most obvious suspect I gave too much movie credits (and time) but he became part of the "Top 10". I will never know. <br /> <br /> But I talked about something mysterious here. Why do these children have a goal? Why did Virginia think that she had killed someone when he had never proven? (Until the end) that someone really was killed and why the sample and the poster claimed that these murders were "The six most strange murders you have ever seen." Even 1981, most of these movies are shown in the first two films on Friday the 13th? By chance, on Friday the 13th, Part 2 was released 2 weeks to my happy birthday. Maybe they're talking about when they filmed several months earlier. <br /> <br /> When there is a "secret" revelation, trust me, you will have to fill the secret 3-4x to get ridiculous and incoherent motives and from Then put the subtitles to get the words of the victim's killer Even if you get it for the first time, it's an outrageous and hilarious final scene. It's almost worth watching the whole movie again. But it's a drinking game. <br /> <br /> This birthday collection should be avoided. Is it a scary and unreasonable first draft script? Please keep in mind that rewriting has to be used many times before the role of the camera. It has either a way of acting or acting that is beyond the truth and 100% unrealistic. 10-11 years old. I like horror movies. (Still doing oddly, clear happiness is wrong But they became more difficult and difficult to watch for many years.) We received our first VCR and I recorded many horror films from the network. All I remember from Happy Birthday to Me was getting the last 10 minutes of tape that scared me to death. ?? And clearly gave the mystery to the murderer Although I can see other clips of this movie, I think this is the first time I've watched in full length. Fortunately, this horrible movie didn't make me a child. Now I'm old and I can use this garbage. But never again. <br /> <br /> Note 2: That said "Happy Birthday to Me" that is crazy playing in the ending credits. (And the overall score) still makes me very surprised I guess this movie (Or a few minutes ago) has influenced my childhood Make you shameful. Melissa Sue Anderson!
