This film deserves bad reviews again. Consider a critic who praises the virtues of the film, including 'No sex, violence or blood.' The setting of this film makes us look as Cody's young comrades with the love of life, and those who have everything to live to blown away the debris from Cody holding his bloodless corpse. And with the nature of the war, we know that Cody has seen horror almost every day. Very much for those who watch this movie with a rose-violent glasses that sets Cody's personality removed from the audience's memory. <br /> <br /> Sans, his own Cody family, like John Rambo, travels across the country. On his bike Long distance travel to the homeland of the United States in some places called Nevada City Not to mention, there is no realization of the fact that Cody is a damaged product. We know this because his CO announces him so true, as he instructs Cody to 'rest' from the death and destruction of the war.

He believes that marriage will depend on compromise and the two never discuss marriage plans. There are no wicked people here. <br /> <br /> Asner is an actor who has received conversations like 'We love your son ....' 'You are part of our family.' After they met a stranger named Cody and the words 'band of brothers' that the phrase could not be anything else. Intended to be used with strangers outside the battlefield. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: This movie is a fluffy Christmas candy that betrays itself in an important way. Not respecting the faith of By beating her body that she knew what she was saying it. By defining a new family while we know that we need to use wisdom: accept strangers as members of a full-fledged family, because we all 'love you'.
