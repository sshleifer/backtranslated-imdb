Not just that it's a bad movie, not just the four best Mexican filmmakers in this movie. And not just that the script is terrible It's just that ... This movie sucks ... This big time is losing money in a very bad chapter. It should be criticized about Mexican society. But we are bored with this type of movie Bad language should be funny? I do not understand Mexican cinema is a big problem if this type of movie continues to play. (And was written and produced) <br /> <br /> Please don't think that this type of movie has been well received in Mexico. They and they do not reflect us.
