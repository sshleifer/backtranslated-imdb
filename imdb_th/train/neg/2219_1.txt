Perhaps one of the most terrifying classics called the classic horror that has been done. Halloween presents Michael Myers, who is memorable and a great performance from Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> < br /> There is a time that can not be forgiven for the stupidity / extremeness of real events. <br /> <br /> This is a type of movie that you can walk away from popcorn, microwave and not. Miss anything. <br /> I won't understand anymore. <br /> <br /> Thank God, Rob Zombie, who created this thing. And in general I hate remakes. <br /> <br /> Of course, he will compensate for the mistake of filling all the random spaces with strange points of interest that the original lacks. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that we feel we have to like as we teach that we should enjoy Dickens. <br /> <br /> Don't consider this a classic movie.
