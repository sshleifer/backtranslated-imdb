They created this like a fantasy from the Man Snow River. Meet Butch Cassidy and Sundance children and to experience the romantic Ned, and Joe plays with high-level talent, a weary wife of a wealthy old man. OK, there are many stories about Ned Kelly. But there are many recorded facts But still has space for artistic creativity in producing good historical drama I mean, this is not a Robin Hood story, not a legend. Arthur is not Beowulf, not someone who has a life covered with fog of fog over the centuries that resting in their lives and times. Is 99% only a couple of times ago My grandparents were old, when Ned was hanged. <br /> <br /> It made me dazed because I imagined that this movie was a serious attempt to tell Kelly's story recently. Peter Carey's best novel, "The True History of the Kelly Gang". Recently, I had hoped that it would be the same. But not the truth is Kelly, who was very ridiculed in the 1970s. Kelly may be closer to the reality and the better overall movie that doesn't say much for this. <br /> < br>> Two bucks to hire a DVD! I will give 3/10 and that's just because the beautiful pictures of the Australian bushes make me feel generous.
