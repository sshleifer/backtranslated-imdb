This film claims to be a study of distortion characteristics. Some critics have been speculated that because of the distortion of the image, this film has a mental depth. In fact, considering the material that is dirty, it is boring and surprisingly shallow without stimulants. Why is the main character the way she is? You will not discover from the script. For keeping the same theme better (And more entertaining movies) Try Bunuel's Belle de Jour
