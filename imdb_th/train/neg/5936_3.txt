This film is a disaster from beginning to end. Interspersed with performances from "Beautiful Next Generation Losers" is an interview with Bono and The Edge as well as the actors themselves. This made little time for Leonard Cohen's clip, who built the tower for others in this film, with an intelligent presence and gentle humor. Which is too busy trying to make him a Saint Leonard or a prophet in the Old Testament Many performances are memorable interpretations. (Especially Rufus and Martha Wainwright), or not successful, only Beth Orton and Anthony, which are distinguished by Leonard's version using a little restraint Performing a little annoying tricky gesture will be sprinkled throughout the movie - like not in the focal point of a red sphere object in a concert and an interview for a blurred camera To listen to what was said) and low murmur, terrifying under the group of many interviews (Efforts to increase gravity?) For real, see music from the life of a documentary produced by the BBC in 1988.
