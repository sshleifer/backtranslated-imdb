"Ask the Dust" looks interesting from the trailer and we like every actor especially. Unfortunately, this movie is not interesting enough to be seen as a drama and it is not funny enough to be a comedy. It seems to be taunting himself and not having fun. After seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to improve, my wife and I walked away without wasting time. It's not interesting, funny, or artistic. It looked as though it was written, produced and directed by a high school boy. Worse than that, it is so shameful for a talented actor not to mention our time and money.
