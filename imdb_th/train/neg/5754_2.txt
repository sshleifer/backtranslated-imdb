I watched the mask in the 80s and now it is shown on Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember thinking that it was quite cool in the daytime and there were a few toys. But now watching it makes me tear I never knew how this cartoon was boring and gentle. It's really scary! It's not near the same league as The Transformers, He-man or Thundercats and almost everyone is quickly forgotten. When it stops, I watch it on Fox Kids just because Ulysses 31 comes in straight away (that is, if the mask doesn't make it. I slept first) One of the less-than-80s of cartoons that I hope will be forgotten again when broadcast on Fox Kids!
