I was really scared by this creepy movie. It's an unusual dark atmosphere. And a really creepy music score. Promise! Of course, after ten minutes, you start to sweat and feel uncomfortable because you are afraid of the worst. This movie has an atmosphere of true nightmares and the worse thing is everything comes out. For an hour and a half, I tried to fight boredom and fell asleep. But the great soundtrack makes me wake up. Nuit Noire is a truly terrifying picture - for your eyes, ears, wisdom and most importantly: your purse because of the idea of ​​spending precious money on movie tickets. For cheap amateur home videos, this is the biggest horror movie.
