Disney has never met this movie. It cannot create at least two sequels. And this is not an exception for people at Disney who will give a weak story to receive the prize quickly. However, I didn't pay to see. But I felt right by watching it. <br /> <br /> Ariel grew up now and has a daughter. But did not allow the daughter to enter the sea because there were threats that were not used by the deceased sister of the sea witch So we will go here again. <br /> <br /> Daughter is deceived (of course) and helps the sea witch After a battle that is not happy, she loses and the mermaids and humans are in harmony. Go back to your life "D-"
