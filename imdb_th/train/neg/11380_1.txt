When I watched Robotboy for the first time, I found it fresh and interesting. But then I noticed that each episode of this program tried to teach you how to behave well / badly when the forecast became And the main character is not interesting Again, we saw a boy who was too cleverly beaten by his elder brother who didn't understand his children and friends: girls and fat boys In addition, this show has no reason. A modern robot that works with two AA batteries and can use many weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between the activation mode and the special activation mode. We saw two different robots, and it rejected the main idea of ​​the show: "The robot must learn how to behave in human society."
