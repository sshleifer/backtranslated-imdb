Once in the Indian cinema, Sholay has changed the way to watch good movies. And hope for a moment (hopefully) we will have a RGV ki Aag that destroys all standards and creates one of its own The standard is very low. It cannot be broken. Ram Gopal varma tries to fuse the talent and create a dish so you can smell from a distance. Using classic methods like Sholay and assassination, it cannot be forgiven at all, and I can't believe that he is almost called the RGV ki Sholay movie. But the movie can be created on its plot by simply defining the characters clearly to keep them alive forever. The thing that Aag does is bring these characters together and make it terrible. You have to There is competition to choose the worst. The elements of realism disappear altogether, and what the movie ends is the grouping of "actors" with less plot and not related events. One star for this film is a ridiculous vote. It is time for RGV to wake up to the reality of his failure and think of another "different" plan that can be divided under the cinema.
