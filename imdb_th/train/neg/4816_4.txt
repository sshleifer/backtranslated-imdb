I think young people related to the creation of "Necromancy" (aka "The Witching" as well as other names) have to feel a bit strange when in the horror scene with men who join John Houseman in the production of comedy. ("The Cradle Will Rock"); People are afraid that they will think that aliens have invaded. ("War of the Worlds"); And directed and starred in the greatest movie of all time ("Citizen Kane") and now Orson Welles starred at the third rate about Satanism. <br /> <br /> In general, there is nothing constructive. About this movie Many nude pictures But the accompanying music can prove distracting Although this film is not particularly predictable But still not worth watching How low does Wells sink? Fortunately, in the last thirteen years of his life, he told the story of "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (about Warner Bros. manga in the 1940s) and hosted a documentary on "The Man Who Saw Tomorrow". this But not this one Just avoid <br /> <br /> Starring Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean
