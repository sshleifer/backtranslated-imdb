I just watched this movie with high definition on television. I am in a wheelchair due to disorders of the nervous system and muscles and like watching a few movies about people with physical disabilities. <br /> <br /> At first I found that the main characters were quite noble and charming His message about people with disabilities and the life time he used to fight for the disabled to be accepted and integrated into the job market of the mainstream society. And my problem is not with the real people who do these things He is a great person. But this film is completely hypocritical and doesn't agree with the message that it preached completely. I found it to be an insult. <br /> <br /> First of all, they did not play any role with the physical disability Of course, they are talented actors. But it seems to be truly genuine to preach about the employment of people with disabilities But did not hire people with disabilities to do anything in the movie When consisting of the fact that in one scene through the film, the audience saw the walk to the cradle on the crutches. There seemed to be only one leg, but the CGI in this scene was clearly shameful. Did they find any real flaws for the movie? For a 5-second shot, it sounds financially more than doing CGI effects rather than just hiring a real disability? At that point in the movie, I found it completely deceptive and against the message. It tried to convey that I came here to talk cranky and complain about this like a pathetic disabled person.
