The Thinner's plot is certainly thin and gross. Fat lawyers drive across gypsy women and the curse of the gypsy makes him lose and lose weight ... to the bone. But losing weight is not good? Nope, except for Stephen King, who thinks that, and Michael McDowell, another horror movie writer and writer of this great film, did the same. Lawyers are not just criminals who are not responsible. They are also fat. Haha! Thinner is like an immature debris for people who lament that he / she has never seen anything disgusting than obesity. Hey, I can only say: See the mirror.
