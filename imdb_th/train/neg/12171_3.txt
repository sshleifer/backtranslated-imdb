Usually I will settle to watch all slash movies that pass through my retina, which sometimes do more harm to my brain. While surfing channels the night before, Sleepaway Camp II happened to me. Of course, I want to check as I have heard of the Sleepaway camp franchise, but I have never seen them really (for the shame I know). Because perhaps what I thought was wrong with all the intentions by the franchise's design <br /> <br /> Now, I suppose that the franchise of Sleepaway Camp is a joke in itself. Even the name came out as a joke deliberately. Go to sleep at the camp? It's fun. I can appreciate movies that want to collect something to create pure horror value. But it is what I can do The performance in this film made the actors of Friday the 13th. It seemed that they were performing in Scotland. Campy wanted a bad performance but happened. Pamela Springsteen as an evil killer who touched reality. Has done a better job of killing my interest than she killed all the actors As far as there are a few jokes that I laugh at, but it is far away and far apart. <br /> <br /> Finally, SAC II is very boring and I want to sleep in the camp. Apparently the death was staged and fake, which you could hardly admire them. If you are looking for a comedy movie that has a good camp, I recommend Club Dread. If your channel surfing leads you across this, check and see what else is available.
