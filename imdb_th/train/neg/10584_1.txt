The only quality of the film's redemption is that it's not good enough to be funny. Everyone in this movie seems like the porn industry will break up. In fact, I've seen better performances on pornography with low budget. I even though I rent some gay porn movies after this classic scene: Jim: Look at your ass Nick: You see you (together): I won't leave you behind. <br /> <br / > The first action sequence shows Production is very bad But it's really funny: a good man has a weapon! In one scene, they all have a sub-machine gun MP5 forging the next scene. AK-47 model! And then they will exchange weapons between the scenes and the M-16 two !! I think they have a limited budget for guns, not enough to hang around between good people and bad people. The fighting scenes are poorly coordinated and forged like all hell. You have to remove the pins / spoons from the grenade to make it explode by yourself. You can't shoot the shoulders, launch all kinds of missiles while riding a helicopter. The weapon you dropped doesn't appear immediately. When the gun is out of the bullet, throwing it away is still stupid. If you don't have the idea of ​​reloading them .. The large trucks that run slowly in the first gear are made for awkward action scenes. I can't believe that this movie will actually happen. This movie is hilarious with nitrous oxide or maybe drunk.
