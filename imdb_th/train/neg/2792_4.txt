STUDIO 666 (also known as THE POSSESSED in the UK) is another sub slasher that has movies on DVD. <br /> <br /> While movies go directly to DVD, many things are fast-paced or Hilarious in bad terms, it's a good story without intention. STUDIO 666 is a sad failure. <br /> <br /> While writing a comment on the first page, every time there is a negative score and comments on Negative. All of these people need nails on their heads. <br /> <br /> Two people (at the time of writing) who write comments with a score of 10 out of 10 should not be serious. Obviously they have a little slasher movie and have a better understanding of the horror story. <br /> <br /> The only positive point I can do about this movie is that it can be done. Better than THE CHOKE and one of them The two most ordinary films that I do not want from my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> The film's story must be made hundreds if not thousands. This film is slightly distorted. (And it's a bad thing) with normal expectations The singer was depressed and committed suicide. After a while, her soul returned and had a friend who survived one of her. The detainee said that killing was fun. The rest of the plot is actually too strange to conclude. You just have to see for yourself. Your attention has not faded to the point of extinction. <br /> <br /> The performance in the movie is terrible for most. The actor who plays Dora is an exception for this story. Her character is always interesting and charming when she is on the screen. She helped raise the film above similar contemporary efforts. Unfortunately, some of the lines that she received were badly written to bring it gently and make her from recording movies. <br /> <br /> The direction is not the same. The villains do not look even scary. Every kill is without any doubt or tension. The atmosphere does not exist and the camera's operation is unbelievable. Some special techniques (If you can call them), reminds me of the TV drama GHOST STORIES. Unfortunately for the film's producer, GHOST STORIES has cleverly written the script, convincing performances and taking advantage of the camera angles. Maybe if the producers watch the TV series closely, they need additional techniques that may help to resolve the matter for the movie. <br /> <br /> The song doesn't fit the tone of the movie. It's just rock music and not the best example of this genre as well. Don't let me start with the scary music that I played at first. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the movie, especially the conversation, are unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, they are not funny enough to move the movie up (or down) to a level that is poor - good - good. <br /> <br /> Overall, the STUDIO 666 is a moderately important person. On the side, I recommend this to those who are fans of straightforward movies from DVD and have the desire to see every single attack.
