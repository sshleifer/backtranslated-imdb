This is one of the few episodes. (If not one episode) that has an undeniable error in the narrative While managing Ralphie's situation, Christopher said that he had heard about Pie-O-My death in a fire accident. This is an important detail, because in this context, it is obvious that Christopher knew at first that Tony was the one who had to kill Ralph. However, there is no way Chris heard about the accident. Who should tell him and when? By the time he was torn from delirium by calling Tony, no one was informed. Tony knows well - which makes it even worse! Hearing Christopher talking about Pie-O-My's death was able to lead Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself had lit a fire. Considering the impressive complex writing process, according to the author on the DVD, I really doubt that no one in them is aware of the problem there. The story is not like that. No need to add that I'm a big fan of the Sopranos. Otherwise, I wouldn't care.
