Loved Part One, The Impossible Planet. But Oh, the second disappointment is 'The Satan Pit'. The exciting thing that clearly appears from the hole is - nothing comes out of the hole. From then, all ages spend time crawling around the air to get rid of the evil beast. There is no intelligence, so there is no confrontation with the doctor / villain that I anticipated. The TARDIS is inside the hole, although the hole will not open until the TARDIS falls on the earth's crust. And finally there is a solution that is ready to use which has no logical reasoning - I mean, why not rush into the hole as soon as the hole opens? Why not hurry to escape him over the years, instead of imprisoning him? Why not? - I can go on. But I lost interest ...
