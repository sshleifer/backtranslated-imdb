I have read a few books and this film did not do as I should. I can give this slide, it's all movies. However, I have a serious problem with movie settings. There seems to be no one talking about this film and the book is based on real events that happened in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the city where this movie should be based on. First of all, the "small" city that is said to be the third largest city in the state. With a population of about 50,000, Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. The second scene for this film is wrong. Grand Island is located in the Platte River Valley. Which is very flat with very little trees I tried to watch this movie. But it made me angry that I saw my hometown being treated badly This is a real event. Most of the city was wiped out. In the book, they talk about cycling from the Mormon Islands to Fonner Park. I guess you can do it if you don't mind sitting 15 miles per trip. For those who want to know what actually happened, go here. http: //www.theind Rely on .com / twisters /
