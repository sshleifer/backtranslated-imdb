I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not a Mormon, so why am I renting this movie? Well, because I live in Utah and think it would be nice to see the places that I know in movies. I know that I won't actually get a joke inside, so I'm not surprised when I'm sitting with Deer that look at the headlights What surprised me was the non-Mormon action that was placed in this film. <br /> <br /> I know it's a Mormon movie supporting members of the LDS church, but I find it offensive because The traditional pattern of unbelieving people Not all Mormons, who are not so much, drink smoked and have an amazing selfish attitude. <br /> <br /> In fact, I sued about this movie. They made pure Mormons. But the rest of The state of Utah, which I think is full of harassment, just because they do not follow the LDS Church's scriptures. <br /> <br /> I understand that the conversion revolves around every LDS member, but you think Salt Lake City is 100% Mormon which is not close to the truth. And as I say, non-Mormons in the movie were shown as drunken jerks please! <br /> <br /> I guess I don't get it because I'm not their faith and I guess I will never.
