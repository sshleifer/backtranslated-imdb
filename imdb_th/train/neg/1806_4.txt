Antonioni's movie is not good. The thing that always surprised me about them is in addition to the beauty of the plastic that is undoubtedly a "psychology" that is boring and teaches about characters and situations. Remember, for example, the conversation between Mastroianni and "evil capitalists" who want to sing him in "La notte" or Monica Vitti laughing at the flirting villagers on the train in "La aventura" or Ferzetti. The same <br /> <br /> I checked yesterday. "Zabriskie Point" in this movie has many beautiful and delicate images of the office. Rod Taylor, LA's streets and highways, advertisements, desserts, etc. at the show. In the same way than Wim Wenders. A year later, unfortunately, there were too many hippie left-handed clich√©s that caused the movie to lose: - The boys left the meeting, stealing planes and flying across the desert to release. Yourself and search "Different things" - executives in a gray suit speak all the time about speculation - young women look at "Object women" in the pool and leaves, because she does not want to be like them - two obese middle class people in the caravan speak in front of the natural beauty of building a hotel and receive a lot of money - last but not least Many couples love the desert. Tired of hippies! <br /> <br /> Sorry today, half a century after the "revolution" of "La Aventura", we can see that the king is naked and his movies (except "Le amiche" and maybe "Il grido") are just aesthetics and General place
