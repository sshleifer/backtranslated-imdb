If not for "Oh So Gourgous," Natassia Malthe, this B-movie wouldn't be worth the sector of my Tivo disk space. In a low rent, a lottery warehouse is a space port that should be shot "Continuous people!" It's the basic principle of making a real movie! At night, there is an alleged space signal and according to the day (Day and night on the space station?) Warehouse! Favorite people! The only thing I can praise this movie is the wardrobe department. For continued, Natalie is in a tight-fitting dress! Even women who saw this bomb must appreciate the clothes that she spent each day filming clearly! Sci-fi channels should be better than performing SpaceBalls! At least there is a real sense of humor in watching something unbelievable. <br /> <br /> PS Michael Ironside, please shoot your agent asap! You are a much better actor to be involved in making movies at this level.
