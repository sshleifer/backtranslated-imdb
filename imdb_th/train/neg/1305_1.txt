"Demons III: The Ogre" is not related to the sequel of "The Demons" and "The Demons 2, the coolest horror movie in the 1980s. Classic" Demons III: The Ogre "is stupid. Cheap price The confusion about the writer is "The Third Demon: The Demon" (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor and stupid writers that William Shakespeare, ghosts or devil eggs from the spider web, or what Huhuhuhuhu makes for a girl's dream). That is very boring. I bought a special DVD box called "Devil" in three movies called "The third demon: ghouls", "other hell" and "black devils" do not close the subtitles and subtitles, priced at $ 14.99 from the Best Buy store in Downey. Why Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are writers There is a low quality, stupid filmmaker like "Halloween III". No monster. Michael Myer. But people wearing Halloween. I'm very confused. I love "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 is better than the boring fool". Ogre "is not part of" The Demons "and" The Demons 2 "is the same demon. <Br /> <br /> Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre.
