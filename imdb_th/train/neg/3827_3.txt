Stereotypes, derivatives, not original and boring in the west Two popular celebrities (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) both give performances that are far from their best. They both have superficial roles and character traits that are identified by conversation. Heston is the sheriff "Like a better world like it used to be before" and Bern is a villain. "Owe something to the man who locked him and had to pay the debt" But not a cold-blooded killer like some big killer Obviously, filmmakers can't think of even the same story about how to make the film different.
