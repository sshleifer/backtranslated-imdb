Believe that the world that he does not exist ... <br /> <br /> This is the line that many people may remember. It comes from The Usual Suspects. Certainly about Kaiser Gold .. I mean Sose .. <br / > <br /> I can have one more thing: - The stupid trick that the director had pulled to try to convince the audience that he really had the story - <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the parts that The most sad of the movies I've seen for a long time. It started out very well with great movie filming, great performances and very clever evidence. But alas, the only way that this movie focuses is to destroy yourself.

The attractiveness that is next to it is short after being removed. There are many things that are distorted in this movie, which will not be resolved if it is a cocktail. You will have to spend a life throwing in a bucket to work the nausea after. drink It has nothing to explain, and once you understand the direction you think it is going to be, you will be drawn again. <br /> <br /> I guess this story doesn't happen on paper and Ritchy must There is an idea that it is great to create a movie out of it as the next David Lynch or something. <br /> <br /> 1/10 f or completely violating your own work (Ritchy: ask Professional help) things that may be Can easily replace gems instead of art pieces, create food for fooled intellectuals to debate at the Sunday afternoon debating club. <br /> <br /> Save your life and your stomach, avoid the cost!
