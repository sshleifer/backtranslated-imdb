Even though I rate this movie as 2 for showing my best efforts in trying to create a quality horror movie. But it was a joke that was not intended I can't know what happened in the movie or people. But I don't care because I know that every scene has something that makes me cry with laughter. The conversation is minimal in the movie. But I believe this is because they started filming without script. The fact that there is no plot line makes movies extremely diverse. It doesn't matter if you sit down and watch movies from start to finish or if you watch it in reverse, you will be confused with enjoyment In particular, I like the scene in which the inmates turn around outside, colliding with each other with wood. I believe the doctor means Genius treatment!
