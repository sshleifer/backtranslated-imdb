Don't understand me wrong, I think this movie is stupid. I actually do it. I am incredibly low standard. The only reason I saw it was because there were many women going. (Different stories at different times) When I started watching, I noticed something, this movie was terrible. There are currently two terrifying types. Freddy vs. Jason is scary that you and your friends sit and laugh and joke about the terrible ways and then have movies like this. The cat in the hat failed to create even the momentary interest in me. When I watch the first bit of it, not only But I was bored But I felt as if I was violated by the horror of the movie. In general, Mike Myers is great. I like most of his work. But some things in this movie didn't click One of the things that the director / producer / writer / changeer has changed is that they refuse to use the color of the original book (red, black, white) on all characters except cats. Coincidentally or not, they still refused to capture the original. (And I hate to use this word as well) This book is like a colorful and delicious Sunday ice cream and this movie looks gentle and hard to swallow like sawdust. <br /> <br /> Avoid this like a prostitute who is leprosy.
