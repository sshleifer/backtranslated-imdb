Actually, using a documentary about the nature of bats that climbed the employees of THE BAT PEOPLE is the most powerful ever. There is a picture of a bat full of bats hanging from the ceiling of the cave. There are a group of bats flying out of the cave or swirling around near the mouth of the cave. Only that is enough to calm down: Imagine all of them climbing after you? And they were all in what should have been a sequence of performances that took place for about forty minutes, a hilarious scene where the bats and bats were full, seemingly attacking a police car, splashing across the windshield like a broken egg. The problem is that this sequence occurred about fifty minutes, too late to record a movie, which mostly consisted of one or more people running, screaming, waving their arms while Users gibberish goofball excited about poor people being bitten by bats. During his holidays, <br /> <br /> The fear is that he came down with rabies that really sucked, so their holiday broke down because of the conclusion on the top of the reference page. THE BAT PEOPLE is released. So this is a powerful summary of the movie: A young couple goes on a romantic getaway that is destroyed when a man is bitten by a bat. They tried bravely to pull it out. But he started to try to convince people around him to know that it was more about rabies. He couldn't control himself and everyone should leave. <br /> <br /> Now when someone is Frustrated at the mouth covered with sweat, the glaring eyes of one of the cheaper muppets and screaming that you received from me, you would flee from him. You do not try to give him drugs. Do not try to tell him that you love him. Give him space to go home and try to go on vacation next year. <br /> <br /> But not the people in this movie act like a mentally retarded person. The young man entered the mouth and he jumped into a bat-type creature and killed an unnecessary secondary character. There is nothing wrong with this. But the movie forgot that it was a cheap animal feature and tried to study psychology. Instead of being a monster movie, many people ran to the doctor to receive the drug, and he eventually ran down the hill to see more people than he should have confirmed that he had tried to chase him down. And pay the expected price. <br /> <br /> The main thing that is wrong with the movie is that this should happen in the first fifteen or twenty minutes, thirty minutes, and this movie should be about the guy after he has. Became a bat person rather than traveling there It takes eighty minutes to get the steam in front of the body, along with sketching interesting characters along the way associated with Michael Pataki, who is always entertained as a small town cop who loses morality and Paul Carr. The last person as a doctor Didn't receive the message. <br /> <br /> The film is boring, boring, about fifteen minutes long, and missed the opportunity to be a memorable and memorable creature about horrible mutations like Italian RATMAN that I watch today and is a sad inspiration to try this one after seeing I and my bright thoughts, even if the scene with a police car is a shrill person: Unfortunately we don't have twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> 3/10
