There is no original idea in this regard. The theme is drawn from a few sources that are the ninth door in the mouth of madness. (Another Carpenter movie) and The Ring. It also goes as far as the sparkling storyline of the ring and is used as the name of the movie. The soundtrack by Cody Carpenter comes from Suspiria. Hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spraying the word HOMAGE around. Yes, I see that the theater is playing Argento's Deep Red. Respect is a separation This is the bottom of the barrel. Hitting the blood and creating a "disturbing" image in the pot didn't create a good horror movie. The carpenter knew that He should fade into confusion or get a time machine.
