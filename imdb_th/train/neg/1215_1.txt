I usually don't give a single star review. But the computer will not give negative numbers. <br /> <br /> The open title tells us that we are in deep water. Although this is a low-budget film that doesn't get the numbers, <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story of an inappropriate husband, Kenneth returns to his family in a gated community. Luxury The house is Della (Kim Basinger) pig's house. His wife let the children run rampant all day. <br /> <br /> OK, we are in deep water. Ms. Basinger is 55 years old when the movie came out. Eh, is your child or grandchild? It's Christmas Eve Della drove to the mall, a long scene that might have been cut off. In order to go to the mace house, the idea of ​​the invasion of eeeeeeevil men rampant in the universe, where she drove past the football players in full play in shed rain on Christmas Eve. Sure for the bonus, she saw a car that had <br /> <br /> We have received real suspicion in the driving scene. Rain and bad traffic The first time we saw Della trying to drive and smoke at the same time. Then later Della tried to drive and talk her cell phone at the same time in one point, turning around completely to check the cushion. Behind the mess for the phone charger <br /> <br /> She walked to the mall. An old friend from the college tried to buy things, but her credit card was rejected. Maybe her husband was not satisfied because he was poor. But it is too complex that the script will have to follow. <br /> <br /> In the parking lot, she runs against the most ridiculous gang in film history. A white boy (Lucas Huston see his career down to the toilet) One black man, Asian and Hispanic. Imagine a company that has people down and you have ideas. <br /> <br /> Even if they have guns But she has a good attitude The department store police came to investigate the fracas and they shot him at the head shot more than once. The car park is crowded everywhere and nobody noticed. <br /> <br /> Della flees into her car and instead of choosing a police station or a safe area with enough light, she drives to the place. Construction She killed all four bad guys, one by one, with tools (letters) in hand. <br /> <br /> MAJOR spoiler in advance. <br /> <br /> She drives home. The car ran out, so she walked through the pouring rain, watching the children go down, and when her husband asked dazed that he took him to the mall to show him the gun and shot him at that distance. Empty <br /> <br /> Experience with four functions should be Resulting in personal empowerment for Della, but we know that her children may use Christmas to raise or to house groups because the state will gather them while she answers the murder charges. The punks can be classified as sensible murders in self-defense. Husband, a different story. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this on cable. If I saw it in the cinema (Has it been released?) I am very angry. I am sorry to see talents such as Ms. Basinger and Mr. Haas lose themselves in the trash like this. <br /> <br /> This is a very good thing. Was written and directed by Susan Montford. Ms. Montford has no longer been writing or directing credit since this turmoil. Have justice in the world
