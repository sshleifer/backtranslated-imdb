Sorry, apart from Kim Bazinger who has done very well, this is one of the worst excitement I've seen in a while. Logic was thrown out when 4 young men threatened this woman outside a department store that had crowded people and fired security personnel. But seemingly unnoticed Then instead of screaming for help or running back to the department store, she drove away and ended up in the middle of the forest with the chase. I can't explain how stupid it is to see this woman fleeing from four gangsters carrying a red tool box, calling on God to save her and having sex with them after killing others mercilessly Please believe me, this is a bad thing and doesn't have the same taste.
