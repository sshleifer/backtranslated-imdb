First of all, I would like to point out that while I am not an expert, managed methods will insult your intelligence. First, the prosecutor never proved that 'Favorable learning' really works. There is no responsibility for the prosecution. (Because they can receive an appeal) and protection that does not do this function As other reviewers said, convenient learning has been proven to be untrue. Secondly, they use Terry as a translator with personal interests and also witness the trial that is very stupid. If the court allowed him to testify in this way, they would bring the neutral person, otherwise they would just ask for an appeal. Thirdly, this child never asked specific questions about the prosecution of the defendant (birthmarks, event details, etc.) and even when asked specifically for defense questions, such as when it started, he couldn't answer. If that is not a reasonable doubt, I don't know what it is and the lawyer that is capable of being judged. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, it starts well with the pressure of being a parent of a child. But the experiment makes this movie truly unbelievable.
