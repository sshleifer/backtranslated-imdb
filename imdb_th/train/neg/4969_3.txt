First of all, this is a place that is not as good as any other waste that Sci-Fi Channel produces. Not saying that Grendel is a good movie. In fact, it's terrible. But it has the potential to be much better The shortcomings of this movie come from the design of characters, characters, adding nonsense to stories, visual effects, music and most: acting. <br /> <br /> When talking about Design my character Of course, it means that our heroes and villains look. Beowulf and the other Danish people seem vain to the viking over the warrior with brute force - our main protagonist helmet is worn too stupid. Grendel looks like an Hulk but has an attachment His strange mustache As well, as he became a little person Like Finn, there are additional stories that are useless to make it their own while still holding on to the source. The crossbow that was given to Wolfe was very ridiculous. I was surprised that the actor didn't walk from the set. In addition to additions, there are also omissions, such as the basic themes of Christianity and heresy, as well as the consequences of lies. <br /> <br /> The special effects are terrible. This shows that the images on the screen are less than convincing. <br /> <br /> A loud song, especially when the character dies. <br /> <br / All this is the worst movie of Sci-Fi does it. It's one of those movies. Although it is better than it was trash bins, which have enjoyed the most. The only thing that can be used is the dialogue that is still wood here and there. <br /> <br /> I suggest you skip this movie and watch Robert Zemeck's movie about ancient stories. Beowulf's only because of this film Grendel) is only half the story and not the whole thing, which makes this film a three-star review.
