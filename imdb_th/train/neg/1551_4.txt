Ladies Man is a funny movie without much thought behind. But what do you expect from SNL movies? Actually it's better than most SNL movies (such as Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury), Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell. In addition, the rest of the actors are average and are there to support the Meadows. I've watched more fun movies. But I used to watch movies that are too stupid. Again, it's not a deep film. But it's good for a few laughs Even if it's more fun Still, if you are looking for a cute comedy, I recommend this. Don't think too much or you will hate it. <br /> <br /> Score: 6/10
