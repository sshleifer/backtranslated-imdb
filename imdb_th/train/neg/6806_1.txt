In addition to all technical errors, <br /> <br /> Female flight attendant who can kill 4 people from 7 terrorists (Including the former Marines) 2 people without even using a gun. Then she landed perfectly on the ground. We are not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; We are talking about the flight attendants who have frequent fears: D about the leaders who take care of the attack / rescue team with a full proof of plan. (According to the logic of the script) to let everyone sleep and someone from his team flies on the plane Only he decided to hurry to change the plan and bring the terrorist attack, the blazing gun, not knowing where the terrorists were or how many people were, and not keeping an advantageous position so that his entire team could easily sweep. . Yes, that is using old wine glasses Only later to decide to use the sleeping gas already And it turned out to be useless for all the intense purposes. <br /> <br /> Not as good as this movie, although I can't stop myself from watching and wondering anyway: D I can't help. Will imagine the excellent script writer and unemployed who think in mind that it is not fair. Haha! : D
