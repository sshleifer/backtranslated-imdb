This film is one of the most distorted paintings in history. Not horribly accurate, this film did nothing to honor Dutch workers, English, Chinese, Americans and hundreds of thousands of indigenous people who were sadistic and killed by the Japanese The bridge will be built. "Above the body of the white man" as stated by the Japanese chief engineer It is disgusting that the unspeakable horrors that Japanese captureers are the source of movies that the bridge itself is not close to the real bridge. Real bridges are constructed of steel and concrete, not wood. What are the survivors alive today? They hate movies and all they should represent. Their friends were starving, tortured and murdered by the brutal sadists. Those who do not die from starvation, starvation or diseases are severely injured by films that make light during their dark times.
