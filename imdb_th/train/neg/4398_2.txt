Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors that I admire throughout their career and that is the only reason to watch this movie. All I can say is that I feel totally sorry! These two great actors disgraced themselves all the way by performing a lot of unrelated, imaginative and extreme relationships. The only reason I can think of is that the director is their friend and they decide to support his movie by starring - I can't think of anything else because this movie is very cheap! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack didn't disappoint me since then. I would recommend that you avoid this movie unless you want your opinion about two spoiled actors.
