When i heard about "Down to earth for the first time" I was quite excited. I'm a big fan of Chris Rock. He's a hilarious person, especially in Doc. But this film proved to be a disappointment. Chris Rock's performance was not as good as his previous performances, and the film was very poorly directed. <br /> <br /> First of all, Chris Rock played the movie. The whole story is a regular joke. Obviously it works well in the scene where he should do the steps. But in the rest of the movie it is not Although he talked to other characters, he thought he was trying to make others laugh. He had some funny moments. But most of them came during the final scene The rest of the actors, they are so beautiful that someone who will talk to Rock has no one to stand out. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film is poorly directed. This movie has a story, a joke: the old white man behaves like a young black comedian. While I like movies with more than one joke, this story is still valid and funny. The problem is that we see too much rock and not enough for white people who are old enough. It should be funny because it is this white person telling Chris Rock's jokes, but most of us have just seen Chris Rock so it's not a joke A few scenes in which they decided to show us the white people speak like rock. Actually, hilarious. If he gets more performances, this movie would be more fun. <br /> <br /> Overall Laughter for a moment could not compensate for the fact that "Down To Earth" was acting badly and Poorly directed This one is very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Score: 4/10
