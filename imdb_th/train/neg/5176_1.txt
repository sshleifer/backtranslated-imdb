When the movie is independent and not rated like Hamilton, I expect from the norm to cut the violence in your heart. I know that good movies don't always have blood and violence. But I read the reviews I have visited the website and I still believe that some of my friends pay $ 9.50 to see this horrible movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I expect the horror, not Dawsons Creek, that has unconventional sexual undertones. My expectations are very low for this movie. But a little anticipation for the film was shot in hell when I saw that one hour before we saw the first drop of blood from someone's finger. There are too many plot holes and too much imagination left. I regret not seeing Happy Feet. I think there may be more violence and blood in that movie than in Hamilton!
