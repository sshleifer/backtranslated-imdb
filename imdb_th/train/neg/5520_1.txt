This film shows in the example is a joke. It's a terrible tragedy. It makes me feel sick. I hate it. I think if they want to create a movie like this more than they should be enough to reflect the true intention of the movie in the trailer I won't watch this movie if I get to know. I think the sample should reflect the theme and intention of the movie. I'm tired of it I really want to be funny and I'm very disappointed. For many days and I still have bad taste in my mouth from this movie I have never been very disappointed in movies and I have never written comments about bad movies. I think the real deception is related to this example, because if they show the true intent of the movie, no one will see it.
