Actually, if anyone has a brain, there is nothing better than <br /> <br /> to talk about this movie. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 1 to this rental. I want to laugh at Will Smith saying, "If you have a dream, you have to protect it." <br /> <br /> Every actor must be bored or not famous at that time. Even Matthew McCauley * but you spell it * is better than all the actors in this movie when he plays Psycho at Texas Chainsaw 4. If you watch this movie With a bad taste in the movie, it hurts. Thank you ... and the truth has been spoken. <br /> <br /> Save yourself from the misery. <br /> <br /> Get the Devil's Rejects episode. This is a classic game.
