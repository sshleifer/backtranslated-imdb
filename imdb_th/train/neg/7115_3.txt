Okay, so the introduction by offering free coffins to everyone who died in fear in this movie is very funny, so the first "skull scene" was pulled out and without a doubt it was funny. The plot of the true story of the movie is quite good, with genuine food, at least a bit, for thinking in the character's behavior and plot. The story is as good as the average performance is not really bad. /> At the same time, this movie is not as flat as the movie takes 1/10. Not scary enough to get the lowest or second lowest rating. If I just read the script, I would say that it has the potential to be a good movie. It's just a horrible direction and production that destroys movies. So it's a bad movie. But there are a lot of worse movies
