I accidentally saw this flick on the shelf under the "new version" and found the idea of ​​a zombie hip hop flick that was too interesting to pass. That's the way to charge the box. However, I think to myself that "It's a great idea!" There are also signs. "Welcome to Oakland" on the cover too. How can I resist? Unfortunately, hip hop can be used for as long as the theme is open. Both hip hop and hip hop culture do not have much role in the movie. I live in Auckland. I know that there are many hip hop artists that want so the low budget of this flick is no excuse to have no proper soundtrack. How many struggling artists will increase the chances of this flick? Why is Quiroz Brothers not taking advantage of this thing above me? <br /> <br /> When this film is rolling, it's a typical zombie movie that has a lot of people. The show is completely black and Latin. You may think that this will make the movie tilt wrong in the movie ... but it's not. Quiroz Brothers sees "city culture" boiling down, driving by firing and dropping F bombs on every line in the movie. "Sex" quickly seems to be the most prominent feature of this movie. There is a single line that has the word three or four times and there are no lines at least once. I didn't feel nauseous and swearing in the movie. But the feeling here is that it is the result of a lack of ideas on the part of the writer (such as Quiroz Brothers) and the script is very bad. <Br >> <br /> This movie is disappointing. It's interesting to see zombies. "City culture" truly, but "Hood of the Living Dead" does not deliver that amount. The characters in this film may be white or Eskimo easily. There are no different flavors with movies. It is just another low budget that has many users flicking with bad performances, writing fleas, unfamiliar directions, filming gentle movies, cheap soundtrack and nothing to suggest at all.
