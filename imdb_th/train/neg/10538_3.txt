The First Power (1990) is a horror movie that debuted in the late 80s / early 90s that created cheap horror movies. I found that this movie is very boring, but it's very hilarious in some parts. This movie lacks a lot of sense and credibility until it's not funny. The fast justice system in this film makes Texas seem weak when comparing Lou Diamond Phillips above his head with this role. (He plays a boiled policeman) and Tracey Griffith (the sister who is more attractive than Melanie) plays the psychic role. Don't waste time with this because it's bad. Wait, I'll take it back. This movie makes a great party movie. Look at the nuns that contain the cross, the blade switch. She has the most delicious leg I have ever seen on a nun that is not in the shrapnel of Jesus Franco. Yeow! <br /> <br /> This is the end of the era. LDP's star is tarnished and he can't draw flies to the dung heap. It's DTV for him until His "ressurection" a few years later. <br /> <br /> Not recommended unless you're desperate.
