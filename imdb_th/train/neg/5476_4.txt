I don't know if this is one of the original films of SyFy Channel, but that's what truly feels. Low-budget action movies that may be created quickly. It has a ludicrous effect, weak dialogue, and a star fades to brand awareness (funny that 90210 kids are doing movies. Cheap TV now. <br /> <br /> Ian Sering plays the Cortes, which we know from history as an explorer who eliminated the entire population of the natives while conquering some parts of Meri the North Here he does not play as a hero or sympathetic. But an opportunist; His character may be killed if this is not based on loosely historical figures. In this story, Cortes is conducting a short exploration mission, trying to find something valuable to prove that he deserves funding to explore America. next He and his people meet a small Aztec tribe that is full of dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> The true hero of this story becomes Rios, which proves that Honorable, witty and intelligent He knew the right thing to do in every situation which caused him to conflict with Cortes, as well as the new generation of Aztec sorcerers with ambitions. Of course, the indigenous young woman who should marry a swindler fraudulently plans to fall in love with Rios, causing him to be angry with Spanish outsiders. So it's quite boring Dinosaurs were easily sent. Even if it occurs in an open area But the story is quite happening in the forest or the Aztec village for 95%, so it's not exciting to see. <br /> <br /> I don't even know Ian Ziering. They give ridiculous wigs and Unbelievable accent and he disappeared there. However, he did not look at or listen to Spanish for a moment, causing the selection of actors to go wrong in all aspects. If the film was released, he would be separated for Razzie. No question. <br /> <br /> Overall, forget about it.
