I never went to Paris But after seeing "Paris, Je t'aime", I'm crazy about this city! I've been to New York many times and I love cities and towns. I expect to be touched by this film, feeling like jumping on a plane and flying there immediately. But behold, and behold, I am sorry for the time and money that I spent on it. There is no love story between people or people and cities. There are many unusual meetings and relationships or people who know each other and it doesn't work. Perhaps this reflects the nature of the city where thousands of people live by themselves. Can't you find love in New York?
