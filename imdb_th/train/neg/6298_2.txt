Terrible story (his worst Amis), pointless and self-conscious. The obvious 'degradation' strategy, shocking and patchy performances, makes this film (like "Rancid Aluminum") capturing everything that goes wrong with the revival of British movies. Humor is the limp and ingenuity of all settings (including the "Internet terrorist group" - Oh, this modern day) actually starts to make an impression. <br /> <br /> Final summary - effort Half to 'fret' that no one is helping Still, it was a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on the screen ... <br /> <br />
