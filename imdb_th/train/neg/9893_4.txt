I just hope that no classical / ancient historians see "Cleopatra" or if they do, they laugh. This film is not accurate, scary, more laughable than "Gladiator" (which at least is a well-written script with a clear and consistent historical error in the story). The most obvious is Octavius, which Is Caesar's successor in the Senate before the assassination of Caesar: at the age of 19! <br /> <br /> In addition, the performance is considered moderate. Timothy Dalton has more than James Bond in him when he says "Caesar Julius Caesar" Billy Zane is Marc Antony who is dense and Leonor Varela tries his best to be a charming pharaoh. (Which in real life does not look good at all) but fell out unbelievably. <br /> <br /> So this is a warning for every historian - this movie Not true with life!
