Oh, where to start? The movie was excellent. When the movie began for the first time due to the initial scenery, I thought I was in a good movie. Then Bigfoot, Bigfoot, appeared. It looked like a cartoon painting of Lion King and King Kong's beloved son. It was totally taken from the belief in the characters. Now I know that Bigfoot can't. Trekking around without a clear reason, but the magic cgi cartoons, so from then the whole movie was shot for me, the money they wash the toilet for cgi that they can use in costumes like Roger Patte Morden made He is the best bigfoot outfit that has never been compared before. I am a bigfoot movie fan and I have been warned about this movie. But my compulsion made me watch this movie and I was disappointed like the previous review. I know that after you read this review, you will still say "I have to watch Bigfoot hunters have to look at Bigfoot hunters." So you would say why I lost the hard earned money in a boring movie like Blood!
