Create equal movies about small towns with Mormons and Baptists. The new family moved in to write a dialogue that was overwritten, showing mediocre green salad, shredded carrots and other 'jokes in Mormons' that everyone acquiring outside the Mormon culture would have a difficult time Tantalizing this movie Everyone in the Mormon culture will enjoy a little laugh here and there. You are much better off watching Hesse's other movies. (Napoleon Dynamite and others) than trying to sit and watch this movie That performance was normal. Jared Hess joined hands with more quality movies such as "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamite". I would like to introduce both of these films in this program.
