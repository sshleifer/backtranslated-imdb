Look, there's nothing nasty about this movie. It's boring. It's a typical rom-com that has the ending that you will see before you can see the trailer. The main difference is that rom-coms classic manage their stories with intelligence and lack of hypocrisy. This movie has no excuse, but actually there is no movement. You feel as though you can get up and walk at any time. The production of this film also gives a sense of the debut film that was created about fifteen years ago. I highly recommend watching classic movies such as the new Harry met Sally, rather than a superficial imitation. Oh, another big problem ... no chemistry If you've seen Michael look cute like Vaughn in Alias, you'll be very disappointed with the way they make him look here.
