We all know things like when we have a bad day at the office, right? This good joke, Neil Simon, see how it is when you have the worst day, just try to go to the office. Sometimes it's not worth it to know what I mean? And sometimes it is not worth it to do something when it was done in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis ... and better. <br /> <br /> Not that Steve Martin is a nasty person. Comedian or wrong actor for the role as a bullying and stressful ad executive Quite the opposite, both have values And it's not that Goldie Hawn won't work as well. Her work is consistently good, if not great, since I saw her for the first time on Martin's TV and Laugh-In of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that It's not about lovers: It's about New York and why everyone should come to New York to live and love their lives in the happiness of getting married? Sort of ?? In the greatest city in the world That is, if you are a New Yorker ... <br /> <br /> Watch the 1970 movie. It's also a great comedy movie that explores things that go wrong whenever you travel somewhere. Situation and vision that you can imagine what happens to you in a strange environment. Unfortunately, this 1999 version is used for free tangent for the audience, especially today, who expect or want to see the excess. For example, it's not the content that appeals to the main players, but there is a pendant (rather long) from Rudy Giuliani, who is the mayor of New York, as we all know ?? Giuliani is still in the presidency. Is it worse? Advertise, walk, talk for the compassionate face of New York. <br /> <br /> Then we have John Cleese, pay back his role as Basil Fawlty? But this time as a promising dresser The hotel staff once again looked soulful for wealthy and general customers, making himself look like an idiot he was in this role. And in this process has caused enormous damage to the memory of Fawlty Towers, which is the best British comedy series. There is no bar ... <br /> <br /> Why was this movie in 1999 been created? In 1970, New York was a dying city in many ways. It was almost bankrupt. So when doing it in the 1970s, that is the city that you saw: the horrible, dark, unstable emotions and not the place where the threatened couples eventually chose to live their new life together in the big smoke. 1999, things got better: Glitz came back to New York. It was booming. It was a big apple that was ready for you to bite. If you have a moxie ... <br /> <br /> So by nature The couple in this second finds a moxie in itself and eventually joins a wonderful fight to continue the dreams of American life, freedom and the pursuit of happiness. So this movie is a real cartoon But not for the reason that the manufacturer may see As far as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawk in the comedy, this movie is a better imitation of Jack Lemmon. If you see the back, don't worry about this.
