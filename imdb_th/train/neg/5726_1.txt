Obviously, there is a level b effort to pay to the Hostel / Saw buzz. My expectations for this film are low. The show is terrible. It's not funny. The plot doesn't really exist, and the only fear is to realize that I lost 1 hour and 21 minutes to watch. Only 33 questions are cast as actors and teams. Day 34 may be the mother of the director? - Although I'm sure she will find it difficult to be higher than 2! DVD add-on services including the "creation" feature that is one hour long Any questions that cause "why" (although it may be a demonstration of things that should not be done!) Avoid all costs.
