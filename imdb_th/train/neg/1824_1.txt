I'm not jealous of Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black who made this movie. It is one of the boring words. Perhaps too much of the predictable truth, the role of Ben Stiller's loser or the funny scenes that didn't make the filmmaker forget about it. Even the appearance of Christopher Walken ended miserably. I'm very disappointed I love Ben Stiller's performance. I like it a lot. In his movie, the last one I saw earlier is Duplex with Drew Barrymore and it's not that bad about Jack Black ... In addition to High Fidelity, I never saw him. Do something good. School of Rock. Oh, scary.
