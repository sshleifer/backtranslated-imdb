First of all, I am convinced that the Norwegian movies are getting better and better from the dreary movies in the 70's and 80's. The movies from this place have a little sense of humor. The movie begins to be fun and funny, compared to the long, dark, depressed and boring. <br /> <br /> During the 90s and 00s, many great movies were created. The movie after the movie received praise from critics and played a lot of money. It became the norm! <br /> <br /> Then, come to United ... <br /> <br /> * Follower spoiler * It's not funny, not once, never. But this is ... we Think it's funny Because we are used to Norwegian movies that are funny Especially with actors like this with a few funny actors, but .. they don't say or do funny things! Where is the humor Show humor! Is it an awkward clerk that plays by Harald Eia? It's a ridiculously exaggerated football coach, right? Is it a criticism of Arne Scheie? This movie is not a joke. <br /> <br /> But that's not my main rudeness about United. That is forecast. (And here I am afraid that Norwegian comedians will stand still because I have seen this in other movies as well.) All the time you just know that it will end well. Every character exactly as it appears at the beginning of the movie and everyone gets what they deserve at the end. There is no room for surprise. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that I sit with a bad feeling after watching this movie. It is a movie that makes me realize that we may need new blood to make Norwegian movies ... again <br /> <br /> Score: 1/6
