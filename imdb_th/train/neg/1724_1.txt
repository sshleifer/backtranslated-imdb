... and it is this movie I imagine that if there is a negative post-mortal life, the cursed soul will be tied to the sofa that is quite uncomfortable and forced to watch this movie forever and ever. <br /> <br /> Oh K. Sometimes it's not that bad. But it may be the worst movie I've ever seen next to "Manos, the Hands of Fate" ... and I saw many bad movies. Believe me. <br /> <br /> This is just a movie. Bold, creating the worst movie (Or worst?) What I don't like about this movie is the funny partner they throw for comedy, relief. Now, relieving a little comedy is a good thing. But most movies focus on the adventures of these two retarded instead of the "hero" of this movie. Actually, it takes less than them! <br /> <br /> For justice, Crown International Destroy the movie by adding bad music and fixing bad work. But actually it may be a bad movie to start with, so Crown doesn't do that much to hurt it. <br /> <br /> Must be listed below 100 items. I don't want this. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's my b movie. It's terrible, but I still like it even if I get one star.
