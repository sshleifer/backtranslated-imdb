If you've seen Sholay in 1975, don't watch this movie. If you've never seen Sholay in 1975, watch it, but don't watch this movie. This movie has all the ingredients that may have gone from making a new Sholay. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the best villain. (Probably only 40 minutes of a reel that should not be burned). If you delete the rest of the movie and just watch amitabh playing around with his character, it will still be worth a look. But as an inspiration to Narsimha, Mohanlal is not fair to his abilities. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is very common and the only reason I think they have been crowned in the role of Raja because he is similar to Amitabh in Sushmita Sen childhood carries himself well with elegance and makeup. But the reward for "The worst performance and every role to date" must go to Nisha Kothari. She tries to reduce her level of performance to the level that even the high school drama will make her acting better. <br /> <br /> If you have a terrible enemy :)
