If I accidentally find this script in a text format, I will read and may laugh. I won't, however, laugh at various points in the movie that the director wanted me to laugh. Even though I'm not entirely sure where these things are I don't care if this is Woody Allen. This writer can't write a dialogue, or at least he can't write the conversation knowingly and draw the performance from an actor with the ability to draw laughter from the clown. For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrasing) "I'm an art historian. I'm looking for work in an art gallery." <br /> <br /> Ok, so it tells the truth. But honestly, do you know which art historian would say that? How do you answer? <br /> <br /> "Really, or an art gallery. Who would have thought?" <br /> <br /> All the scripts were littered with semi-patriotic ideas that I didn't expect. From respectable character writers I agree that I do not have all the knowledge of Allen's work and decide that I do not want to start learning. The character is disgusting, without exception, trying to show that we all suffer from human condition? Or writing a really poor character You are the judge
