Fashion designers travel across the cat and fall into the pool, knocking her head and something floating on the surface. With a rather magical effect (This is a TV movie) She floats out of her body. She floated through the ring tunnel of orange smoke and black rigid bodies looked into her view. (They look like a puppet in her apartment) I almost thought I was watching Jess Franco movie .... While her friend recovered her, the black arm grabbed her on her wrist and she struggled to relieve herself. When she revived, she remembered everything and had a nasty bruising on her arm. <br /> <br /> Soon after, she almost got an uncontrollable car that appeared on the sidewalk. after On Halloween, she decided with her boyfriend to visit Mexico. When she got there, she was surprised to find that it was a day of death. They are being disturbed by another American traveler who keeps track of them and he almost drowns. <br /> <br /> Designers are encouraged to join a group of near-death people. Everyone has experience in the tunnel. But not black people or people who escape from death One of them had, and he was very anxious. She is also encouraged to meet with her soul. <br /> <br /> One doctor told her about the person he called "walker" (the name of the novel is based on). He is the one who should die from one reason when checking to prove that he had died from other causes. So it was like they walked after death until they died again. But he blames it for keeping bad records. <br /> <br /> I watched this video in 102 minutes of video and it felt very long. I can't imagine that there is a 192 minute version! Maybe if it was intended to look more than two nights on TV, it would be better to look like that in one sitting. <br /> <br /> I read only one novel, Gary Brandner, about Floater and if so Representing his work, he is not the most original writer. Floors have a common plot: choose to kill children in revenge. Even variance is common: choose from dead children and kill people in the following year to take revenge from the grave. And in fact, there is a common point with this movie in the story that the children practice staring, and when he drowned, he rose from his body like here I do not know how much of the Dead of Night is close to his walker fiction. I understand that the movie Howling is not very similar to his novels. <br /> <br /> It's a slow movie and special effects and movies filmed using low-budget TV defects. There are many characters that are easily recognizable. In addition, it feels more old until the mid-1980s. Over 1989 I found it boring. Much better low-priced movies that cover similar content, which I do not think is a bad date, namely Sole Survivor (1983) (the content that inspired the movie Final Destination 2000s). Night
