This movie started quite gruesome when women were tied and tortured psychologically. With a full nude picture of a male forehead, dead animal parts, a dog licking a tit, a nipple, a control of her bladder Every shot is cool gray. Effective But a little less Then we went to see BTK's killer youth, including his current and criminal history. The tension is completely a matter of mind and the murderer's scene comes into his victim's house and talk to them for a long time and it is creepy. Here we do not see fancy images or good images, it seems like taken with a camera in your home. It doesn't look scary. But in a way that saw the gangsters engage with his victims for some time before killing them quite unusual and chills What this movie does not have is what drama really has. There are police scenes sometimes every time. But without the thrill of finding a murderer This story is not much. This may be a powerful psychological thriller, a study of madness. Unfortunately, the movie is full of real slaughterhouse videos. It spread throughout the movie and came suddenly and repeatedly. Sometimes you don't know it's coming and don't have enough time to look out. And I must refuse I'm all for horror movies with a low budget. But I do not tolerate suffering from animals It is not too necessary and comes without warning. I'm glad Lionsgate has published something that no one else has done. But they should pass through this movie or edit animal blood Stay away from this garbage
