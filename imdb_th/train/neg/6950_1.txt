We all know before airing the Ron Moore mini series, not Battlestar Galactica. It's okay. It means that it must stand on its own. It cannot rely on the Battlestar Galactica. If it is good, it is their own advantage and Ron Moore has something to be proud of. If the report is true, this is what Moore wants. However, if destroying his mini-series, he creates shame for the great actors shown on the screen, not to mention the many outside screen personnel. And this is what he did. <br /> <br /> Yes, this mini-series doesn't have a remake. I didn't even call it fantasy again. It was a new production inspired by the Battlestar Galactica. It didn't happen in the Galactica universe with the same places and jargon and technology. Did not tell the search for the Galactic Gala for the thirteenth It does not depend on the myths and mysteries that support Galatika. Ron Moore's mini-series is a space-opera action flick with the nod of the ceremony for Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should say that Because according to his plan, there is little original or interesting I can convey all things to you without warning spoilers. But I won't do that to you How do I get to the most important point? Here it is: Just look at an example. It will tell you everything that exists in this story. <br /> <br /> Yes, human creation turns to men and tries to destroy humans. (I guess they forgot Azimov's rules again). They look like humans, so there are many things in us. At least not having time to travel Oh and many fighting scenes and random sex scenes and violence The result is that when Moore pulled from Galactica, nodding the ceremony, it came out more than respect. I mean he can't think of anything. <br /> <br /> From the first few minutes I want to see something else. I didn't care about Moore's character, because I couldn't identify those characters. This truth struck me in the face when Cylons started attacking their Armageddon on a planet level and I didn't give a damn. How dreadful it is. <br /> <br /> Moore's hero, when confronted with an unbeatable obstacle instead of overcoming it. Finally, it is the only way to save humanity yadda yadda yadda. They find a safe solution instead of risking their lives to protect others. At least disgust is not indifference. <br /> <br /> In the end, Ron Moore's mini-series is just doing activities without a movie purpose in the track. And I just want it to end And as time passed, my life was sucked out of me Compared to my own wishes, I became a spiritless zombie. I didn't care which might be the type that this mini-series would attract. I want to fill myself. I want - and I swear that this is true - I have to watch the episode of Babylon 5. Actually, there are two episodes and I feel much better. And happier
