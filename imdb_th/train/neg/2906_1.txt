- There may be spoilers ... but believe me, this movie destroys itself from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> I walked into this movie with high expectations. It's my fault I put too much stock on Steve Carell's record to date. The 40-year-old virgins ... Miss Sunshine is a little ... Office and I made a mistake in visiting IMD and saw the ratings of the users. 7.5 Before going to the movies, it was a very good forecast in the past. But there was something that didn't happen soon. The last time I felt this embarrassment and in the extreme pain in this movie theater was watching "Blue Steel" in 1990. <br /> <br /> This flick. Fumble from beginning to end The script is content that is not polite. Mighty write around "the murderer of love"? "Love is talent"? Anyone who writes this shit suffers from the same suffering that American beauty writers try to try waaaaayyyyyy too hard. All that flick is full. The third time of the company is like a horrible shower scene Or pointless aerobic scenes / confusion or a great washing scene When you think there is something serious and / or real is going to happen, they will throw these bad moments. And it will happen over and over again. <br /> <br /> And what are the characters of Carell? The man found a wide lame at the bookstore and suddenly fell in love with each other? Let's face Their conversations were sucked. They should both say goodbye after a few minutes. Pay attention to the initial conversation when you are unlucky to watch this movie .... Carell's characters try to say something random and not funny. (I think the exact line is "Once when I was a youngster" ... that was serious. But the couple laughed so hard that the coffee was spewing out of their nose. The actors seem to be hurt by wondering why they were ordered to do what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Go back to IMDb stuff ... You have to think. Find out how Prevent the promotion team of the movie from leaving this site I know that it is impossible. But clearly the first 20 pain or so ratings / comments were posted by a 12 year old child or by the studio's hiring Check the rank of The Family Stone ... If it's mid-year 5, this thing must be 2 ... and that pushes it.
