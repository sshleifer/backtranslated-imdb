This version is quite tepid. I'm afraid Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood. But the acting style of the weary and tired actor of William Hurt was not very suitable for the bold passion of Edward Rochester and Charlotte Gainsbrough that looked like a teenager. I can't believe that they cut Edward's great marriage proposal from the end of the book, one of the most exciting moments in literature. I am grateful that they eventually use this ordinary girl to play Jane. The character should be 18 of the world, but if you want to see a version that is closer to the personality and interest of the novel, see Model 70 with George. C. Scott and Susannah York York are too old, tall and playable. But no one touched Rochester's character like Scott did
