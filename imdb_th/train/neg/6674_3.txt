I have to admit that the drawing of this movie is the director Eduardo Sanchez, who helped the famous and successful Blair Witch Project. In addition, this is a strange alien movie and sounded like Stephen King's Dreamcatcher, which is one of the movies that critics hate but I enjoy. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately I feel that most The solution is a waste of time, so I will give this review briefly. The building has good prospects and Altered is no different. It tells the story of a group of men who have experienced strange encounters when they are younger and as usual, others will take you as a fantasy of things. Stories about alien abduction must be handled. With probes into the continent, so I won't go into detail But you have been drifting. It's nasty and what you want to forget. <br /> <br /> What will happen? Do you have a chance to get revenge? That is, you can succeed in hunting and occupying your life. What will you do? For this group, it's a fun time to pay back, or so they think And this is where the movie begins to develop as a snoozefest with an unimpressive dialogue and worse performances Even if it has a low budget But there are many factors in redeeming awards, whether it's the story, the strength or the help from the actor to create an interesting character It is a standard cardboard fare from vanilla's plain script, coupled with cheap shocking tactics. <br /> <br /> The good thing, even if it's makeup. There was a lot of effort in creating something that I didn't mention because it would only cause a few elements to make this movie resistant. In addition, there are special effects, cheap prices, blood and blood-filled moments that you have never seen before. <br /> <br /> Look, this is the last choice. Compared to other monster movies in the city - this film festival is less fun and too serious. Waving by the direction that is not interesting, you are warned.
