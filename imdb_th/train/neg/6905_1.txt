Polynesian men, clich√©d, drink, fight and create a stream of women, popular, stupid words, and not ironic. Polynesian real life is more fun than these hard-fixed cardboard characters. A Samoan woman who supposedly didn't look or act like a Samoan person, looks like a white woman who has sex with anyone. With weakness as if the story of the river, you can't say anything about the show, even the best performers can't do anything with this chapter. It's a sad story to see Polynesian actors willing to play like a sad story like this in a movie that doesn't have one good scene. It's a Kiwi taxpayer's money, which is an opportunity to create a great movie about a vibrant community. It would be better not to make a movie if they are not good and don't care about this.
