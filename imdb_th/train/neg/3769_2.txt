There are many movies with Bigfoot, most of which are not good. But at the very least there is an attractive charm for them. Sasquatch Hunters doesn't have the possibility. It is just a serious shock. <br /> <br /> Sasquatch Hunters is a group of paleontologists, paleontologists and forest defenders who participate in remote areas of the Pacific Northwest forests. The bones of some unusually large primate were discovered in this region and because monkeys are not natural in North America to begin with, this leads to scientific exploration. Of course, soon they found all the burial areas filled with skeletal remains of creatures that resemble these large apes. I think we all know what has happened to people who are bothering the ancient burial area in the movie. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie consists of amazing characters and interchangeable, trekking through. forest Climb through the forest anymore, stop for long enough to check and talk about some discoveries on the way. But he climbed through the forest more by looking for missing members Set the theory and gather around the fire to discuss the little things they did that day. Finally, when Sasquatch appears, he becomes a person who stumbles in darkness while being taken out once. (Done in the blink of an eye and you miss the fashion and the real killings happen outside the camera). All of this is amazingly boring. <br /> <br /> The movie wants to be serious and the director is trying to make clear doubts. But no one will find us, therefore being left in a boring scene People roam around the forest to go somewhere and walk around the forest at night to show fear. I would lie if I said I didn't use the fast forward button to speed up these scenes. <br /> <br /> For Sasquatch himself, like other characters in every movie. No need to do much and lack a distinct personality. It looks like the King Kong shaking version, which is not all that bad, except in the scenes where they use CGI instead of men in the Bigfoot series, which is painfully obvious during the scene. Monsters in the daytime Part of me can't help but feel that using computer effects to make Bigfoot lively is miserable. If there is a monster, one of the movies that I believe should be brought to life by the situation, it is Bigfoot. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that do not have a plot. That is all that is true, which is evidence that people involved stretch out to make a lengthy movie without having to pay attention to adding all the ingredients to create a movie that is worth you.
