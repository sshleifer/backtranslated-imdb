I accidentally watched this movie. I'm not sure whether I'm sorry or not. I felt that I was watching this movie created by that film school student who didn't impress me. It plays all the words that Hollywood can imagine while flogging us with the message "The company is the most evil." The intelligence of this movie is not known. As far as it was, he managed to make his own spoiler. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be a fantasy world of computers. The lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend. But it is a genius, programming and a clear hacker (I think) among all the other elements that are boring - fantasy - a reality that you have to look for. Movie z When I saw Ned Bellamy ... He tends to be a good secret. <br /> <br /> Can't recommend this. The first time I was afraid
