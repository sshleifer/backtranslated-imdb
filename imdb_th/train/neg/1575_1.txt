This movie is terrible. The car has a speed of 30 mph when it should go. 100 ... stuck gear lever (In the park!) The nurse who drove nearly 2 hours with a mobile phone on the shoulder ... Can't do it. Can the moron use this damn phone? Nothing reliable in this shit. I will be ashamed to see this movie!
