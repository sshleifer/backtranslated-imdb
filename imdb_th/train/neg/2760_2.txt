I know it's not gunna that works between me and D-wars from the moment we meet. At first, its name was lazy. War D, like writing too many dragons for them. In addition ... You can't show your name unless you are Blue Monkey. Blue Monkey can do whatever it wants. < br /> <br /> The second sign of our relationship with stone is the crazy progress of the story. This is a movie. A dream journalist reports on a snake's track back in time when he and his father entered what had to be a competition for stores in gremlins and a dream boy reporter found a sparkling box. An old shop to reveal many horrifying truths. Bauraki, the evil snake that is supposed to be cheated from the chance he will become a god. Tell the boy that he is a new born warrior and somewhere in LA is his reincarnated lover and gives him junk jewelry. The store also revealed that despite the clear white But he is a 500-year-old Asian. <br /> <br /> Fifteen years later, the journalist who dreams of remembering this perfectly and begins to act crazy. Try to find this woman. Cgi hijinks follow and in Ten minutes ago my brain melted out of my nose. Why? Continue with your beloved reader if you have a ball. <br /> <br /> So Sarah, a reincarnation lover, must have her own past. I benefited from having the best friends in Asia, and in the scene where she began to make strange and create posters with characters in Asia, they told me that anyone who created this film didn't know what they were doing. It was a Korean legend and she was born back from a Korean princess. But everything is in Chinese Later that night, TAT Her dragon started to hurt. She called the police because it seemed like she had a heart attack. Look, in this crazy world, they deal with different heart attacks because the next time we see her, she is locked in her room with the outside guard and the nurse says she is crazy. I have a new fear now, and if I have a problem, the first responder will think I'm mad. <br /> <br /> Dwar has one scene when Patrick Dempsey Jr (Dreamy Reporter) is in a coffee shop with Black cheeky friend In the previous scene, Miffed Near divinity Bauraki killed an elephant and slipped through the suburbs and killed one of Sarah's friends. Watching people scared to come out after the 9-11 incident, but we had to make everything deteriorate. After that, the decision to buy coffee And the pastries are worth the risk of our lives Doing business as usual, there is no way that the giant snake will prohibit me from going to caffeine. If I was inside and scared of my life, the terrorists and the priests of the devil would win. <br /> <br /> After receiving a satisfying dragon in a Dwar helicopter battle, my dearly treacherous treat me with money. $$ and vinegar filled with scenes to finish it all. Bauraki has his own fortress and is under LA. I guess they don't really speak, but Dreamy Reporter and Sarah were bumped into a car crash to These men have fewer and when they wake up, they will see the Dragon Palace. Some dialogue with a mentally retarded God, after which the dragon, a good snake appears from nowhere and the snake will fight / love anything. And I am not kidding about a good snake out of nowhere Maybe you thought I had blown it out. I didn't mention this in the movie. Suddenly ... there! A few seconds later, and a good dragon turns into a dragon god. Put Baurki into the fire. Sarah becomes a ghost and goes with the dragon, the goddess who dreams of being left in the middle of the roll of credit ... Thank God. <br /> < br /> Now our relationship is like Rocky like having a good time. There was a man who looked like a turtle, cut from a turtle and talked like a raider from Tuscany. I will call him Tuskan Shredder. He can do what he wants every time he wants. It will be useless. He can walk through the wall in a scene that is useless. He can go in your dreams when he does nothing and he can fire the ten soldiers who set fire. But not when it's important He is also allergic to touching the junk jewelry. I like him because he was hit by a car twice in the same scene. <br /> <br /> Most of the great actors ... Jason Behr, which I think is great in Roswell. Can do only one way and that is to pretend to be spacious and Patrick Dempsey "ish" <br /> <br /> One thing I like about prostitutes Dwars is Bauraki, the lead actor of it. That giant snake made his mind out. I dare to say that he plays better demi gods than John Barrymore, showing Richard III or Hamlet with emotions in every scene, stealing thunder from The characters that support the little man When he eats elephants, I feel like nobody in the past, present or future will eat elephants with the greatest feeling ever. He is more an actor. He is the power of nature and he devotes his heart and soul to every second of this cursed project. Yes, my favorite actor in this movie is snake cgi. I have a ball that will accept that. <br /> <br /> Here to hope that Bauraki will get more work and not an actor. Jason Behr discovered a variety of emotions. I don't have to watch Blue Monkey anymore. <br /> <br /> So D-War is over. I want my CD to come back and be friends.
