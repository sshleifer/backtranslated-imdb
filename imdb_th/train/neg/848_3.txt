OK. If you are looking for another Bastketball Diaries, this is the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> I spin around two brothers. Max is younger and has a cocaine addiction. Adam, the eldest, is a doctor. This movie should show a jump from reality to the lowest point that drugs can't do. It shows that cocaine can be fun, no matter what the situation happens. Most movies focus on Max and how to separate from him. Eventually, Adam could no longer accept the stress of his job and began to use as well. (Drugs that have to be ordered by doctors) <br /> <br /> This film has almost no point. Don't go down to what cocaine really does for you. There are boring and low-budget scenes and Adam's older brother's acting is scary. <br /> <br /> I don't know if this movie. How to manage To pass and receive the award, not the heart-Wencher. If you want a movie that is clear and real in the world of drugs for rent, if not buy 'The Basketball Diaries' and notice the difference Try to avoid this film. But if you think you will enjoy Try it yourself ...
