What "noise" cannot do is let us understand its characteristics. Tim Robbins plays a New Yorker who can no longer cope with the noise of the city, especially car alarms. It is a strange idea for a movie that is credible about creativity as much as "Death Wish". It's clever at the point; Especially the scene in which our hero tried to read through the gel that "I'm too stupid to understand this." He read and read the paragraph with confusion. We read it and don't understand as well. But then the car alarm went off Throughout the movie, it constantly interferes with the alarms and sounds of the city. Although all helps us to understand our heroes a little But allowed everyone to break his marriage and distract from the side plans instead of digging into his personality Too many self-corrections, wrong editing, not "noise", not bad. William Hurt, at least, is colorful. At least the ending was not agreed. Overall, it's an important point in transportation that you never thought of before. At least I can't Although all are in the ninety minute length But it cannot end faster than this The story was dragged and seemed to disappear as soon as it started. <br /> <br /> This is another movie that you might see at the film festival. Try using a DVD if you are really involved in the project. Otherwise will skip
