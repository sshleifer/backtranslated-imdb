I will admit that I saw "Jerry Springer" five minutes. I didn't think I was a fool. But I think I am actually watching what is on his list. You should try to elevate yourself higher. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as part of the social education activities that I was doing. I was told that this movie was only a little involved with Springer. But is about the life of those who will appear in "Springer" better managed. This movie may be an interesting picture of how pathetic these people are. I will admit that I feel the attention of Connie (Molly Hagan). This is all she has in life. So sad that she felt that she had to go to Jerry's show to fix this. <br /> <br /> I felt really sorry that Molly Hagan appeared in this story. Did you notice that after this film, she was given the role as "B" on TV? I will say this about Hagan. She is a very beautiful and intelligent woman. I didn't doubt that she was serious about her performance and she tried to show her role with care. The problem was that Hagan couldn't do the scene himself. She has nothing to do in the lead role. Her best work will be an angel in "Herman's Head" (bad list But the heart is in the right place) and when she was a guest on "Seinfeld" as Sister Roberta
