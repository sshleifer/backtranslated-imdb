This film began to present original ideas. But somehow became a great hassle later What are the terms of the original beginning, if the rest of the other movies do little things to avoid the ancient thoughts? This movie is very unbelievable. I want to know that someone enters the clinic, receives a nurse's kit, kills the doctor, removes the patient from her bed, puts it into a Chevy pickup truck and leaves him. Jump to another scene that hides these little details. The performance is not good at all. The villain is just "Annoying madman" has no profound, all-straight line style. After 20 minutes of the movie, most of the scenes are unbelievable. They seem to be there for only 90 minutes because they don't want it all. The doctor clearly saw the woman under a strong drug, refused to check. She was fired from her house and quietly left the house? The final scene made me become a laugher. Only the Mickey Mouse can make it true. I gave 2 out of 10 for the first episode, saying 10 minutes of the movie.
