I work as a group to stop exploiting comedians, and I have just spent the past 2 months listening to horror stories from comedians who tried to screen themselves for "Last Comic Standing". No chance to audition, more than 80% of comedians who were rejected were denied before they were able to show everyone that they were talented! If they do it for audition, I say it is "Set in advance" if they get a second chance So what television viewers see is not the best cartoon in the United States. <br /> <br /> If most cartoons do not receive IMDB credits I know this because I made credit for all 6 seasons of "Last Comic Standing" and I didn't get the money for the manufacturer's work. It's really a shame. Last month I asked "Last Comic Standing 7" on Facebook. Why does the manufacturer give IMDb credit and I was banned from their Facebook page !!! I'm not a comedian, so I don't have a stake in this story. I just want people to know the truth. I don't like to see anyone being taken advantage of, and that's why I help comedians. Comedians receive benefits from HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is a large network of three networks, so those responsible should be embarrassed by themselves that allow this exploitation. <br /> <br /> Comedian victim: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
