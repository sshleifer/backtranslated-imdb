This worthless B movie tries to forge a study of sexual addiction. But actually it's a bad excuse for sexual abuse The story revolves around Sammy Horn (a subtle name) played by Michael Des Barres. Sammy is the owner of a restaurant with Grace's wife (Rosanna Arquette) and a small child. He is addicted to sex and must have sex. That has no meaning every five minutes with any woman in his field of vision to agree (And of course, every woman on this planet found that he could not resist, despite the fact that he looked old. <br /> <br /> This story focuses on conversations with his therapist (Nastassja Kinski). Where he describes each person's sexual exploitation via flashback This is nothing more than a convenient launch point for a serial sex action parade that lasts at least 75% of the time. <br /> <br /> It's hard to know how to start criticizing the film. How can this The production cost is abysmal. This film was filmed in a video from somewhere between the TV series. (Best) and amateur porn movies taken in someone's garage The direction of Joseph Brutman is frightening with bad light, poor framing and bad actor direction. The script is ridiculous and rude and rude dialogue. <br /> <br /> Women are often depicted as sexually deceased nymphs, just waiting for Sammy to come and make them rude. While giving food that is not known enough. As an example, Grace's sister informs Sammy offensively that she knows that he is sleeping and that she will tell his wife. His response to that was to throw her into the wall and start raping her. In about three seconds, she was sacred and converted into one of his sex disciples asking him to give her more. As Grace walked in and the sister said to her, "Oh, it's great to meet. You have to rush to pick up Timmy and his mother's words about Sammy's indecision. The bond of loyalty is sealed with a good feud. There is no spoiler here, because it's a normal, clear nature of movies that everyone who saw during the first fifteen minutes can predict. <br /> <br /> Sexual depictions are too much of a mechanism. And very bad simulation That they are more funny than erotic Most will be done with the participants, both fully dressed. The show was miserable. Michael Des Barres presented all the depths of the rainforest He seems to be involved in pushing and insulting sex. But when talking about acting with Arquette and Kinski, he actually drifted away. Rosanna Arquette is the closest thing for an actor in this film, which gives a satisfying and painful performance. Truly, when she finally discovered that her perfect husband was a tricky animal, Nastassja Kinski had too much sympathy as a therapist. But at least we have a show going on here The rest of the actors are just a group of bodies that are doubled to the level that they give such exciting ideas. 'Hit me harder, is that the best thing you can do?' And `Oh God ?? Yes, '<br /> <br /> This film is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The suspicious difference to thousands of movies that I have watched. I have rated the shame that is very rare. It is 1/10 not seen within three hours of meals.
