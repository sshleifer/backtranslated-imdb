I don't know how it was about this movie - director Sam Marovich made a mess of every aspect in this movie. Usually I would say that this is a movie that shouldn't exist. But this movie may be the most important forever This movie should have no doubt for the sole purpose of being 'The Worst Movie Ever Made'. I've seen bad movies in my life. But this thing destroyed what I thought was hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is funny. Considered that this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Oh wow ...
