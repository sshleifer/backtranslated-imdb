Obviously, most viewers don't know anything about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and Central and Eastern Europe, including Hitler and Stalin, the Nuremberg era (and the experiments that have been forgotten all over Europe. ) Is the revenge and injustice of the winner What do you think why there is no American, British, French or Soviet defense after World War II? No American war crimes, England and more? No Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, no Dresden, Hamburg, no Berlin, no katen etc. The Germans also have war crimes. But in Nuremberg, justice is not a true consideration. The main points are: Vae victis! Germany must perish! (That is the name of the book in America, 1941) <br /> <br /> This film is a terrifying brainwashing tool of America that is full of mistakes, lies, propaganda, prejudice and injustice. With hypocrisy But not surprising ... why the Nuremberg process is not enough This movie is a nightmare. Completely dark after 60 years! Darkness (and hatred and narcissism and self-criticism) are the true causes of massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and others, and no American war criminals ... Bravo America! Very smart. Even Stalin is still jealous of it ...
