Welcome to the story of evil spirits and someone's nightmare. This horror story reveals that a newly married husband (John Hudson) and his wife (Peggy Weber) were haunted by the memory of his previous wife. Does the husband really try to drive a car that is anxious? Or is it a learning that challenges Mickey gardeners (Alex Nicole) who takes care of the mansion's space since the death of the original mistress of the house? This cheap horror flick has a story line that will make you participate in every ending. The special technique is quite bad, even in the standard 1958. I swear, sometimes the screaming of the skull seems to be like in the movie Godzilla. In addition, in the role as an actor as Reverend Snow is also an actor, Russ Conway. .. The gardener lurking (Nicol) is a film director. You can catch this as part of AMC's Monsterfest.
