Actually, this movie is worse than most movies I've had through torture and I've passed a lot. Absolute nonsense It's a terrible conversation. Pointless plot development; Pulling out the 'haunted pictures' scene that really looks like a high school art editing project rather than a 5/10 horror movie. The most attractive woman Long boring sex scenes about women talking (Forget what you know about virgins! Especially with fake breasts on the side); Muttering hard to understand words from some characters; And they use the mask from Killer Klowns from outer space during the self-help scene, which is probably the saving grace because this movie is quite funny, but not Veden Fell is the worst person in the history of movies. <br /> <br /> To be absolutely missed
