Regardless of the ratings I give to BOOM, it is because of the wonderful sights of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is just a hardcore addiction of Elizabeth TAYLOR (her down-term) and RICHARD BURTON (his abortion period). Tennessee Williams writes. "The milk train doesn't stop here anymore" and should like adjusting his play - but obviously he is the only one. Taylor reports that Hate and Burton want money. <br /> <br /> No matter how many tiers, Taylor, with Taylor's posture and smoke in her howling. The explosion that servants than NOEL COWARD seem to be a visitor from other films when he finally appeared. <br /> <br /> It's a very interesting story among Taylor's fans. May be considered "must see" but if you The car ride through this thing without a drink in your hand, you go ahead of me. Sadly, this is the movie that marks the end of Taylor, who was seriously portrayed as a movie actor even after receiving an Oscar twice. For Burton, it is equally disastrous and critics call it BOMB. Judge for yourself if you dare.
