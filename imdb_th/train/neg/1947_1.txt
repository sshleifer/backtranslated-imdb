I am 17 years old and I still like most Scooby Doo movies and old episodes. I love movies in 1990 and recently we have been treated to a better one in traveling to Scooby Doo's DVD. This decade, Scooby Doo and Goblin King, which I don't expect to be as good as However, go back and get a clue! I watched some episodes by expecting very good things. But from what I saw, I wasn't impressed. First of all, I hate animation. It's flat, flattening and very much on Saturday-morning-comics-standard, easily in the worst aspect of the series. Even some of the shows that I really hate are a little better animation, worse Scooby Doo is good, positive. I also hate changing characters because it seems that instead of solving puzzles now, Shaggy and Scooby are playing as super heroes, something they never did in Movies or in Scooby-Doo Where Are You? Show. Adjusting the theme is not very good as well. I do not remember and the jokes are lame and invented. Although I admit that there is a very talented dub, if they have better content and are not told differently from the original human voice as possible. In summary, I think it is terrible and I didn't try to discredit it. It was something I felt personally. 1/10 Bethany Cox
