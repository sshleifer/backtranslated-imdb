I like the first two movies. But this movie is a waste of time and money. (For me and the studio) I also wonder why they made this horror movie. Things that have plastic guns and toy cars that can enter into other houses are ridiculous. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two films are very funny. But the terrorists in this movie are very stupid and not funny. Believe me, this movie is a waste of time.
