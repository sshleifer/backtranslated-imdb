I don't see what everyone likes about this movie. The setting is too long and talkative and when finished, the main character remains flat and opaque as he used to be in the first scene. After this movie got Cusack into the hotel room with this bar, I had to wonder what would happen here in the next hour to allow me to participate. Answer: Not much, just John. Nkusac, who has a long mental breakdown. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the character of Chuck has more depth. Maybe if he is crazy about his daily life .. maybe if This movie has developed a better format. About losing and believing, or not being used at first .. maybe if this movie has options to choose from either horror, psychology or horror, excited and bringing these styles to the fullest use ... I don't know. What I know is that I saw this movie with two horror movies and we didn't like it. <br /> <br /> Except the untrustworthy episode on the shelf. The the RAM The stupid door keeper in these three air ducts takes less than five minutes to screen this boring movie screen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this story seems to steal ideas from The Shining and use them here for less powerful effects. Is Stephen King now thinking of stealing himself?
