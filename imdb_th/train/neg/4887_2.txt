The first movie is quite good. This is quite bad. <br /> <br /> Rotate many videos. (Including opening credits and the final title) from Criminally Insane. New footage, shooting videos is difficult. The scene lacks proper light, sound, sometimes almost without hearing the sound, even the video has flaws, such as the image that is constantly rotating Her frequent reasons for finding food in the way she wants. <br /> <br /> At least it's just a special DVD for the first person. Including the same movie directed by Satan Black Wedding. Unfortunately, it does not include the movie The Death Nurse.
