Hmm ... Where to start? How did actress Demi Moore be involved in nonsense? "First blood" may be rated as a cow *** t But this kind of nonsense is just Rambo with pointed nipples. Of course, if you are interested in crapstory (Demi Moore just wants to prove that women can be a part of NAVY Seals) which is the most stupid clich√© I can think of. Mortensen makes this movie acceptable. But Hell, I can't imagine that Demi Moore is a Rambo (especially not in the last 30 minutes that is useless). Ridley Scott does not deserve credit for making this film for women. With equal rights, it is just an idiotic propaganda for the American army and to make it more interesting scary Movie
