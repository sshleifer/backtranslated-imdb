I was subjected to this film for my school's relationship class. Think that it is nothing fascinating and nothing new Although it tries to be original, focusing on the teenage father instead, the mother shows the problem that the father must pass. It has interesting aspects. But it is not at the initiative because it has nothing in this movie that is real We have the main characters that have sisters who like in every other movie. This kind of story has a story for him. We have a mother at home who is expecting too much and when he gives a feeling of discontent and leaves him in the pile garbage Then we have a father who has disappeared all the time. Then the woman, we have parents who want everything and expect that she will be perfect in everything she does. In the story I said it was interesting But the lack of good performances from all actors and the lack of good writing or storytelling Everything about this thing is in the old mind. Little children in school began to study with women. They came together to have sex. And then we had a small child. Maybe it would be better if the writing was improved and the performance improved. I received a more serious feeling from Leatherface and his fanatics than I did from any actor in the film. The movie is nonsense and scary. Until now, the only film about pregnancy that I had seen was Juno. Until the comedic point of this serious situation has proved more enjoyable while still giving the same message. Just as I said, the original idea of ​​these movies mainly focuses on teen mothers. But this person chooses not to focus on his father's drama But again, the initiative didn't save this movie from ordinary people. I hope someone decides to create a new movie with better actors and better writers, or just create another similar movie because the film loses potential.
