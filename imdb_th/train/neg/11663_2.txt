Why don't they dress up as black chicks? Yes, they won't look different. Who can give one Wayans movie that they don't dress as women? No harm, not counting Jack White and Michael Costanza ghost, writing that (other Norton Trio members act as directors) <br /> <br /> In White Chicks, there are no jokes. It's just Wayans who act like children. Women for 2 hours, no settings, no punches and no laughs. There are a lot of "I think I will play with the time crisis 3" At least for me there (5 times of course) <br /> <br /> Some people have to tell Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (talented person Just one), Kim, Rakeesha, George W. and Osama Bin Wayans stop making movies. It only hurt the O-Zone floor. <br /> <br /> VERDICT 1/2 * from ****
