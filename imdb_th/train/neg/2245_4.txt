This movie is not the same as the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason and that is a shame because in 1954 my version is much better. I don't deny Barbra Streisand's ability. She is a great actor and a great singer. I'm not familiar with Kris Kristofferson's other work. So I can't judge However, this movie is very much needed. It is slow. It has nudity and language that is impolite and difficult to sit through. <br /> <br /> However, I'm not a fan of rock music Better Judy Garland version Watch the 1976 movie with Barbra and Kris and judge for yourself.
