I'm very disappointed with this movie. I expect to have more movies about crime, Thelma and Louise's female colleagues. On the other hand, the female prison has escaped unkindly, without feeling loyal to each other. They are extremely rude hyenas that beat each other twice and include lesbian rape with other women in the movie. <br /> <br /> Instead of being a thief In planning the escape and finding hidden money, the escaped woman is selfish and too ferocious to trust each other for a long time. These women do not receive positive freedom. They just ended up being a loose cannon group, unable to respect themselves or others. If you like crime movies, caper, 70s women, skip the bombs and watch the chase of The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, Claudia Jennings And Jocelyn Jones
