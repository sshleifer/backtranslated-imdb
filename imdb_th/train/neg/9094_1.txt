Okay, I want to destroy it for you ... It's a shame! <br /> <br /> If Roger Cumberle had done a great job in the first time, then why did he do bad work on this issue? I'm sorry. May be better if the series is aired But to be true ... this movie is a distortion! Many bad performances * The Shower * "Kissing Cousins" ?????? What kind of line? "Slipery when wet" ?????????? Can we say DUH-M! This movie has tried, I'll give you. But it's too stupid! They also tried to make a joke by giving a stupid accent to the servants in the house, which is actually .... not funny! It's pathetic, not to mention that they make everyone in this picture nothing like the original actors. As if they made them look different or objective! I like to see when I am really a real board, which does not happen occasionally. For those who don't like it ... Okay, what do you think? Can you choose this movie that has an excellent performance and Sarah Michelle Gellar? This film is gold, if Sarah Michelle Gellar is there. DUH! But this movie is not illegal by Amy Adams. Oh yes, since Sebastien has a heart ????? Ugh!
