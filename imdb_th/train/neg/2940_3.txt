I saw this movie when I was really small. It was one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. Now, as usual, I like to watch strange movies, but it's quite a lot. <br /> <br /> There's nothing new for movies. If anything, it starts like Toy Story, where the toy comes to life and Raggedy Ann and Andy go on an adventure to help Babette with their new friends. Then the madness followed with greed, Lonis, a sea creature named Kasok, and a group of pirates singing the song, all of which just created this movie. In addition, I can't help but feel that Babette is annoying and too lazy. She didn't help the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, even though I don't like this movie I like the music of camels. Although it is a song about loneliness But it was friendly to it Then there is Sir Leonard. While most Looneys are just plain nuts, Sir Leonard is the most interesting and most enjoyable one. King Koo Koo is just a small bag that makes Dr. Evil look like a bad guy evil In addition, there is a song of Raggedy Andy No Girl's Toy. It's a good song for a little boy who wants to show strength. But actually these things didn't make the movie better (But remember that this is just my point of view) <br /> <br /> While I don't recommend this movie, even though I have to admit But there are charming moments if you are interested, but only in the mood of something "unusual" really
