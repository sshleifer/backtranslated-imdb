Movies like Amazing Grace and Chuck are perfect examples that people in this country have not received. They never do And liberalism continues to flow further and further into political forgiveness. <br /> <br /> The film involves a small league baseball star who decides to stop playing the ball to protest against the presence of nuclear weapons. This boy was mocked by understanding until a professional athlete led by former NBA star Alex English joined his nation. Not only did some of them join the cause. By the time his movement reached the pinnacle, all the leagues of professional sports and colleges had to cancel their season because no one would play anymore. Just moving this review, I'm ready to give evidence to them. Although it doesn't happen in a million years But I can imagine it from there. <br /> <br /> I can't remember how. But to some type of agreement and The boy decided to go back and play the game he loved in an incredibly scary and ridiculous scene. <br /> <br /> Before criticizing the film's message Even if anyone agrees with the gestures of the boys, it would be impossible to overcome that the film was not well built. And that is a shame because there are many good actors who have to lose (Peck, Curtis, Petersen). Alex English did the best he could with his character and I hope he tries to act in Many movies Alas, it may be easier to find a job. In the NBA training world, there is a desire that Mr. English will teach this type of brutal NBA today that will shoot rock better. Of course, Alex knows how to bring the ball through. <br /> <br /> As far as the text in this film is simple, all the nuclear warheads are hiding in those missile silos going west to Prevent war !!!!! It will be one story for this boy and his flock to protest the real war or use of nuclear weapons. In fact, these weapons have never been used and that is the genius behind their existence. Both sides during the Cold War are crazy enough to shoot one missile. Without these weapons, who knew what had happened between the United States and the Soviet Union? <br /> <br /> The filmmakers intended for children in America to clearly follow their causes. Children in America is smarter than the left wing that created this carcass. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth just 2 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie about the dangers of nuclear war. Stick with ST. Strangelove instead of br /> <br /> Mr Newell, you're not Frank Capra!
