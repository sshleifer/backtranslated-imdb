It's really terrible. Only half the quality of redemption is the effect of thousands of bullets used in movies. There is a context error everywhere. Scary performances help Kirk. The story looks like a hole and the belief that this movie is a video game in itself, just killing a movie if it's not a corpse So overall it is your death. I will give this a zero to get the option at the grade level.
