Ok, my girlfriend and I rented a DVD and about 30 minutes in the movie. We will exchange "ehhh what is this movie and more importantly, I'm interested to see what it ends with" and decide we want drugs to make We are interested in "PTSD" or just stop the pain there and see other things. We chose to use it later. <br /> <br /> I like "but I'm a cheerleader" but Mango Kiss is too stupid and exaggerated for my taste. Sorry! I like "D.E.B.S", "Better Than Chocolate", "Fucking Åmål", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire" <br /> <br /> -Sorcia
