There is no way to avoid the comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas. So let that part go out. First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch is a movie that is invaluable and inferior to Cat. Great comedian and not afraid to act as a great actor Mike Myers spawned from his old tricks. <br /> <br /> Why, why, Mike Myers? Children can pay less attention and Austin Powers population will not go to watch this movie. What is the studio? <br /> <br /> The cat is also involved with Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why must focus on New York? Not consistent with what Dr. Sauce has all written Myers was also allowed to sneak into his Scottish shtick. I wonder if the directors and studios tried to utter the voices before they gave up and said "As long as you don't say fahklempt, 'You can keep the accent." It seems that Meyers will not find any comfort, whether it be costumes, makeup or conversations. <br /> <br /> Jokes There are only a handful of people who have inappropriate habits and age. When Meyer picked up a garden shovel and sent it to the camera: "Dirty, ho", everything except the shooting at the edge disappeared and even without help. <br /> <br /> The only one with the creator 'Whoville' is clear. Having a hand in building a city and a house in the 'Cat', the scenes and props are very appealing, causing the audience to distract from writing bad directions and meers. <br /> <br /> Enjoy Working with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston Dakota Fanning as the only actor That seemed to be aware that she is in the film based on the classic film Dr. Seuss and still the reality of the music. <br /> <br /> Call SPCA. This cat should be sterilized and not allowed to repeat again. Please please, no sequel
