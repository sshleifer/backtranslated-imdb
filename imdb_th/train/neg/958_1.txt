How does this become a blockbuster? Dear God, I don't know why to start. Why is this movie too much to suck? Movies can be predictable & without initiative The only thing I admire is the performance of some characters. This film is too bright, they should do something with light like Makes the environment darker Creating a dead character makes this movie look like a horror movie in 1970. This is the year 2006! People are not afraid of others who make heavy makeup. Most horror scenes we bring from Hollywood or other Asian horror movies are all cut! This is the reason I do not watch Tagalog movies. The only reason that many people "scream" while watching this movie is because of consistency. How many times have we copied the scene from The Ring and broke out instead of being a woman out of the TV right now? No matter how you place it, it still rips away.
