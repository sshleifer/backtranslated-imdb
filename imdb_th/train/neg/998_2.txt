It is quite bad when the general movie conclusions contain more information than the movie itself. The "Plot Summary" paragraph written on the movie page contains details that I cannot compile from watching the actual movie. I found myself always backing up to see the details I just missed, which can tell me what happened. Alas, no use - this movie makes a lot of strange things if you call it a story. It's like they tried to fool us into thinking that there are some movies here, filming enough to have the similarities of the story and letting the rest of our imagination. I can sit at home and imagine plans and stories for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is someone I have never paid enough attention to to put my name on my face and I will see why. She has one of the most inventive performances I have ever seen for a leading character in a movie. A or B. I think that's ok. Maybe she doesn't really want this chapter. Just get a strong proposal. For the movies she entered? Not correct. She is listed as one of the manufacturers. The next time you create something, don't book yourself as a leader if you can't. If you really do, create the right character for you to be. In addition, some people who mention white / Latin problems - yes, I hate to say But this film met with revenge against male college aged white men wearing a baseball cap That is what will happen when there is nothing in the movie that will make the audience to the Latin characters. The character Adrian seems to be jerking badly than the characters in the story. For Maya's character, she doesn't look like a real person. However, I was ashamed of Hollywood that this movie was created.
