This film is another attempt by director Tim Burton to take advantage of the familiar name to bring his' vision 'to the screen. He did it with' Batman ', `Sleepy Hollow' and now this Not a remake. The only thing that is the same as the original is that there are simians that can speak (and Charleton Heston created a cameo). Burton has created a whole new story for today's audiences. <br /> <br /> Planet of the Apes Primitive The production of the time during the 1960 America are struggling to define their new civilization. It is a busy time to search for spirits and review social norms. It is a human rights era in which groups considered inferior want to be treated equally. In that context, POTA is comparatively reflective of the philosophical turmoil facing the audience today. POTA is a very intelligent movie. That penetrated difficult questions and handled the oppression of the American society thoroughly to examine the facts by making the white man show his intelligence With the race that he thought was inferior Dialectical method between Colonel Taylor (Charlton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zera (Kim Hunter) think that it is stimulating and intelligent with both smart and satire Clearly, <br /> <br /> Burton's version of the product of modern times in POTA is the sixties. This is the Apes for Dummies. It is superficial and jejune. Replacing the correct political platitudes for intelligent conversation and focus. Focusing on the form rather than the substance. The ending "Surprise" is not And completely unrelated to the movie except the exciting story that produced the sequel While the ending of the original POTA connects everything together in a powerful scene But Burton's ending makes viewers laugh at him. "I know there is something you don't know and you have to wait for the sequel to find out. '<br /> <br /> From a technical perspective, as in the case of Burton's movie, this movie is Great movie Makeup is great and Burton's camera technician is outstanding (although I don't like his dark look). However, thirty-three years of progress in artificial makeup cannot compensate for the scornful script. <br /> < br /> The story has been reduced to a monster movie The human group gathered behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) to fight the strange monkeys who had received help and support from only a few turncoats. (Especially Helena Bonham Carter Ari). The presentation is a work that has formulas and simple, with a lot of violence. Ideal for today's fast food ideas. <br /> <br /> That show. Blending together, Mark Wahlberg is an actor who has the ability to play this role. Walberg is great to play the dark, dull, tortured, but strong character. In music Wahlberg and Helena Bonham Carter is an actress with a wonderful character under her ability to disconnect is ludicrous. She tried hard to do something with a delicate character. But her interpretation of the presentation, such as between the peace protestors in college and the love of sick teens, <br /> <br /> Then there was Tim Roth. His acting is a virtuous person who can help protect this film from destruction by himself. Roth has a brutal hatred like Thade General, whose heartlessness has created one of the worst and most disgusting people I can remember. sometime In addition, his physical performance is excellent, making it the perfect chimpanzees that believe that almost believe that there are races. <br /> <br /> This film is very disappointing. It is the right entertainment as long as you check your brain at the door. I rate here 3/10 from a technical point of view. It is better than it may be 9/10. However, this is an insult to the original franchise. It was Burton's once again attempting to praise himself by using a familiar name to attract crowds to the box office so many people could see what genius he was. Of course it is true. But it would be great if he used that ability to produce many movies instead of a simple pap that was designed for mass consumption.
