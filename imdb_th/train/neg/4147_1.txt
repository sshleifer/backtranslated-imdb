I am a big fan of horrible movies. What is wonderful and ridiculous is my game. Imagine my soul. I went to a local rental shop and met with vampires and zombies. The name is too fun. Did you know that there is no one in the world that can pull things out like that? It must be bad Not out at all Me and my friends sit outside without talking for several minutes. We both reflect on the future of our lives after watching this movie. I destroyed the silence that was depressing with the words "... friend ... what?" Forever in the "WTF" mode, characters; No development and memorable songs; Worse than vampire pornography; Vampires? Zombies; <br /> <br /> The zombies in the end; Everyone should watch this movie honestly. It's terrible that I want to see it again. So please indulge yourself, watch and get pressure
