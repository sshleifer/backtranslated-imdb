James Bond in the wilderness? That is the appearance: Pierce Brosnan is better known as "Bond in" Tommorrow Never Dies "(1997) and" Golden Eye "(1995) - both shot before release. Frankly, the two films that lead to both mistakes by Brosnan show more convincing performances, and with Annie Galipeau (as Pony, Gray Owl's love) have to fight reckless dialogue. < br /> <br /> Both aunts, on the other hand, are perfect. But this movie is not about aunt It is about the forests of the Canadian wilderness. And while photography may be beautiful, there is no brutal truth of living in the forest. Annie Galipeau as Pony just failed to convince because I really wanted to believe in her. She is twenty-three years old, quite rarely experienced in this film, and it may work, but Richard Attenborough may not be strong enough for her. He makes her look fragile, of course, that she is .. but in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> But one thing is for sure, she always looks perfect. But the mascara and the thick eyebrows in the wilderness? It doesn't fit, especially when she seems to be hiking with Bond. (Sorry gray owl) and use photo-ops for kissing close-ups. <br /> <br /> I've been with The wild people in the Pacific Northwest and they do not look beautiful and sweet while fighting to survive. Which led me to another point: the movie failed to reminisce about the setting time: 1930. I put the guilt here, mostly in the script, the lack of enthusiasm for the sermon at the expense of Of amazing curves, plot points and those small details that can cause moments through action. <br /> <br /> William Nicholson and his latest proposal "Elizabeth, the Golden Age" opened When The day before, so I hope to have /> <br /> updated Yes, I have read <br comment on other posts, but I'm not sure there is plenty of potential. But make mistakes and may feel bad If it has religious movies, it will be panned. But because it was told about the environment, the film remained above criticism because it was "The right politics" Sorry, all I didn't buy. Amen.
