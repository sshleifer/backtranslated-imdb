Okay, I've heard a lot about this movie, so when it comes to movies on TV, I want to watch it as a horror fan. I think I can do overall "huh?" For everyone who looks at it. <br /> <br /> I decided to move on with my life. But at a party with my close friends, we saw that it was happening. We passed it. We both announced that "This is the most stupid thing I've ever seen." It's not scary. I will give to Roth (Which I think is a hacking child); The characters have changed throughout the movie Ala "Cube". <br /> <br /> However, even if there is a "rat in the cage" as your typical style - who will launch the person, etc. It is a rather horror story. <br /> A few points: 1.) What is that kid? I'm not talking about him being strange and annoying. I'm talking about "Slow motion karate kick" What is that? 2.) Okay, I know Ryder's character likes Jordan Ladd, but as a girl I was shocked that he had just gone ahead and molested her in her sleep. <br /> <br /> 3.) Roth is in the movie just so Roth can be in the movie. Speaking about writing yourself aimlessly! 4.) What is secondary to 5.) So she was pulled out of the dog immediately? And have little or no blood? Just scrap her jeans? Anyway, we laughed goodbye and I like to laugh in horror movies (Return of the Living Dead 2, Evil Dead) but I don't know if we should laugh here ...
