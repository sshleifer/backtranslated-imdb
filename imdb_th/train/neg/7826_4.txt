Special effects? Very good <br /> <br /> Script? Scary, no plot, no depth, no meaning. This film makes Superman become a meaningless hero who is a hero without a prototype. In the original film, he represented America in the Cold War. Here he is nothing but Hulk. <br /> <br /> Of course, the actor Kevin Spacey is a good choice among others. <br /> <br /> This thing still can't solve the problem. This movie has no depth. I can not see that everyone can come out with the meaning of this film when Superman is and is created every day to be a hero that has meaning not only in the cartoon but also in the heart. Of people too This is a real waste of money, considering that this movie has many directions. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: Lex Luthor may be the villain of being a good corporate governance world. Dictatorial politics and on top of him are just a hacker, another fool. <br /> <br /> And Superman? For what he stood in this film? Nothing except the hacker "salvage" figure. <br /> <br /> Wait until you reach the dollar theater if you see it.
