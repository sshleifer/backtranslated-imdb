Class .... Phantasm II class ..... excellent Phantasm III ..... uh ..... terrible <br /> <br /> Although I like to stick to this film But I can't It seems that this movie "sold out". The first bad signal came when the video contained samples for other movies at the beginning. In addition, too many pointless characters, important examples for children. (Which is a person who has funny cracks initially But soon you want him to die.) Women who use karate to fight with the ball Zombies that are blooming (What are they doing there, there is no link to them in other phatasms?) There are also severe dwarves lacking. <br /> <br /> The only good bit is the beginning of cracking. And of course Reggie B. <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> For me, this movie looks like a filler between II and IV because the special characters go out at the end to be able to continue with the 4th digit. In IV <br /> <br /> Overall disappointing 3/10
