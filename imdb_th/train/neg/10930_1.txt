This movie is a total dog. I found myself trying to find something to laugh at, so I wouldn't feel like I wasted all my money - and my time. The writing in this movie is really bad. It is a shame that does not depend on the standards of other Hale Storm movies. <br /> <br /> They should save money by getting D-list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spending money on Writing the script until it's done correctly, even Gary Coleman is not used properly for his role. <br /> <br /> This film makes you wonder what the main plot points are. What is included, including sub-plans After watching this movie, I was impressed that the producers hoped to catch some humor like Napoleon Dynamite, which was not a straight line for the characters and the delivery. Unfortunately, this movie failed to deliver the character, transmission or humor. I should go to the dentist instead!
