If I had to rate this film at a linear level, I had to give a low score of 3/10. <br /> <br /> But it's fun and there are many good things to say about movies. <br /> <br /> Candidate psychiatrist James Bishop was assigned to St. Andrew's Hospital for his residents and left and wished to "change the world" <br /> <br /> from the beginning of The movie that you know the hospital hides the evil truth But James thinks he can make a difference and does not know this evil. <br /> <br /> The story is quite good, you know all the time that there is truth about what the patient tells about evil. In the residence and wondering when and how James will find this In addition, when there is a break, James is pursuing the devil and you feel anxious until the "fight" ends. <br /> <br /> Add a beautiful, beautiful girl who arrives at the worst time and Other standard horror elements and you will get a picture. <br /> <br /> The collection of characters is really good. You are introduced to most people killed. Some of you "know" br >> <br /> The movie creates unwanted scenes that are well done as well. There is a mystery revealed - in an acceptable way. <br /> <br /> The main character, James, is very convincing - a story about an enthusiastic student who starts to work well in this environment. <br /> <br /> The thing that kills this movie is: * Stupid effect - "Plan 9 from outside the world" Modern version - Bad type (The devil looks like a red scarecrow) * Some bad performances - the main character sometimes acts badly and sometimes well. * Sometimes the sound is very cheap. <br /> <br /> I always think. that "I can create a movie like this with a home video camera" throughout the story.
