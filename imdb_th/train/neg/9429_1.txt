I bought this movie for $ 5 at a second-hand CD shop and I am also sorry. I will start by saying that I am a big fan of magic horror. They provide tasteless, cheap entertainment. This movie provides entertainment in the first half of the hour because it is so bad that it can easily make fun in the MST3K style. Then it was boring. <br /> <br /> The performance is the most scary part of the movie. Although excellent performances are not expected But this thing is not as good as laughing, and it is true that all the entertainment is there. This is the positive side of the movie. The place where this movie truly diminishes entertainment is writing and editing. <br /> <br /> This film gives way too much. "What happened to% $ @ #" There were many moments of time, such as a strange mother who was suitable for dinner and had no effect on the movie. Along the line of dinner, the responsible person decided that it was fun to see people eating food that was distilled for five minutes without having to talk to each other when serving food. During the meal and other inappropriate moments, the scene will be cut into the pure darkness outside. Then cut back and talk about the darkness, which is one of the most fun parts of the film, which is the weather that seems not at night unless it rains. And when talking about darkness, the big problem of this movie is that it's so terrible that you can't see what happened in half time, which is more complicated. In one scene, you can't say that you should see something very shocking. <br /> <br /> And when the scene of the peak, Unhinged has one of the worst things. I've seen people say "Wow, that surprised me and that was good." I can say that the big revelation surprised me because I didn't see it coming. The reason I don't see it going because it is absolutely unreasonable. I will not destroy it for you. But I will tell you that my friend and I spent twenty minutes to go back to different parts of the movie to find something that would prove that everything we did and what we found was more. It is impossible. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is really better when you watch with an opinion track that makes it fun. I like horror movies shit But it's too much
