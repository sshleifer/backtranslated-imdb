This movie must be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. The performance is terrible, scary and wonderful and talks about the predictable plot! I will not watch this movie again and I will not recommend this movie to anyone. It's a waste of time! The first time, as soon as the movie started, I realized what I got. What they do for this movie is to copy the scenes from other horror movies together in this movie. Prank phone, Halloween night, mental and one knife! It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm not afraid during the movie, which I think horror movies should do. For making movies, it is a joke that everyone talks about how wonderful and awesome the movie is. I mean, how did you know that the movie was "Horror movies" that are cheap, at least have good actors in there, and maybe they will be pulled out as good horror
