Bob Hope's worst comedy movie (and that includes the heavy competition) Hope on an island with a sailor dreaming of being in the bathtub with a geisha girl "driving a boat". Some people take the hacker's hopes. Across this cliff, because it has Phelps, Dillers and Gina Lolo Bredida and still can't laugh or get excited, Bing Crosby is where you really need him.
