After watching this, I thought to myself that there were too many writers and directors or producers too. <br /> <br /> In any way, this is a terrible movie. Terrible in a way that it's not fun. But cause you to bite and shake Causing you to shout "This is wrong" in zero immersion movies Up to now, most of you may be familiar with the horrible mistakes / strangeities in movies with computer hackers. This movie is all about it. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is the little girl Emily, played by Eliza Bennett. I hope you will be great and make this thing .. at least worth something. <br /> <br /> Act as a favorite. Do not watch this There is not even an appropriate action there. Waste all time
