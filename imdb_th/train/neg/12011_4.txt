John Pressman (Micheal "I should call Ditech 'Lerner) to work at the doctor's office in a way. His mother (Zelda' Poltergeist 'Rubenstein) hypnotized him from those who saw him wrong But this became a movie in the movie But soon the lines were blurred when John went to the cinema to kill Encouraging people to watch movies do the same Lerner is above the top in this matter appropriately. But Zelda returned to show the conversation over and over again That is annoying quickly But not as annoying as the two girls who are watching a movie in this movie is a horror movie, this story fails, it's too busy to try to be smart, trying to send a message Tension or at least jump or two No, what we have here is the worst Slasher: Art House <br /> <br /> My grade: D +
