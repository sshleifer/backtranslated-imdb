This is the story of two men who found a copy of 'Funky Monkey'. This search looks strange at the time of thinking that there is a poster for the movie at Cineplex Odeon in the area. 'Project X' Both of them thought that the movie with that monkey was excellent. <br /> <br /> They were in a long drive while they watched this movie. There are some monkeys that have been replaced by the Stunt MAN. Clearly, the monkeys were not trained in Shakespeare's acting school. Perhaps replacing the monkey with Ben Affleck might help them think. <br /> <br /> Maybe a strong close friend might help like Jackie Chan or heck, maybe even Hulk Hogan. Fortunately, this movie has an amazing martial arts artist and Matthew Modine that looks like Li's. While some might argue that Matthew Modine didn't approach Jet Li, but the camera's trick proved that he was a good person. When it was clear that the untrained chimpanzees were unable to cope with this film, the movie leans on Matthew Modine as a real star. <br /> <br /> I didn't mention that there are some dorky children Can someone develop a bond with Modine and the Monkey? Is it possible for the child to learn the confidence and take the girl in this movie? Even Matthew Modine should be jealous of this. (Because of the use of pick-up lines 'I am the second person with a monkey' seems not working with women. <br /> <br /> Not long after watching this Both movies received a call from Matthew Modine telling them 'Seven days'
