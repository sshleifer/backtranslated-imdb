This movie has the worst performance I've ever seen! Some scenes are original, such as nails that penetrate the floor. This nail trap caught these bad guys. The rest of the movie downgrades as you go. I can't believe that this movie isn't in the top 100 forever. I can't believe it will be a sequel! The next movie I want to see is R.O.T.O.R. R.O.T.O.R will be even worse? <br /> <br />
