Actually, it's the easiest of the top 5 of the worst movies I've ever seen. Partly because it is very serious compared to normal light trash. This movie requires you to be emotionally involved with the characters and pay attention to the alleged conspiracy. This has never happened before. <br /> <br /> **** Spoiler MILD ****** <br /> <br /> There are 3 main reasons that make this movie worse. Much: 1.) The plot is not contiguous and has no sense at all 2.) The camerawork that has more form than the annoying substance 3.) Moronic characters and plot holes <br /> <br /> Allow me to do it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> 1.) Clearly, when this movie was created, they couldn't decide what to do. Movies about the conspiracy of the church, shame or possession So guess what? They combine them! The deceased is possessed by the dead, which makes her show disgrace to reveal the rebellion of the church. How can ordinary people overcome death and possess another person through his prayers, never being described or even mentioned Now instead of saying what he wants to say to him, why? Why not try to spit it out? But we returned to the scene where there was a screaming voice with a brutal sound, carved a secret message on the car and writing a message on the wall. Obviously, this priest was a violent man too, because the young woman who was possessed also wore a character wig while speaking in a loud and lamenting voice. This began to bond with my second complaint, because whenever a woman received a stigma, she challenged the law of gravity by floating in the air and throwing everything and everyone around like an earthquake. Why does this happen? Who knows!?! I guess the director thinks it looks "cool". <br /> <br /> 2.) The film has dozens of shots in a slow motion, of course, as the bird emerges from and flies. Go out and The most annoying is the drop of water. This woman's apartment is dropping all the time! Continuous! According to reason In order to summarize this complaint at the end and whether for any reason, the camera will cut into water droplets in a slow motion. Go back !! why!?! I do not know! It is not related to anything, and again I bet because the director thinks it looks "cool". <br /> <br /> 3) One of the main characters said that he became a priest to explain. Hole in science It's not reasonable for me. I think going to church will be enough. But not he had to go through the entire rigamarole of being a priest I just don't buy Secondly, there are many plot holes which I will explain in detail below. For the first time, when she received the first shame, the scene ended with her unconscious, bleeding. Next, she is in the hospital. Who calls an ambulance? Another story is the end when the character. "Scientific priests" mentioned earlier are talking to the spirits that possess the young woman. He said, "Take me as your messenger!" It's not a word for quoting, but do you understand his answer? "You do not have faith, doubt only!" Atheists have no faith, even a little scientific priest! And then there is the fact that the object of this film's conspiracy is the Lost Gospel (St. Thomas' I believe) is available at local bookstores. The characters are willing to kill to get rid of this document. But you can walk to the bookstore and buy it Perhaps this will happen in alternative history, which it is not widely known. But the movie never tried to tell this story to us, or even hinted that this was what happened. The backup of the document was revealed. <br /> <br> Finally, this movie is terrible at an exciting level. It was my nemesis, which I felt had to insult every opportunity I received. I hate it. Final grade: F
