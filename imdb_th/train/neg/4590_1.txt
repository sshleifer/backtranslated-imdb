Anyone who studies physics or cognitive science will be disgusted after 40 minutes as my wife and me. The ignorant crowds may be entertained by the hands-on debate and the "ridiculous" conclusion. (Without trying for rational reasons) from real science I was offended by such nonsense under the guise of "Science" I can conclude that the writer picked up the book Quantum Physics without understanding the words. Then watch the matrix about a thousand times and proceed to write this movie. <br /> <br /> For example Crime trials in Washington, DC were conducted by Transcendental Meditation programs. A short search will reveal the science of their methods. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/dissenter.htm) <br /> <br /> Save your money.
