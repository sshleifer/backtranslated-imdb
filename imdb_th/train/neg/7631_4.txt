I will not deal with the shortcomings of peterbogdanovichian TLPS's obvious, but I will look at the positive aspects of the dwarf celluloid too much of this movie. <br /> <br /> 1 Peter Bogdanovich tries to create a movie that can be fully tolerated. This fact brought the film up to the top and reached the peak of his weak film work. <br /> <br /> 2 Bogdanovich shows that the lucky boyfriend. How to be generous by sharing the beautiful body and chest of Cybill Shepherd with his male audience - not just once But there are two times Brava! The undeniable highlight of this festa del siesta event. <br /> <br /> 3 TLPS almost without scenes with stereotypical country music behind the scenes. (Peter tries to make it clear that the film is located in the Deep South region of America (as if it wasn't very clear), so he reinforces this point ...) How do you get an advantage? When the movie ends, and the monotonous country music stops your tired ear drum massages, you start to get excited and strange: "This movie is over!" It's pure happiness. <br /> < br /> 4 This film gives hope to all women who look like Cloris Leachman. Hopefully someday they might grab a younger brother and possibly a good girlfriend. <br /> <br /> 5 Biographies Of Cloris Leachman (which The knowledge that is not part of TLPS) give hope to all women who look like that one day they might win the pageant Chicago. (Let them have enough money to bribe the jury as well) <br /> <br /> (Do you think I'm joking abut Cloris won the beauty pageant? Check her profile and we'll see. Who laughed for a long time ...) <br /> <br /> 6 The film was filmed in black and white, which made us unable to see Cloris Leachman's face in a natural way.
