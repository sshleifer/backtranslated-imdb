The definition of nasty things as defined by Webster's Dictioary is "The cause of hatred or disgust" If someone can think of a more appropriate word or definition for Alone in the Dark, please let us know because this is the best thing I can do. However, I do not feel that in this word, it describes how scary this movie is. <br /> <br /> I went to watch this movie with my two roommates. One has a very similar taste to me. The other is the action / adventure guru. This guy often doesn't care about the size of the plot hole as long as the movie has a lot of explosions he will. <br /> <br /> Saying that we went into the theater to see Alone in the Dark Friday. My little surprise is that we are the only one in the theater. When it started, I knew why immediately. <br /> <br /> It started with the worst opening scene of any movie, and unfortunately I had to admit that it was getting worse. The opening scene was a scrolling message. 5 minutes telling the story But I understand why it tells the story The director must understand that only the illiterate person will confirm the idea of ​​paying to watch this movie, not only the first scene, which is the longest scrolling message in film history. But still no reason It seems that in the same order we heard about the complete separation of movies. One is about ancient civilizations and interfere with other portals about mad scientists and his experiments in orphans. If you are reading this and are confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Then, the horrifying story, the performance, the effects and the camera work begins. Tara Reid is an awesome actor. She didn't do anything for a second, making you think she is a museum curator. Blame is not good, unbelievable, and no chemistry with Reid. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to be the worst thing that humans have created. All the time I and my classmates have similar tastes. Ask questions like: What is this and what happens? In addition to this junk, we have a few narrative sequences by blaming them well? NO. What are they describing? NO. We, no matter what point, as an audience, have a little inkling why we should pay attention to what happened? Again NO. <br /> <br /> Then we had a random sex scene. We were informed that Slater and Reid were together, but they didn't do anything as if they were interested in each other. But then BAM ... sex scene I don't know again. <br /> <br /> Well, oh I don't know 30 seconds. After the bad scene ended, we were fired with 20 or more soldiers and a number of similar things. This is set to be a heavy metal track and cause more bleeding in the brain than I thought. <br /> <br /> And if that's not enough ... <br /> <br /> No The main villain has a scientist and has something. "Aliens" At one point, scientists controlled the extraterrestrials and stood on the hill, ordering them to attack the military checkpoint. Why? How can he be the supreme commander of these things? Why are they listening to him? I don't know again. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with Slater and Reid walking in a city that has been evacuated. Why is the city evacuated? What is the alien invasion? The soldiers told them? Who knows ... and at this point, who will be interested? I can't, and you won't do it. <br /> <br /> But to disable Slater and Reid is attacked by aliens. Although it is said that extraterrestrial beings are killed by exposure to sunlight And that is, you can guess that it's in the middle of * &% $ ing days, and it's as bright as possible Maybe what aliens buy sunglasses, I don't know and don't care. <br /> <br /> Now, after the movie ends, I ran out of the cinema. I 6 feet 6 inches waving my arms trembling and Tell everyone not to watch this movie. Even my action / adventure roommate (to consider the movie that just cut and bombed 2 hours into 1 movie for the greatest thing ever created) admits that the plot is clear. In this movie <br /> <br /> To summarize this CRAP-FEST, I give 0.0 / 10 and will decrease if I can. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the worst movie ever created. I don't want this film to be my worst enemy.
