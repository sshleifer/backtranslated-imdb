Twenty years ago, a five-year-old boy, Michael Hawthorne, saw his father kill his mother with an ax in an empty road and kill himself later. In modern times, Michael (Gordon Currie) invites his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friend Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch. Maldive (Phillipis) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) to spend Halloween in the country together with their grandparents on their farms He asked his friend to wear a dress that would represent their greatest fear and together with his fellow Indian crow (Byron Chief Moon). They will celebrate ancient India using deadly carved wood. Morty (Jon Fedele) to get rid of the fear forever Michael's biggest fear is to become a serial killer like his father. But there is something wrong and Morty turns to his father, killing his friend. <br /> <br /> "Fear: Resurrection" is a disappointing slash. The film uses an interesting concept to eliminate the greatest fear of each friend before it grows. But in the script that is busy, full of ancient ideas There are exaggerated performances such as Betsy Palmer; Others are very weak But in general, the performance is good. Unfortunately, there is no explanation as to why the model came to life. Moreover, even if surrounded by close friends, the group will not feel pain or regret when each person dies. A stroke of less than fifty minutes may be used to create a more dramatic situation. In the end, Michael showed the charm that his father paid attention to, which I didn't notice all the time. I do not know whether the previous reference has been modified on a DVD published in Brazil with 87 minutes of work or not. The special technique is very reasonable for the movie B. ): "Fear 2: Uma Noite de Halloween" ("Fear 2: One Night of Halloween")
