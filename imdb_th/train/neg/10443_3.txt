I saw this movie screened in New York and I, along with my friends and the whole audience, were very disappointed. This movie is not that bad. It is lifeless like a snake biting victim. Samual L. Jackson looks surprisingly weary and mostly a weak snake effect. It reminds me of one of those wonderful sciFi movies, except the magic of this movie is not a joke or even a camp. It seems that everything is wearing flat and is a unique formula. I'm shocked to say that Anaconda is actually more fun. It's easy to understand that SOAP realizes that it's part of it * and plays with it. But the thing that this movie failed to do is a script that has fear. It's the worst lame movie: It's not happy.
