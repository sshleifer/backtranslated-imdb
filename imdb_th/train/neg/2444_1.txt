Two houses, one road, one telephone booth, one car, next door, young woman, next door for boys and zombies This ingredient list is probably enough for a great horror movie. What you want is the blue light, the surrounding music and ... finished, not in the hands of Dutch director Van Rooy Roy! <br /> <br /> I like to organize. "Bad movie evening" from time to time The concept is very simple: drink, get friends, love movies, and enjoy the worst movies. For this evening, the peace of filth is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that Van Rooy Roy still protects her film as if it were a great success. To testify about this, you will have to listen to the DVD soundtrack again: disbelieve and guarantee laughter!
