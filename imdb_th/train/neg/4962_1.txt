Pure shit 99.999% and another 0.001% is a short time that I think the blonde chick is going to take off clothes. <br /> <br /> The conversation is terrible. Sucking action and without sex (The blonde chick mentioned earlier, dressed modestly, the whole movie) CGI was incredibly honored to be the worst thing I've ever seen in a movie. The show looks normal from Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis, which is the only 'name' in this movie and Marina Sirtis looks really bad. <br /> <br /> I've seen high school playing more. This is the type of movie that MST3K grows. The head should rotate in sci-fi so that this steaming pile floats in the air.
