I won't say that this movie is scary because I see it worse. But it's still not half way. <br /> <br /> The story is very confusing. I can't understand what happened and where I'm going. When the film ended, I scratched my head. I watched to the end of the credit to see if they had something after them that might clear things, but when the credit was exhausted it I felt like I had been Jarred from one of the weaknesses pointing at another point throughout the movie without changing between these two things. <br /> <br /> The character development is very shallow. I can't figure out when someone is angry or offended with someone. I can't say that half of the characters should be drunk, screwed with mental challenges or that they have bad actors to show them. It seems that this movie is based on the pattern. (Which is credit, they are hard to avoid using when you make a movie about a singer in a rock band), which SHOULD makes the character development easier due to other movies, the suffering of abused children or Trial of heroin users who try to clean The pattern is easy to explain, which explains why so many bad movies tend to use too many fixed characters. On the other hand, this film uses left and right characters. But trying to make them as hard as possible. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the characters is that they seem to be fired without explanation I guess it's okay because it takes very little time to develop characters that I didn't have the opportunity to know them, so I never miss them. <br /> <br /> And last but not least Is Sadie's singing. It's terrible. The song that supports her is not a prize winner. But in general, the screams that were released from Sadie's vocal cords. I swore that there was one point in the movie that she sang for at least 10 minutes. I seriously thought that I had to close it during the whining-a. -thon this <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is confusing. The character has been poorly developed. Georgia's performance is woody and solid. Sadie's character is drawn from a bad situation to another situation without any story or explanation. No, and I think there is no good reason to watch this movie unless you have a thirst for pain in the cinema.
