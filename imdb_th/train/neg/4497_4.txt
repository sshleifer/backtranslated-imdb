- I plan to write something that explains what I don't like about this movie. But it will be harder than I thought Honestly, I do not remember much about this. I watched it three days ago and was almost unimpressed. That is a sign of a real smelly person. About the only thing I remember was the most boring boredom. The novelty of having Humphrey Bogart is like a detective wearing really fast. It will be different if he can perform. But he is a famous singer The killing scene is handled like an amateur and without any doubt, if you can't see the killer for five minutes in the movie, you have to see the horror of the Euro more The casting is a gift that is dead for the killer's identity.
