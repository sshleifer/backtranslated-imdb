I read the book for a long time and didn't remember the particular storyline. But remember that I enjoy it When I was at home on the sofa, it seemed like a good idea and hey !! It's a movie for life. <br /> <br /> This movie has a B-actor and actor. <br /> <br /> The actress is on the right side of Desperate Housewives. I have never seen the show. But there are many ads for the show and I get the important part Nothing is original or not, of course, but not in life. <br /> <br /> All male actors look handsome and look good. But a woman must have a husband. <br /> <br /> In one scene, a woman is struggling. With men for her life and what do you do ??? Kick him in the testicles What's more? Women like me to tell some women ... It's not as easy as I thought. <br /> <br /> It's not bad. I get cold once or twice, so I have to give credit. Others too
