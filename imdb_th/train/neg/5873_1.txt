I do not know what they are thinking by them. I mean, anyone who connects with this disaster from a distance. I watched a lot of bad movies. But i will say one Everything the author has created to lead to the most ridiculous dialogue written on the screen. There's nothing good about this movie, whether from a technical perspective or any other perspective. Should be released immediately. There are some names that are known quite well in this movie. Actually, I hesitate to use the word movie.it is like a set of random scenes that do not have relationships with others and make less sense. 0 I fail to see why anyone with any dignity will appear in this.i it's really cheap and i also get ripped of.even if i get this movie for free i will still get Copy 0/10
