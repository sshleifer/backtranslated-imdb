This is another production in northeast Florida, mostly filmed in and near Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Ranch. I am quite surprised that the company can occupy the main road of Fernandina Beach as long as Necessary to get the road scene This movie is beautiful and not good. Tami Erin is a cute person but very pretentious. Eileen Brennan does more than this. Suitable for young children or those who like a lot of softness 4 from the Miller-Movies formula.
