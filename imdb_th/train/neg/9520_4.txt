[*** Possible spoiler ***] The reputation of this movie before, so it is expected that I will sit down to see in the mailbox on TCM. What a very disappointing thing. br /> <br /> The actors are excellent and have the highest production value. But the character has no depth, the plot is thin and everything is too long For movies related to alcoholism, family departments, extramarital affairs, gambling and sexual oppression, this movie is a flat, suspicious, boring, lifeless and thoughtless movie. One example is a picture of Frank Erhard's dishonesty: He wants to send his wife to "Go upstairs and relax a little" followed by pleading with headaches leading to ("Hey Nancy, I have a blue drive tonight.") All of this is a formula that has been worn well. We do not feel that these people are real people. But the weird cardboard displayed in the puppet drama In addition, the source of the apparent disagreement between Frank and Dave Hirsch has never been explored or explained. Dave's obsession with Gwen on-again / off-again is an inexplicable thing in terms of her inability to defecate or leave the pot. His next marriage, born from the desperation of the character Shirley Maclaine / Ginny, is from the moment it was presented to this audience, apparently doomed to fail. Edited by the person killed only The moment when a jealous lover starts running with a gun, I start to bet by myself - who, Dave or Ginny - will be killed. The performances of MacLaine and Dean Martin are the best. But overall I found this movie interesting to be a part of Hollywood history.
