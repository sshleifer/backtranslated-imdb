"Giant" is one of the most boring and long-standing Hollywood artifacts ever. Many scenes seem to be fake and without energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean wasted no time in producing this big Hollywood movie. The main idea of ​​this film is that people taking a job against anti-oil drilling on his land are ridiculous and I know this because I am from Houston. Two scenes, especially Dean, serving coffee. Taylor redeemed this boring movie. If looking for more accurate and interesting images about modern methods of changing fields in Texas, see "Hud" (one of Paul Newman's great performances) or "The Last Picture Show".
