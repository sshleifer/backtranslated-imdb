Go to watch this movie, expecting action 'There is really nothing' but still very disappointed. The opening scene promises a little funny action. It makes you fascinated in the first half because you expect that now is the time for action to come and nothing like that happens. This movie and the ending just make you frustrated until the point that you are frustrated. There is no reason at all. The movie is lacking in every aspect. There is no real story, and it seems to be very hollow. Although "Rambo" is in there, I don't think he can help scoring it There is no reason for the movie. The perfect way to waste your time and money. By the most annoying movie I have ever seen and I'm sure there will be others who will have the same view after being patient with it Of course, not for those who have a slight sense of film.
