American Pie: Beta House is the 6th American Pie movie in the series, although it has nothing to do with the three original American Pie movies, except some characters should be related to the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy in <br /> <br /> There is very little to watch this movie. There are no jokes. The performance is painful, especially for girls with a "Southern" accent that sounds like an impersonation. British woman who pretended to be Canadian hillbilly using the word "ya'll" This movie made me feel like an idiot. Why am I not enrolling in a college that nobody is attending? (But everyone gets a good score) Women often take off their clothes in public. Everyone has unprotected sex without the burden. A photo of a girl's family without thought? In fact, this series has been downgraded to the standard of softcore porn. Maybe for the next person they will eventually break down and hire Ron Jeremy as the leader. I'm sure they can tie it into the series by causing the third uncle of his character Stifler to be removed or something like that.
