John Goodman's program is terrible, but this is just foul. The only thing in this mess that makes me smile is the perception of Patrick Starfish's voice in the Frosty style. Childhood But never received a mature view over the years Paranoia rules the dark world in which these characters live. Everyone is unpleasant and unreasonable. The plot is predictable. But watching from one scene that cannot be described as one scene that can not be connected to another scene without aim is no fun to watch. The worst thing is that no one in the production team seems to have ever seen snow!
