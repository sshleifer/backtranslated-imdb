Oh, this is a really bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is ok. But I think that she acted wickedly in the movie, not because she had her organs torn by raven birds at night. But because she thought of shooting her agent to put her in the shit. Faye Dunaway acted like she was remaking Mommy Dearest and the ending was very stupid. I can't recommend this movie, even as Edgar Allen Poe's girlfriend. I was fascinated by the reference to his work (Ravens, House of Usher, cursed like a family of cursed and buried) - May turn back in his grave if he knows about this film
