I understand that this movie is built with a very low budget. But that is not an excuse for surprises at Grendel Deathstalker, the throne of fire, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, Invbarible Barbarian made from budget, shoelaces and bad special effects. Traditional costumes, dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscapes make Grendale the potential to be a sword and magic movie with a low budget. But the manufacturer completely destroyed this opportunity Compare this film with Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane, but it is a good example that cheap sci-fi / adventure movies can be created using special techniques that are reliable and attractive characters.
