I disagree with what is written and talk about it. "Masterpiece" of the new wave of German: <br /> <br /> 1) There are significant shortcomings in simple explanations of basic communication of important planning points such as Related to Maria's abortion and a secret contract between Oswald and her husband How many people understood that the husband agreed in exchange for a large amount of financial compensation that would not go back and restore his wife until Oswald died? <br /> <br /> 2) The ending was not satisfied. Much The original script calls for Maria to commit suicide after reading Oswald's testament when he finds that her husband has sold the marriage to Oswald. However, in the final version, Maria uses water from the faucet through her wrist to show suicide gestures only. Then Maria was blown up quickly instead of having to confront and live with the consequences of her delusion and moral compromise. <br /> <br /> 3) Fassbinder tries to force people. In the private sector to be more personal, contrary to what critics and "Expert" insists I don't think it will work. The news of the history of the invading radio or the sound of the German-built jack in the soundtrack in the film's remarkable events does not make those historical events part of the drama. <br /> <br /> The selfish ambitions of Maria's rise from poverty to wealth mean parallel economic wonders of war after Germany. So Maria intended to be a specific woman and pondered her time and place. Women have long confirmed their independence by using sex for their own progress. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, there are many times of negligence and untiring expertise - addiction of Fassbinder and patience and unintended consequences An unknown person talking outside the screen without ever seeing Music is annoying in places. And periodically melodic melodies for use in the show <br /> Surprisingly for movies that condemn the country for the overall degradation of disaster
