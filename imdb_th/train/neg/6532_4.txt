This film begins with people on earth discovering that their rockets to Mars are not missing. But floating in space near the planet When it was pulled back, one of the sick crew members was still alive and the other two disappeared. What happened to them will be told through members back by the survivors. <br /> <br /> While on Mars, the team was attacked by a monster that is a stupid insect. While the scenes are quite good, the monsters are among the ones I've seen in movies. In addition, in a strange attempt to produce realism, use a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation makes movies look cheap when they are on the surface of Mars and the intensity of red makes My eyes are really bleeding - it's terrible !! This film has an interesting plot, including a good message about space travel. For lovers of the genre, it's worth seeing. For others, you may find that the whole thing is rather stupid. See for yourself and decide. <br /> <br /> While in today's standard, this movie is a movie. Especially good sci-fi At that time it was quite good. <br /> <br /> PS - When you watch the movie, be careful. Tremayne, he looks like the image of Dr. Quest from the comic "Jonny Quest"! In addition, he listened and acted like him as well.
