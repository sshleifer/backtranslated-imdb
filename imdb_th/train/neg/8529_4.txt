What a fool at MGM thinks it is a good idea to put Clark Gable in the role of an army officer? Surprisingly, Carrie Grant, another handsome star in the future, played the Salvation Army with just two years later in the wrong SHE DONE HIM. Folly of these roles But I still wonder if anyone thinks that the Salvation Army is "HOT" and who can look at these manners and see them as realistic agents. A long time ago I worked for the sister organization of the Salvation Army (Volunteer of America) and I never saw someone working there before. Maybe I should get a job with Salvation Army instead. <br /> <br /> So for those who are very curious, this is a good movie to watch out for. But for others it is a bad writing, a messy conversation and Creating annoying morals makes the movie very slow.
