Agreed to forget all the technical incompatibilities or the physical impossibility of the space shuttle without accident by a quirky robot with a golden heart Forget the ugly effects and poorly constructed characters Just look at the evidence of the story. The reason that the film was first produced and you will see that the film has been badly merged. <br /> <br /> I know that a 9-year-old boy who insults on wisdom and laughs at It's a very scary story. The show is funny and the message that is trying to show is incomprehensible. And worse, cable channels allow the show channels! It is twice a day, every two or three days! Why is everyone in the right mind thinking that people want to see this celluloid pain many times and less than to see it? <br /> <br /> My advice is not to use energy to see this thing. . It's not worth it.
