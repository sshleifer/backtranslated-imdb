What is the worst movie of 2003? "The cat is in the hat?" "Gigli?" Not here! I proposed that it was a cruel little movie from the beginning of the year. Poorly written and badly edited (If I may be brave) Do not act well. "Command" is a black hole of the movie - the movie so dense, not even a little, a little entertainment can escape from the horizon of the suction event. It's not funny, unintentionally, like (example) "Showgirls" <br /> <br /> You know that the producers assume that their audience is not very smart. They changed the name of the movie to the original "Sinners" because they thought that Americans were too stupid to understand what the sinners were, even though they tried their best to explain what the sinners were in the movie. But they thought of the complete common name and the image of Heath Ledger that looked sullen more than enough to take you there. <br /> <br /> And hey, you know what they are right. My ex girlfriend saw a picture of Heath and dragged me in. Congratulations to the manufacturer. You meet your target market. She likes "Grease II". So you are in a good company. <br /> <br /> Return to the Heath topic. Play the Catholic priest from a specific order (you guess) who is trying to investigate the murder. His advisor He has a possible marriage problem because no one in their right mind will believe that he knows little things about religion less than being celibate. The only other member of this order is a fat, funny, alcoholic person. As far as I want to see the return of funny alcohol to the big screen, his efforts on the joke reminds me of all the dorks in my high school that made the imitation of Monty Python. Think if they talk about Things like Pythons. They are funny automatically. You know who I am talking about. <br /> <br /> If I say anything more Frankly, what makes this movie for me lose is the fact that it was created.
