After watching the "Next Action Star" reality television program, many eps TiVo recorded a terrifying rag for me. For some strange reasons - and I only blame myself - I watch everything, hoping to have something * that is unique in the entire movie. After advertising too much about Joel Silver's "Midas Touch" with an action flick, he might want to make sure that he is alchemy. <br /> <br /> First of all, the only redemption value of the movie. This story is Billy Zane, and although he can't lift the slipshod written out of the crapper, Zane's performance is reduced by about 2 / 3rds while he doesn't know what to do besides watching. Peace of mind <br /> <br / > Can't blame him here. Writing is quite straightforward to suck. Let's take the concept from "Rat Race", "Enemy of the State", "Terminator," "Midnight Run" and the bad gambling movie that you can think about and revamp. And whoever has a cool idea is to have two chase scenes in the ROW? <br /> <br /> Sean Carigan, "The Man of Time" of "The Next Action Star" shows. All strengths and weaknesses of casting The director spoke throughout the series. Johnny notes one, Sean plays a jock that looks good as a good person. But struggling with carrying the weight of the movie Quite frankly, we almost never care about whether he will live or die in the middle of the way, while Carrigan failed to give reasons for the audience to like him. Boring daily routine But his luck is old because there is nothing about the characters that will take root. <br /> <br /> But Carrigan is a dream compared to the strict Corinne Van Ryck de Groot. Howard Fine tells her. Pretending to be a Terminator in the first half of the movie? I do not think so I expect her to claim Arnie anyway. Her character "acting" can be compared to the amazing depth of "Freddy Got Fingered" even though it is not developed. The camera loves her in a dark and shiny limousine. But during the daytime with violent behavior, she absorbs all energy from the screen Jeanne Bauer shows a more natural life in her five-minute period than Corinne shows in her part. <br /> <br /> In the end, Sean has a look. Strong and durable to be a good leader in the group of actors. Should not be left to do this solo It was too big a job for him. "Next Action Star" colleague Jared Elliot may or may not have better luck by creating dynamic characters. But it is difficult to say that some of Jeff Welch's weak scripts should take Welch's iMac from him before he hurts himself or others and eventually Van Ryck de Groot is simple and far-reaching. Will be like this <br /> <br /> Joel Silver is a shame
