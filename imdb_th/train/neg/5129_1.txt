The text of this film is "Personality is more important than beauty." Jeanine Garofalo should be an "ugly duckling." But the funny thing is she isn't ugly. (Actually, she is more attractive than Uma Thurman, a friend who looks like a model) <br /> <br /> Now this movie will be available if "The Ugly Duckling" isn't really beautiful? Hollywood will stop with this hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, even if there is a message that wants to convey this movie, it is ridiculous. <br /> <br />
