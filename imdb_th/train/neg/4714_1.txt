I want this GARBAGE to be zero. Unfortunately, there is no place, so I have to give 1 to remind you about the horror of mimicking the familiar cartoon! The characters look like they were drawn by preschoolers. Don't wait. I've seen better preschoolers! I like the "Misadventures of Flapjack" for scary excuse for cartoons! I might say what other people say two words: RIP OFF !! Can you remember the episode of Dexter's Lab when they drove the kart along that volcano? Yes, Mr. Fellows also paid for that idea and failed! They tear Shadow Lugia in one episode that parody Pokemon! (He also paid for that franchise too!) One character was destroyed from Mandark from Dexter's laboratory! Mister Fellows need to be sued for violating the law for this shit !! Everyone has their own opinions. But those who like Johnny test (RIP-OFF), you just lie to yourself. Do your favorite things. Change channels when fraud. Try to tarnish your screen!
