> You are warned that it's a spoiler! > This movie is so bad that I wonder if I can write enough. Good direction, the image is well thought out. The actor is very good, especially Richard pryor, I want to see him more. Madeline Kahn and john houseman are classic. Dudley, more than God, blesses him that he can do better. John Ritter again. I want to see him more. In my opinion, this failure is caused by the failure of all writing. Perhaps the manufacturer may pull the plug when he sees what he is creating. It is too bad that a lot of money goes into this boiler when there is a slight change here and in my opinion it will be fixed. To produce one chuckle
