Was enjoying this movie until Ed Norton's facial hair Without revealing the details of the plan - one afternoon, he had a light beard, but on the same evening the beard disappeared and the mustache grew Fuller than the mustache that goes with the mustache Later, during the dark night in the open, the tentacles disappeared and he appeared there. This is an opportunity to stop shaving without a choice. The differences in these continuity led me to distract from the rest of the film and destroy the credibility that had previously existed. In addition, I found that the length of the cowboy's only scene in his bedroom reminded Deane in too many taxi drivers. Although it is a show of respect But was placed too thick for this audience
