I can't watch more than 14 minutes. It's a great combination of really bad performances and terrible governance. The pictures used are nasty. They break 180 degrees all the time. My head hurts. Try to see what "you know" dirt on the window. "Mysterious machine" makes you see the light from the window ... What a nuisance again ... It has a bad frame all the time. I only directed short films. But I'm pretty sure I will be better in directing this incredible documentary film, just a long French kiss scene at first, telling you that it's very scary. Very beautiful. It will save you 5 bucks or rent and 1 hour and 30 hours in your life. You will never get back ...
