It is difficult to know that this adjustment started wrong because I thought the problem started with my own book. Alexander McCall Smith worked out that you didn't read the detective story. But because of Africa's profound and formidable vision He made for Botswana what Borat had done for Kazakhstan - without success. <br /> <br /> When I realized this and played the role of Mma Ramotswe, if she was to represent a non-African land, it was appropriate that she was a non-AFL woman. Ric? She is not the only American in the team. Mma Makutsi played by Anika Noni Rose. Both women are far too young for the role they play and are more charming than they should. Both mercilessly killing the local accent and both focusing on this cruelty that caused them to fail. In Scott's performance, Scott's Mma Ramotswe is cute, cute and gentle. Rose's Mma Makutsi is an annoying bitch. <br /> <br /> The result is hardly accessible. The main actors have been redeemed by the presence of Lucian Msamati, who will get good results as Mr JLB Matekoni. He came out smarter and tougher in the book. But I think I can't blame Msamati for this - he is the light that shines in the ocean of sucking. The conflict between his performance and the book was clearly laid out by the killers committee, writing the screenplay. <br /> <br /> For me, Col Smith's writing was fun, but not good. He refused. Will fix For this reason, his books have grammatical experiments that surround science and characters that change the middle of the sentence. Therefore, it is a matter of success that the writing team in this project really makes it worse. <br /> <br /> The dialogue now becomes mostly Anglicised. The characters speak of "opening" and "sensitivity. Needs "Mma Ramotswe and Mr JLB Matekoni openly flirt. Mma Makutsi lamented about not having a computer. But with the continuous styling, hair, makeup and jewelry, I was surprised that there was no MacBook in her handbag with a Visa card. Will we leave here? It's hard to be upset by the crappy adaptations. For the truth, what I like about most original books is that there is no evidence. McCall Smith depicted the wearing of Botswana, consisting of cute and harmless blacks. Which is filled with lovely nuggets and scholars It can read well, even with language simulations. But it is the vision of white people who want black people It's not true. <br /> <br /> When considering it, it is hardly surprising that this item will absorb as much as It remains to be seen how European and American audiences will notice.
