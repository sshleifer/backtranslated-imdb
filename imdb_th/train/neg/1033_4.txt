I grew up with Scooby Doo. Where are you and I still love it. It's one of my favorite cartoons, along with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and Pirates and Tom and Jerry. This performance is good for kids, but the sound is good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect like Scooby and Shaggy. ) Theme adjustment can be tolerated. However, it's quite disappointing. Normally I'm not interested in Scrappy, but when he looks like the main character, it will be annoying quickly. Complete with power. Puppy Scrappy poem is more annoying than usual. Half of the gangs that disappeared after the first year didn't feel like Scooby Doo and the jokes and stories were generally crippled and not coming. But there are very few chasing monsters or uncovering the baddies. The summary is not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: get clues, but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for animation, sound, theme adjustment and truth. It's good. For children, Bethany Cox
