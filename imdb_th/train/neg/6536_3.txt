This DVD seems to be targeted to someone who just put it and plays in an endless circle in the background. It is organized into a set of music videos of the Grand Canyon set as various Tangerine Dream songs. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the TD music is boring and the transfer to DVD is rather blurry and dim. DVDs are too expensive for what it is.
