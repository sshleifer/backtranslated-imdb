Do nothing in this movie There are only strange short scenes that I do not know what happened to not count. This movie is boring and painful, and this comes from people who like it when movies about making movies. Confused, so I watched this shit. What happened to Donald Sutherland because he completely missed this thing? And what is the "pedofile" scene at the beginning of the movie Can make everyone sleep! 4/10
