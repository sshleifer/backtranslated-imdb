Maria Bello doesn't seem to care about what people think she chose in the movie role. Once again, she chose a movie that was difficult and unpopular to join. Maybe she wanted those movies to get rid of the sugar coating. (Also known as "Hollywood") that she did here and then (Ugly Coyote and of course Mummy 3) /> <br /> At that moment I thought failed to achieve what was set out. (I'm not going to do that), Maria Bello is great in her other independent / small movies that she performed in her performance. It elevates this thing. I but in the end (and even though I try to overlook some flaws, such as bad walking and drama), the movie is still too long.
