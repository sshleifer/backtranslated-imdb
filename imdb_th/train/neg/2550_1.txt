It's a tagline "In the tradition of the American Pie" that tricked me into renting this movie What I received was Jackass's style of garbage, with an important difference when compared to Jackass the Movie. It looks like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> This film made me regret that I received 1 other movie award 10 because now I can't go This film creates a bad movie that seems to be about movies. <br /> <br /> I closed it after 45 minutes and that was something I didn't do. But it is boring, plain, stupid, unattractive and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Do not believe that some people give 10 out of 10 awards. What do your parents do? Do you put your head when you are a child? Or is the first movie you have seen, so you have nothing to compare with it? Are you still innocent and bust all you've ever thought out? At least something wrong. <br /> <br /> My advice: Avoid this. Even if it is in your mood for a simple movie that doesn't require thinking, choose something else or you'll regret it for sure.
