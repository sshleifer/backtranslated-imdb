<br /> <br /> Finally Paul Verhoeven burst out. He became a joke in himself. Again, we have a movie which includes sex and violence, immorality, peeking women and enthusiastic conversations between the characters and pancakes. <br /> <br /> It's not helpful. Because they didn't do anything in this movie It's all nonsense. All the actors gave the performance in the form of the movie Verhoeven. In other words, rampant rather than performing at almost every level. Starship Troopers fled because it was a world full of characters that the characters lived In this regard, scientists are acting in the same manner. Unfortunately, Paul, but the soldiers and scientists did not do the same idea. <br /> <br /> One of the major drawbacks in the plot is that after Escape one night to do evil. The character Kevin Bacons then returns to science. The labs that we have spent more time in watching animated manniquens (except Elizabeth Shue) walking and talking Why not show what the characters can do in the outside world? How can they follow him if he is anywhere ??? Think that all things can be done with this concept, both in terms of story and characteristics Then see what this movie did and you do bad things and make the whole project come true. <br /> <br /> The more disdain is Doco on DVD that everyone claims Verhoeven is MAd Genius. One of the two is not bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing interesting. Like the name that tells <br /> <br /> hollow !!!
