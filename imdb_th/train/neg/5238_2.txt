I do not understand the positive comments made about this movie. It is cheap and disgusting at all levels and I can't understand how it was created. <br /> <br /> The cartoon character is full - Sue's father, who has a voice, has alcohol, lay , Irish father is a good example There are no characters that are sympathetic from afar - except for a short time for Asian fans of Sue. But he became a person who can use violence in the family! As both of them were hopelessly unattractive, I didn't know why Rita and / or Sue would throw themselves into creeps like Bob - but if they do, why do I have to pay attention to What happened to them? Many criticisms are interested in "realism". If it's true, it's a sad reflection in society. But there is no reason to put it on film. <br /> <br /> I don't like movies at all.
