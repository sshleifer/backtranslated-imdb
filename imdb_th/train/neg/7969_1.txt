OK, another story that I and Joe Swatman bought. OK. This is not the worst movie I have reviewed last week. But it still sucked Royaly. We were so fun to see this shit. <br /> <br /> The next monster is a mistake in these students' unusual ideas. You just know that you have a problem. What when people wear him? Saw of the shotgun. This film is not as scary as we expected. I mean death is a heart attack. Again, I think the acting is terrible. Many actors have to be porn stars and she will go to see her clothes for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> The worst part is the ending. For a little puzzle, but that had never happened before. Let's face it. <br /> <br /> My score:> <br /> Mock 4/100 funny (how much fun we had Mocking) 73/100 Performing 8/100 in general 12/100
