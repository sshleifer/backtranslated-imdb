John Heder is very scary in this movie. I felt that I was watching a bad college boy performing for the first time in a student movie. Anna Farris is considered a path for a bad course. But not scary (Including her cute) Dianne Keaton should know each other better Jeff Daniels is the only one who saves on this movie. (Although it is a bad decision on his part as well) <br /> <br /> All I will avoid all this. I'm just glad not paying to see! <br /> <br /> John Heder will be stuck in the typecast role of 'dorky boy' unless he does some serious work about his performance.
