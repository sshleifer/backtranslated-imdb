Dear God! I waited for this film to "start" ... then I waited for it to redeem myself ... and when it wasn't done I was sitting there stunned that: 1) It might be terrible and 2) That I just wasted a couple of hours in true ignorance I have a belief that Drew couldn't make this movie worse ... and the boys I've lost faith in! Don't bother with this! Drew tried, but this film is poorly written, serves poorly and feels bad! I can't believe that this bad script has been funded! There are millions of opportunities to do with the idea (the word "concept" is too big for this movie to qualify!) And it still doesn't go anywhere! It's pathetic! In the event that other investigators have thought that it is not the worst thing Because believe me, if it's worse, I'll scrape my wrist before doing it!
