The most boring nonsense I've ever seen. The plot is full of irrelevant stories and the worst performances I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> To make it worse, the camera angles that make me feel sick are used. (It may not be a bad thing) and the image of San Francisco seems as if they were stolen from the City Tourism Board's promotional video. <br /> <br /> Oh and forced sex The scene was not half good. Please give better light next time.
