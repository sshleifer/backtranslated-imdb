Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines into this sleepy slasher and the light fades quickly. If not, she has other reasons to see this. Five children have registered to prepare an old dormitory for the due date of demolition. The problem will occur automatically when strange stray men are persuaded and the group is only a few short. Then the killer is on the loose. I want to say that I will enjoy this It has a fair setting or maybe just Daphne Zuniga. In that movie, it is too slow and almost silent like a library. Most performances are below average and the "view" period is very old news. The famous songwriter Christopher Young from the movie "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" has done this in a repeat of the queue made for television movies Still, it seems to be higher than this film deserves. So besides Young and Zuniga, this person also talks about the bottom of the tank.
