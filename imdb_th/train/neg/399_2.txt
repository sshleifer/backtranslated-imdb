This image begins with good intentions. Bacon, a scientist, goes out to test the invisibility theory and Shue is cute according to her role. Everything is different. After that, it's your typical Hollywood movie. Now filmed on stage with many special effects. Remove any humor, intelligence or spirit. In other words, don't waste time watching this thing. Bought a videotape with John DeLancie as Invisible Man instead. Also starring Leonard Nimoy. It is now good and HG Wells acts as well as this mess.
