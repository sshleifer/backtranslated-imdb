I don't think it's scary as some people do. It's passed as one of the horror movies that you might lose in the middle of the night when you can't sleep, even if you accept that it's not a better quality It is true that the performances are not great - I think Marianne McAndrew as Cathy Beck. For example, they find that they are not completely passionate - but the main problem is the plot that does not make sense. Becks is traveling. Went to lecture by John (Stewart Moss) as a part and honeymoon that they never had (Now it's romantic!) The work is related to the tourist cave, in which it sounds strange to the tour group through the caves that relate to someone's work?) But it's strange when we know that he is a doctor. Research in preventive medicine (Isn't that relationship causing me to disappear?) Bitten by a bat while he was. The cave began to transform into something that I thought should be a hybrid between humans and bats. (Although, finally, when we saw him in makeup, he seemed to be a kind monkey) and the fun of killing began. This is another problem. The first killing was a hospital nurse. At first, everyone thought that her death was an accident. The second murder was a story of a young girl who was described as tearing her neck. The sheriff (Michael Pataki) told us that her death was similar to a nurse. (Meaning torn neck - who would think that was an accident?) And what was the sheriff? He looked ridiculous, ridiculous until the scene in Cathy's hotel room when he drank a bit of alcohol and almost raped her. After that, everything returned to normal. It ended with the end of almost everything that was not resolved and still one of the most annoying songs I've heard in the movie. Even everything has something here that makes me look. Sometimes pure purity can make you go through an hour and a half. Quite bad. Yes - but not as bad as some people say.
