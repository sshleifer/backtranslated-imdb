Writing the screen is very stupid, causing me to die for 2 hours. I will never come back. (I've heard this before) The show is so-so. Things change often enough to make you look and wait for something terrifying. However, there is still no original thing in this film, while the first Cube is a stupid horror movie that doesn't have any reason at the end. But this time it's a terrifying issue of trying. To explain all the details that the first movie did not answer The funny thing is that the director will bring the exact scene of the first novel that is quite new and trying to explain to them. But that scene has just been copied and has no relevance This script is pointless. I can imagine that it was written by a 15-year-old man with a baseball cap and a bottle of beer for a class project. The best part is that at the end, they destroy the good servants and they become friends with the moron in the first movie and you see him when they meet him. ('This room is green ..') in Cube 1997 Goodie gooodie, clapping, clap First of all, if you don't see the first person, it's not reasonable that you are the director. Oh, another good idea: instead of numbers to specify the x, y, z coordinates of the room (cube 1997), this time it's three letters, each with 26 possible coordinates, except now. The change is no longer reasonable .. so he let the letter disappear before anyone can use them ... I need a refund. <br /> <br /> I guess I have to write it down. Go because there There are only bad thoughts, inconsistencies or many silly ideas in this movie. The director / writer should have the ability.
