I rented this movie because I hope it will be one of the whole family to enjoy. Although this film is family friendly But my family does not enjoy it because it gives a wrong view to God. If you obey God and follow Him, you won't guarantee success Your football team will not always win. You will not get an amazingly better grade. Infertility is not completely cured. You will not be added. Sometimes you are stuck with an old car. <br /> <br /> God is not here to find everything we need. Rather, we were created to glorify him. Sometimes we honor him the most when things don't seem good for us. Life is Christ Death is a profit.
