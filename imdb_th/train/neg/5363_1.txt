I do not think that this movie is worth the bad, the acting is not good, except Janine Turner. There is no imagination. If you've never seen this movie before, don't pay attention to it, it's not worth it. The only good thing about it is that Janine Turner performs well. Terry's husband is a brilliant defense lawyer who has won many awards. He thought he was very smart. But he was just crazy. Her best friend had a relationship with her husband and betrayed her. Good girl. She doesn't have a day at the beach as well.
