Do not do well. The horrifying performance and the ending that the director appears from anywhere, because this movie is nothing boring. It is shocking that the film was considered to be awarded at the Gij√≥n Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Everyone who comes out of the theater has the same opinion as me. - What is the point of making this movie? The reference to Iraq is strange or not thought correctly. I was amazed that the film was released - disappointing and very time consuming. Sorry, very negative comments But hope to deter some people who make mistakes as well It's a pity that we don't have a queue and A at the end of the movie - now it's interesting.
