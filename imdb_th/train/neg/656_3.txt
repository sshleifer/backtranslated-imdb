Note: I can't force myself to write a review of the creative reviews of the Prom Night. It can't be done. But I go back to what I thought about while watching movies. <br /> <br /> What I think about while watching Prom Night: <br /> <br /> - I'm tired of dreams. At These complex deaths will only occur with the main character who wakes up before she bites it. Of course, when I say "Complex death" I mean, tapping the screen, neck or stabbing in the stomach, not all "It's just a dream." What was destroyed by Dallas? When talking about this, I suspect that the pair stabbed in the intestines will cause immediate death. <br /> <br /> - This movie only takes ten minutes and I can count the horror clich√©s with both hands. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> - After meeting the protagonist's girlfriend, I was confident that he would die. Who wants to bet? <br /> <br /> - The killer in this movie is a teacher who is obsessed with Donna's character (by the way everyone thinks "Ek" is a scary name for the main characters in horror movies? ) He spent three years in prison, the highest security before breaking out and found Donna celebrating her high school, Brahma. While there is no account for the taste, I seriously wonder who will spend all the time to interrupt some boring people like Donna. <br /> <br /> - High schools allow proms to happen at the hotel and Not following students. Obviously, students can buy rooms in the hotel and get out perfectly. I think if this plot doesn't happen, this movie is probably 90 minutes that people are tired of their thoughts and bite the dust when they go to the bathroom. I think their exchange of excitement is my most boredom with everything. I have already played "Counting pieces of chewing gum that are chewing under the seat" and "guessing how much money I have in my purse" and I'm just making a mark in 20 minutes. How can I entertain myself? <br /> <br /> - Know yourself: Do not forget the milk and bread on the way home. <br /> <br /> - Dear screenwriter: Have you ever feared enough to pass this movie? And all the horror movies are rebuilt this year. <br /> <br /> - This film in 1980 was not very good. But when compared to this movie, it's like Citizen Kane or at least a godfather. It had Jamie Lee Curtis in her horror movie after Halloween, and there was a little "twist" at the end. I miss Jamie Lee I hope you can do more. <br /> <br /> - There seems to be a lot of dance work. Instead of fighting with their girlfriend instead of going to college I heard the name of all these colleges being raised and I couldn't help but wondering if these women had to cheat on entrance exams. <br /> <br /> - The murderer must carry a bag. Of really effective cleaning equipment and wiping his clutter between scenes That is the only reason that explains why he stabbed the dead on the carpet or in the bathroom and when it was time for someone to go up to the room in the hotel without signs of fighting (On the other hand: this is a very lazy murderer. Michael Myers goes to hunt down the victim and speaks just that.) <br /> <br /> - Official: All audiences in the theater are deeply rooted with murderers. What happened? Donna returned to her room while the siren was instructing everyone to leave the building? Is it a constant dream of you and even after passing something amazing in the dream, she insists to confirm her steps to Or is it an unbelievable performance of Brittany Snow? I must say that it is all of the above. <br /> <br /> - Okay, who has "He died outside the screen in the third scene"? You win the pot. <br /> <br /> - Finally, the movie is over. My friend turned to me and said "Donna is not too smart." That is an exaggeration of the week. The kind of saying that a tornado is a small gust or a power outage for a week is a little inconvenient. <br /> <br /> - I can't wait to get the rotten tomatoes and see who gives. Move favorite reviews. <br /> <br /> - I can't recommend this. I refuse to recommend this This is a lazy horror movie, too, and the only way to enjoy the cheese texture is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers. And unfortunately for non-alcoholic theater patrons. <br /> <br /> Score: * from ****
