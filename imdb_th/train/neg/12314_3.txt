Maybe I'm really old. But this one just misses me and the old funny bones completely Of course, there must be something unusual with this Irish. (That is me, Schultz!) Lord, what will I see? Light! Firstly, Phil Silvers, energy, mania, intelligence and driving are part of the overall education and education in life if you want. Although it is possible that the first story series: "You Can't Get Rich" (1955-59 *) will be in the CBS television network with others in the role of Sgt. Bilko is very difficult. To see pictures of other actors / comedians in a business that wears the sergeant's coat. <br /> <br /> Such strong personalities cannot be avoided, even if not the same type of profession as Sabotage the nightmare It proved to be of other people, such as Clayton More ("The Lone RANGER"), George Reeves ("The Adventures of SUPERMAN") and Charles Nelson Riley ("UNCLE CROC'S BLOCKS") <br /> <br / > One of the major obstacles to changing and updating such works from the TV screen in 1950 is the movie that continued in 1990, which is our collective memory. Without being sure that the percentage of the crowd is remembered as the character Bilko from seeing traditional work and early corporate revival and their numbers are certainly many; Even the most young people who have seen Bilko's replay during the past time Obviously, the new movie and its origin are miles away. Or even a light year. <br /> <br /> In order not to think of a group full of old friends, please consider other issues. <br /> <br /> Here today, date 14 of November, in the year of being our Lord, 2007 I swear and confirm under the oath that I am a Steve Martin fan for almost 30 years. In addition, I also enjoy the wisdom and ability of Bilko '96 Co-Stars Dan Akroyd and Phil Hard Batman Finally, it is the ability of these men and many others, such as "NBC; s Saturday NIGHT" and "SECOND CITY TV" alumni, who made the last quarter of the 20th century laugh. But BILKO rebuilt; It doesn't click at all. <br /> <br /> Maybe if this movie was created as a Service Comedy (always like 'em!) But without the name Bilko Show and giving it its identity, it will be Highly praised by crabby, old people like me <br /> <br /> So we have a lot of comics and cartoons that have become movies recently. Then there were people who made the Army World War II comedy series of Hal Roach DOUBLEDAY & AMES and the first TV cartoon series "CRUSADER RABBIT"? Remember where you first heard! Poodle Schnitz!
