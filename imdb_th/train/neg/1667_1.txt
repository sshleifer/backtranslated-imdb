I really like this movie until the end. Of course, it's wonderful and unattractive. But still keep my attention during the rainy afternoon Until the end is For her last performance at the famous classic conservatory, where she tried to pursue a trained student, what did the other main characters do? Wow, they with her understanding and execution of this time to honor the musical tradition? No, she tortured and killed Habanera, who had a great sensibility from Carmen and turned it into a pop song in Brittany. My ears bleed! And in a time of horror, her teacher clapped her hands! Any teacher that is not in the imagination caused by the spear will make her fail immediately. Save time, save your ears - skip this movie!
