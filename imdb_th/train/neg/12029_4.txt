In general, I find that if you haven't heard about movies before watching on DVD, there may be good reasons for it. I never heard about this movie until I was in Blockbuster the previous day and saw it on the shelves. Because all good movies have been rented out (The movie that I want to watch) I think I will give this shot. <br /> <br /> It's no different from other movies in the genre, like The Singles Ward or RM. You may enjoy this. <br /> <br /> However, if you are not a Mormon, this movie may not attract you. There is no way to avoid openly religious messages (Mormons) that are inside and sometimes it is difficult and wonderful. Ultimately, if you don't fall into the Mormon group, you should be better to watch other things. <br /> <br /> Acceptable. There are some funny moments in the movie. But i don't think It is enough to salvage the overall movie.
