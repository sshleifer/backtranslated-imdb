This movie is a sad story created for sad people. I was sitting in a movie theater that ripped me apart and wanted to poke my chair because this movie made the scene become a satirical scene. And someone roared with laughter behind me, which made me wonder what kind of movies these people had to watch to enjoy this horse ** t. <br /> <br /> Nikkhil Advani has six stories Without plot And no interesting characters The script is boring. He might be drunk when he wrote the script. There is no adherence to these stories. There is nothing new, nothing to attract audiences and full of millions of conversations you've heard. One of the stories about this couple who cannot have sex because various disasters occur every time they want to do it. I mean seriously, is this really necessary? It's not funny, not creative. But proved that Advani had no funny feelings Another story (Which may be the only thing I am interested in) depends on human infidelity and ends with sorrow, sati-savitri pati-parmeshwar I do not know the plot. Salmaan-Priyanka What about There is no problem in the plot to be a plot. She can't shoot Karan Johar's movie because she has to marry Salmaan ?? Why can't she marry him and still shoot? Or Advani and Priyanaka just want to prove to the world that it is true that female actors cannot succeed if they are married or they should not act in movies when they are married? Obviously, there are six actors in this movie. Advani can't produce the movie by himself. Therefore, he took full advantage of sponsors such as the Times Group to unscruple their film fair magazine. And the jewelry brand that women in this movie seems to like for sure !! I came to IMD for the worst score and I was shocked to see the movie watching post. It shows the tragic status of Bollywood and the way the stars get the attention of the fans. When fans like this, Salaam E Ishq's films will continue to be created and may be even worse.
