The word 'true' in the title of this movie makes my alarm bell ringing. They sounded when the name card called the American Civil War was 'Interstate War' (avoidance needed by southern people to die hard) Jesse James - bandit, slave holder and murderer - was described as a quiet and gentle farm boy. <br /> <br /> This film Ruthless There is no mention of slavery, even from the fact that Jesse James's poor mother was the slave owner before the war and Jesse and his brother Frank fought to maintain slavery actively. From this movie, everyone in the civil war fought to decide whether Missouri was a northern state or a southern state ... that's all (Missouri: it's a coin! It's a breathy coin!) Black people disappear completely from this film, except for two two beggars, one beggar, one of those wearing the signal. Hand written (Some pictures of the 19th-century newspapers are not as accurate as in the 20th century fonts.) <br /> <br /> This film has a strange backward structure. very impressed (And the good work of stunt horses) and excellent editing I tasted one line of dialogue: 'Some boys will not taste the beans again.' The movie received direct information: Agnes Moorehead, as Jessie's mother, concealed her right arm in the scene after the attack by Pinkerton's agent ( Here is called 'Remington'), in which the mother of Jesse James's real life is injured Her lower arm Some mistakes here are forgiving: During the day he was in existence, Jesse James, in fact, was accidentally shot from his left middle finger. But Robert Wagner, I've seen the photos of the real wife of Jesse James; If she looks half-awesome as far as Hope Lang looks in this movie, Jesse James may be at home more. <br /> <br /> There are many new fixes here and most male actors wear. Hairstyles in 1950, but many of the film's mistakes can be avoided. William Quantrill, the mentor of Jesse James, was mentioned many times. But every actor pronounced his name wrong. We saw Jesse and his wife move into a complex two-story house. (Soon he will die) After paying the rent of $ 18, in fact, the last residence of Jesse James (at 1318 Lafayette Street, St. Joseph, Missouri) is a simple one-story cottage. Rent for $ 14, no upstairs ... so when Jesse James is killed, his wife can't run from the upper floor, as hoped for reason here (actually she is in the kitchen) <br /> <br /> One continuous error : Robert Wagner. (No double stunts) Performs impressive impressions in the back of the jaw. ... But when he gets up, his wrists are lost. <br /> <br /> Screenplay Do strange things and do not need to juggle. After attempting to rob Northfield, Jesse said he expected to return home on his birthday. The real Northfield bank robbery by James Gang (7 September 1876) for two days after Jesse James's birthday (sometimes he refers to his birthday next year). Later, we saw Jesse and his wife move into the house. St. Joseph on a hot summer day while Jesse told her what he planned to do when Christmas Eve arrived ... but in real life Mr and Mrs Jesse James moved into that house on the 24th. December 2424 ... so this scene should be * Is * on Christmas Eve! All these mistakes can be avoided. <br /> <br /> Some characters here are not reasonable. According to the film, the Northfield bank attack failed because one of the subordinates (characters) came late to cut the telegraph line. If this happens, it will hinder the escape of James Gang ... but it will not affect the robbery itself, which fails for other reasons. <br /> <br /> Have a good performance by Jeffrey. Hunter (as Frank James), Moorehead, Alan Hale Jnr (as Cole Younger) and stage actor Marian Seldes in the rare screenplay I was disappointed with Robert Wagner, an actor who was not ranked. Elsewhere, Wagner proved his impressive range by drawing heroes, villains, heroes and characters that were not morally clear. Here he seems unable to decide whether to show that Jesse James is a good person or a bad person ... so he doesn't bother. John Carradine telephoned in his performance, with a short role as a preacher who played the role of Baptist Jesse and his wife at their wedding. In fact, Jesse James was baptized at a young age by his uncle, a Methodist priest ... but perhaps the second baptism is a refill. <br /> <br /> Jesse James is not a Robin Hood (I suspect Robin Hood is Robin Hood as well, but it is another story). There are no examples of Jesse James's documents that used to share his gifts with anyone outside of his family. After some ups and downs, he didn't separate the wreath with other gangs. In this movie, Jesse was shot after he vowed to stop the robbers forever. In fact, the night before he died, Jesse James and Ford brothers stole the horse that Jesse had planned to use the next day to rob the Black Platt bank. In order to prepare for most of his robbery, Jesse James stole horses from farmers in the area ... the same poor villagers that (In the wrong legend) benefited from his donation I went to one scene where Jesse James wore a poem, which he disagreed with, oil painting that shows tasteful nude pictures. <br /> <br /> 'True story (not much!) Jesse's story. James is a dishonest person about murderers, thieves, and deliberately dishonest about the civil war. For an impressive stunt, a good photo montage, and a few great performances, I would rate this film in disrespectful 2 stories from 10 points.
