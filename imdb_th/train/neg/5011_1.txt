... and I never thought which movie was worthy of winning 1! But this is the worst movie I've ever watched. My wife picked it up because of the actors. But the story is correct since the DVD box seems to be quite predictable. It's not a mystery or a movie that attracts children. It does not include any feelings if that is what the name may suggest you. This is just all. Do not waste your time or money until you feel like watching many children in a growing Gothic environment. Nothing new. Nothing interesting. Nothing to see. Max Makowski makes Nick Stahl the worst.
