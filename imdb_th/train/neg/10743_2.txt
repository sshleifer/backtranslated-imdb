This movie is really bad with a chapter full of memorable songs and unbelievable performances. Special effects are not good as well. (Not the worst I have ever seen) and the music is so bad that you have to listen to believe. There are only two short themes (30 seconds long) over and over throughout the movie. One of the worst movies I've ever seen
