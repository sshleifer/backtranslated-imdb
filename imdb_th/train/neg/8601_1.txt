OK, where can we start with this little gem? Mutant slugs began to take hold of New England (?). Small, only one man could stop them ... and the man ... was Mike Brady! Now, if it's still not laughing, keep tracking. <br /> <br /> The image of a slug is something known as a stock image. No matter who they are attacking or where they are, they will see the same slugs and ammunition everywhere. Please note that this singular image takes at least half of the movie. <br /> <br /> The performance in this movie falls down, dragging out, stealing your purse. I'm sure it's worse. But you will face pressure The only gem is ... You can guess ... Mike Brady! He had to attend YMCA for a few nights because he was the best in the group. <br /> <br /> Horror stories? This film should not be taken seriously. No horror! The horns cried out loud. All the additional actions can be avoided with a salt shake machine or two. See only this movie in the MST3K environment, otherwise I can see significant damage to the brain.
