Dereks seems to be struggling to find Bo for "after 10". <br /> <br /> I used to work for a marine park in the Florida Keys. One day, the script for "The Ghost Can't Do" is circulating among Instructor in "Ban Pla", which is preparing food for dolphins. There is a scene where - Dolphin - should be a proposal Bo (or Bologna) by asking "make eggs". Read the script. We-lauuughed -... <br /> <br /> We can't. Take part in this movie at our factory, even though our dolphins are in "The Big Blue!" <br /> <br /> This must be near the end of Anthony Quinn's life. I hope he will enjoy this movie because of course it doesn't do anything for his legacy.
