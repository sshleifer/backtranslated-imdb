The traditional "end point" is a great way. The characters that look realistic and natural. The new creation is terrible. The preaching is too clear. It missed the point of why the original was original. The black charger is cool. But can't help this flick Why be with a white challenger? I don't think it's the best choice in the year 71. Some of the movies are unintentionally hilarious. Like when Vigo stood on a cliff overlooking the valley after his "Dream Quest", his Indian friend stood beside him. Vigo only wore his white pants. I'm sorry - it looks ridiculous - he explores the scenery in Another scene of his Fruit of the Looms is at the end - after the explosion in the bulldozer, the announcer says that the effect will be clocked at 180 miles per hour. He then said that the police said that he had not found his carcass because he had evaporated. But some people believe that he was bailed and hid in the crowd Then showed him that he was rolling out of the car at 180 miles per hour! First of all, you cannot open the car door at 180 miles per hour. Secondly, the car will not travel continuously in a straight line for 100 years. No one steer. It will immediately turn around 30 times. Third, if you reach the sidewalk at 180 miles per hour, you will have to find strange things, whether we see him at the end, standing with his daughter. Overall, the movie will insult anyone's intelligence.
