Yesterday I saw the movie Flyboys and my girlfriend told me that it was the worst movie she had seen ... because I thought it was terrible as well. I think - which movie is the worst movie that I've seen and this is The only movie that reminds <br /> <br /> It's a shame that it's been a couple of years since I saw it. But I remember Dean Adam and Eve as a good-looking military soldier.) A strange deal with a CGI helicopter when it might be cheaper to rent a helicopter than to hire CGI-guys. But I guess They found that the helicopter was a free sample for the CGI program or the manufacturer's son. Like playing with his new computer How is it? Scary and when the dragon flies through the corridor of the complex, then bringing the same image over and over again - looks very cheap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie - it's really scary ...
