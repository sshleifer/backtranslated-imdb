In addition to the great movie James Wong Howe, which is excellent in the fight scene, this film is also a real foul-smelling. <br /> <br /> This is the second movie I saw on the last day directed by Alexander. The first Korda is Charles Laughton's "Rembrandt". It's so bad that I turn off the machine. This one, I'm afraid it's not going to be much better. <br /> <br /> Flora Robson is ugly like Queen Elizabeth. Maybe her performance as a Queen is pure for the 1937 standard. But when you compare to Helen's Mirren is not exactly the same. In the form of a robot, Robson says her style The message of her struggle for the British army is tiring. <br /> <br /> Even Laurence Olivier, who has the ability to save this most boring thing, <br /> <br /> Future wife Vivien Leigh is in a supporting role here, and she doesn't convey anything here if I think Scarlett is 2 years later! <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the history of Spanish Armada was created to be boring in this movie.
