Spoiler will be in this This movie should be better if they have different script directors and CGI service providers. Not right? This movie has a man starting his own amusement park ... uh ... zoo on a deserted island where people can see dinosaurs ... uh ... Sabretooths and it's called Jurra ... Ouch ... Primal Park. I don't mind copying because there is no original idea for this type of movie. But this one just hit your face with it. There are even things. "Shadow of life on design" Non-sabretooths Sabretooths as Mr. Primal Park (an ancient cat that kills) are rubbish, but the ultimate success is what I call "Sloggy" because after eliminating one big cat One hero is slightly relaxed because there is only one left. Enter the person who eats strange food that says Nah. We created three. The third is a monster that pulls himself around with a great face. Student groups are still on the island to hunt scavengers. With ancient ideas or sorting (Always thought of wanting a short nickname) from the living person, only one person completed his duties, so I was fired Oh yes, the compulsor "The evil capitalist must die" is effective without anyone but two people! The death of Mr. Primal Park is the most ridiculous thing you will see in a movie while the bottle of the statue of a Sabretooth is loose (courtesy of Sloggy). If I get it easily, I like "Sabretooth" better than this machine.
