"Celebrate all saints?" Which ...? When ...? <br /> <br /> The story of the Feast of All Saints and the theme has been fixed? <br /> <br /> The lost thing of the great name! There is nothing in the story that has the most distant connection with "The celebration of the saint" There is no story in the story about "All Souls Day", which this reference Why use this name if you never intend to put any stories or themes about "All Souls Day" or "Feast of All Saints"? <br /> <br /> Scripting and amateurs at <br /> <br /> How bad is it that they attract such great talent to this clunker? Amateur writing - a character known throughout their lives to a great speech about their life history for the benefit of the audience. <br /> <br /> The director thinks <br /> <br /> The director is also bad! The style that is too compulsive and contemplative makes you feel unskilled. In one scene, the characters are shouting. "Take your hand away from me" and no one touches him! However, the worst scene is the unbeatable battle scenes at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> Too much gore in the very fake Silly battle scene. <br /> <br /> There are many dead people. Much in the most fake fight scenes Seems to be a skit on Saturday night !! You can see special things waiting for the guides to walk across the camera. Everyone plays the scene of their death as a child. 4 The blood that is the victim of the fight is too much and is not used carefully. It seems that people use the tomato sauce dispenser and spray the red line on the costume. <br /> <br /> All of the fighting scenes come out. Magic War Movie You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride and forward the airline. <br /> <br /> Who in real life will ever do this? <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous thing to write, direct and select is the focus of the scene: <br /> <br /> The little girl is standing under the body of her hanging father. -Who was terribly destroyed and the blood dripped from a truly gaping wound Even an idiot knows that he's dead! Even so, she is a monotonous person over and over again, "Father, Father ..." while looking at someone outside the screen. She gives you as much confidence and passion as you would expect from a non-actor who acts as a call for the camera all day long. <br /> <br /> Although a poor child will have Any acting skill, completely unbelievable scenes The little girl didn't even stay in the battlefield after several hours of murder - surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies while she stood peacefully !! The natural instinct will make children scream and fear, run away from bloodshed killings! <br /> <br /> We think it's scary or laughing ...? <br /> <br /> One of the stupid details that makes the scene have a satirical tone. SNL is the scene that Father hangs with. A large request through his mouth and cheeks He looks like a fish in the hook! Funny details that are not intended to make the whole scene a fake and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> In fantasy, La-La-Land, mother and daughter are the same age! <br /> <br /> Another funny detail is that you see the main character - the mother of the little girl - at the end of the scene and in the next scene that happened 20 years later. She looks the same. ! She is young and beautiful and now is the same age as her daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost closed the movie there because the direction and writing were terrible - but I tried to separate it because I wanted to see Louisiana's settings and I like all actors. I don't know what these good actors are thinking when they accept these roles. <br /> <br /> Who is the target audience? <br /> <br /> Too much blood and use. Severe violence in The opening scene is strange, with a vocal tone. It is also a strange way to start a movie where the rest of the time seems like a goal to love a woman reading a novel. Strange inconsistencies in tone!
