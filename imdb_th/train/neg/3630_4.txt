Must assume that those who watch this movie ("The greatest opera ever filmed" I didn't read somewhere?) Not interested in opera. Ignore Wagner or ignore anything except. Their desire to appear culture Whether representing Wagner's Swan song or this movie made me a disaster that was not affected by reading scores leading to matching with complicated and crazy messages. > <br /> It's a wonder that people who have an idea of ​​opera (Or for stories that play, especially one by Shakespeare) is "about" should be allowed anywhere near the theater or movie studio; Syberberg is very modern, but without the smallest reason from Wagner's message, decides that Parsifal is "about" integrating bisexual, so the character's name in the later stages transforms into a Niki baby, even if those who still sing high. Young age, if any actor in the movie is a singer, and we have Armin Jordan, a musician who is seen as a face (But did not hear the sound) of Amfortas, twice as double as the kind of Batonzilla or the conductor who ate Monsalvat during the play of the Good Friday song - which by the way that the great love of nature is represented by Shopworn scattering and flaccid crocuses In the theater, sometimes we have to separate imperfections with our thoughts. But I cannot think of why Cyberberg cannot be interconnected for Parsifal and Gurneez, a lush mountain meadow as Julie Andrews in Sound of Music .. <br /> < br /> Sound difficult to withstand the highs and horns, especially with the glare of the ears that add another type of fatigue to our jitters with uncontrollable actions and paralysis. Of the ceremony playoff Some people in the review again mentioned the biometrics of 1951 and Knappertsbusch. Although his tempe is often very slow, there are things that Jordan lacks the sense of pulse, the sense of decline and the flow of music - and after half a century. The orchestra's sound in that scene in the modern media still prevails over this film.
