See No. 1 12/24/2009 ?? 4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): The Christmas mood is not specific enough to explain how the real story happened in the events that followed the facts of the man. One that was wrongly imprisoned for his family to make Christmas happen for them. Three children in the family fled home while traveling to Washington DC for help from President Herbert Hoover of the United States. This trek provides stories such as their positive encounters with hobo and puppeteer, which makes the story like a movie. Disney's "Animal of the Term" and not suitable here At the end there was no details about how the president helped the family and this was another disadvantage for the movie in my opinion. Eventually this film will make tears. But eventually it takes a long time This film should not be the original TV movie. (As IMD) but it has obviously faded away that makes it look like this ?? So I'm not sure if their information is correct. All of this is a simple movie. (Which may be more complicated) with a story similar to Christmas But playing politely and without much content
