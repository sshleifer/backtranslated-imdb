I've watched West on British TV for decades, and I still don't know until yesterday, showing that most other Western Scott came every few years or more, and it is always worth watching. <br /> <br> Good color and outdoor outfits But that's all I can say about this movie. I have to agree with other negative comments that have already been made. Many times I feel like I want to close it, and eventually I do halfway.
