I was surprised by Alone in the Dark. It's terrible. I hardly believe what I see. There are no characters, just a pattern. Only a few walk around and get killed. The scope of character development is to name and occupy each character. There is no real plot, and the characters don't seem to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes have just begun by themselves, from where to pound the techno tracks. While I was watching this movie, I still asked. "Where did this happen?" The performance was a quality drama in high school with a hard delivery as the actors were reading from the queue card without understanding their script. Their problem in sending signals makes it more clear with the awesome sound design. Listen to the ADR sounds like being recorded in the open room. The actors have been taken care of clearly all the time to make their mark, looking at the robot almost in their movements. Therefore, vehicles that do not have these items will be pulled through a series of unbelievable and confusing situations that often will not benefit from the changing scene. They are here, now they are there. This is happening. Random scenes with a touch or a little reason I really enjoyed watching it. Of course, not worth nine dollars.
