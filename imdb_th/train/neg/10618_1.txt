This film has a terrifying horror and is a hand to those who have been raped. On the surface, it may be a brave movie about rape. But if you dig under the surface, what is in it is a positive message about the rape of Aishwarya. Those who have been raped are victims who are unable to cope because she is a woman. She needs a man to help her when Society creates jibes about her and expresses her opinions. She will not stand for herself. It was left for Anil Kapoor to do everything he said while Aishwarya did everything weeping. <br /> <br /> Satish Kaushik walked down the wrong way by showing that the rape victim was weak and willing. lose What is more effective is to portray a strong woman who rebelled against her enemies in a brave way. The director is famous for being a magician. His movies are often full of weak women. But he tried to hide in the controversial role He wants to learn that because that role is debatable, it doesn't mean that her character is strong. <br /> <br /> The worst scene in the movie is when Aishwarya clears herself after being raped. She made to please the father who thought she was dirty now. Even though it is commendable that Shah shows shame on the victims of rape by the light. But what he did not show us was Ash's father wrong with making his daughter or not. For this reason, we have messages that are confusing about rape. <br /> <br /> Humor is not necessary for such a strong movie. Moreover, funny movies are not funny. Ash has a role while Anil Kapoor does nothing but shout. The song is moderate, except for the title song, which is a beautiful picture. (The only bright spot of this film) The role of Sonali Bendre is disappointing and useless. Overall, what might be a great movie that will be remembered as a terrible mistake that will make the audience violent.
