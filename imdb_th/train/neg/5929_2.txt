People who appreciate this movie are a real disappointment - I hope at least that Leonard will see the good things from this story because his savings were embezzled from the manager a couple of years ago. This is really scary. At first, Leonard said that he did not feel his past feelings, and then an hour and a half, the movie would emphasize the worst emotional element of Leonard's music. It is a very precious blood by shooting close-ups of singers who are more emotional than endless. Cohen's interview was finished in a lo-fi closeup and I wanted to see the medium or long shots of his entire body! I don't care about the opinions of the performers less than this, especially the marginalized Ego and Bono. There are no actors in this film, making even one song that is as good as Leonard's music, and if you think of seeing this and you have any doubts, this may be a special PBS program that is acceptable. one But I would hesitate to get a DVD from this story Finally, when the film shows Leonard's "Tower of Song", it was destroyed by Bono, even the occasional good performance. (Anthony, the first number of Rufus Martha, the traitor) was destroyed by the context of the rest of Turbain. Forget this album and go buy Leonard's latest album if you want to pay him.
