I hate this movie I hate acting I hate everything about it. It's annoying and silly. Everyone says that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and they're going to make it big. What kind of drugs are you using? !!!?!?!?!?! Nat and alex are going to end as well, whether it's Hobos or Jane Hudson's end. "What happened to Baby Jane "Can I only do more than 20 minutes in this show? 30 seconds of the show and I can survive for about half an hour of 'Battle of the Bands'. Everyone can cheer for these audiences at the Kid's Choice Awards. How do I have no clue The day before Nick's premiere, most teen actresses in Nick (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw and others) appeared in commercials that influenced children who died in the brain. First of all, they didn't fool me, and secondly, nat and alex may use drugs or pay a lot of money to speak and sound reliable because I don't see who can find this item / entertainment movie. The music is terrible. Nat's singing sounds uncomfortable. Alex is the most annoying movie / TV character ever. He's not funny. He's annoying. He's really weird and he thinks he's hot and knows everything about women. This guy is lucky if he can handle it. You know that this item is fake when you find some characters. (In real life) no even !! The character Jesse plays by Nat and Jess's cousin Alex Draper. (They have a budget problem). Their father is not single. He is married to Polly Draper. But she does not appear on the show, making it seem that Wolfe is a little mother. Rosalina does not exist as well. Her name is Al Di Medico. I will tell you that the naked brother must be in a deep place. ** When their "fans" discover that the whole thing is the scene 0/10
