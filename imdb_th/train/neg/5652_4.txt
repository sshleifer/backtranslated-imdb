This is not a bad movie ... but it is the type that your boyfriend makes you see. Not bad .... It just makes a half hour long It's hard for me to leave this movie because I really like the idea of ​​it, but it's just a long and thin story ... very bad. I mean to pass something "Change your life" and he can hardly smile Maybe I won't "get" this movie. If anyone can explain to me, I would love to be informed.
