This may be the worst movie ever created to make Roger Corman's name worse. I can understand it in his early years when he has a reduced budget. But today there is no excuse to give birth to this! I am a "B" person in the movie, misuse and from some people the view that all the flicks that I love are kept by "regular audiences" but use my words in this vampire club making the top of that list. best It is hard to imagine that vampires without fangs score music completely. The sound effects are ineffective, and eventually Mr.Savage doesn't seem to know that he's in a vampire movie that all witches are too bad. Because he always has a "bad" career, let me know that I'm trying hard on this issue when I don't like movies. I often forget that it's a good thing.
