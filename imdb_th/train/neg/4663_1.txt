This movie is terrible. I love war movies and normally can come out of most movies and find what I like. But this is not one of them This film has no content and violence. OK, I understand. Finn is one of the hell of a fight and that's great. But the story was not well told You do not have a real connection with any characters and there is no real story to follow. You just go from one scene to another, nothing happens in creating a story that tries to convey. If you want a war movie that will make you pinned and amazingly, without a fight scene, I will recommend "Downfall" (German movies, World War II) or if you like great stories and lots of action, I recommend " Brotherhood of War "(Korean War / Korean Movie) These two films will not let you down as the winter war is done.
