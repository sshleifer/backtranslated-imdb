I noticed that previous reviewers (Which seems to be still at school) gave very good reviews, and I can assume that this is because the reviewer did not see the excellent BBC BBC adaptation of the 1989 classic novel. With this model (1999) is the selection of Anthony Way as Tom Long. Anthony Way is a talented boy who shot for fame after appearing in the TV mini series "The Choir". I guess If only he had been playing the role of Tom Long on the strength of his excellent performance in "The Choir" Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in. "Choir" has grown into a towering child at the time "Tom Midnight Garden" filmed and Anthony failed to convince Tom's school children. It is far beyond imagination to believe that Tom (Played by Anthony) will be friends with the younger Hatti in 1989. The BBC version of Tom and Hatty is very close in the era and the development of their friendship is very reliable. more For the 1999 film, although the special effects are not persuasive and there are no obvious improvements in the 1989 TV effects, the casting and performances of this model are inferior to the previous adaptations. This and in this movie is a true classic version From the last observation, I will point out that the VHS of the 1989 BBC version can do better than the second hand. Â£ 20.00 While the new DVD of this model can be purchased for less than 5.00 pounds, would I like to say more? ?
