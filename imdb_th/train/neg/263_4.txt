After working all day, I sat down to relax and open a movie channel. This movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting, so I adjusted it before it started. The first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested. But the lack of acting ability in Jamie Foxx and the slow movement made me want to get up and find food in the movie. If there is any credit for the film's performance, go to David Morse, at least trying to make this movie interesting. Unable to plan to impress your friends by choosing this person as a tenant in the movie night.
