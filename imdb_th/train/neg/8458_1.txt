I bought this movie last weekend at my local Movie Gallery. It bought 2 free 2 free and I needed one more so I chose this one. Horrible mistake The box reads like it would be a really good movie. It started out like it would be this great movie about 5 minutes, that is This film is about a Lila girl who was killed trying to save Jack from her cow. Laila's father, Cordobes, is the man who took the job of the people of the city. He assumed that Jack killed Layla because she was afraid of this cow and went on a hunt to find him. That was a good first 5 minutes. What followed later would be 100 times worse. Anyone who wrote the script in thought My must have some acid travel or something because nothing makes me feel anything like ever. Jack is running away and finds this DJ named Mary, who travels on the radio. I think Mary should be a pure Mary character. You know the mother of Jesus. But who knows I can't make heads or tails? As they are running ... we will see bad people, magic pictures, horrific encounters, past events, etc ... and all of these things do in the way that your brain hurts from trying to figure out. What's happened No need to say that I brought this movie back and exchanged it for something else. It's terrible that I told you it's scary. And there is no fierce battle in this film Unless you count the first minute of the movie Hopefully I will help others not to waste time on this movie.
