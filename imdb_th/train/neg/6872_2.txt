This list has a good story. But with bad conversations The main character is particularly annoying. Clearly, why this show was canceled, even though, like most UPN programs, I never knew that it would be republished again. <br /> <br /> Most plots seem to be copied From another list And the movie makes me think that the producers don't have the original idea in their heads. <br /> <br /> I haven't commented enough. You must have at least ten lines of text. Special effects are not bad for the show in 2001. <br /> <br /> The aphorism is a good character.
