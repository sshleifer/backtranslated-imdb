This movie, even though it's a comedy But is a serious matter Its topic is imperialism. (Whose capital is me): The way in which England is foolishly insulted, trying to convince himself that it is still a great power after the Second World War. At the imperial house, operated by the kind-hearted dolphins of the species that they cannot distinguish close relatives The government office consists of long forgotten archives (dug at the Orwellian paranoid?) Who live in merciless rats and an anthologies room where the living room has a bored and read popular fiction. br /> <br /> Foreign old pomp But the pomp from the context looks flaky and stupid, especially when it is embodied in the twits of a mistake. Carlton-Brown is a depressing image without the decay of lachrymose that destroys gems that oppose imperialism at that time < br /> <br /> This film is about the cold war bravely accepting it as The danger that participants deserve to be ridiculed and insulted, not afraid and respectful. It's about colonization, abandonment rather than dictatorship, destruction of colonies in which they rob, rob, facilities, power, and most importantly self-respect, allowing them to risk being exposed to dangerous cattle. <Br /> <br /> It's definitely serious to kill it. That is not to say that the weighty subjects cannot be treated with jokes - The Miracle Of Morgan's Creek, Dr. Strangelove and The Life Of Brian have proven that Of course we may suggest that serious themes should be treated by comedians only - it helps to see more clearly. <br /> <br /> Carlton-Browne's problem Is that every situation must be more important than just a cartoon So it weighed down and did not act In the three films mentioned above, most of the humor comes from the reaction of the characters to the extreme situation, not the extreme situation. Here, the script is not too good to preserve the richest cartoon characters and the greatest talent ever assembled - Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, Raymond Huntley and John le Mesurier - lose criminals. <br /> <br / > Terry - Thomas sublimely often shows that he is unable to deal with the leadership and he needs to play cynicism. This song was created for most comedy shows. But it is a heavy irony that draws attention to the lack of buzz on the screen (To be fair, unlike most British comedies of that era, which are fierce and bad, Boultings often try to score through movies by editing and sorting) Huntley can only laugh. Truly The character he can play in sleep mode <br /> <br /> Now, the forces of Boultings do not have a good day - they have never thought enough. Although Carlton-Browne Will enjoy the decline of the empire But it seems to be against democracy and military I'm sure this isn't there. But these mistakes will happen if you allow the intended intent to be more important than intelligence, cartoons and movies.
