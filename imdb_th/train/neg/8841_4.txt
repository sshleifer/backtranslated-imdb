Parasomnia has interesting places But the story is not well done without tension or even a rational approach Actors in unbelievable stories, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who played a major role in movies such as Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest of the actors are unknown. (And not very good) except for Jeffrey Combs (Herbert West from the Re-Animator animated trilogy), but he can play this role in his sleep (Which is the little thing he did here) The main problem is that the actions of the characters are not reasonable at all. The story is quite boring and predictable with a cheap computer effect mixed with some scenes that are full of blood, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> It should be better. Really below average
