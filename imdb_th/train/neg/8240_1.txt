Don't waste time watching this! If you don't want to study all the wrong things, you shouldn't make a good movie. I'm not the only one who always watched movies. But this is a personal matter I wasted precious time that they couldn't give back. I feel compelled to write this report to remind others that you don't waste time watching this shit. If this is a student project, I must say that it is not bad, but for the first 15 minutes ... After that it is annoying. Bad screams, bad videos (A good camera can make it better.) And what is the effect of the Blair-Witch? No budget. I hope that it will be better But not so Now, is it what the hell deserves 4? 2 is more fair but 1 for wasting my time! I'm talking about peace.
