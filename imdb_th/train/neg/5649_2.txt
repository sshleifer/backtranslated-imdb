I don't think this is worse than acting under the right conditions. I accept the first season. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a show about a lawyer who is not a lawyer. God forbid anyone to go to law school according to these lists, which I have heard is the case when I watch the interview of the program. It makes me have to shut my mouth. <br /> <br /> In addition, Spader and Shatner, who should be the star in the program, are the most annoying. Although this may be a compliment in some situations But certainly not here At first, they insulted women on the list as a joke. But since that's what they really do all the time, I realize that this is the deepest thing that the program will receive. Trying to separate the intense, dramatic moments and even the ridiculous moments in the middle of this true performance failed to compensate for the increased loss of interest I was experiencing trying to perform. <br /> <br Alan Shor is colorful and "Public service announcements" that are free of charge, which he throws out his comments, do not create a very annoying Denny Crane impression. I feel embarrassed for him and for writers on the crane speeches that wear the machine Colonial dress <br /> <br /> I gave two stars because there was a time when I thought of trying to deal with some contemporary issues. Made with care. <br /> <br /> I think the listener realizes that sexual abuse at Denny and Alan shows that it's a distressing issue, even for those who have invited them since. first This is I do not care whether or not treatment of sexual harassment in the program is good. But I just felt that the author insulted me by instilling sexuality in acting with the hope that my libido would make me come back again. I am no longer a teenager and I think this program promises not to. Respond to those who get the lowest score. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm writing this story after me. Realized that it would not be better It's a shame because it's one of the items I want to love.
