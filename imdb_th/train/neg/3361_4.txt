This movie is one of the greatest movies ever. Incredible performances, great special effects ...... Oh, I must think of a good movie. This is not one of them. Just suck. <br /> <br /> What I want to know is what kind of bone the head thinks that this movie is 10 when I vote. There are 206 stories. God knows what will happen. Now, for other voting, 8 or 9 is too high, but the score is 10 ??? Come, what makes this movie so good to be 10. I know that these are the same 206 that Jean Claude Van Damme thinks is a great actor.
