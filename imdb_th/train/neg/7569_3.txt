Suitable for Axis & Allies moments. Play espionage throughout North Africa and the rest of the world. It's not the best of movies. But it's not the worst of the budget movies, as explained earlier from the War Classics collection. <br /> <br /> Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo is very good in his first documentary. I enjoyed the show very much Harry's Park (credit Parkyarkarkus) why he did not play a role greater than me. He plays the perfect partner / companion and saves the movie ... imho <br /> <br /> As mentioned, this film is part of a budget package from Superbox-Mart, named War Classics, eight films for eight dollars, including movies that have never heard about good stars. Some people try to pay bills. <br /> <br /> This script ... well, not hot. A lot of editing and movies are ... worse if you can go through all these things and want to see the future of Cisco Kid and the tragic sidekick that never fulfills his true potential to pick it up. As before! Otherwise there will be other WW2 movies to see. <br /> <br /> - Thunderossa
