Human muscles - monkeys in Africa's forests are hunted by opportunistic exploration teams; The lovely daughter of the team leader met him first. The story of Tarzan, a model with a lot of stuttering, has produced OK. But disabled with the worst direction of movies I've seen John Derek is too inspired to take a slow action shot and look at Berek's undressed body; He is as talented as Ed Ed. Trying to find mouth-to-mouth sex. Dereks lack quick flair and taste. They have feelings for themselves, mocking and abandoning courage. (They were careful in the wind) but after promising to open it all, it will go to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (which may have a marble in his mouth all the time) plays the title role but plays the third fiddle for John's ego. Derek and Bo Derek's ego of their own importance * from ****
