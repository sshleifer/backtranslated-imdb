OK, besides the psychedelic background image, the information presented here is good. Music that I can do without (Not that it's a bad song But it is not suitable for this movie. <br /> <br /> For the content of the movie - the lack of views of the pagans on the existence of Christ and the comparison of actions and events in the life of the monk A shocking Christian with the life of a person / legendary god such as Mithra and Dionyses. He then presents the sequence of the origins of Christianity and presents the case 'OK' but not the one that made me disappointed. br /> If the director is stuck with the facts and continues with them well, however, at this point in the film, it dissolves into a group of unsatisfactory personal attacks on "Passion of the Christ" of Mel Gibson and a Christian private school that the director attended in his youth During an interview with his former headmaster (Which during that time was the story that the director established under false pretense) I felt that the director behaved like a child He asked a good question. But just like the movie, the interview failed to attack the rules of this private school, not Christianity. <br /> <br /> All if you're interested in information, see the first 30 minutes or more then close.
