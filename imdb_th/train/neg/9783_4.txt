It's not the worst movie I've ever seen. But not very good I am a paintball player. I've played a lot of airball and the transition from the jungle to the airball is a big change. This movie has a similar quality. First of all, the first movie begins with this team, which is clearly trying to shoot the "Phantom" guy or whatever. They seem to be a professional team and wear a T-shirt and a shot. C A man plays a bunch of sports. Not very wrong with this movie. But it's a wonderful story. A group of children who are good people are woodsball players who don't seem to have much money and have a dream of getting a better gun. Other teams choose them all the time and scold them because they play wild and blah blah blah. Ghosts help these woodsball kids out and train them and all this shit. He makes them play airball and beat the whole team, including "Professional" <br /> <br /> What is this movie? Budget is a great thing. Paintball movies are not bad. But the budget is relatively low and the movie feels that it was created by amateurs. There is no big name in this movie and the performance is wonderful. The recognition of paintball is not good as well. They seem to imply that everyone is going to pull the ball and all the other shit. This is a lousy movie in my opinion and does not give real awareness of what paintball is. In actual speaking, paintball is not a friend that likes everyone. It has a lot of insults and bonuses, not "respect" and play according to rules. Do not watch this movie and expect the screams of the field. "4 is 1! ! "
