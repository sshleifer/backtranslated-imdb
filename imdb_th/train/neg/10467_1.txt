If there is a call to create a bad movie that reflects the stupidity of humanity that will happen, this movie will be rewarded. The plot focuses on the biblical prophecies hidden in the hidden text in the Bible, which encourages gangsters seeking power to try to control the world completely. How does this writer believe in reality? <br /> <br /> The performance is not as good as it should be. Kasper Van Dee lost his ability to make this movie. Michael York's work is a fair match for this chapter because he is the center of the movie and works well. <br /> <br /> This story is very nasty and annoying. No gentle or young mind should see this movie. This is a good and evil basic planning method that is lost. <br /> <br /> There must be many mental illnesses floating around the movie circle looking for ways to market this type of waste. Must have some checks to get PG-13 points, but it's still bad.
