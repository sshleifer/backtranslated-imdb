When I bought this DVD, I thought: "It's a good joke about love and relationships created in Portuguese standards, right? I'm all wrong! It's a disappointing movie! First of all, it's not a joke. It's a cheap drama that can be seen as a lot of fun, even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Secondly, the plot is very boring and nowhere ?? It has no structure. It flows like the wind in either direction. Production is not good as well! The sound mixing is terrible because sometimes the sound is disconnected. It reminds me of old Portuguese movies from the 80s ?? Should the show be better too? In conclusion, it is not in this movie that the Portuguese cinema will improve! In fact, it's one of the worst Portuguese movies I've ever seen in recent years! Bad controversy, poor performances, bad production? I don't have high hopes for this movie. But it's much worse than I imagined! Forget it!
