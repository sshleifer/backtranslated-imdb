Do not be deceived because it is a review that is 'shining' quoted in the DVD box. "Seriously entertaining", "Serious horror mania" and the worst is "ON PAR with JAWS". This movie doesn't have any problems. <br /> <br /> Normally I Don't worry about writing bad reviews for movies. But I can't believe that this movie will stop at 7, which is comfortable in IMDb. That was left by a lazy scientist, this film is nowhere and it goes flawlessly Basically and unlikely, one girl was a monster. (I will rate them in the design of good living. But this is not the creation of WETA) and her semi-comedy family spent one and a half hours following her ... in the sewers around the Han River. Their search is no doubt again. Has anyone called this Jaws and when they met her, you knew it was useless? In addition, many large films are committed to quarantine the government, which ends in a funny scene involving a man spraying water in front of a crowded bus stop. <br /> <br / > Blech. It's terrible. I'm not kidding. Do you want to see rotten monster movies? Deep Rising rentals, at least you'll save 30 minutes in your life.
