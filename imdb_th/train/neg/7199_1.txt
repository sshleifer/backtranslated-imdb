why?!! This is a movie that is not interesting, boring and disgraceful. The embarrassment comes from being in the city where they created it ... Pittsburgh PA! Why are they allowing these people to make BAAAAAD movies there? <br /> <br /> When the film was released in the beginning ... it was a romantic comedy ... everything changed. Why follow Disney's cuteness? They interpret this classic cartoon character very badly. Seeing Matthew Broderick makes fun of his movies is not fun too. Sheesh !!
