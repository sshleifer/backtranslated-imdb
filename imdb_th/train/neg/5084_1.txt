I watched this movie twice I can't believe that Pinyin made fantasy movies. I am also a movie / theater director and I know what I say. This is not Romania anymore. But I saw the event being happening at the same time as the event from 11 September. There is no story, no plot, nothing. No conclusion, no text, nothing profound, nothing hidden. Just an empty picture. <br /> <br /> What most Romans don't know about this movie is for the French audience. They believe that this is true in Romania. In addition, for teenagers, Pintilie should stop making movies. I don't really know that we will call this movie that may be a horror movie :) and we wonder why we have pictures in Europe. This is true But not anymore One of my best friends from the British Embassy said: "How long do you not know how long Romanian people walked from Ceausescu?"
