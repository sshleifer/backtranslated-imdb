When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was airing in the United States, I was very excited. Then I was unlucky to see what was darned. I love the books of M. C. Beaton about the great Scottish police. The characters in this book are fun and well written. The power that is responsible for this mistake has never read one of Beaton's books. Only the name "Hamish Macbeth" is related to the series. In addition to the lack of familiar characters, I found that all performances were too loud. It seems that the actors feel that they have to shout and scream each other. If you love M. Beaton Macbeth's cute Hamish, don't waste time on this garbage.
