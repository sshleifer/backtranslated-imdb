This popular production has fans, but in translating the classic 'Mary Reilly' bad comments, Moby Dick is like a slower painting. <br /> <br /> Because of the philosophical reasons of the movie. "Production" has never created a great movie. Instead of lacking a strong idea (In this case, for changing the book into a movie) with items that do not impair hope But didn't despise the attempt to deceive the audience to think that they saw greatness Because the audience and critics are likely to fail in this regard, Oscar follows up with the food of the stupid equation. <br /> <br /> I'm not involved in all the comments that the investigators found in Moby Dick. Unbelievably outstanding Actors have read articles about Jonah, Moby Dick, Ocean, Moby Dick, Moby Dick, ... everything that cannot be responded and not one of the interesting chapters. It's very inert It's not created In terms of storytelling, Moby Dick (as a movie) is more than just a summary of the story. After half an hour, I muttered that "Oh, it's great ... swear again ... 4 minutes alone!" <br /> <br /> In an attempt to fail to share with you There are many gray hairs here. Starbuck should be a golden god (!) <br /> <br /> One knows who is looking for a great director when he creates his own media instead of trying to repeat feelings. Of other people's drawings and dishes or classic reverence such as Huston made here. Paintings and books are good things But it is a different medium The film failed to understand that the Village of the Damned piece was better in terms of respect than a culture that could not endure. This is the movie making school, Eat Your Vegetables. <br /> <br /> One person admires the work that needs to be done to create a movie. But not a story There are only a few groups that reflect interesting marine research. The log of the cottage is a method of construction, work & various marine efforts; And the technology of whaling And that did not call the movie two hours
