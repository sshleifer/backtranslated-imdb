Okay, I won't criticize this movie in depth. I noticed many comments beforehand, and while I liked Maria de Medeiros, I was hesitant to express insulting comments and in this way almost a year has passed. But every time I see that DVD on my shelf, I will feel the groan inside. Okay, let the sound of consciousness replace me! But for other movies like me - be careful. <br /> <br /> Express yourself in a simple and gentle manner. This is my position: <br /> <br /> Political turmoil and overthrow of the background. Of this film serves as The backdrop for a moment in my life - through the newspaper I read every day in my European Central Pub. At that time I followed the sports news. But never fully understood what happened Journalists tend to report both non-partisan or conservatives that frown on any group that disturbs peace or rebellion against the establishment. That was the time when other unrest continued through Paris, Berlin, Prague and various places in the United States. All the problems I understood clearly at that time - but dictatorship or not, my documents tend to be treated. To the rule of Portugal The establishment - not a "kingdom of evil", well in the use of the sudden Star War. <br /> <br /> So I read the disturbing week But then never found a genius editorial that may give The history behind them or assess the dictatorship and economic-social effects of the dictatorship. <br /> <br /> So, in the purchase of this movie, I have at least two hopes: to understand the details that leads to Social unrest and enjoy creative drama This film doesn't make me <br /> <br /> This film assumes that the audience has deep knowledge and emotions about historical facts and plays - as I said I want to support Maria de Medeiros and Portuguese film industry, but - it's a boring and shallow story. <br /> <br /> I get a DVD from France - "The official selection Cannes 2000 - I'm not sure. Snacks course "box shows the actor smiling neat lead as a symbol of victory in a fashion that reminded me of the Playboy bunny. After watching the work, I wondered what the French people would think of - even though it was a piece of "verite cinema" that contained sensitive racial content, I understood their natural preferences to be regarded as "honesty. "But ... <br /> <br /> Look at the back of the box:" Regardless of the chaleuruex sur la Revolution "- warmth. Explain Allende's overthrow and murder. "Warmth"! Try with Czechoslovakia in 1968! Try with the line of rebellion and rebellion! <br /> <br /> Another review: Maria de Medeiros, son, avec renoue, paid son, enfance and son histoire "Garbage junk! At least for me <br /> <br /> I love Portugal in all Europe. Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favorite cities. But the love that I have for the city and country has not created an empty movie for me. I will stick to my ancient VHS tapes of Capas Negras and A Cancao de Lisboa - at the same time I am attached to Zone 2 by the northern name that may be included in the trash.
