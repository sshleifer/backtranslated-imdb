Just by penetrating the "Murder, She Wrote" that is unbelievably better, it's an amazing story that this badly written garbage lasted for eight years. I'm sure most people who watch this shit that are not caring are in their sixties and seventies and just fine because they have nothing better to do or remember its stars from Dick. Van Dyke Show, old Van Dyke, who had a good career in the 1960s, never had many actors. (By his own admission) and he was too old to play as a doctor when the series began in 1993. He certainly looked old. The effect of smoking for many years and heavy drinking Barry's son, who is not able to live in his real life, is a wooden actor who is not in the things that are not related to his father, playing the son in the series.
