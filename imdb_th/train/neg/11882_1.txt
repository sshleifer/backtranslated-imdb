I passed this to the shelf a few times, looking at many positive words. (With a small name) on the front and wondering if I lost something? Last night, it was one of the movie channels and I was fine. I didn't miss. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I only watched the first 30 minutes. Maybe this movie could become a golden joke after that. With the slow, slow pace and lack of laughter in the first 30 days, I seriously wondered. <br /> <br /> The characters lead the movie in classic style. "I don't know how to start my movie." For a long time, the only person who was boring about that he didn't want to be sued. It's not funny. It's not a farce from other people. OK. Chuck. First he said it. Then he crushed it on the floor, smiled at the camera as if it were the funniest thing he had ever written himself. Don't guess your familiarity with your audience. The familiarity is _earned_ which is a respectable matter. <br /> <br /> From there, you will often have a short, fat man talking in a very weak manner about his boring life as a temperature. I do not know that he is a Jew. It is a disgrace to the Jewish comedian that calls this "Humor of the Jews" It is a joke that is not funny. Just because you are a Jew does not mean that you have a special ability in jokes. WASP, Spalding Gray, work humor, analyze yourself better than this man, so it's clear that it's not about race. <br /> < br /> If one of the bits that I have seen works, I may be stuck around. But some schlub happens about how much he loves the name of the woman he works with and from identifying them for a time. Minutes did not create a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is a clear effort to use. About the popularity of "Office Space" Do not let yourself be a victim of target marketing. Just don't speak to "Haiku Tunnel"
