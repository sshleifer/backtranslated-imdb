This is a type of movie that needs to be good, but very bad. I think the kids don't seem to be aware of the gravity of the situation. The boy Dekir said to the girls that they were under his responsibility when she asked why he wanted to go back to them. But after that he gave a gun to a friend, a swivel chair and wanted him to fix the phone line alone. Where is the responsibility? I understand that poor actors have to pay for food. But why not just give money to them to create such stupid movies or give money for charity? Oh yes, no one knows how to set goals. Punk people are stupid at the cafeteria. There's no place like crazy. They all want to look professional. But they all suck Another thing that I do not believe that there is no emergency exit in schools. Children are trying many doors. But all of them are locked What will happen if there is a fire and the security guard of dumass dies? Is illegal if there is no emergency exit in the school There are many things to say. But it will be too long I take my life to see shit.
