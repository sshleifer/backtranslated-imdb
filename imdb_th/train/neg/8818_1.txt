A strange and stupid movie about some children who became traumatized when he knew that Santa wasn't real (???). He grew up and became an adult. (Brandon McCartney) who made a list of naughty or good people Christmas, one day he captured and set out to kill the mischievous - dressed like Santa. Of course, <br /> <br /> Boring and it's just a normal horror movie of Santa. If you're looking for blood, it's not here. There are only a few images of murder and they are not scary with many fake effects. Most movies have only Brandon Maggart, who speaks to himself and starts crazy slowly. The script is a repetitive thing. The performance is terrible and leads to the ending that makes me stare at the TV that is sluggish. Seriously, I had to re-tap the tape and see again to make sure I didn't see hallucinations! Really poor ending. <br /> <br /> If you want to rent a Christmas that is scary, flick "Christmas Black" (original version of the 70s - not an awesome remake) Avoid this cost
