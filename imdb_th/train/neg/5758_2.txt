You can say that the actors will make movies. But this clearly proved that the words were wrong Most characters in this movie have nothing to do. They play part of the deep cardboard cutting that is moved in a predictable and unattractive way. The story is very easy. May be summarized in a few words But I will suspend if the reader wants to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I have to move forward quickly, as Jack shows us how. Nasty eaters I must say that 70% of this movie is about cooking, eating or preparing to eat. Quite frankly, I didn't want to spend time watching Jack, chewing loudly by gaping. Personally, I can do without reference to the shoes and jokes that Pepper had in the first half of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to my own personal dementia There are countless scenes and images from cameras that feel like being dragged. When anything happens, the reaction of that character is vague and dry. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this.
