Many of the moons that passed when I was seven years old. I can't remember clearly seeing the trailer for this movie. It attracted my innocent curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to watch this movie. As a wise adult, they are, they tell me that "Absolutely not! It is rubbish. "Of course, I was very disappointed that I would not be the first child on my blog to see. "The man who is melting" <br /> <br /> A little time passed - maybe a couple of days. I forgot about "The Incredible Melting Man" and my disappointment faded. Twenty-five years ago, until it came into the forefront of my thoughts. While surfing through digital cable channels, I found that this movie has been lost for a long time. My curiosity piqued and I finally decided to participate in this fruit which was banned by my parents. I should listen to them. "Incredible Melting Man" may be the worst movie that humans know. It made the movie like "Def-Con 4," Metalstorm "and" Freddie Got Fingered ". It seemed Oscar nominated. I felt violated because it took almost two hours of my life to watch this rough dirt, even in years 1977 Other people convince the film company to create this movie beyond me. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistakes as I do. Listen to your parents. If they forbid you to watch this movie, they are right.
