I can't remember seeing another murder / mystery movie like this. The film is about a medical examiner who examines the mysterious death of his friend in a car accident. Receiving a bad movie: bad performances, boring stories, lack of doubt, bad humor and No drama I remember having watched this movie in PAX, a prominent television station about making movies that budgeted for low TV such as this camp. Of course, television movies do not have the advantage or doubt that it is a movie from a large screen. But this movie is definitely sour. The film maker missed the opportunity to create a "Receipe for Murder" as an excellent TV movie. The name is suspicious. <br /> <br /> So if you want a good recipe, don't watch this movie. This film alone can destroy your TV appetite. <br /> <br /> Grade F
