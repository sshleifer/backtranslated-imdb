Okay, so the example of this movie will tell you that a stubborn girl went to live with her grandmother in the summer in order to break away. Actually that's not the case! It's about a stubborn 17-year-old girl who reveals the secret and depends on her mother to believe that she is telling the truth. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I like the concept of this movie Really They have a really good plot and a really good form of love / hate relationship between mother and daughter. However, I didn't like watching Lindsay Lohan's performance. In fact, this movie would be great if they had other people, maybe even better actors. The character of Rachel (Lohan) is very sexually aggressive, and it reminds us of the real Lindsay, so it's separated from this movie. <br /> <br /> I think if You put Lindsay together. You will enjoy this movie. The ending is quite good (and sad).
