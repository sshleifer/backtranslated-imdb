Hey, no doubt, Tommy is the evil here. I do not know why But for some reason, small children in horror movies often encounter small buttocks and because they are children, they will not die Because they are annoying ... uh .. except the hospital of fear But it is not far apart. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with the movie Can't find this movie on DVD? Of course you can! All you have to do is buy a DVD set. Chilling classics! Not only will you get a DVD change for $ 15, but you still get 49 movies! What a bargain! PFF agrees. I have done advertising for these wonderful movies. Suppose this movie is not worth 15 dollars by yourself. <br /> <br /> So we have chemical scientists. Yes. Make every chemical scientist look handsome like this guy playing Peter. He tried to find a serum to stop the deterioration of the body. The college he is working on wants to pull the plug in his project so he tries to do it himself. But because it is a horror movie, he sucks it and starts and an incredibly long conversion that takes almost 3/4 of the movie. <br /> <br /> To cut down the movie that he has some relationships with women. Who has a son and she never married! scandalous! But of course, Tommy is one of the most annoying characters .... No, I brought it back. He is the most annoying person. Worse than the old disabled man who wants to work Peter and sympathize with him while he is in the hospital. Correct, even as an old disabled person, you can still be a villain. <br /> <br /> So we saw that Peter began to kill some people in the image he randomly until he realized that he was doing and Decided to Kill everyone in his path to return to normal. However, at the end he became a lizard. Yes i know don't ask The ending doesn't have any reason. And if you hope to get a really good return, you won't get it. <br /> <br /> This is not a horror movie .... It's disappointing because it lacks good returns. If you have 50 movies The story is already here and this is your next entry. You are not a gangster. But you are not a great movie as well Just sit back and relax and eat a lot of snacks. Since this film will not make you jump out of your skin in no time. <br /> <br /> The change has received 4 plastic lizard heads from 10.
