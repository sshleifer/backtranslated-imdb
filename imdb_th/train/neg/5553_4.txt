This third Darkman is definitely better than the second. But still much worse than the original movie What makes this thing better than D2 is the fact that The Bad Guy has been changed and Durant has not been brought back again. There are also some hints about character development when talking about the family of bad guys and Darkman. This makes my heart soft and I give this flick as much as 4/10. *
