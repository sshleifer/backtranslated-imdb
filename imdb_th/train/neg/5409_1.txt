The Christmas secret was dubbed a great movie. But I was truly disappointed They sell VHS and DVD movies when it ends, which makes me think that the producers are very proud of this project. As a screen actor myself, I felt that most of the performances were being called, even though Beau Bridges as Nick had a minute or two. If I was Richard Thomas, I would not bring this movie to another history. It is an embarrassment I am a big fan since his Walton era. But I found myself not watching his subsequent work. Very bad. This is an offer to protect the actor. <br /> <br /> I hope this is not considered an inappropriate review and negative assumptions about my qualifications as a critic. I opened this movie because it has good actors and I'm ready to enjoy this movie. However, I will challenge any one there to watch this movie and do not want their money back, even if it is in T.V.
