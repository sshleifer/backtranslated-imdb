First of all, I have to admit that the two movies I have seen by this director that I see without a title and may miss the issue. My Czech language is not bad But by watching my two movies, I hope I won't try to learn at all. Samotari is too cool. Too cool way It has ten different stories. That is not an unusual thing in the size of Prague (really small). The main characters are between 20 and 30. They have work and only one job. The best character is the Balkan girl. Her feelings are reflected by immigrants here every day. About it. Only great characters, others are making their lives in hell by themselves. How can I sympathize with the lack of such clarity? Perhaps there is a bit of interest for Japanese tourists. But do I need another stereotype in the movie? If you like music that's okay, watch this movie. If you want to laugh at the stupidity of others, watch this movie. If you like humor that is satirical and dry, look at the original Jarmusch, not imitation. And in any situation, watch the movie of Ondricek Septej (Whisper.) That is, unless you enjoy the homophobic pattern
