MONSTER - He's great. I like the special effects that create this monster that looks like the latest version of "The Creature From the Black Lagoon" The scene where the beast lives in this land and captures people from good to the jaw. <br /> <br /> SOCIAL COMMENTARY: Most stories occur in quarantine areas as doctors. (Under government orders) indicates that there are diseases similar to SARS In summary, we have received a cover story of a familiar government. Do you know? I expect that the paranoid liberalism of Hollywood movies will always damage our government. But it seems that Koreans are copying the pattern and it's very boring. In here it takes away from the excitement and suspicion of This "monster" just dragged the film down. The main family featured in this film must be seen from a distance, while the young girl in the family died, presumably being an animal that was dragged away by a strange creature. <br /> <br /> MORAL: General "No cause. Pollution in water "The message because this is something that can happen - a terrifying mutant monster This used to be an anti-nuclear bombing message from the 1950s when radiation irradiated giant ants, spiders, fish or anything in the Sci-Fi movie. Now, "environmental issues" are the points of interest. <br /> <br /> Humor I usually hurt myself with pain, but it's not funny. I don't know if the humor of Korea is pathetic or not, or the movie intends to behave strangely using the movie "Godzilla". Well, hopefully it's the latter. <br /> <br /> Transfer - video transfer is good. This is a clear picture and good sound with the crowd of rear speakers. I watched this thing in Korean with English subtitles. That could be a mistake because the sound of the throat of Korea sounds annoying after half an hour. <br /> <br /> Overall - this is a promise, but it turns out to be a big and boring city in many points. Forgiveness for modern monster movies Two hours too long for this I don't know how this movie attracts people to Korea. They must not have much in the way of movies to enjoy and support.
