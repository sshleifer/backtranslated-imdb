1957 (Yes, that's the correct date) Production J. Arthur Rank with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; It must be a comedian, right? Oh, it's terrible. It's a movie that is gagged: watching people have to be shocked when seeing a little crocodile. Music has been improperly delivered and cannot be forgotten. Jeannie Carson is a talented dancer and singer. But what did you do in this movie? Diana Dors came here as well. Her performance level is not bad. But she is in this movie for someone to look at We have to do something beside the groan in this movie. The movie is currently being sold on VHS. People in e-Bay save money and waste time for themselves. Funny movie without laughter A musical drama without memorable songs or dances
