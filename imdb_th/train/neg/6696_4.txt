(With spoilers) Miya, Kari Wuhrer, murder of a prostitute, nymphomaniac, lives and cars of 18 virgins, even though he is too shy to admit it At the end of the movie, Myia not only makes people look innocent. But giving a naive and naive lesson that how to find dangerous nut jobs and keep them away from him or her. <br /> <br /> Hang around, take a break. Miya trucks are chosen by Roy, Burt Young, for a hot and heavy activity in the back of his wheelchair Roy is drunk and is too stupid to realize that Mina is not someone other than his separate daughter! Provoked that Miya was not willing to receive a trace with him, almost squeezing her to death, only to be interrupted by a student of the first year. Trent Colbert, who plowed into the rest of the area, swept one of the truckers. br /> Seeing her chance, Miya jumped into Trent's car and both were closed in what became the most bizarre car chase ever in the movie. The journey across the northeastern United States ended with the involvement of a truck, a murder and a shootout with state soldiers, which led to Trent's parents' house being held hostage. There was a shot between Miya, who was mad with all the SWAT teams added by the local police and state police. <br /> <br /> You expect movies like "Hit and Run" to be funny or accidentally accidentally. Not in reality, this film is a nuisance to everyone in the movie, which Miya treats everyone in the movie that she has contacted with his father. Trent drove her to the northeast of Miya, causing the poor to get drunk, accompany him in the rental room with a whip, handcuffs and candles at the spot. Miya also worked with Mr. Foster, the owner of the hotel, by tricking him into using his gun as part of a strange sex game. After holding Foster, she went out with Trent in the cold. His rented room, $ 400.00 purse in there, didn't have to drive away. <br /> <br /> Need money to pay gas to return to his parents' home for Thanksgiving. Trent received a call from Miya to Go get At a local restaurant for a refund. Like a jerk that he was a Trent, took Miya, who is now a refugee from his law, and later shared with her father Roy on the open highway as he tried to run both Trent & Miya out of The road <br /> <br /> The chase ends in a deserted house where Roy chases Miya. He runs on a muddy road in his high heels, letting you know where there is a bomb from him. His own shotgun, Roy, was busy trying to take off his pants until he forgot that he had left the gun unattended. <br /> <br /> Both arrested and killed, including hit and run, hit them. Two places stop at the boutique S & M / Tattoo shop in Trent, receiving his ears and nose and dressed in Leather and chain by Myri with his and her dog collar This is to meet with his straightforward and conservative parents for a Thanksgiving dinner. <br /> <br /> Having a penalty run against the state military has one of them. Seriously injured, both refugees from the law ended at Trent's parents, Mr & Mrs Colbet, David Keith & Elaine Martyn, home to all local police forces along with the SWAT team waiting for them there. <br /> <br / > Nasty movies that have episodes The annoying truly makes you wonder what the film is trying to do. You feel very sympathetic to Miya at first. But when the film rolls to an unstoppable ending, it evaporates as quickly as the ice tray in Death Valley. Although Roy is the most disliked person in the movie at first, when the movie ends, Miya completely obscures him.
