First of all ..... <br /> <br /> What is crazy? Why in this world are they trying to sell shit on a low budget on TV late at night with promises of offensive and annoying garbage that a human being with a spirit cannot watch? <br /> <br /> Shit is A joke about an injured dog, grandmother, her head falling ... The man with his hands blown apart and two women go to the bathroom? This world has nothing in hell that allows people to find comedy in something very seriously ill. Anyone who thinks that this type of content is a joke should not even be allowed to walk on this planet. <br /> <br /> But from what I hear, it's not nasty ... So .. They promised to show comedy through the dirty garbage and ... and they couldn't pull it out.
