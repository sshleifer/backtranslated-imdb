"Captain Sky and the World of the Future" (a very amazing title) is a bad movie There is no heart, no deep thoughts, nothing special about it. Yes, the CGI background looks interesting, but the result is that all of those things are taken in the annoying soft focus In addition, movies also use music in the same way as "Gilligan Island" or Scooby-Comics - never stop terribly bad There are no new ideas like just gobs and gobs and gobs and ... etc. of the bits taken from old movies and publications. No goalkeeper here, the movie seems to exist because it can Save your money and time Not fun
