Another romantic comedy story from England that audiences around the world have a lot of appetite. This weak effort is a joke of the genre - the classic clich√©d scene. All are here from a ridiculously complex misunderstanding that runs after leaving the train to declare love. The character is a one-dimensional caricature that allows Love-Hewitt, who can bring the relationship to the movie. Things that threaten to spin out of control in the reliability department when the movie proceeds The suspension of our good-natured beliefs finally collapses at the end of a miserable period. If you are looking for Bridget Jones, you will not be able to experience the Notting Hill here.
