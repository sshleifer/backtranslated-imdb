Not that he is interested But I'm not a friend of Simon Pegg. If I can, there is a good chance that we will come out if he continues to do this kind of garbage. The problem is that he found that the formula was succeeded as the next type that was unusual in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run and others, but it started to wear some. Here, his character has no visible qualities. He is rude and disgusting and thinks he's funny when he's not straightforward. When moving from New York from London (And I believe that this link is intended to attract audiences on both sides of the Atlantic). He proved to be equal with his new colleagues. Even so, is it surprising that when he was hired as a disgusting stripper when he appeared at the editorial meeting, he would take revenge on the boss? He, even though he didn't do anything well Oh and because he is a superficial man, he falls in love with Megan Fox at first sight, probably because her character is shallow like him. Everything is done to summarize the predictable movie, even though I don't see any audience showing how this reflects their lives. The shame is that on this paper is a character that should be worth watching. Even though Pegg plays himself, Kirsten Dunst seems to be moving, even though he doesn't create a chemical scene. One of the advantages is Miriam Margolyes as the owner of New York's land. Pegg - now if you stay on the screen for longer .....
