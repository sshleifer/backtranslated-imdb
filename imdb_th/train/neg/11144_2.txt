This flick reminds me of "Weird erotic" I tend to sleep late and watch Cinemax. When I was 13 years old, I would flick the soft core sheet because there was no simulation and grinding machine. However, there are many nudity - open scenes in a strip club. We see Kane Hodder's keester (or at least a dwarf butt) and a 10-minute lesbian dance scene that cannot be explained in the middle of the movie. A werewolf woman who looks like they are wearing monster costumes. The 13-year-old boy rejoiced. <br /> <br /> In addition to the werewolf scenes, there is the worst CGI I've seen for years. FMV from Resident Evil video game in terms of quality The wolf is too bad to explain, and even if the suit is not shown too well many times. <br /> <br /> Plot and unreasonable performances. There is a strange story about werewolves and werewolves - Darkwolf is the last story. But from what I can say that hybrids do the same thing that every werewolf looks at humans, turning them into wolves and killing people. The Darkwolf is trying to find a pair, but strange, unable to find a partner. But can inhale everyone she touches Again, this skill proved to be less useful because Darkwolf ended up killing many people who never touched, found or saw the best I could tell. A friend doesn't know that she is a werewolf and she is fighting a change or something. <br /> <br /> You think it's hard to make a monster movie like this. But they do well. Need the lowest quality werewolves to rent. Military dogs want a lot of T&A. This is your flick.
