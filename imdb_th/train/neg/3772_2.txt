I just saw Dick Tracy and I thought it was terrible. Paintings in the background of the city look scary. Mob's character looks too strange. Warren Betty didn't do a great job like Dick Tracy. But it's not a better performance Madonna should be singing. Glenne Headly performed very well in this movie. I gave this movie for 2/10 due to the great performance of Al Pacino. But he still works well
