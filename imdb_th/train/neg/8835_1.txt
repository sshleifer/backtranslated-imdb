Before I watched this movie, I read the reviews here, stating that this movie might be one of the best movies ever!? Hahaha. The scene, the scene, the tension began to increase ... from the annoying characters in this movie. From a small girl who gibbles and tries to drown with a little boy, a murderer who is running without notice Have not received an answer in this movie When I watched it, it seemed that the film was going in one direction and then didn't go anywhere. But go in a new direction ... and in and in ... <br /> <br /> Great performance But the writing is terrible Each character in each scene speaks or does something unbelievable, unrealistic and the reaction of the actor / special actor is very strange. There are no solutions to problems that develop throughout the movie, causing confusion and wasting time.
