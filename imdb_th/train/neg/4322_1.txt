Read on and acknowledge - You can save your life for 88 minutes (that's all!) <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie has set out to produce. Tales in Capra style, if fail .... complete and absolutely failed I try to think of one good thing about this and can't do it. Let me talk about some highlights ... <br /> <br /> People don't die. They will live eternal life as migrant workers in Santa's factory. The angel is a former cow sitting in a tree. Santa can bring people back from death. (If you send a good letter to him) <br /> <br /> and the plot .. I won't make you lose But must have light in the movie if only to compare with the darkness But nothing Even though the shooting was cold, the snow that appeared at the end of the freezing everywhere looked cool, humid and miserable. <br /> <br /> As you think this movie ends happily (schmaltzy), slowly
