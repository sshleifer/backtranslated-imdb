It seems obvious from this adjustment that he can't, not only will he leave the story behind. But he still did it himself! What he chose to leave was incredible, until I was happy that he chose to release some of the most important parts of the novel. The plot is dark, inconsistent and lacking. To say the least, I don't want to say anything about the lively actors. But they can't! Ghosts are definitely difficult. But this is pathetic! The Micawber is nothing more than Kramer in the nineteenth century, and those who talk a little about Betsy Trotwood are better! If you want to see real Copperfield, see the wonderful BBC adaptation in 1999 for screenwriters. I think he read Cliff's record!
