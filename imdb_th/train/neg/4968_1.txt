I expect the film to be based on Grendel, a book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It is based on Beowulf's epic, but from the perspective of a monster. <br /> <br /> Whatever you think Gardner's book The Beowulf Movie Epic shouldn't have Grendel's right when it doesn't say anything about a monster rather than a pathetic scene. Show that there is nothing more than a predator that has been fixed. <br /> <br /> In addition, writers should be punished by making the original story much worse and contributing to the increasing ignorance of TV viewers across the United States. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is a common thing to do this wrong. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing and time consuming.
