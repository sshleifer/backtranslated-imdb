Full score for the content of this film as an Englishman. I don't know if there is a divide in the US Navy during World War II. A brave attempt to bring this truth to the world However, this film is pathetic, with no direction of acting that is wood and the script is just a monotonous ancient idea. I can say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I sat and cringed from the beginning to the end in a very bad way that this thing had gathered together. This may be a great movie. Many of us, who are outside of the United States, are new and unique. The sad truth of this is the way it is gathered together. It's a shame that this true story, which may change people's attitudes, is affected by low budget. I just hope that in the future, sometimes one of the big studios will use this theme and do justice
