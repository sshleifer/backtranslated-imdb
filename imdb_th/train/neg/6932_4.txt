I have waited a long time to see DR TARR'S dungeon and after I watched it I was really disappointed. It's not an eccentric movie that I expected. The trailer (which I saw in the Something Weird DVD) was better than the whole movie, which was amazingly unforgettable. There are almost no scenes that stand out in this regard and the look and feel are interesting. But not close to other Baroque movies there <br /> The main problem of DUNGEON, DR DR torture of TARR is - more than anything else. It's almost like watching a book. I just want this movie to have a moment of silence or emotion or something. Instead, we see / listen to the main characters chit-chat endlessly about boring things. <br /> <br /> Chance Missed
