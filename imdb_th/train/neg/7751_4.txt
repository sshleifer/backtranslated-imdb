Before the CGI in this film is scary I watched it during the marathon of bad movies in the SciFi channel. At the end, when the park owner was killed, it could be one of the worst examples of CGI I've ever seen. Better animation. <br /> <br /> That said Why are they on this particular island? It is not specified in the movie. And why do people come into the area of ​​cats? No reason. <br /> <br /> One of the things that stand out in this movie is a good performance. In what might be called a "B movie created for a TV movie", the performance is very good. Parry Shen is particularly outstanding. <br /> <br /> If you don't have anything to do on Saturday It may be good for memorable words.
