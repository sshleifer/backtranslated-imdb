After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb, I am very enthusiastic about this movie. But it's a terrible movie. The total time you see the aliens is about 5 minutes. (The rest of this movie is the cheap suspense.) The performance is above all the story. >> The story doesn't seem to go in the first direction. They catch aliens (after 7 years! Then they didn't know what to do about it (after 7 years?) And still wanted To release (Why did they catch it?) Then, the girl who showed the most wanted to walk away from this madness. Then she didn't do that anymore. She did and didn't do it. Then they concluded that killing the aliens would kill the entire human race. (And remember that in the past year, no man had ever seen these aliens who had permanent settlements) and what did they do? They tortured and blasted an alien group into a group. <br /> <br /> This is my first review about IMDb. I'm a very lazy person who hasn't written recently. So listen to my warning. : This movement is not worth your time. Don't watch this movie.
