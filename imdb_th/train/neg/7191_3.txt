Seen yesterday at night at the Midnight Slam of the des Monde du Montreal Film Festival in Montreal. What a disappointment. This film is clearly ranked by fans of IMDb. The show is only normal. The director does not bring anything new or interesting. The plot is lacking: the movie is about those college graduates and games that They play using prank. And above all, you can predict the end of the movie in the first five minutes If you like prank and play with an ax that makes you jump once or twice in the whole movie If you don't, this movie isn't worth it.
