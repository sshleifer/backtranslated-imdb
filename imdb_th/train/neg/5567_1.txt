Ok, I rented this movie because the director ... He used to have interesting past temples. (If you haven't seen Waxork, however, I have doubts about this movie from the beginning. But I decided to suck it and watch it. It's not good. Very bad. If you haven't watched a movie and don't mind reading First of all, the old saying that 'You can't judge a book with a cover.' Here, the box for this flick seems to indicate that Jill is a rocky fox with long hair and highlights. The back of the box has a shot of Jill, red leather and other shots. The explanation makes you want to rent a movie because it sounds good. You start watching it and suddenly you find that this movie happened. (Inexplicable) In 1977, Jill was a dog that was not a girl on the cover. This movie can't be predicted as you think ... and that's not a good thing. The characters do a lot of stupid things without a slight impulse ... It's embarrassing to watch 10 minutes before. Dolph and other women have sex without reason. In addition, what is the point that Dolph kills this woman with cold blood that helps him? Director Anthony Hickox should see a foul odor when he reads the script. If located in the underworld of the new millennium and half of the characters are clever, it should be appropriate. In settings in the 1970s, there was no reason and no effect on any stories. Avoid it!
