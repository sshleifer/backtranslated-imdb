Like all Carnosaur movies, this is a joke. The way the dinosaurs move makes me think of when my sister plays with her doll because they can't look stiff or fake. I mean, first of all, they were on the bus, then in the warehouse. Suddenly they were on the boat. And seriously, it makes sense that two dinosaurs can be together on a van or on a boat? I think dinosaurs are the biggest animals and now they can sit on a moving van. It sounds silly even if you miss it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give 3 is because it's still entertaining. I found it better than the first one. (Not looking at the second) Just don't rent it. I saw it on TV and it's a good thing that I do because I don't want to waste money on renting it.
