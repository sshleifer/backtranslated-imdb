This movie Pok√©mon is a terrible movie. Unlike the first movie, this is not a good movie at all. Graphics are appropriate. But the story remains the same and no real characters are created At first, the interaction between the characters was good. Removing Brock and adding traces is not good. Tracking really does not have anything to say or do, and unlike Brock does not help to relieve comedy. The only good point is that you can see the real fog. There is cheerfulness in the ash. Overall, this movie is not worth the rental, and the previous short film didn't do anything for me or my wife. And we think that the Pokemon fans themselves are okay. Maybe the next one might be better.
