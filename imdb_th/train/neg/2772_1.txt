Spoiler warning .. I have to agree with you. It's almost there. This is a bad movie about real and interesting stories. It has such a promise. But the show is the most ridiculous Some scenes are beautiful and realistic. Others are leaving the amusement park. I found myself laughing while watching what was supposed to be a serious scene. I really want to like this movie. But i can't The best part is the fight between friends who end up with the "dying king". I like the punishment of Queens. And the last appointment creates a beautiful image There are many better movies to watch. I do not recommend this
