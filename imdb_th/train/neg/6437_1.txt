Spoiler <br /> <br /> First of all, nothing actually happened in this movie, apart from a mysterious bleeding woman. Secondly, it's not scary. Third, it has the worst soundtrack of any movie. Let me do it thoroughly. The sound was edited by Beavis or Butthead. I'm not sure where to go with Beverly. The film gradually calmed down and people muttered and muttered, forcing you to turn the volume up. (I watched at home) Then Beavis will deliver a shocking and scary sound that quickly reduces the volume again. This happened many times until the movie ended with kindness. I imagined Beavis laughing rudely from behind the two-way mirror while watching the test group at a distance each time. If you have children and like to watch horror movies after they fall asleep, this movie is a big mistake. But it was a big mistake anyway This is the idea If you are going to create a horror movie, at least add a free headband. A 19-year-old girl who screams at the top of the lungs before she takes off the shadows on someone's wall The cat was thrown into the camera to make the audience scared strange, strange, with a crazy laugh or a monster that looks like a hand on the stage covered with aluminum foil (a la TV's Lost in Space). Not even scared me They want to hurt my ears.
