This is like two films - one story, knowledge and participation, other stories that are stupid and repetitive. It's really a shame. All problems don't work with writing. But when considering how much writing and producing B movies, how quickly It's a real shame because this may be a very good movie. <br /> <br /> Good first movie. This film is original and related to the World War II code breaks. This is a very attractive thing and I like watching the leader (Lee Bowman) walk through him as a code breaker. Actually, two thirds of this movie is very good. But now the bad thing, this movie takes too long and loses steam for about 50 minutes. In addition, the role of Jean Rogers as a "big fan" must rank as one of the worst in history. the movie For Bowman's clever moves every time, the idiot Rogers stepped in to crush things while "Comedy Relief" misunderstood. If her role was cleverly written, the overall movie would be better very much! But watching her, it's hard to understand that we have actually won WWII !!
