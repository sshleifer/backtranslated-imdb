Ok i'm happy I saw two very strong stage performances in New York, along with the original actors and another show at San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney. You rock! Compared to both films, this is almost impossible to see at all. I am reading a DVD in the last evening and still not finished. Too many irrelevant interactions and also adding too many scenes and people. Yes, the four main performances are quite good, especially Miss Streep, but comparing the stage and movies is an example of "less is more". The thickness of the plays to meet the needs of movie viewers for a variety of scenery and Specificity is a poor choice. Please, please go to find the production process somewhere near you.
