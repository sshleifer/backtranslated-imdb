(Including some spoilers may say that) <br /> <br /> This movie is impossible to be serious. In some parts it was so stupid that I could not help laughing. Try me in the order in which Stallone's character jumps up to 20 meters with full climbing equipment or (And this is really my favorite thing) trapping bad people by sticking to stalactites Yes, he made a lot of strength that was gathered together to accomplish that? I'm Duno, but he's sure to make money really.
