Evil Aliens owes a great deal to the early movies Peter Jackson, Bad Taste and Braindead. I must confess that I will not enjoy those movies in particular, and I say the same thing about this. Jake West is an inspiring director. His heart The person who raised him looked at me, losing the number of times that the major Hollywood movies refer to James Camerons Aliens. The best, the amount of blood and blood shown here is not funny as well. And dragging it out, maybe it will work better as a short film, a poor actor, a weak direction and a plot that doesn't exist. I can see what the director tried to do what he was trying to pay. But others do the same thing better here. 4/10
