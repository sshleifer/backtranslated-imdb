How can I get a great technician to fall? Kim Basinger is a great actress. But she hit hard when she took this role This film is not good for one particular reason: exhausted in logic It seems to be one of those movies that can get through all of its holes if it comes out in the 80s and 90s. But in 2008 it looks really stupid. This is the worst thriller I've ever had. See and I saw the Bone Collector and Twisted The gang of gangsters ended up killing the police who helped her. Then she was chased by these mad men through an abandoned road and she eliminated it one by one with a tool box full of tools. <br /> <br /> Many things are wrong with this movie. As I have already said, this movie stepped on logic all around and with the exception of Kim Basinger, the performance was made for bad TV. Hell, an artificial thriller. This story is made for a broken TV. How she killed these legitimate political thugs (1 Caucasian, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian, and 1 African American all together to spell the Caucasian girl. You don't love America? The way she killed Hispanic people made me laugh like crazy. The sex scene with the main hoodlum was in the left field so you shook your head ashamed I only recommend this to bad movie lovers and no one else. Anyone else, especially Kim Basinger's fans, would not be able to flick this story. You don't want to see the actors you respect in this movie, aren't you right now? Of course not. You were warned.
