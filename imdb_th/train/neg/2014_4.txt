I remember loving this show when I was a kid. I think the helicopter is the best thing I have ever seen. It is a special advanced technology for the time. It can expel enemy fire, do all kinds of acrobats in the air, and destroy everything that is in front. Now I go back to watch it today and I was amazed how this punch was. The cast members are almost uninteresting, have a wonderful time and the fight scenes are incredibly fake. And almost every end, there will be a crap fight helicopter as well, with the use of low-quality, low-quality stock video clearly Many footage appeared in the Vietnam War era. <br /> <br /> Airwolf has the same theme as the Knight Rider, except the alternative combat vehicles are helicopters instead of cars. After watching a few episodes, I found myself most bored. However, I like music.
