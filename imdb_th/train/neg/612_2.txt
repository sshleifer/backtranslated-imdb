SCARECROW is one of the most terrible movies that has become annoying. A lonely high school student who was always chosen by a classmate and rejected by a woman ended up walking into a trailer. His mother had sex with a drunken smug person. He then chased the boy out into the field near and killed him. Clearly, the spirit of the boy was transferred to a scarecrow, which then killed the gangster who tortured him and the teacher This scarecrow, in addition to having a fast airline for each victim, can still act like a matrix, turn up in the air and kill people on the sidewalk in the daytime. In addition, why does he always look like dead bodies? As with the sequel, there is no need for the two that followed.
