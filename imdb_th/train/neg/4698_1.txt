I mean, seriously, which group will sing about crazy cars? So if they were ten people, it was too young to sing about. The name is too beautiful too. My brother? Just because they take off their pants ??? Creativity I don't understand why they want a TV show. I mean, most artists don't want TV programs about themselves, especially the naked brothers. Heck, the number of them is in a bad group And what about movies seriously? Nick Jeez used to be the highlight of my growing year. But seriously, are the brothers naked? Many parents do not allow their children to look like this, especially with the name of the Naked Brother band, which is a stupid, non-creative program that should not be broadcast on TV.
