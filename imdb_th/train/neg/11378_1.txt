The duck at MST3K should see the dog of this movie. Essentially, it's about a hacker actor who has a disability in Hollywood who can't perform any acting and he has this strange passion with a taxi driver in the movie What did this dumb actor do?

As if the actor's boyfriend was heartbroken and sobbing and said something like "How can you do this for me?" Then why are you crying? Because he dyed his blonde hair and became a surfer friend for gigs This movie is not reasonable! The actors playing in Benson are also here, and he plays a stereotypical right-wing politician with a lot of humorous conversations. This movie will break. You believe me. are you talking to me!
