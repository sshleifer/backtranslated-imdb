Another movie from Alfred Hitchcock, which seems to be made from contractual obligations, like Juno and Paycock. You can tell that Hitchcock has little interest in this film. Almost no style or craftsmanship at all The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young couple who come to make money and go on a cruise that proves to be a test of their marriage. Emily was given a chance in a new life with a good heart, a wealthy man who fell in love with her. But chose to take the high road and stay with her husband This may seem more credible if Fred did not become a perfect and delicate ass that jumped on the first opportunity he saw to leave his wife with another woman. Both ended up together. But this movie has no real reconciliation scene The third action proceeded in a completely different direction, with both being aboard the abandoned ship and being rescued by fishing boats in Asia. Joan Barry gave an exciting performance as an honest wife of an unfaithful husband That's all you can say for this.
