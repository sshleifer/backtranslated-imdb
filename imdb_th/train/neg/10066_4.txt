I watched it again recently and there is another version that is shorter than 1999. I feel that they are the same movie. But I want to know the difference. <br /> <br /> One of them is Japan. Can happen to Ohtherwise. Why must vote for the same movie twice? <br /> <br /> Prof Ivy is quite boring. She listened as though she was almost asleep, without any expression, even in the role she had <br /> <br /> Enough fun, but didn't have much. (Which follows after Lucia has no plan to destroy the world) and the normal character who tries to stop him because he tries to capture Lucia, causing destruction A little better, deoxys (poke 7) is great, without 8 almost here.
