The Haunting is another bad horror movie that has extra-realistic effects, fake and big screen actors, and does not have any redemption properties except in movies. Their rework is not bad. But directed by Jion Da Bont. I think the A-List actor (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) is there to divert our attention from the plot. Tedot, boring, special techniques And each made great strides Do not care about who is in it. We care about the characters and the two stories that this movie missed. The story is to take the classic story of The Haunting Of Hill House and tear it into four chapters and use the rest for the movie. And it doesn't explain much. The characters are quite skinny and while the show is good, you don't care about any characters at all. Lily Lily Taylor gives an awesome performance and looks like she is 8 years old when sending the line. Don't talk about what screamer she is. Lily Taylor is not created for the horror genre that everyone, ghosts, is stupid and wonderful. And the ghost of Hugh Cain looks like a fat man dressed like a solemn on Halloween with smoke machines. This animal is on the roof of one of the rooms with a giant purple mouth and it is not a joke that is not. Intended Beautiful and well designed, which may be the only positive thing about this movie, but it looks good, but it doesn't help it from everything that is cruel. I can honestly say that I Feels like I'm wasting my time watching TV So I will get even more money if I pay to see But luckily it is in the Scream Channel. Overall, Haunting is a boring game that tries to beat you with bad special effects.
