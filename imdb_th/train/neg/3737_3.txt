I think "the best time" is the cause of the journey. Initial evidence (The person who sent the winning touchdown to the rival high school team couldn't seem to win and then trying to reunite the two teams to play again) was one of the things I had never heard before Since Ron Shelton wrote a very good sports movie, I wonder if it's more than that, right? I hope that this movie will not be bright with Shelton pitching the story as I wrote above. <br /> <br /> So we have evidence. From there you will think or hope that there may be a slight twist on the way to make things lively. There is no such luck. This script tracks the ancient ideas that you can guess. There is not a moment in this movie that you won't see far before this movie is revealed and the ending .... If you can't find the end point at the end of the first reel then you will get No need to pay attention or watch other sports movies in your life. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams and Kurt Russell are celebrities (and bored) in the prospect group. Williams is a poor schmo that drops through and Russell is the quarterback that throws through fate. Do you think Russell will be right for him again to see if he and Williams can be mistaken for a city that has never been forgotten? This is a lame duck movie, along with a lame duck script that anyone can just shake their heads with, wondering what will happen. Sure there is a little laugh and straight talk. There is a truly funny scene. Williams and Russell have a marriage problem and the wife invites them to dinner to fix the problem. No man knows that they are invited on Monday and yes, Monday Night Football is open. Please note that both teams play with one combined victory. (Especially Williams) tried to resist the temptation to find out how the game was going The scene became a hilarious part, while Williams checked the score using the bathroom as a trick. When he returned, he scored for Russell. Later, when Russell began moving with his wife, Williams, in the television view of their room. <br /> <br /> It's an inspiring and funny scene in a movie that nobody cares about. And stupid
