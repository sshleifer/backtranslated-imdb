In general, this is about a couple who wants to feed a second child. At the adoption agency, they found a mouse (Stuart) and they decided to adopt. If you think this is a foolish thing, catch it because it's getting worse. <br /> <br /> Stuart arrives at his new home where he is treated as a human child (free me! ) The rest are ancient ideas about family problems, jealousy from "brother", brother and at the end, all issues are resolved and all of them are "Happy family" It is boring and worn out like this. It shows in a blunt and uncomplicated way. <br /> <br /> I do not know that the director believes that he is creating by introducing the mouse to Ancient ideas Or he just tries to fill in a few minutes But he just upgraded the old idea from boredom to disgust. <br /> <br /> Why did I give 3 and not zero? Because the family cat that loves Stuart is as much as "brother" and because of the comedic performances that Stuart takes from his small size. <br /> <br /> Overall, I believe that this movie will Can use reasonably well if: Stuart is a pet and not a "sibling" b. It is still in a funny gig like Stuart tries to beat the cat and leave the boring old idea which Not paired with anything else
