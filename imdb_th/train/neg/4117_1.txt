Two days after seeing this thing, I still felt painfully with HAVING that saw it. It was terrible. You must be surprised that anyone can write this rag very little. A proud arrogant performance that looks like he's sleepwalking and Alison Eastwood embarrasses himself. Such actions are indicative of a low budget movie making, which means that this film is not a painfully good story? If you are 6 years old, you can write this movie. Simplisticisticistic and ordinary Lame
