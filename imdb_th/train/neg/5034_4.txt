I was very surprised to see the high ratings for this film and from a few reviews that had positive results. I saw the movie and was very disappointed. I didn't find it so fun. It's slow and lacking in entertainment literally. Even the murder scene is still lacking with a close shot that looks bad. And the end of the wonderful twist that should not be really much. I saw it already. This movie may not be mentioned much. But only a small amount of it gets I will not recommend this movie.
