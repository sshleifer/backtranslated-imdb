Mary Pickford became the chief of the Scots after the death of her father and had love. As a reviewer, Snow Leopard friends said the movie is quite a scene to start. Some are amusing, for example, Pickford sent her small group to the church while some were there. Overall, the story is weak, especially the planned love story. The transfer is so dark that it is difficult to appreciate the scenery. However, it was not the best work of the Director Maurice Tourneur Pickford and Tourneur collaborated again in 'The Poor Little Rich Girl' that is quite easily accessible. 'Typecasting Pickford is a child character.
