Wow. That's what I can say right now. Who wrote this Who created this What kind of self-respecting actors will agree with this 'action'? Oh God! I don't know how I made this movie. But I think the fact that I have 8 cups of coffee that day is an important element in making me wake up the noble! It was one of the most unpredictable and difficult screenplay I've ever seen ... and for the record, I never planned to 'witness' again. <br /> <br /> I saw for the first time. Movie when I bought a DVD (MISTAKE # 1) I mean ... I think hey! Julia Stiles I like you. She's cool. I'll watch it as soon as I get home. (MISTAKE # 2) I try to watch it without groaning every five minutes. Wondering when this shit will end. Really do But I was not successful It is one of the worst things I have ever seen. I mean ... what is with that thing that he imagines will happen and come back into real life. It was annoying when Father used to do that in 'Parenthood' Ten years ago, 'jokes' - and I believe I have to spend a lot of time with me to call them - stupid, boring and forgotten characters. The whole story is predictable ... all of this. Make the movie that should be wiped Save the history! I should think there is something wrong when I know that I have never heard of this before. It should be straightforward with the DVD. <br /> <br /> For anyone who might be thinking of watching this thing, I have one suggestion. I can't! For God's love ... can't !!! I feel ashamed that there is in my DVD collection and I can't get rid of it ... nobody and I mean no one wants to buy from me! And I'm talking about second hand shops and third hand to buy mud from your shoes and stick it in the shop window That should tell you how CRAP is.
