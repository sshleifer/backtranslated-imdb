Silly, simplistic, and short, GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: A WOMAN FROMANHERE) Nowhere. <br /> <br /> Short stories (just over sixty minutes). This story is not inspired by spaghetti. Western style It is Sam Raimi's cheating on THE QUICK & THE DEAD (a homage to western spaghetti) that brings to the contemporary atmosphere. In QUICK & DEAD, Sharon Stone's characters try to avenge the cowardly sheriff. (Played by Gene Hackman) who, when she was just a puck, placed the fate of her father. She accidentally shoots him through the head in a crazy gun. Saki (played by Ryoko Yonekura, nimble) tries to avenge Mr. Tojo's dastardly (played with a simple appeal by Shingo Tsurumi). But the homeless man put her father's fate in her hand; She let her feet fall out of his hand and the beloved father was pulled out of a half truck. The only significant difference despite the preference is the fact that Tojo Sadistically lame Saki with ?? I will not let you down in case you decide to watch. <br /> <br /> Speak briefly. Saki ?? Pale imitation of 'Man With No Name' by Clint Eastwood ?? Ride into the city ?? Essentially, there are car shops and taverns beside American military bases, so I guess it's enough for the city? Damaged by Tojo, a local crimelord that has a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored. Confessing her true identity as a bounty hunter, Saki takes the position of a local gunman in a shooting with more choreography than passing on similarities to the work of Johnny To and John Woo. Of course, at the end of the movie Saki Has endured her suffering in the hands of bad people But she got up as an opportunity ?? On her knees in a laughing endeavor with a surprise that ended? And eliminate all of her enemies with a rocket launcher. <br /> <br /> Don't ask where she will get the rocket launcher. Just watch yourself. Try not to laugh. <br /> <br /> Average image quality for DVD release. There is a grainy quality for many sequences, but overall this is not a bad transfer. The sound quality makes the imagination sometimes. But it's not a bad transfer. <br /> <br /> But it's a bad movie.
