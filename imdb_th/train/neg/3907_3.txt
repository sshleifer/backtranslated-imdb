I'm glad I rented this movie for one reason. Its shortcomings made me want to read Allende's book and get the full story. (For my knowledge) and Meryl and Glenn work well. <br /> <br /> Cons: This is the worst performance I've ever seen from Jeremy Irons - I always wonder if there is something. Unusual with his mouth (And I hate how to speak English terribly. He said "Transito.") Winona Ryder didn't believe anything except to watch children and most other acting ideals were available. The character and the development of the relationship that I was frustrated and angry before the end. <br /> <br /> Now I want to know that this movie is the work of Bille August. Two coins Rotate the rental Smilla's Sense of Snow.
