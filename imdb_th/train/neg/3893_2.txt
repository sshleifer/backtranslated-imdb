I was thinking that the main character, astronaut with bad luck (In the case of his skin, hair, muscle and others) can always get more movies after he is reduced to a pool. What he had to do was find a job as a blob. The evidence of this flick was quite lame. Astronauts receive radiation from the sun (I think) and start to act like ice cream cones on hot days, not just a mystery. But clearly he had to kill humans and eat their flesh so that he could maintain the integrity of the cells? Have you ever noticed that whenever there is a radiation accident or an experiment occurring, will that person become an instant killer? Why is it so? <br /> <br /> The astronauts are lurking at night from the 'secret place' (which has no security) and therefore shines on his part when he goes. Obviously he still has enough memory to make him head to the rocket launcher. Perhaps because he wants to return to space. <br /> <br /> So start a part of the movie that fills the doctor. Walking around with Geiger counters trying to find people dissolved by the murmur he gave. He killed a fisherman who looked like Bill Gates, scared of a little girl in Frankenstein's monster movie la la Frankenstein and ended up with a strange couple. Then there was a short scene in which he hit his former generals and a very long scene where he killed a young stray and chased his girlfriend around. You probably thought that after she cut off his arms, he Run away. That scene will change, but not ... We treat the woman for about ten minutes, tucked around the corner and screamed in fear, even if the monster disappeared. Everything I can think of is the girlfriend of every director. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie ends with all the rest. The molten finish has become a thick substance. Nothing ... That's it. That's the end of the movie. At least that means that there is no room for the sequels.
