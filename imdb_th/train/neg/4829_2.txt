As an ordinary movie watcher, I can't say that I like watching this movie. It's not too emotional for the drama to not catch the thriller, not too fast for the show. In addition, some movies are not reliable. Ok, I understand the soldiers coming out of their hearts there. But it is difficult to believe that the person would risk the carjack in the center of the city and after being shouted by the professor's wife Without asking questions (In the proper way) It looks very romantic if it's an animation or like that. But it should be a serious movie about war .. There are many episodes like this, so the whole picture makes an impression that it is just an example of a movie and <br /> <br /> It feels like a filmmaker wants to create a picture of a brave soldier, but his 'psychology' seems unnatural. <br /> <br /> This picture left. The question in my head: Why, why are they giving Oscars? Why six and IMHO, it's the most exciting part of the movie :)
