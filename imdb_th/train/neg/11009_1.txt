I rate this movie as AWFUL (1). After previewing, I think this movie might be very cool. "Guaranteed invasion ... everyone!" Said the trailer. Um ... It makes me angry because this movie is really bad. It's almost a joke because I laughed about two seconds throughout the movie. And what are all gays in this movie?

I guess the director is gay who rejects or something like that. <br /> <br /> So my advice is: If you want to lose money, go to rent a comedy that you've seen Millions of times you are better off watching Mother Of All Lousy Comedy's. It's really all shit.
