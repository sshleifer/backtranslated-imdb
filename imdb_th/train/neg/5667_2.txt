If I check IMDb before renting this DVD from Netflix, I have a couple of hours in my life. I honestly wondered when the film director wrote as well. In this case, according to the same credit is "Writers and directors" - unfortunately, indicating the overall quality of this production There are a few interesting moments (such as the scene of Judy Tenuta recalling her early jokes that made Judy-Ism) which gave me more than one star rating However, those moments are small and far ... and I hardly see them because the opening sequence is hard to understand for me, not to mention disgusting in violence. I agree that I go back to that part again to see if I missed something that would help me figure it out when I saw the whole thing. No, at least I can remember who is the character that will become important later on. The "rotating camera" technique is too active and useless. I found myself talking to the TV screen: "What!?" Or "For good, go up!" Not recommended.
