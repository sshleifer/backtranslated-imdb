I expect more from the very boring Battlestar Galactica prequel franchise in the main series. After the first 30 minutes, I waited until the end. The characters talk a lot about religion, computers, programming, punishment, etc. There are a lot of mafia gangsters who make hit songs. However, Caprica doesn't have the traditional series actions to compensate for the slower parts. <br /> <br /> Give me Providing useful advice when watching movies: As a general rule of titillation that can be exploited, you will know that this movie will be ridiculous. Caprica has this thing. The director / writer often tries to compensate for his bad ability by throwing an empty body. It doesn't work at all and everything that can be done is to reduce the relevance of the involved actress and I feel. Sorry for them, the director / writer who did this should be banned from doing business. <br /> <br /> If you want to be bored for half an hour by renting Caprica, there is free pornography on the internet if you want. t Cold naked body Otherwise, do not go here.
