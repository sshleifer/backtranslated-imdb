I don't know what the Oscar voters saw in this movie. But they have to see very difficult things to see in the movie in order to be rewarded with the best Oscar All I know is fortunately that Gene Kelly has to play in it or this will be twice as bad as I believe it is. First of all, I don't think Leslie Karon is really suitable to play this role. She's not a talented person, she's not a great dancer, and she doesn't look good at all. It's a shame that an actor or an actor might destroy the movie just like playing because if Leslie Caron isn't in this story, it might make the movie great. This story is wise. The director is not bad and as I said, Gene Kelly is quite good. Now I'm not talking about all about Leslie Karon just to criticize her. I just said that because I think that's the worst part of this movie. She may be a good actor. But I can't tell because I haven't seen you in other matters But I think she's terrible in "An American in Paris", so if you want to see it forward But I tell you, you better see "Singin 'in the rain"
