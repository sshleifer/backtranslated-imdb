***** Warning: There may be a spoiler ********* My big problem with this movie is how to be self-centered and self-sacrificing adulterous wife !! After having one night standing with a slippery psychosis, she is being stalked by him. He calls her all the time and threatens her and also sends videos of their nights together. He is crazy, crazy and very dangerous. The problem is that she thought he was dangerous to HER (and revealed her secret). She never thought of worrying about her husband for a moment! Did she not even think that he might be in danger of this psychosis? As soon as she realized how he should warn her husband, no matter what happened May have never had a movie before But actually it doesn't really exist, so what's the difference?
