That's what my friend Brian talked about this movie after about an hour. He couldn't prevent him from falling asleep. I talked about the horrific way and I finally bowed and played it without the adjective for the word "boring". <br /> <br /> Imagine if you want the highest point of Hack So unpleasant things are so scary that everything you need after watching it is sitting alone in the dark and not talking to anyone. Some people work under the illusion that this movie can be watched. It is not under any form of drug or brain damage. I will only recommend this to someone to help them understand that it is really unbearable. Don't believe me. Compile around. <br /> <br /> Receiving as our nation in America doesn't show. To the people of the Middle East, always tasteful, but then the children in the bow dress Salaam-fashion With Castrol's oil bottle? You will find here. Get it? ARAB Worship Oil I don't want to believe what I see For children to fly a plane to a skyscraper should be more appropriate. Who in the right mind will think of humor? It's not close to "Clever dissatisfaction" is terrible and makes you want to punch anyone who is paid to write that bit in the face. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the movie, five singers group called That "mine" will take the stage on the ball of the staff. Okay - are you ready? The joke is their terrier and off-key. Why am I writing it with capital letters? Because the joke is a pound, pound, combined with your head with a marathon of awesome jokes They started moderately enough; The glasses were broken, the glass of water that was broken into pieces ... and then, I was 100% serious, the sequence of stopping the two frames of the women's shoes came out. You read correctly - terrible songs in a single frame, the feet of women wearing shoes in the next episode - shoes closed !!! Understand because the music is terrible, her shoes go off! What F. ??? <br /> <br /> Then there was a stock video editing to drive home to the point where singing was a bad thing. If any human being suffered from this scene in the theater without running like hell, I would be amazed. This movie is like a practical joke to see how fast people will go out. Robert Downey Sr. directs a comedy about his son's respect without drugs. Not good. Other things that should be Be careful: <br /> <br /> 1 popular song put anywhere possible Every time the licensee appears, playing an improper Iggy Pop song In addition, every actor tried his best to act like it was really cold for some reason. <br /> <br /> 2 Barbara Bach's awesome accent She sounded like she was trying to talk like a baby while rolling the marble on her tongue. There are no nudity, and there are many scenes that every boy lamented and lamented from her rift as if they were in a performance class in a community school. <br /> <br /> 3 Liceman pulled a dog condom that was worth Disgust of him Remember that; When the film came out in "Abortion" and "Condom" was seen as "frustrated". <br /> <br /> 4. Tom Poston, a pedophile pedophile starving boy, came back when Hollywood thought "pedophile. "And" Homosexuality "is one of the same embarrassing things. <br /> <br /> 5. Look at the ending. There is nothing wrong with your VCR. That is the end. Who has created a movie? <br /> <br /> See this at your own risk. Up The Academy is well known for creating other movies such as The Jerk or Blazing Saddles. It's funny. Just place a video tape near you.
