I saw this back in the year of '94 when it was finally released. Obviously because of Orion's image of bankruptcy, I thought that this film was not released two years ago. <br /> <br /> I had trouble remembering some details because I hadn't seen it for a long time I remember it was a very boring movie. I still argue that I will walk away from it. Shops are not interesting or engaging at all. Is an imitation of America's graffiti # 3. <br /> <br /> There are no performances that should be worth watching. One of the biggest disappointments since local newspaper critics gave high marks.
