When my wife and I decided to watch this movie, we thought it would not fail. I love Billy Crystal. My wife likes Julia Roberts and everyone we talk to says that they like it. <br /> <br /> We are misled. <br /> <br /> My part, I feel Billy The character of the crystal is one dimension and makes this film very small. Of course, he played two good jokes. But as a character, he doesn't do anything except to spend a lot of space. <br /> <br /> Poor and Julia Roberts In the past, she played well as a woman who was determined and determined. In this flick, she seemed completely restrained and had very little fire. This is not Julia Roberts, who my wife likes to see. <br /> <br /> Okay if I have to find a good thing. Now that is entertainment. But like Billy Crystal, which shows his character almost nothing. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a night of unconscious laughs with a very little ransom But if you are looking for a romantic and intelligent comedy, this is not your movie. It's not above
