That's what I found myself talking again and again in Scene 3 of the excuse for the movie. First of all, computer effects are really incredible! Those computers should be slapped back. The rest of the movie, though ... <br /> <br /> There are no characters in a realistic manner, especially in the third scene. It's not worth it to be a secret!) Many laughing movies happen unintentionally, like when they try to explain that the invisible eyelids of men don't work. Please give more credit to the audience !!! <br /> <br /> The sexual aspect of this film is interesting. What do you do if you can't see it? No one can catch you! These problems, if getting more attention, Kevin Bacon's mad scientist may feel a little more emotional. <br /> <br /> This movie will be more successful as a porn because the place can actually Perform in a unique and interesting manner. But this piece ... go see something else Or not and stay with the result. <br /> <br /> 3/10
