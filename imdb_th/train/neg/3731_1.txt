I was raised in a "Christian" house. Since birth, I have been recorded before seeing this film and the remaining series and being forced to watch the youth group at the church This movie is very disruptive. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and a true nightmare for many years. I've slept in my bed and listened to my mother's footsteps. If I didn't hear your footsteps, I would sneak upstairs to make sure she wouldn't get angry. I used to pray hard every night for salvation because I was afraid of Jesus who forgot me. This is not something I will show my children until they are older. I spent many years shaking my fear that this movie gave me.
