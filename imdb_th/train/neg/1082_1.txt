I think I've watched all of Grisham's movies now and in general they are terrible, except The Rainmaker, but this one is terrible. It's unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Spoiler warning <br / > <br /> It's one of the movies that the characters do that doesn't have a stupid reason that no one else does. He is a lawyer for Christ's sake. Why, when his children disappeared, he didn't call the police. Oh yes, because every police officer hates lawyers, so they ignore and let him be attacked. <br /> <br /> When he is arrested for murder, they let him free. He is locked in a cell. Waiting for bail trial. <br /> <br /> Why do you have to drag your children halfway around the country when you can protect them easily at home? <br /> <br /> Police don't care at all. Will try to find a mental patient who has escaped They do not want to interview his daughter. <br /> <br /> For a ridiculous ending. <br /> <br /> Totally stupid, stupid, unrealistic, and totally time consuming. <br /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst movies ever made
