There are bad movies. They are funny and there are people you scream. "I need my life for one and a half hours" ... That's what it really is. <br /> <br /> Dean Adam tries to be an actor but fails. Sfx is terrible (scenes and cubes Repeated rocks that look like drop paper) and fake plastic guns with torches attached to them ... Split screen effects used to perform many things at the same time are terrible. <br /> < br /> This movie cannot be used as one of the contributors. Nightlife simple But it was so bad. <br /> <br /> If I can give a negative score
