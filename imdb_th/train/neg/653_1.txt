If I actually rate this movie, it should be in a negative number. While I respect the fact that there are serious scary people who make these horror movies, people buying tickets for this movie is a waste of money. You can spend time with something worth the time. <br /> < br> Although it is a horror movie But there is nothing terrifying about this, unless you see how terrifying the ancient idea of ​​a movie that scares you. If scoring higher than this, it is possible to make a better movie in the long run. <br /> <br /> Anyone who does "Prom Night" in this version Actors may perform well if they are not suspicious. This is a terrible movie theater trip. I will meet "One Missed Call" again. At least there is a plan.
