Things that make the French connection work well. The relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider) in this disaster is directed by Frankenheimer (Who brought gems such as Raindeer Games and Island of Dr. Moreau) to us. The film focuses on Doyle and the passion for capturing Charnier (Rey). Charnier, with help from the French local authorities, makes laugh out loud, correct me if I'm wrong, but Charnier doesn't cross the city with a 65 pound pure hit !!! The road worth 32 million, but yes, send Doyle to find this man. It can't squeeze him. Please !!! Weak story The performance was terrible. (Except for the only one of the hackers who have an overwhelming role) the direction is everywhere Even the wounds between the scenes were terrible. Do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one.
