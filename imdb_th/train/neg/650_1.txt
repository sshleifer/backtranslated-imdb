Why does Hollywood feel the need to create a great movie? (Massacre at Texas Chainsaw, The Hills Have Eyes) But it's worse. Why Hollywood feels the need to create a horror movie that doesn't start again (Prom Night, The Amityville Horror) like their original. These things create a failure to create an atmosphere, character or fear of any genuine. Prom Prom is smooth and doesn't look interesting. But because of the wrong reason <br /> <br /> It's a bad journey, not the most interesting and boring thing that fails in everything it is designed to do. It's clear that Hollywood horror movies are dead. Even the likes of The Hills Have Eyes and the Texas Chainsaw massacre were able to destroy their franchisees in style with a blood tank and a good plot. Prom night was almost without blood and I didn't. Talked about how bad the story The inability to seal the killer makes this movie the least suspicious horror movie since uh ... the original <br /> <br /> One of the most famous slasher films of the 1980s came back.

Donna and her best friends prepare to Enjoy the big explosion of high school by living and partying until dawn. But while Donna is willing to look through her nightmares and go into a brighter future than those she thinks she has escaped forever, has returned to the last dance.

Donna will do it when she Forced to face her greatest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis are co-stars in making movies that will have every teenager wearing a tuxedo looking at their shoulders while sticking out on the dance floor. Plots that may not make you want to see this The witch, if you ask me what is good, <br /> <br /> Without much work, McCormick tries to milk out the most provocative situation. At one point, a young woman retreated to the floor lamp (lamp!) And McCormick tried to pump up at a terrible time. When really desperate, calling for desperate measures There has never been a wardrobe picture since the last IKEA catalog. <br /> <br /> In the era of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and To Catch a Predator, there may be scary and scary movies. Was excavated from the inflammation of glamor and passion in an eerie society with youthful beauty This is not that movie. <br /> <br /> My final decision. Avoid all costs. Nobody likes Prom Night. It's a disappointment for those who often enjoy hacking. Considering blood deficiency or being absolutely shocked One night you will quickly forget.
