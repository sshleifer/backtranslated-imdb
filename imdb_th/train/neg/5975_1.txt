I never wanted to watch this movie, then one day funny, I watched it to see that it wasn't good; My bias has been confirmed. <br /> <br /> For beginners, I want to question the film's politics. It is hidden behind a woman's mask. 'Make it big in the city' but the only way women can make it big is to use their sex rather than their intelligence or skills. These women are nothing more than prostitutes. Is this less charming girl not allowed to succeed? This is not the only right-wing message of the movie. There are hundreds of American flags and huge amounts of money. A good example of what is the only power in America is capitalism and spiritual values, morals or art, even if not viewed in this film. Money is the only important thing for young people. <br /> <br /> Bar manager says she doesn't allow drug users to stay in her bar. Your own neck and then the neck of your employees and customers Anyone who knows anything about intoxication will know that the liquor has the same dangers as heroin and is more dangerous than most illegal drugs. <br /> <br /> And finally, the scene where the characters lead is the way. sex Audience interest (When she doesn't dress or with her boyfriend) Is your father always involved? We watched, making her not dressed in a camera, almost gliding her legs while she was calling her father. She 'auctioned' her father like she 'auctioned' her boyfriend. I found this strange thing. <Br /> <br /> In summary, this film is a moral deception, fascism has deteriorated towards women and frankly disturbing. But what do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
