This is a really big story that can't help myself. Jeffrey (Jon Hader) is a 29-year-old man who still lives with his mother (Diane Keaton) and Not planning to go anywhere Until his mother met a businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels) whom she might marry. <br /> <br /> It would be a good movie if Heder didn't play his annoying Jeffrey. Began not having the opportunity to like him and it was getting worse. In the end we should like him But there was no reason he didn't change from the selfish beast that he was the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> Keaton didn't look to try and be in a form of horror after 2007. Because I said that Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Haider and Keaton, and where to believe that their mother and son The only saving grace is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris, although they are not interested as well. In addition to the small smile, this movie is not worthy of being called funny because there is nothing to laugh! If you're in your mood for the latest Diane Keaton flicks, see Mad Money or Smother, which is much better than this deep endeavor.
