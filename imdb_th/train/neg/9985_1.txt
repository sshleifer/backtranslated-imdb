Have I ever seen a movie that is not as shocking as this? I can think of many that are equal to this one. But no one managed better All actors are scary maps that are full of flat conversations. I was ashamed of everyone involved in doing this. Each person put fear that is not caused by the plot. But by realizing that this project can be easily accomplished Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz do not have enough reason to make this a reality. Of course, it's the style of movies that Americans don't understand. See the final results if you want and you will see what I'm talking about. But don't say I didn't warn you ...
