*** Reviews may have some spoilers *** I will give this review short and sweet. I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounds interesting and there are some top performers, such as Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. Is it really bad? It's not good. Justin Timberlake. The journalist scrambled with a case that could lead to police corruption in Edison's police force. LL Cool J was Deed, a police officer in the special forces of the Special Forces team called FRAT (Strategy Retaliate against First), he joined bad cop "modern" names Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) In the opening scene we see Lazerov & Deed been a bank robber. But at night, they are holding two drug makers. I do not want to give out much, but things are not good for those who do drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman) went to experiment with Deeds & Lazerov. He suspected that there was a foul play and with Ashford's help, there was some ugly investigation of Wallace (Kevin Spacey) inside the FRAT. The team joined Ashford to try to bring the corrupt police to justice. <br /> <br /> You can tell from the beginning that Freeman's and Spacey's performances are quite boring. The only person who gave the full performance was Dylan McDermott. He was the perfect case in this film and made believers come out of me. LL Cool J Terrible in this movie, he said that every line is the same and shows emotions Same feeling He has improved a lot in movies such as Deep Blue Sea and Any Given Sunday. The movie starts with good action. But then dragging his feet across the rest of the movie. The ending is far from satisfying. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time with this movie. I put it on eBay this weekend.
