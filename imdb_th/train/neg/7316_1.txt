When I saw an example of this film, I didn't expect much to start with a teenage horror movie around the second. But wow this movie is really scary And that is openness. <br /> <br /> First of all, casting for the movie is terrible. You don't feel sympathetic. (Or for that matter, any unusual feeling) for the character The performance was so bad that I just waited and hoped that the horrible things of the Lord would end Can you explain why the boy who looks like a boy started screaming "PANCAKES !!!" at the top of his lungs while moving Jackie Chan? With another virus? Why did the father of the boy become angry with the virus and go on a narrow-minded hunt to find him? I was confused and most skeptical that I said loudly, "Where did the hell come from?" <br /> <br /> I just don't want to believe what I have seen. I think I've seen some bad movies. But I must say that Cabin Fever ranks them all. This movie makes me want to puke and puke again. Then blow my brain. <br /> <br /> Please help yourself a half hour and do more useful things. Viewing the grass may be the right choice.
