I used to think that "The Stoned Age" was the worst movie ever created ... I was wrong. "Hobgoblins" overtook in every way I could imagine, and a few I couldn't. Characters in "Hobgoblins" I hate actors ... and everyone involved in this cruelty I will not include teasers in this movie. I'm not a cruel person. I can't control the innocent people like you. In fact, conversations about the plot related to this film are unreasonable and disrespectful. The words I use to describe this movie are: insinid, asinine, and ingenuous <br /> <br /> In summary, please do not watch this movie. I wish you from one movie lover to another ... not from one human to another, please please. For the sake of your own consciousness and intelligence, do not watch it. Destroy the copy you found.
