I am not one of those people who are just online after I watched the movie and decided to call it the worst movie ever created. If you doubt me, please see my other comments. However, for the first time I saw a movie that was so scary that I wanted to write about its badness before it ended. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. For me, Ed Wood is a genius. I think Bloody Murder, Jeepers Creepers and horror horror movies are the best. However, there is no good thing that I can say about this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot does not exist. If someone reading my review had to pay for it, they could distinguish themselves. But I recommend that you know that nickel is more valuable than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The special technique is not good. <br /> <br /> The performance is not good. <br /> <br /> Chance In both sales are charming. But that's all there is. <br /> <br /> I'm not the type to Make the movie lose for everyone But I invite everyone to email me at foxbarking@yahoo.com To ask for my opinion about this film before they lose a little I'll tell you. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies and I love horror and I love new creative movies. I love things that are horrible like a hostel. (Which some reviewers claim to be like this But obviously they think that just because Roger Bart is in this and the hostel 2) but this may be the most worthless and stupid movie number 1 and ever made <br /> <br /> And before you ignore this review comes from someone who not only But watching all the premiere of House of the Dead but actually buying copies
