Forbidden Siren is based on the Siren 2 Playstation 2 (2s) game. Like most video games that turn into movies, I would say that most people do not translate into different media and that causes pain like <br /> <br /> There are long chapters that explain and define the place for the story and the mysterious island that the writer (Leo Morimoto) and his children, daughter Yui Ichikawa and son Hideo. (Jun Nishiyama) came in. The villagers didn't look too friendly and soon the correct voice guidance about the island sirens would be inside when the siren began to groan. <br /> <br /> Naturally and slowly, things started. Our brothers and sisters traveled to the mission around the bush to find out what had happened on an unfriendly island with strange inhabitants. But in reality, you will not be interested in what happens while the villagers and tales are thrown in to convince the story more. The thing that pushes it into the realm of bad humor is a bad time that has been unconsciously laid out, which is just a laughing giggle at its stupidity until later explained. It is one thing that tries to think and present something wise. But there is another thing that makes it reliable and vulnerable to cover. <br /> <br /> Even if it takes 90 minutes - I think it's a horror movie that has Runtime benchmark - gives almost two hours of feeling with a slow buildup to tell you what you need. Things start to pick up in the last 20 minutes. But it is a classic case that is too late. <br /> <br /> The thing that saves movies is to change the tag and reveal at the end. Again, this is a common device used to try and raise the horror film that seems easy to become a little more special, hoping to make the audience impressed. It turned out to be satisfactory. But leave a bad taste as you feel cheated Twisting will have two ways to make you feel - it helps to raise the movie to a memorable level or give a new feeling. Unfortunately, the sirens are forbidden from the back. <br /> <br /> The elegance of saving is a film that uses shadows and mirrors. But it wasn't worth the time To avoid this problem
