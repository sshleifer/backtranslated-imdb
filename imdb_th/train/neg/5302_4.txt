Dewaana, as a movie, must go through ancient ideas. The man and woman fell in love and married. The husband was killed by a family friend who wanted a fortune. Their family remarried and was surprised that the number 1 husband appeared again. This film is reminiscent of Chandni of Yash Chopra and countless others. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan give good performances. Amrish Puri as a villain has to go through the movement and nothing more than a Bollywood villain. Nadeem Shravan's music standards are excellent. All songs are excellent. My favorite is Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is an ordinary movie that has to go through movement.
