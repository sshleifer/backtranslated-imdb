I love my students in the first two seasons. <br /> <br /> But now with Season 5? (Or is it 6?) Things are getting too easy. <br /> <br /> I used to like acting. But it became Donald Trump Ego Festival, received his company. You will work but come! Something says "You were burnt." It's just an insult. <br /> <br /> After watching the program, I didn't want to work for him. Not because he is such an arrogant person It's an unrealistic act and the way he handles things makes me struggling. Good entertainment? Yes, but tired after being stabbed. Very tired .. It's not team work, not personal. It's just a business. Watch your back jack
