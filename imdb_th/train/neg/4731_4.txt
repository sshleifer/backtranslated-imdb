Half-hearted effort to bring Elvis Presley into the modern era But even with a little sexy shower scene and a subplot of Playboy magazine, Presley is surrounded by old shyness. Women pick EP up on the beach and then proceed to live their lives. He - and he doesn't seem to care! Dick Sargent deteriorated in the side of the other side, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Try hard like the two Elvis bosses (he is the one with the moonlight, you see). "Almost fell in love", but if you want to see a lazy person, hipper, update Elvis sex-comedy - look elsewhere when Elvis and his horrifying tourist attractions go to bed together. There is a wooden board between they! Get real ** from ****
