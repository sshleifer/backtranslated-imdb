The location is interesting. But sadly, this movie isn't fair at all. The casting is quite good and it can shoot beautifully - but in that way there is a very inconsistent direction. (The quick fix was not affected at all .... I waited for Steven Bochco to work on credit, followed by ads). (And everything else left to Boogie Nights for character development) and there is no suitable character to attract viewers to the story Very memorable movie
