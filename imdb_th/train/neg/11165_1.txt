I mean really ... I will soon have a sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie. It's ridiculous, ridiculous and not funny. <br /> <br /> When I saw the example, I knew it wouldn't be a great movie. I just didn't think it would be that bad .. <br /> <br /> What happened to a good era when you could find clever dialogue in every movie? When actors do not have to play a ridiculous role in trying to be funny? Now we find ourselves having a movie like this. Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie 4 I can't find funny parts. <br /> <br /> Just skip this piece. <br /> <br /> PS (Sorry for my English)
