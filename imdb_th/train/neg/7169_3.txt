This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. However, Alice and Jared Harris mimic Christopher Walken is what makes this movie fun. Smoking, drinking and Alice's performance when appearing, her name is strange and interesting. I have to applaud Jared for the imitation of Christopher Walk and Christopher Woking for this to be true
