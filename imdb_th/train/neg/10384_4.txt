.. It's one! A wonderful place in front of the bat. <br /> <br /> There is a great first scene to give credit when determining credit. <br /> <br /> There are strong characters and good scripts for Ghost story But this is what disturbs me: whenever the ghost appears, which I like the most How does it look? ... The only thing is the relationship of the ghost. Because things that happen in the first scene that you think their dynamic is different It's just not good. But actually the ending is very good! Of course, 'The Grudge' tells the same story using a polished lens. But there is no samurai and that is what I like about this movie. Compare <br /> <br /> Please someone who has a good temperament to create this movie. Will definitely love this movie
