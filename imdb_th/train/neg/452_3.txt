I watched this movie for a love project. Please tell Nicolas Cage to learn how it feels about his character and read the script he spoke again My life cannot continue ... I accidentally cut my own hand ... My brother is near. Apparently his fault And since when the happy ending has included good people who take care of the sad and alone mother There is no closing of bad scripts and there are not enough secondary character extensions. Help yourself unless you laugh The costumes were made appropriately and the specials did a great job. I'm sure it will be a fun movie to do. But to be a more specific type, I can't recommend this movie to people I know. It is not a chicken flick. It's not a strict romance. And I can't show children because of gender and questions that need to be followed In conclusion, not just a good flick
