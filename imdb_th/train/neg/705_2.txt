Anne Ryan's books are very few here, meaning nothing. Some characters - characters that are violent and surprising - don't go to the screen at all, and those who are watered down to the point that there is no reason for their existence. <br /> Where is the relationship? What is between Christophe and Marcel? Where is the continuation between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose appear because her story has never been explained? Where is the rape and redemption of Marie, which is the greatest feature? (And the destruction) that she can pass on to white - and her marriage to Richard? Why did the movie end with Marcel dancing in the hands of his father? We didn't learn anything from Aglae more than she was a bitch who hated her husband. Why is there no background to explain this hatred? <br /> <br /> For the show, there are no better people than ordinary people, even if it's because of a nasty script. The best thing is the actor who plays Richard. But Richard wasn't on the screen enough to salvage this matter. The worst is Jasmine Bodhi as Dolly Rose, although it comes down again to an actress who has nothing to do with what she has received from a little work. <br /> <br / > All of this is scary. I think it would be impossible for any movie that Anne Rice to be worse than EXEN TO EDEN, but FEAST of SAINTS makes that look messy. Why would rice become an eater, would you allow her best work to become garbage on the screen?
