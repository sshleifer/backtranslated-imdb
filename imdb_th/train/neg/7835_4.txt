Men, I really want to like these items. I am starving for a good television and I applaud TNT for giving these "opportunities", but sadly I am in the minority that I think when it comes to Stephen King cinema. The writing of the king is brilliant. The irony is that it doesn't translate well on the screen, whether big or small. With a few exceptions (very few), King's experience cannot be filmed with the same effect that the story has when reading. Many people will not agree with this. But I'm sure that in their hearts, they have to admit that the best story of the king is filming. But the hilarious memories of the stories that they read for simple reasons, the stories of the average king arose in the imagination of the characters in the story He gave us an idea of ​​the inner thoughts, emotions and perspectives that are broken or unreal. Sometimes, in the short term, King replaces the reader that you can't put Panavision cameras as an audience watching the King. More than half that readers can access It's not too far to claim that one has become a character in the story of the king that they read while one is limited to having to sneak in that same character when filming. As long as King writes Hollywood, will try to shoot everything that comes out of his word processor, regardless of whether or not he should do it. I don't blame the filmmakers for trying. But it requires a lot of skill and caution to pull the difficult to understand Stephen King adaptation that works This mission is similar to turning lead into gold. Well, good luck next time.
