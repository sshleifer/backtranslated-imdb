This is the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen and probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The actors and actors are horrible and it seems that they are trying hard to play their role as a strong, jerky, jerky, knowing everything and the big feet are terrible. It appears to be a computer that has been created since Atari & Intellivision. At one point, at the end of the movie, while the army of sasquatches was pursued, one of the remaining survivors was shot, and while it was running, it seemed that the donkey's poor version of Kong! And the bullets were hit by bullets and the blood flowing out of it was a terrible animation The annoying thing is music. Way to the way too much music (Classic scores or what you call it) throughout the movie It's not the end Oh yes, the movie is boring too. One of the worst movies I've ever seen I suggest you shoot $ 3 or whatever they think of renting this movie and use it with a gas gallon or a valuable menu. Truly awesome!
