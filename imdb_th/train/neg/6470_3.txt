Disney reached a point that was better than anyone had ever seen. The original LITTLE MERMAID will feel blatantly torn. Celebrating the birth of Melody, daughter, Ariel and Eric, plans to introduce her to King Triton. The celebration fails quickly by the sister of Monsula Morca, who plans to use melodies as a defense tool for To get the trident of King Ariel and Eric to create a wall around the ocean while Melody grew up wondering why she could not go there. <br /> <br /> Scary and terrible is what Athit By the sequel of this video directly LITTLE MERMAID 2 delivers a sense that everything you see looks like a Disney movie, I guess that Disney can replicate themselves only! Don't tell me that penguins and walruses don't remind you of another partner from LION KING! <br /> <br /> Other disappointing moments include the match between Sebastien and Louie, the chef. They played horribly! The important point between Morgana and everyone seems to be disappointing again. <br /> <br /> I won't give anything, but in 75 minutes everything seems to be narrow and unbelievable. The disgrace of Disney LITTLE MERMAID 2 is better to rent and laugh at. You can then prepare for the rest of Disney's next season to make you drown later.
