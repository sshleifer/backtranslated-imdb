Frank Capra's creativity takes time to create this movie. While it has a few charming moments and many great actors, Capra's recycling is not just a script. But as an important image from the story of his first version, Broadway Bill (1934) is a worthless person. It is well understood that he will use the video from the horse riding competition again, which is exciting. But he used the whole conversation scene with the little actor, then brought those actors back and it seems that we would not notice, like the Ward Ward is 14 years old! Unless you want to see one of Oliver Hardy's last appearances, skip it and watch Broadway Bill instead.
