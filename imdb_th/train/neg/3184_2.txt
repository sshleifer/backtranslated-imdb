I have never been impressed with JD before and Final Justice (which I have never seen before broadcasting MST3k) proves that there are no exceptions. Not that the character is more cute than Mitchell. But it is less than Geronimo ("Call me 'Heronimo'). I don't like <br /> <br /> Actually, one of Mitchell's suspects and the final judges. Plans to get revenge on Joe Don's agent. Try to get the "star" killed by inducing a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Joe Don must find a new agent because he is now graduating. "Comic Relief" in the James Bond movie. The problem is that it is difficult to tell the difference between his comedy character there and his "serious" character in his action movie. <br /> < br /> For the plot .. They repeat the same set over and over again. You will think that you are watching the Groundhog Day of 2. Suppose they still use the same scene of Geronimo out of the prison. Funny story .. Hmm, yes, anything. <br /> <br / > On the positive side, the view of Malta is very beautiful, so it kicks up to 2 for me. Mongolian has designated Malta to travel for a few decades.
