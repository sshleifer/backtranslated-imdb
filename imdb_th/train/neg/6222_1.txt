I'm not sure that the user should be allowed to check the movie after sitting half. But I'm afraid I can't stand for another minute. <br /> <br /> If this excuse for the movie wasn't possible, I had a great GP swirling like a wheel in his grave. /> <br /> Excellent review above 'Not a movie for Parson's fans, directors and writers. (Second rate) Dare to try to do things that they can't clearly show. What are they thinking Where will I start? <br /> <br /> Script: I think I will get a bittersweet. What I get is to carry the body, hurt the body badly, without clich√©, stupid, hippie, stupid police check. Stupid? Check out the terrible plans, check the female characters, write shy? check again. Ignoring all the stories that you are trying to convey. <br /> <br /> After a while, you realize that what you are watching is a soap and not a good thing.

BBC called the king of the valley And it was reasonable ... <br /> <br /> Acting: Now are we really important when some men from the TV decide to go out to perform if he doesn't get bad, he stinks us? Applaud his efforts? Knoxville just about managed to pass all the bad scenes. Christina A. There is no luck like this. Her performance was a car crash. (Even if you do anything with those lines, I don't know) The hippies that are in the body of the car: Oh dear. Oh, dear. Oh, baby. We didn't move from Cheech and Chong or not. <br /> <br /> I can go further. But I think you probably drifted away What I have to say is that, as others say, there is no one in this movie that is clearly a flying man for The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers, or Gram's solo work. And of course they tried to do everything with a good story from the legendary stone This film is shallow, unable to find anything, and the jaw cleared from the beginning to ... Oh, wait, I'm not finished. And I suggest you stay away too
