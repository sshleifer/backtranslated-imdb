For some reason, in the late 1970s and early 80s, CBS local stations in New York continued to play this movie late on Friday or Saturday nights for many years, usually at 2 am or sometimes It is a movie that is suitable for that time period because it is difficult to follow and quite strange. (See other reviews for specific story information) However, after holding it many times in the past, cable TV (And even after it was hit But before they offered the program all night) I still caught this strange thing. After not seeing it for many years, I decided to see if I could find it on the DVD. It's only applicable (From every search I have done) in a small print on the label "Brentwood Video" which is part of the 4 movies (4 movies on the two sides) called "different human worlds Stars "If anyone is interested, usually about $ 10, but even less, if you buy products around the movie, the other 3 stories in this series are available in many other public domain movie collections. No Need to comment with them here. But I don't see "eyes" available elsewhere Although it is almost "restored" in any way, this type of printing takes approximately 92 minutes. Therefore, when the 90-minute IMDb working time specified is incorrect Although it takes 92 minutes to work, it is not uncommon for movies to be shown in English from another language. It seems to be a common way of budget conscience to save money, sometimes not having to dub some voices if they don't think it is important to the story. Longer versions will cause less confusion, or will anyone really know unless you see it as a native language ... However, my efforts to watch during the day are ineffective and ultimately I just closed it. There is something about watching this thing in the middle of the night that is suitable for this movie, or maybe it's just my experience before. Who knows ??
