I should love this movie The performance was very good and Barbara Stanwick was great. But this movie seems to be interesting to me This film makes people in the working class look low and cheap. The fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and daughter who is not above it makes me feel uneasy Barbara Stanweek while mother gave birth to a daughter But the daughter forgot that she loved to find happiness with her very well for the family I wonder how other people who used to watch this movie felt about it. The performance was very good and worth watching. I don't like the story Just a personal setting. Thank you.
