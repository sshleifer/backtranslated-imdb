This film is not worth the movie shot. The conversation is filled with lines that are distracted and played by amateur actors who listen. They seem to read the script for the first time. The shaky and shaky movie style mimics the "The Ring" style effect. Cheap. Characters don't act like normal people. For example, the character looking for her twin sister at her house forced her to walk through the front door, sneaking around the house, shocked and sobbing, and she didn't call her sister's name to see if she was at home. Or what? You think she just buried her sister instead of searching for her. Overloading her childhood Too many unnecessary events are normal signs of amateur directors. In fact, it's funny to see the pictures of many women driving her car along the road, the road running, around this corner, right here, right here, the side view, now the front view is enough. That you are watching TV ads for Solaris! The movie is terrible. 0 out of 100. I pity anyone who uses money to make this movie or watch it really.
