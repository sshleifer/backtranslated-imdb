I read the story of John Everham many years ago in Reader's Digest and I remember thinking about creating a great movie. And it would be impossible for Michael Landon to never grab it As far as I am concerned, Landon is one of the worst actors in the world, and his art license is up to the top, similar to the massacre of his "little house" series. The performances that do not have a better word are very scary. The screenplay is sloppy and there are more intimate stories of Landon cats than they should be allowed. <br /> <br /> The film reflects enough of Everingham With "Little House On The Prairie" reflecting the book "Follow" on it is just another vehicle that shows the terrifying feats of the Landons
