Now this movie is my metric compared to other movies that will be compared ... like in "Is it stupid like Revolver?" I was at the Toronto International Film Festival last night. Which is filled with more than 2,000 people, walking out in the eerie silence. Jason Stratham is amazing if only But he had a purpose. In the first 10 minutes, he received an offer from Andre 3000 and the Big Pussy (from Soprano's reputation) which made no sense at all! Then there was a shot, and then there was Ray Liotta wearing an embarrassing bikini pants. Then there was some movement of Ray Liotta's naked butt, shooting a lot of teeth, gnashing teeth, which I wasn't sure was the reaction to him. Looking for ... not the next 5 times. Everyone in this movie thinks himself smarter than a typical bear and Guy Ritchie thinks he's a yogi bear. The story may be nowhere. But the poses look too real! The only way this movie will be worse is Madonna, if himself in there.
