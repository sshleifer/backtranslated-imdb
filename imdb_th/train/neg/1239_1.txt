As a big fan of the movie "PLANET OF THE APES", I rented this DVD even if I didn't like everything in Tim Burton. He wasn't disappointed with the direction that didn't get his attention again. Even with the E-makeup, there is still a second rate that cannot be forgiven when considering the great budget of this wonder. Mark Wahlberg proved immediately and all he was not an actor. (As if BOOGIE's night didn't prove enough) I felt embarrassed because of the true talent like Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. No doubt their paychecks were an inspiration to them because it couldn't be a movie script Be bored I rented this DVD for $ 1 a special night and I still feel torn.
