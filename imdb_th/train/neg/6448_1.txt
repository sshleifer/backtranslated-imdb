Unknown creatures are the right words for this movie. Or may be called an unknown movie This movie is a scandal from the beginning. It has a pathetic "plot", "show" and "special effects". <br /> <br /> "post-teens", thirty years old, some are locked in The forest with reptiles and reptiles made of rubber, a set that is lurking around endlessly. What you get from this movie is talking and doing a little precious. You have a girl who is walking through the forest. You talk, then you have men. (With heavy mascara) walking through the forest that is talking The whole thing is so boring. <br /> <br /> The creatures are almost invisible in most movies. When it showed a distorted image to cover the fact that it was a man in a rubber suit and the movement showed that it was a suit, so the reason for blurring and distortion of the picture <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie on any subject, because the words and movies that have been praised are the most likely that people who have been picked up on the road to "act" in this amazing movie! Skip this course!
