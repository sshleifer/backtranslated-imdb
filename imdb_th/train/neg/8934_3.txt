I bought this DVD without any previous reference, but the names of John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on the cover. I found a very strange Brazilian title. But I decided to see how funny it might look like "switches". However, the irrelevant stories were scary and difficult to explain. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) was sent to surgery to change his sex in Copenhagen and He returns to Hollywood, saying that she will be Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and claiming to be the treasure of Buck Loner uncle. Throughout the day, Myra and her ego, Myron makes a young couple in the school. The Her uncle's sex freak. At one point, the movie was so confusing that I believed that the whole story was just a journey in Myron's heart that was caused by an accident. Unfortunately, the beauty of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett is not enough to flick this image. My score is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher At√© Certo Ponto" ("Men & women reach the point")
