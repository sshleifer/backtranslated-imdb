This is a scary movie. All three stories will have mental psychic braces that are not necessary and everything is bad. The first thing is about wild wolves and some women have something that is not reasonable. But what is hypnotized is like that. The second person with Bill Paxton is not good as a crazy roommate should not be watched by anyone. The last sad thing is something that is almost impossible to understand, which I think is better than general garbage.
