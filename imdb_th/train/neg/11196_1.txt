My friend and I walked away after 15 minutes and we were not the first one. After that, we tried to get a refund. Cinema management is not allowed to do this. But they agreed to let us watch another movie The only time working for us was to see Dickie Roberts: Child Child Star. As you can tell, this is not a memorable night. May be one of my worst movies tonight. The second shutdown has to be when I see the head of the local disturbance and robbery. In summary, for the benefit of mankind, please do not see the command.
