(Which didn't tell much, Anna Neagle was absolutely ridiculous like Nanette, no matter what kind of charm she has today, they won't appear clearly in this movie.

Obviously, the studio didn't feel compelled to pay for the musical performance of "No, No, Nanette". For what it's worth, a DVD can cost $ 1.00. It's worth it to say that you've been. See it
