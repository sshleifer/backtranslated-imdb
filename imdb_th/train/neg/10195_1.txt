Clearly, the writer / director of this film doesn't know anything about the movie. I think DP in this project is linked and replaced with monkeys because every sight is too dark or has a hot spot than the sun br /> <br /> The story is scary. The characters are one dimension. For someone to say that this movie was made for poker fans and not a movie fan, that someone is teasing themselves. There are no poker fans in this world who like this movie. Even your money people hate this project. If wanting to enter a casino and play a few hands, do not give the experience of writing about poker. Keeping your work day And if it's playing poker, you have to hurt yourself
