I'm a madman who made this movie. The more I am angry, I lose the precious time of my life. I sit still to see this. I should have a job doing wax and get more entertainment. At least Cherri made me laugh before it was painful. At first I felt a little confused. But after that I saw and understood what had happened. Up to now, this movie has gone half way. Yes, I am a procrastinator. But I want to see things until the end, so I stick it out. I watch it all. Not only actors But attracting cruel attention But they are unbelievable I've seen my nephew cry because it's more interested in sexual desire in this movie. If you like bad movies with bad performances, watch this.
