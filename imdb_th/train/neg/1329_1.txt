This movie is excellent. I didn't laugh hard in a comedy movie that was not intended for a long time. Leno should stick to stand up and the TV at night. The car in this movie is cool. But this movie is the most stupid movie I've ever seen. It is pathetic. The acting is terrible and the story may be written by a 4 year old boy. Don't understand me wrong. Jay leno is hilarious but not in this movie!
