It is best known among Shakespeare's plays easily. The humble direction, stagnant studio work and unusual performances make the tragedy go away. <br /> <br /> In Verona, Capulets and Montagues have been feuding for centuries. Montague falls in love with Juliet. (Rebecca Zaire) The Capulet. The bloodshed soon happened ... <br /> <br /> The studio work, especially in the daytime scene, makes the energy to play down. It is a powerful story and therefore should be shot outside the house. Alongside this set is scary with tights and too laughing. The battle on the stage looks scary by stretching and running too much to participate. <br /> <br /> Patrick Ryecart is too light to be a truly powerful Romeo. He manages the violence of the character when the plot occurs. But his emphasis and exaggeration, often with expressive eyes, does not limit his scope. It is very difficult for the audience involved in this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too young to be Juliet well. Naive character But will be greeted again a little. <br /> <br /> The supporting role is not much better. Joseph O'Connor's Friar Laurence is good, but his best line is cut too much. Andrews' Mercutio was on the stage, not in the camera. He gurns and gesticulates too much and looks ridiculous. As a result, Alan Rickman, who plays his role, almost doesn't seem to be Tybalt. Good in the following years But that is not the evidence here. The Prince can play a good role with his short appearance, but actor Lawrence Naismith has failed to give any power to the camera. Only Micheal Hordern in his best role in C This series comes out of this story with any dignity. His Capulet plays well and is happy to see. <br /> <br /> See one of the other versions of this story instead.
