This is one of the movies of the 70s that was certainly left and is the most striking story for the beginning of the Bigfoot hysteria. There is also a remarkable issue of insanity throughout the story, especially when the first half. Of darkness and emotions being replaced by MUSL INTERLUDE of all things (as other users point out as one of the songs dedicated to the character Travis Anyone canoeing for a while and then ... leaving it not to be seen again.) Even though it's a painful day, I am still a scary movie to show to children and everyone who enjoys the legend. Bigfoot or the rustic culture of the 70s was bound to be fired from this story. My favorite part: A man was so scared that he jumped headlong into the door (!?) And the narrator explained that he was unconscious from "shock". Uh, I would say that breaking the door with his head is likely why he Unconscious But whatever matter, <br /> <br /> 4/10 stars or 7/10 if you like Americana that is not good
