I don't understand people. Why does this movie get 8.3 !!!!!! ???? I have high hopes for this movie. But when I spent about half an hour I wanted to leave the cinema. In most comments on this website, people say that this is one of the best action movies they have ever seen. (Or during the summer, year, etc.) they say it's a great summary WTF !!!!!!!!! ?????? What are the conclusions? (In addition to the fact that Bond was able to ride a motorcycle, shoot and fight better than others he met)? What did you learn about Bond's character in this movie? ****** Nothing !!!!!!! Orochi, many actions But what is great about the action in this movie ?? I don't like movies and movie editing. Flicker camera effects and fast changing images are used too quickly and they are old. (I'm not interested in Supremacy because it's still easy to follow. I want it quickly. I save $$$ for other things. <br /> <br /> This film doesn't have a plot. All of these films take 115 minutes to follow. Bond, which you didn't really learn at all during the 115-minute period of the film, was perfect in everything he was trying to do. There is no exact character development in this movie, you don't know anything about anyone and there are many new characters presented in this sector. Some people say that this movie has incredible writing and skepticism ??????????? !!!!!!!! What to write ???? Wondering what ??? No doubt Bond is perfect in doing everything he does. I don't think he has anything to worry about. If this is the best movie of 2007, I may stop watching all the movies !!!! <br /> <br /> Many people say that Matt Damon's performance in this movie is one of the best careers. (If not the best) in his career What performance? How many lines do he have in this film ??? I have a respect for Damon because he is in a movie that I like and plays as a different type of character, but a good actor is someone you can hardly remember to watch another movie. Not the same person who has the same role over and over again (which Damon didn't do, but the example of the person doing Vin Diesel) <br /> <br /> However, this movie made me very disappointed. I do not recommend this movie But I recommend the first two (Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy) and of course I recommend reading three books. (Which is very different from movies)
