I don't get this Obviously, this film has a fairly good budget. It has a very good movie. It has good pacing, good editing and good governance as well. Why OH, why don't they hire people to write the last chapter, so it's not a wonderful thing, and why are they hiring punch actors? Can't leave the paper bag? This movie is very good. Often it looks good and feels good. But in the end you know that this movie is not good. <br /> <br /> So I will say it's a good performance. But it's a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> and eels? Come, really one!
