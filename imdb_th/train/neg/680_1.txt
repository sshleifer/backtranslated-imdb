I finally met "Starlight" on television tonight and everything I can say is ... Wow! It is difficult to know how to start - an incredible hokey effect. (Check out the laser beam shot from Willie's eyes!) Brutal performances, incredible conversations Infused with all production This is a unique experience and we should all be grateful for that. I nominated Jonathon Kay as the true heir of Ed Wood!
