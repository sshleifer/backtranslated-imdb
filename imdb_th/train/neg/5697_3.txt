This is the most original, original ghost story that doesn't make it even more lively if using Ireland's place. If the great Master James had thought about it before, some things actually did not have a story called "skinny ghosts"? - He will not care to publish it. Orson Welles appears in the soft ending scene which is favored by the old friend, the producer of the film His presence and the single film industry in jokes will make him an Oscar nominee. This is an additional proof if there is a need for an Oscar to never guarantee goodness.
