Just saw this movie last weekend. I was upset and disappointed with it. Essentially, the film tells you that immigrants from the former Soviet Union, especially in this country, took everyone they could from the old country and invaded and occupied what the Americans worked for Which is a very wrong way to see immigration and the worse way is to tell people about it That is important Another thing, writing, directing and filming is included at the amateur level of the village. Actors do quite well. But it was not up to them to save this shit A few jokes, jokes But mostly bad and wonderful Can't wait to get out of the cinema. Want a refund.
