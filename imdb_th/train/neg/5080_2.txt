This is a review of The Wizard, not to be confused with The Wiz or Mr. Wizard. The wizard is a movie in the late eighth century about the ability of a boy who is very quiet in playing video games and walking during the opening credits. All The Wiz is an unnecessary update of The Wizard of Oz and Mr. Wizard is the one who attach 100 tubes together and let some kids drink it. <br /> <br /> Now we can Get everything Let me tell you this: There is no reason to watch this movie. It is just 100 minutes of Nintendo's commercial, designed to take advantage of Powerglove, the Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "design" in the sense that is possible because it seems that this movie is written. Up at the weekend by The cracking team of people who have never played Nintendo and directed by someone less stylish than my grandmother. Maybe if the writer and director actually sat down and played the game, they knew they were going to shoot all the garbage and go to a vocational school to learn how to install a car stereo. <br /> <br /> Hope this will be an impressive experience for you. It's not for me. In fact, I think I might lose some brain cells to watch this movie and write about it. The next time you are at a video store and you see The Wiz, The Wizard and the Wizard of Oz sitting there on the shelves of the little rows, let them miss and play Duck Hunt instead.
