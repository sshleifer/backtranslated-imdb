Hallam Foe tells a story about a boy who lost his mother and later touched the Oedepus complex. <br /> <br /> It's 95 minutes long, but probably better in ten minutes. There was a middle hour where he practiced climbing on the roof and habits in the church tower like Quasimodo (but he was less sympathetic). <br /> <br /> There are strange unrelated love stories. With nothing She seems to be his mother, right? We know that he missed his mother. That was the first ten minutes. They should put the beginning and the end at the same time, and it will be O.K short film. Now it is like the character that does not change. He's the guy who happened. The only active choice he has in this film is to apply for jobs. <br /> <br /> There are things that Oedepus all happened, which should allow us to analyze his character. He painted the face, dressed in women's clothes and wore a dead badger on his head. Badger! You must see the ending! He came back home with the badgers on his head. (And it was shot like a tasteless horror movie) to kill his father's new wife (Which he had sex with at first) and somehow they think that this is not fun enough so they put indie punk music as the background I have to admit that I'm allergic to movies that want to write psychological complexities on your nose. It feels like this director / man / MacKenzie is trying to show us that he is studying psychology in school. You are very smart! Thank you for bringing these forgotten theories back to our memory! You really dig! It's a wall! Okay, now I know that this movie is based on a random book, but .. <br /> <br /> It's boring. A lot of talking heads In addition, the editing program changes color from one scene to scene. Do you know that the weather is cold and warm, etc. Why? Perhaps "Hallam Foe" may be both a feature and a test film for color blind people. Or maybe they just think that this drama is not enough to tell us that he feels lonely, so they add a blue color for us to really get it. <br /> <br /> I don't even comment on it. With indie-ancient ideas-oh-how-how-cute drawings that they have made in the presentation And everything that "cute" about sex happens All these films are independent ancient ideas. But I recommend I laughed more than a few times. Although it is really annoying to be a movie student and see how this kind of story can pass.
