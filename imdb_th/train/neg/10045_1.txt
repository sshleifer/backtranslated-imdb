Around the world, said that the Tashan movie will be a good movie with joy. But not in this case, Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake as a female actress Kareena Kapoor. She couldn't stand the whole story of Luke Tom-Boy. She's not going well. Even movie films are not reasonable. Everyone said that Quetin Taratino of India was Vijay, but not at Quetin. The talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid movie. Indigo is a big talented actor and this movie is not Akshay Kumar, also the victim of this movie, Saif. The style and Phoormola are not good in this movie. I'm disappointed.
