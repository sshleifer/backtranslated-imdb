First of all, I have my doubts, just look at the DVD box and read it, saying it's a story about a teenager gathering a lake that they will find or do. All movies with this evidence failed miserably, even though it was a slasher film, except for the first Friday of the 13th day. <br /> <br /> I want to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times. Thinking constantly that it must be a little bit better. It's not normal. I think every movie has something you can do. This thing is nothing. <br /> <br /> Do your favorite things and find something creative that will be done for 80 minutes. Press the paper or eat dirt.
