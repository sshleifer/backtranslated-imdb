Come! Deal with those who beat Pakistan Bollywood not only But will create excellent movies only <br /> <br /> I'm a great Bollywood fan - but the anti-Pakistani movie makes me too startled - everything <br /> <br /> I'm really happy to see that both audiences are rejecting propaganda and there is a movie like Main Hoon Na coming out there, not only because they deserve it. It is because of the quality of Bollywood. Masala - but because it tries to say: give a peaceful opportunity and show that there is madness on both sides that do not represent the crowd.
