This movie must be the worst story I've ever seen. The name of this movie deceives the audience to think that there may be hope. The story of this movie is the best laughing story with a poor performance that you have to cringe. The name 'Zombie Nation' means a number of zombies that actually have a total of six. This thing cannot be classified as a horror movie because of the 80s music launches when zombies are 'attacking'. In fact, zombies talk and act like humans in a film that has only one difference: makeup that looks like a La Roux If you've had the opportunity to buy this movie, try it.
