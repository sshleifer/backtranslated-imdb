I didn't expect it to be a great movie. But I didn't expect that it would be that bad. I hate the character so much that I have to change the channel. I turned my back in the hope that it would be only part of the movie, but not and so the daughter sat there, feeling embarrassed or almost quitting work or driving crazy in her own home? Are you kidding me I was raised to respect (and fear) my mother, but I will make her faster in the nearest hotel if she proves annoying in my house. I expect to follow a set of rules in my mother's house. <br /> <br /> I didn't buy it at all. I try to give many opportunities. I really do apologize.
