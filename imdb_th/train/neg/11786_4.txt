The show has a great episode. This is not one of them. It's not a bad episode. It's just hard to keep track of "dead people", "all over the house" and "dig that cat. He's actually gone." With Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you will find that Charles is married to Peggy for her money only. Both went on a honeymoon and their cars broke down on a dirt road and they had to find shelter in an old abandoned mansion. Soon Charles discovered the secret of Peggy's family ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, you should look at it now. But don't expect the same feeling as the rest of the season in the first season.
