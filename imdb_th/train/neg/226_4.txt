Andie McDowell is beautiful while a 40-year-old woman who begins a serious relationship makes her a great young man and has fallen with 2 great female singers. <br /> <br /> Dig gold. In a sincere young man, "girl-friend" dies - set on this "Stupid relationship" goes over and over again, triggering duties in "helping" their friends. (Which obviously is a fool of Gigolo, a tricky game "<br /> <br /> The short-lived situation is ridiculous, especially fetched, not covered anymore if there are no incredible scenes. This may have hope for sweet love instead of all viewers. The rest is shaking head voluntarily - these things don't happen! If there is no cliff detailing, I warn the audience that there is high expectations for this movie. Most (like me) will be very disappointed. The size of 1 to 10, this one is rated 4 that is weak with me. There are better materials. So much here Not worth your time
