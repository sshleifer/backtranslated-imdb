This is just a joke of the movie. They've lost me in the opening scene. (Warning spoiler) Dangerous creatures kill other creatures in his cage. This is a scientist watching on the monitor and guessing what she's doing. In the cage to check things out, how stupid those writers think that humans come in the same way, like jumping in an aquarium with great white sharks because they eat your goldfish ... more useless and frightening. And I will not talk about the actors because they are not worth the effort Why did they not chase those who wrote that immediately was a mystery for me ..... and this kind of stupidity continues for the whole movie Only good things that cgi is better than the average for these low-cost movies. <br /> <br /> If these bad things disturb you But should be warned if your IQ is higher than 60. You may hate it
