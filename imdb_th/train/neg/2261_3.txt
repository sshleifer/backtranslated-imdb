The RINGMASTER presents Jerry Springer as a TV host named Jerry, but not JERRY SPRINGER SHOW. His guests are trash trailers. But not the trailer trash that you participated in JERRY SPRINGER SHOW. They attack each other but don't like it on ..... what is the purpose of making a movie about JERRY SPRINGER's acting and pretending that it is JERRY SPRINGER SHOW? And beyond that, this movie is a very boring movie
