I was shocked to see that the average score for this film was 5.2 / 10. For what affects me, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I still wonder why I watched it until the end First of all, the plot is completely hopeless and the show is truly scary. I think the unknown actress will have a better role than Susan Luchee; About Mr. Kamar Del's Reyes I think it would be a better choice for him to be in his "Valley of the Dolls". (And I try to stay politely ...) to avoid any costs. My rating is 1 and I still think it pays well. But since we can't give O ....
