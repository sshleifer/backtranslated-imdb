Hello everyone, if you see "Singing in the Rain" You remember the scene of Gene Kelly dancing in the rain. You can still remember the dance number of Donald O'Connor at "Make 'em Laugh". If you see "Royal Wedding", you will remember Fred Astaire's dance on the ceiling. If you see "Jailhouse Rock", you will remember the number of dance designs By The King himself. <br /> <br /> That's what is missing. There may be blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation. The nearest is Chuck Makovan. "I can do that." The fact that you have someone who has the ability to move on the stage together, does not create a great dance movie. Richard Attenborough is punished for this failure. He aimed the camera at the stage and thought it would be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Shouting at people in the Broadway selection was not an entertainment. Michael Douglas would be a terrible actor if he was. In the west or funny He was okay when he was in the movie Michael Douglas. We saw him shouting at someone that we wanted to shout at. Not working here. <br /> <br /> A good actor, except Michael. Of course, good movies can be created even if using songs that are in the production process. But some people should think about how to shoot. <br /> <br /> The next time they do one of them. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
