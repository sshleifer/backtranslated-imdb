When I saw the name of this movie, I always thought it was a stage play, just like "The Harvey Girls". It wasn't. No music and not a moment <br /> <br /> It started with the master James Wood telling his three eldest daughters and the house <br /> <br /> We thought it would be a story. Modern history And for a short time, then it became the story of Stanwyck's heartless battle with George Brent, an attorney. Why did she die like this to him? And why? As we learned in a strange, retrospective sequence described by Stanwyck, she thought that she could receive some money. (For her sister, including herself) by marriage She hit someone she had been an outsider who was Brent's lawyer in truth. <br /> <br /> Lest anyone think they have an eight-year-old boy or more is - you Did you know ... They were married in a hurry and in the short time that they were together, he became pregnant. <br /> <br /> One of her sisters fell in love with a painter named Gig Young who played By Gig Young, another sister trying to get him out, etc. etc. <br / > <br /> It's a mess, messy - doing well enough But without any remnants of logic or reliability
