Let me start by saying that I strongly agree with the basic thesis of this film that there may not be Jesus in history and Christianity is a scam. As mentioned above, this movie works quite poorly in proving that It caused a great argument - the gap between the theoretical life of Jesus and the writing of the Gospel, which was filled with Paul's writings that did not indicate the history of Jesus - and then failed. Full argument It makes a broad statement without having to show evidence that statements are based on and will ignore the arguments presented by Christian apologists. Intellectual infidelity, emotional management and serious controversy are clear and dramatic. The only Christian we heard from this film is the head of the old school, the filmmaker who came out like a rational and rational person who tried to deal with twit and chips on his shoulder - and many Christians found that Random in the parking lot, I'm sorry, but the revelation that the average Christian doesn't have much knowledge of their religion. You may claim that Jay Leno has proved the existence of Michael Dukakis in his Jay-Walking section. Interviews with experts may be interesting. But this movie is full of too many things. Frankly, the filmmakers are just funky. Within the first five minutes, the film met Jerry Fawell and Charles Manson and the writer of the Left Behind series with Branch Davidians and at the end of the movie became a story of their own. Until there was no reasonable argument, leaving only a former Christian who was furious about the people and places he blamed on his childhood Yes, maybe this movie might be interesting. But it disappeared in a documentary about Jesus' history and congratulated himself for reducing sympathy This is Michael Moore's film without any humor or acumen in the film, combined with Richard Dawkins's book that has no intelligence or intellectual precision across it.
