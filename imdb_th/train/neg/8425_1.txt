Indeed, it is a disgusting, disgusting movie with a little real sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Dad's character in particular is rude in the end. (Intentionally so clearly) and showing in the most pathetic images. <br /> <br /> My wife and I found this film to be a terrible emotion without having to exchange any qualities straight away. Come, I hope I will never see it. <br /> <br /> I consider England's efforts to be sick and embarrassed. <br /> <br /> People who like this movie: Rejoice in The show of deep degradation and dirtyness <br /> <br /> This production should be ashamed of themselves.
