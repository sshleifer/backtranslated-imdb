... and let it be bigger than ever I will not make direct references or anything here. But at least this film is pathetic If you are training soldiers, don't pay attention. I put it on a DVD with 2 friends who want to watch interesting action / war movies. Why can't I read the criticism first? <br /> <br /> Now, in the episode "Bomb", the first movie has a lot of flaws and they continue to perform and become bigger. My is not related to the army. But somehow found the error of two filmmakers almost as fast as I did and asked me if something really happened. As you might have guessed, they are not. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie unless you can overlook the complete error 2/10 to attract my attention. First
