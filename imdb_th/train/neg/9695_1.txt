warning! Don't even consider watching this movie in any way. It's not worth it to download from the internet. Every little porn has more content than this broken celluloid. Obviously, the filmmaker called the idea of ​​creating a movie. They can't tell good jokes to save their lives. It is an insult to every human being. If you are looking for a movie that is full of fun, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> We hope that Mr. Unterwaldt ("Junior", this person will be a good indicator for an inexperienced experience. Slow / painful death and never making a movie again. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's a waste of time to write anything about this shit. That's why I'll stop now and watch a good movie.
