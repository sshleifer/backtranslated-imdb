First of all, let me say that I'm a big fan of Ashley Judd; That's why I wanted to know about her debut role. There is no argument that her ability is clear and her performance is excellent. I guess I can see how professional critics like the beauty of the story. However, I like to think that the movie is intended to entertain us and that this movie failed. <br /> <br /> Half way I found myself thinking that "How long do we have to watch? The girl in the shop stood around around an empty shop. Looks like it will continue forever! <br /> <br /> Then I think maybe this is a movie that the director tried to lull the audience into a relaxed state before colliding with an unstable event There is no such luck. This film is still a boring and boring story that has never been to the end. <br /> <br /> I didn't say this because I was a junkie. I like all kinds of movies, especially romantic movies. But I expect to be entertained. <br /> <br /> Add to the fact that movies and sound quality are comparable to neighbors' poor home movies! <br /> <br /> I don't understand who will like this movie. Entertainment center fee The most in my life 114 minutes <br /> <br />
