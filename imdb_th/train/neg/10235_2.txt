The only reason I gave 2 is that the movie work is very modern today. At least there is something to comment. <br /> <br /> This movie is an ace. It's like the 21st century animal food that crushed the house. Blood is worthless and disgusting. I didn't care about the characters. But I care that cretin. Some people pay attention to this shit pen: I'll complain about the money I spend. But my date and I left wisely after 40 minutes and went to the theater next to each other. To see the adventure and entertainment "Live Free or Die Hard" which may get a much higher score from me just because I have to endure "Captivity" for 40 minutes
