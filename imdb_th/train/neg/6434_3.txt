I am always amazed by the differences of people and movies, almost all of which you get both extremes. The person who thinks is the best movie and the one who thinks it is the worst. <br /> <br /> Stick Mata isn't the worst movie I've ever seen. But it was there First of all from all sounds Manufacturers spend more time with the soundtrack than editing. It was very loud when the soundtrack was playing and no one spoke and when Patrica spoke with one voice, she could hardly hear. <br /> <br /> I always like Patrica and Gaberial, but both of them. Flat in this film, Patrica has 3 emotions in general. Silently with great pain or being really angry. She is unclean. The first one is the person who has the power over the second person involved in pain, screaming. It is a loud voice that makes the three people not upset. <br /> <br /> Maybe I miss the deep meaning and subplots that everyone talks about, or maybe I might be disturbed by the shooting at Scary and MTV in style. When you watch 3 minutes of video, you have to cut quickly and slowly to convey the story quickly in a 2-hour documentary. It is disgusting. I failed to see her meaning when I saw that women all over the steet and children. <br /> <br /> I think that might be true, with something to say. But the entire budget used to buy music and equipment for making rain is slow Put the picture and rent a disgusting apartment that Arquette lives in. They end up shooting the guy with the story.
