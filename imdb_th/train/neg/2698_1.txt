This movie shows how racist John Singleton is. He shows that white people and other races that are not as devilish as are in our education system. The fast way that he forgot that it was the same education system that made him the way he was and failed. The Ice Cube character is the best of the black man that encourages responsibility for most of the violence. In this movie Singles almost did not experience the relationship between white and black characters who tried to communicate with each other when Omar Epps said "I have to be with my people." And John, do not think that the image of Thomas Jefferson in the tower staircase did not receive the attention of me. Good touch!
