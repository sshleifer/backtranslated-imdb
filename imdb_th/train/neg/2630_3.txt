Spoiler alert!!! Personally, I don't understand why Pete didn't save Williams. I mean, it's good to know why William was motivated or forced. I think the intelligence members are people every day and have galangal. Wua Lue, writer Members of the Secret Service, now he has a clear motivation that is well known. But renting this movie will not satisfy you, causing an old twist. But already used. The average performance - these are only in this movie. Wait for it to end. Clark Johnson, as a SWAT director, did a lot better at this time and I still wonder if the producer (like Michael Douglas ) How to get out of this movie to the cinema
