I am a big fan of this book and Orwell is my favorite writer since studying Animal Farm at the GCSE. I bought a DVD out of curiosity. Burton is an actor that I hold so well. When I heard that he played the role of O'Brien, I was hurled. <br /> <br /> I watched the preview on the DVD. The first fear and some things came in large part about the horrible "song". Frankly, hearing Eurythmics automatically shouted "1984!" Over and over again in defeating the electronic rhythm. Similarly, <br /> The overall performance is quite good. Burton and Hurt play their role well and the tension in the ministry is true. Will feel the end, especially in the harsh Room 101 scene. However, this is where the movie is released. The movie takes too much time to focus on the love story between Winston and Julia, which is straightforward, not what Orwell wrote. He is writing about a harrowing future about how Ingsoc created human beliefs and broke them all in his name that was created to love the eldest brother. This film crosses the most important part of the book, which is Winston, which deals with the position in life and the world and his new education through O'Brien. <br /> <br /> Comments on IMDb At the moment, the movie that is attached to the book is completely wrong. Julia does not appear when Winston visits O'Brien. They refuse to commit themselves to the brotherhood of Goldstein and confess their guilt. There is no clear mention of the initial instance that Winston found an article with Unpersons, but it was mentioned at the end, if you haven't read the book, it caused complete confusion. <br /> <br /> Horrifying Which some great performances cannot help, it seems that Michael Radford will miss the point that Orwell is trying to do and the electronica track is really scary
