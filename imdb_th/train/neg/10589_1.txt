Universal Soldier: The Return is not the worst movie ever created. Didn't have the honor to go to see a movie that tried to build a sentence or make a work of art But failed miserably However, perhaps the movies that I have never seen have tried a little and are completely successful, just like Universal Soldier: The Return <br /> <br /> This film is a sci-fi / action movie that is almost Nothing is recommended at all. The performance isn't as good as the movie I've seen. Bad storyline and predictable Pathetic special effects In short, everyone connected from a distance with this movie should be ashamed of ourselves: the return of the previous Van Damme fare seems to be a masterpiece of an advanced movie. Some movies are terrible. They are good. Believe me when I tell you that this is not one of them. I'm not really sure what to say here. I wonder if many people are considering watching this movie if they haven't done it yet.
