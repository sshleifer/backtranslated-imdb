Yes, it's about sums. This movie is very scary. Two minutes in, I want to dig my eyes. This thing is regarded as "LDS innovative comedian" but it's not good for the members of that church! I don't think any human being should be the victim of low quality movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, you can tell that there isn't any effort in this movie. It seems that the female is boring, scary, daring, transformed, repetitively being thrown together by two crazy weasels that are embedded in the gift for the connected thoughts. (At least semi-each other) then there is an act which is offensive from * everyone * related Even the hijackers fail to make it alive. <br /> <br /> And don't forget the fact that our protagonist is a jerk that we want to believe can be changed. But that road is full of embarrassing dialogue "gags" that are ugly and many Mormons "funny" that everyone in their correct minds LDS or should not be considered purely * stupid *! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen!
