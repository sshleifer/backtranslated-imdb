The evidence of this film is revealed in the DVD box. Textile workers develop magical fabrics that do not degrade. But the movie cannot follow Instead of doing that for 45 minutes, take the pre-preface before he makes a big discovery. Since the audience did not receive much benefit from seeing a child who had thought something out of it, it was a strange option: the film was prevented from participating in any topic when finding cloth This created a fast pace for both Big Vick, the industry and the blue colleagues who wanted the artifacts to fall down, causing the movie to have subtle movements. Just two things Inventing chemicals and running from oppressors. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why everyone explains that this is a joke. The tone is not funny or funny. It is like a serious social criticism today: capitalism changes both supply chain and production. Which will prevent innovation from accessing and improving the world Yes, it may be true. But without playing with the attitude towards the facts, this movie is just the most serious argument. You have to have a broad definition of comedy to find here. <br /> <br /> This is like the British John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe?)
