"Spielberg likes to smell the confidence in the morning. But confidence must lose honesty in the story telling. No one should love that. "- Lucius Shepard <br /> <br />" The Color Purple "occurred in the lower south in the early 1900s and Tell the story of Celie and Nettie, two African-American sisters. The film opens with a girl playing in a purple flower field, which is a beautiful paradise that immediately shattered by the presence of their stepfather. This motif, innocence, interrupted by men? Infiltrate the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The film is released in a short sequence. Sealy is revealed to be her stepfather twice, born in a dirty barn with her newborn baby being taken. Went out and was forced to marry a local widow named Albert Johnson Clean and take care of his children. <br /> <br /> These scary scenes get a little time in the screen and are surrounded by the time of filming the movie Ghost Dust, a beautiful melodic score. Comedy that is not compatible The cumulative effect is like a mix of Disney cartoons and rape movies, which is a vibrating aesthetic that makes Stanley Kubrick say "The Color Purple" makes him frustrated until he has to shut down after ten minutes and ten minutes. ? He took a long time. <br /> <br /> This film is often said to be "racism", "woman" and "black culture" which is true. Alice Walker, the author of a novel based on the film, claims to be bisexual. But actually being a lesbian in the closet Her books are fantasy, lesbian stories of female liberation and self-discovery, which portray men as female creatures. For Walker, the only way out of this labyrinth is that women are bound together in a lesbian style, a black utopia and the independence of a famous woman. <br /> <br /> Movies of the year Berg Lens of the American legend of consolation This is a movie that the power of salvation of Christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men. The movie that Albert finds himself in a laughing situation. The misunderstood moments of humor make him look like a fool. The movie that all the characters received from the mini-staged actors, consisting of men with passion (Often smiling and smiling teeth), chubby breastfeeding, jazz bands and gospel choirs <br /> <br /> This is a movie that blacks are innocent children and accept the condition social The movie that black people are passionate about, eroticism, eroticism. Movies that poverty and racism are not fully visible. (Albert lives in a big house) and a black man is not complete. This is not Old South. This is an Old South derived from "Gone With the Wind", MGM Muscals, "South of Music", Warner. Cartoons, "Halleluha!" And Disney movies that were banned In other words, it is south when seeing children raise the 50s TV. It is very funny, so racism in the way that it reduces these humans into a one-dimensional ethnic pattern, the famous black novelist Ishmael Reed is like Nazi conspiracy <br /> <br /> Of course in Spielberg fashion The film ends with the family bonding. This compromise is in Walker's novel. But Spielberg continues with letting all the characters reconcile with their relatives. <br /> <br /> In addition to the hate letter of Walker and blacks and caricature of The black community, we have only a vague idea of ​​how these characters live and do not understand how they interact with others in their communities. Instead of turning the camera of Spielberg into a fight for our attention. (One of Sealy's kitchens seems to be in the "Home Alone" movie). Every emotion in the play, the director never stops to observe something or compromise. Of life to pass This match with Quincy Jones's "white" song, and you have one of the most bizarre movies in film history: an angry actress who was filmed by a white Jew in the form of Disney and Griffith scored by the black man Williams. <br /> <br /> The problem is the lack of white characters. Consider this: Men in this movie do not show that it is a rude story to each other and they do not dominate women because they are cruel, racist societies that reduce their manhood. No, they are cruel to nature. And women, whether they are suffering in silence, like Celia or rebellion, and are firmly like her sister, trying and surviving just because men are too stupid to destroy them The better movie will not focus on the oppression of women alone because it happens among the oppressed. But it shows that it is a social violation which leads to marriage abuse in which black women slaves are forced to do the same job (While still complying with traditional female roles) and domestic violence among African-Americans, mostly due to economic factors, women cannot support themselves and their children alone. <Br /> <br /> So there is a hidden ideology that works here in the late part of the movie. One character tells the other that because he didn't respect his wife, she was beaten. And imprisoned by white people The meaning is that black people must return to the roots of Africans to restore their own dignity and to be their fault that the white people smash them unfairly, such as - respecting each other in the community. Your poor little group and you will not run on the dominant white culture. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - Failure to confront sex and lesbian, improper musical numbers. , Countless sequences filled An external visual pizazz, Business comic incongruity, musical cues and pronounced mood swings Purple "worthless.
