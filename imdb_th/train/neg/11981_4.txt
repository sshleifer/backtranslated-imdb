Yes, Marie Dresser drank the prunes that she thought was poisonous and she ran away. <br /> <br /> Dresser is a good person. Never drink a cup of tea. But she is a strong actor who can definitely catch the screen. <br /> <br /> I watched this story for Polly Moran, which I've seen elsewhere. Here, Moran is okay - okay - as a friend / foe of Dressler's stubborn enemy. Unfortunately, she sank in almost all forgiveness. <br /> <br /> A very good story Bad people try to rob the town of Dressler's victory and end well They can do it if used well and if used wrongly. However, I'm not familiar with them at that time. They are like different stocks, right? It seems strange to create a story about The Little Man around a complex financial entity.
