This movie is really scary. The eye that plays Ben can do everything wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> Writers / directors / producers / actors and others may be good. Thinking about making movies about the important issues of gay marriage, family acceptance, religion, fear of hate, crime and other issues that affect gay at these times. But trying to cram all problems A little justice for these causes. <br /> <br /> The script is not good. The selection of ordinary actors, but the dialogue and acting are just a disaster. The brother who loves to hate is the most actors in the camp and there is no lead chemist between the two leading actors. (I think I've seen a lot of passion for corn flakes advertising). (The scene in which the brother is raising his detective is the highlight) <br /> <br /> I'm just glad to see that the creator of this train didn't push other garbage into distribution and if he thought Doing that, I have some suggestions - don't do that.
