Imagine you are a high school kid behind the dark theater with your boyfriend. How bad will the movie be so that you feel forced to leave the theater and go home before the end? This movie is really bad. The movies are usually not as good as they can. This movie is superior to bad. It's a painful pain. Terrible. Scary. Crimes against humanity are bad.
