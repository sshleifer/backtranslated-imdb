This movie is so bad, it's hard to find the right words to describe it. <br /> <br /> At first, the story is very ridiculous. The narrow-minded man can write a better story! Actors are boring and not exiled. Sometimes they are forced to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> National Forest camera certification is the only good thing in all of these movies. I should feel ashes because I paid for this lousy picture. <br /> <br /> Hopefully no one will make a sequel or create a movie that is similar to a worse story :-)
