Tasteless. I can't even write about movies wisely. I laughed the whole movie. It shouldn't be funny. Matt Farnsworth has no clue what he is doing. It seems that his story will be written without knowledge of the Iowa culture and the problem of potions. I know that Tenn comes from Iowa, which makes his film more puzzling. Why are the two main characters accented? It's not reasonable. The show looks best and sometimes looks difficult. Violence and sex are full of movies. I guess violence and sex should make the movie look frustrating. But it was unbelievable and disgusting The ending of a very bad movie that I can do is laugh and see the credit that I don't believe. As I walked out of the theater, everyone who went away laughed with me. The ending of this movie is intended to cause tears. But it is the opposite Don't waste time on this horror movie unless you want to see the foolish, puzzled.
