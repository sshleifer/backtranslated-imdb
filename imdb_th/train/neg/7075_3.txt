At least this is the third remake of this film, so if while watching it, there is a feeling of Deja Woo not to be surprised. What they do is change the setting of the story and tell it differently. But the difference is not important And it is not better than this because the plot has defects in the beginning, it does not work, and as with previous generations, the performance is moderate There is a unique ending. If this movie ends ten minutes earlier, it will be effective and satisfying, and I think it's worth it. But this is a spoiler and eventually the crime will be paid because the crime is not arrested. I don't like this message as a result of the movie.
