Prom night: The most important night for a shallow girl that consists of almost all plastic. So the character reminds us every ten minutes when an annoying miniscule event occurs in their lives. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for the Prom Night. There is less than the original, nothing about it and I'll give it. Zero or less than possible stars in IMDB. Part of my viewing that I enjoyed was when a teenager sitting in front of us decided to play a 'ghost' game. It's more exciting than what's happening on their front screen. <br /> < br /> The plot, in general, some men are rampant. And it is that it is not rampant, slightly exciting Maybe if the guy gets a horror from a distance rather than tame Robbie Williams that looks like a baseball cap, I might be sitting there feeling a little worried. The fact that I pay less attention to the character than I do about the color of the theater carpet. And to make matters worse, the rest of the drama is one dimension and forgotten. The hotel staff doesn't seem to notice or care that one of their maids is missing and there is further evidence that the murderer can't remember after he has shaved. I was incredibly surprised that the female girl wearing a blue dress was the only one who noticed who he was. She realized this, and then fell down the stairs, entangled herself in a plastic sheet and hit the overcoat as a good person. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that I hold the belief that the director tried. Fully He pushed all the boundaries without showing shocking real killings! And music, don't even start me It's almost as good as stripping at the funeral. <br /> <br /> I hope the Prom Night is funny. It's terrible and foolishly predictable. There is no one in their right mind or else there is a reason to watch this movie. The mainstream cinema seems to be depressed and movies like this are worse than the situation. If you are urged to see this terrifying movie, hear my excuse, don't do it. There are better things to spend six pounds. Like playing a sheet with ghosts
