When viewed quickly, this film has everything the mind needs: a vampire story with a limit of "18 or less" that is filled with violence, drugs, gore, sex (including lesbian sex). the police! But then this movie is a continuation of a bad story (very thin), a bad performance - with a ridiculous English accent that makes you believe that you're watching Monty Python that is bad - bad music ending. It's a shameful thing ... plus the ridiculous sex scenes, blood that isn't very impressive. And those vampires are reflected in the mirror and don't be afraid of the day! You will be very disappointed unless you see it as "Space Mutiny" or "Troll 2". I hope one day Bloodlust will reach the bottom 100 because it is a real place. <br /> <br /> I said it. Still fun to watch if you have friends and enough beer. <br /> 3/10
