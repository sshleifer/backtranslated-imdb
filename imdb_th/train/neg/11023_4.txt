The follow-up of David Mackenzie's great Adam wants to be an underdog story from the feelings of a lonely voyeur who tries to face sexual problems with a dead mother. It needs courage, realism and mystery. At the same time, it wants to be funny and without the judgment of the disturbed leader as he creates himself as an adult. <br /> <br /> In order to find this end, the film tries hard to be young. Its poster has hand-drawn characters like Juno. The original soundtrack consists of indie rock songs that try to convince viewers that Hallam is okay; Just a little misunderstanding But this movie has something strange but youthful. <br /> <br /> Like Young Adam, the central puzzle of this movie involves a drowned woman - in this case, Hallam Young Adam's mother maintains a mysterious, quiet, reflective. And walking well enough to hit you with the truth as it comes The enemy Hallam does the opposite. It clearly and quickly leads the character's psychotic symptoms until he has never done anything outside of the expected parameters. The opening scene is Hallam in his tree house. Watching his sister fool with her boyfriend. Hallam interrupted quickly by confirming that he was in the house. Here we see everything Hallam will do for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The mystery surrounding the drowning of his mother is whether it is suicide or murder. By his father's girlfriend The audience couldn't really trust Hallam because, in addition to being creepy, we thought that his obsession with his insanity This is an obstacle to my mystery because Hallam has a discrete relationship. When he found some clues to support his demands, he escaped from the house. At first it seemed to look for the police. Then he was very sidelined by a girl who resembled his mother, who brought the story out of the mysterious element. <br /> <br /> While Jamie Bell brings the beloved features His out By the clarity of his psychological needs This movie has no mysterious way. But not blunt as well It tries to be true in dealing with such problems. But it increased the courage that was very nervous that registered himself quite the opposite It is a serious matter. The Trainpotting attitude will help the audience root for the protagonist who weighs the building, locks the key, and camps for the sake of sneaking. Tom Hallam's adventures in these cities are too difficult for rural boys to get involved and they are not sexy, giddy or pleasant. They are more neutral than anything. Doesn't propel the character or story of Mackenzie, making you understand Hallam, but he failed to create a central area. <br /> <br /> He expects you to enjoy Hallam's trials and tribulations. Look at the audience about the sneak peek / the type of person involved. Obviously, most people will disgust it, and Hallam Foe realizes that, but it doesn't make us see Hallam weighing the merits of his decisions. He went from person to person trying to fill his emptiness. There is a disturbing line from Hallam's love, especially Kate, which she is drunk. "I love creepy boys" may ask the audience to do the same. The line tries to guess her understanding of her. (Her motives are still vague) and can't make him judge him. It's not difficult to like Hallam, but it's very difficult to participate in his adventures - if it's an adventure. While the movie is trying to use a colorful soundtrack to cover the unpredictable mood, <br /> <br /> The great performance was weighed down by a film with a weak third scene. This story has been nominated again for the US release and for what reason? Not only does not attract more attention But the difficult truth is that Hallam's character never received the 'Mister' position.
