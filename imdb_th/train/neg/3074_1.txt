Even the doped cocaine of the 1980s is pathetic. I do not understand why someone wants to lose celluloid, time, effort, money, and brain cells of the audience to create wonders. If you are funny, make it funny. If you want to shoot trash like this, keep it yourself. If you are going to release it as a joke like this: no !!! I mean, it's funny, right? Some people please tell me that this is a joke. Please.
