The only reason I didn't give this movie less than 3 stars is because it's not quite like the movie Manos: The Hands of Fate. extremly The location of this film sounds likely to be the concept of mass transfer. But the direction they go with it is not completely interesting It is a movie about funding, research and arching than laser projection. The actors are wood, not frantic and distant. Just like the love story between two scientists - which is nothing but love. I can't tell what is attracting attention between them because chemistry doesn't really exist. And I do not really understand why the main man faced with confusion decided to kill everyone he met At least I now know that I should let someone hear fairly before I cut their research funding, otherwise they are rampant about killing mischievously with stupid hands
