This movie is very depressing. <br /> <br /> The character is very cold. The mother, which he is the main character, is everything except the "mother". Okay, she's not happy in her marriage and makes her husband and children always the first. Her husband died Then she visited her son and found a large bed lying with her daughter and ended up sleeping with him. Until now, this movie can be used, not great, but can be viewed. That guy is charming and who can blame her? Okay, it's not easy for mothers to sleep with your daughter's lover. But sorry for the shock of losing her husband. <br /> <br /> She was obsessed with men. I think this is the part I started to dislike. She always wanted to please him in "old days" with snacks while he was working at her son's home. (I think this is the only thing she has ever learned to do) as if it were the only way. The attention was clearly that the guy was not very interested (actually it seems he thought he was sleeping with her as an activity. Charity) and instead of insulting her, she also asked him to go to sleep with her and be a good person to her. When he insulted "I want to make you satisfied." She told him hopelessly while he was insulting her. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes me angry in this film is the lack of self-respect that my mother has for herself. She told me "I am a shapeless body" The first time they slept together <br /> <br /> This movie insulted women. If it was me, I would buy a little object that would make me satisfied and less emotionally painful ... :)
