Johnny and Jeremy are strange vampires. Remove the fangs of course. They are dark, bitter creatures and nothing will do better than distributing their own misery. With their charm (Ie the sharp tongue and chunky purse, respectively) they persuaded the desperate spirits they carried to torture and victory. That is the basis of this black comedy, more or less as I understand. <br /> <br /> It's not a mix of black humor that I can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothers me. I would imagine that the main character, however, I enjoy the sound and melody of the fire words. (And very witty) I was very impressed with the strong performances of the actors, especially David Thelis; Only Jeremy's character has two dimensions. Photography and music, both dramatic and nondescript, work together very well. <br /> <br /> Things that shut me about "naked" (and the main reason I never recommend anyone) are the way it Over and over again, it seems to present the hatred of women as a correct way to drain suffering. In other words, in a terrible world, what is the difference if someone creates pain for a girl? In the introduction (as available on this website) that Johnny is not a ruthless person because he is not rude to women like Jeremy, it seems completely absurd for me. They are both bad and nasty. And they are eager to hurt women every time they have a chance. Everyone argues that Johnny finally gets what he deserves, as if his bad karma hurls straight and bites him in the ass. But despite his sadistic behavior, Jeremy is still considered to be a laughing class. And i might be wrong But I guess most people who love this movie certainly still find that the aspect of this movie looks funny in the dark.
