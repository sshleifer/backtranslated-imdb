It's a waste of opportunity to create an interesting movie about a complex subject. There are very few surveys about things that feel like a straight (or gay) person working in a gay sexual environment. Dancers talk about their art as if there are no erotic elements. They may not be all prostitutes who are employed. But they are sex service providers that show imagination and sell the private sector with more dancing From one movie, it will be impressive that they often attract women who go to gay clubs and then end up hiring "dancers" for private meetings. Although the image in the club shows only women in front of the stage and "dancers" play with women in the audience only. This is not the reality of these clubs. It can be quite difficult to earn a living, doing private dances for women and straight couples. How do they feel about gay people and their customers? We learn very little. But we get the fillers Gay activists who do not add anything to the study of straight dancers The manager told us about the costume for dragging. But does not provide insights about the life and attitude of dancers. <br /> <br /> Pictures of Mexico City are general images. The phallus that shows that sausage roasting is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is a simple, interesting movie for those who want to see beautiful pictures. gay
