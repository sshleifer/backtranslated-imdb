I like it i really do Please don't think I'm an idiot. But I have to admit that I like this movie I expect it to be ridiculous. It is nonsense. But sometimes it's okay to relax and watch movies that you don't have to concentrate too much, right? I didn't expect any hidden meaning or encouragement, and none at all, but that didn't matter because I only watched it for entertainment and it made me enjoy all the time. This movie is why Ben Stillers (sorry about something about Mary) and Vince Vaughns (but you spell his last name, I don't have to worry about checking). Have a job. It's ok to watch shit movies. Which you didn't expect too much from it and me for one to stand, trot might run But not driving because I don't have a car to blockbuster Or even a selection and rental of humorous movies, a certain amount of restrooms and a one night stay watching them Good day to you, PS reader. If you don't say that this comment helps you, I don't like you. If you say that helps God bless you, you will go to heaven.
