Spend your time in other ways, even housework is better than this movie. Jokes are not funny. Fun music that Dr. Perseus is not there. How much lousy time was spent. My kids 4-16 laughed a bit. At first, the kids were bored with it and went out to play Barbie and the older ones went out to play ps2 and surfed my wife's net. make food So I will finish it alone It's the worst "kids" movie I've ever seen. If you want to watch a fun children's movie, watch Shrek 2, the movie is fun for kids and parents. Avoid this film It's not funny. It's not cute. The makeup of the cat is about the only good thing in it and you can see it on the disc label.
