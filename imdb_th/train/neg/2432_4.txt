Not much to say about this. The plot that you can pin the pin in the first 10 minutes. There's nothing wrong with this movie. Very little action for action movies. Have the opportunity to explore the characters' emotions from time to time Regardless of whether the action movie is the right genre or not, I'm not sure. Sniper is one of the easiest movies to watch without having to pay attention because of a slight twist and a straight plot Go straight I might be wrong in that matter, so with a second watch or with an undivided interest it might be better. <br /> <br /> 4/10
