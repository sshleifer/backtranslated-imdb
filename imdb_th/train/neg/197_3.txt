While being the great Western James Arnes, this film has gone down like the worst Alamo movie ever created. The story is terrible, all inaccuracies and not true in the boot! Continuity is sent to all four winds. Who caught the cannon sequence? The Mexicans were stupid enough to shoot an artillery that was obviously a muddy and jab. If there is a ridiculous hat of Brian Keith! The cost must be away or what? Or just out of mind!
