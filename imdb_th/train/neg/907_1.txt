I wrote another review of this film after buying a DVD and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch again after reading the comments that had been made since then. As a film student and create a movie that has a budget close to itself (For example, there is no budget to shoot on a digital camera) I stand by my original comments. This is a student project without budget. (And not an exceptionally good project) published in videos / DVDs to make it look like an award-winning movie (If you read the cover) So deceiving the public to think that it's not something. I need a refund under trading description! Complete garbage!
