I always check the MTV Movie Awards to see a list of witty and entertaining items that offer special rewards. (Chewbacca won the Lifetime Achievement Award as an example), so this year is no different. While I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott is a fool. I used to laugh at Stiffler in both the American Pie movies and enjoy him in Dude Where's My Car? But MTV Movie Awards are terrible. There is nothing connected with humor or fun. Justin Timberlake should adhere to singing and dancing; He is sure that Hell can't do it. <br /> <br /> I want to know who is the writer on this list. Last year's performance by Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was an extremely funny story (The Lord of the Rings, a parody of only worth watching all programs), but this year is completely different. Nobody understands Timberlake's comments about Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson. ("They are watching movies together. But never met! They are here ... ") Where is the joke? Kate and Luke just got into a weak conversation, never talking about "funny" by Timberlake. And Yann completely lost his talent, not even making me smile But laughing alone And what is the point of Harrison Ford's torpedo? What makes them feel? Perhaps MTV writers will think that younger audiences will know the older Ford, like Han Solo, Indiania Jones or the president from Air Force One. I'm baffled and some people will tell me about the deal with Adrian. Brody? How old is this man and how old he thinks? The guy looks 30, trying to act 19 again .... Give up. Show some classes. (Eg in the words of your best actor) and show your age. <br /> <br /> I gave this show 1 star out of 4 just because of Gollam's words for the best performance. This is very creative, very well done and produces genuine laughter all night.
