I work at the Blockbuster store and every week we have movies that come with a few copies. This is the type of movie that Sci-Fi channels show. The type of movie that nobody wants and only a fool is renting when they bring it. Come back, I asked them "Is it good?" They say, "No, we closed it after 15 minutes!" The movie was made from a terrifying computer, a very determined and unattractive monster. <br /> <br /> This is the same type of movie that Grendel is, and certainly a waste of time if you want to have a reason.) A good movie from Beowulf. Then try using Beowulf & Grendel, starring Gerard Butler, who is an actor in the anticipated movie. 300 enthusiastic stories as King Leonidas from Sparta. <br /> <br /> Plus, this year we will have Beowulf movies as well. Many selected actors from Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson to Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich <br /> <br /> But don't let your hopes like all of us do with Eragon for another big disappointment. <br /> <br /> And about renting here is a simple rule of I: If there is only one or two books, do not rent it because it is Ls absurd (99.9% of the time it normally would not be true if the title of a documentary or foreign language).
