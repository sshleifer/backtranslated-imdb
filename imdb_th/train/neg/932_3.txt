I watched this movie and hope to have something better all the time. What is wonderful about men who don't have emotions? * Yawn * <br /> <br /> You've never seen Alex show your emotions to anyone other than his son. Yes, I know that this is the reason that his son was the only one who made him upset. (If you can call it that way) I understand. <br /> <br /> The characters are not developing relationships, not Give enough time to understand in one scene. Sarah says that they will not fall in love and the next time we see her talking about his death, she shakes because they are very close together? There are a lot of logic in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's like having people look at Boogie Nights and write this script to imitate Little Bill. Even the scenes that he "loses emotion" are just like the episodes The little Bill shot his wife to the face (or lack). Yes, William H. Macy is good at drawing people without emotion - ever done - can you say Magnolia? <br /> <br /> This movie not only lacks emotion but lacks script content. None Character development and plot And it certainly lacks my advice :) <br /> <br /> ~ A ~
