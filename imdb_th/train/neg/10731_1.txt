This film is the story of a Russian prostitute returning to his hometown village to perform a funeral for his sister / friend. But not fully explored The essence of the movie is the funeral, awakening and quarreling later about the future of the crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka. Obviously there is no movie editing. The journey of a prostitute from one city to another village is a breathtakingly endless train ride and walk through the mud. Maybe that impressed us with the greatness of the Russian landscape. Such a village is the dwelling of a widow and a man, the wife of a dead woman. Continuing the doll business is a problem for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible. Most movies are taken with a mobile camera which may cause nausea. Another problem for Western audiences is that the narrative does not include music and lamentation. Do not go to see this movie if you are not fluent in Russian.
