Every movie of David Prior is terrible in all matters, whether it is bad writing, bad performances, bad movies, no budget. (In general, the director's brother is a male actor), but they all have incredible entertainment value because of unintentional hilarity. Plot of "Prior" movie of David Prior almost all things. (As I like talking about) is the same thing All American commanders gather to bomb the baddies of the Communists. But unlike other cold wastes such as Red Dawn, the previous movies were really funny because of their location and performances. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene with Becker. (Or other friends) being summoned by General Mitchell for a top secret mission in South America The most funny line in the movie was delivered something that had an effect. "This is my roommate. I practice him well." What. Do you practice your roommates? And obviously this will be their solution to avoiding eviction. <br /> <br /> If you can find these gems in videos that are available everywhere, buy them. They are all funny and entertaining after a few beers. See them with your group of friends for a true MST3K style experience. Up to now, my friends and I have managed Night Wars and Aerobicide, also known as "Killer Workout". But what I recommend to them the most is Final Sanction by Robert Z'dar
