This film from Italy in the 70s was not in class with Dog Soldiers, The Howling or even the great American werewolf in Paris, but it was fun. I'm talking about watching a blonde actress The beautiful run rampant in her birthday outfit. We are talking about the complete nudity graphics ... Obviously she is really blonde ... humma humma humma !! The story is a hoot. SFX is a child and the show (mostly) has a bad smell. The only redemption value of this film is all. (And there are many) naked and sex scenes Tame according to the HBO standard, but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night. OK ... this is a spoiler ... no werewolves. (Except in the opening scene of the heroine's ancestors (??) The woman just thinks she is a werewolf ... In other words, clinical Lycanthrope
