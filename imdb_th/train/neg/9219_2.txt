I never knew that this was a movie created to watch TV. But I can guess at any time It has all the same colors, polite characters and scary songs that I remember from the 80s, including the 'social platform' that almost screamed "Afterschool special" Anyhoo <br /> <br / > Rona Jaffe (Thank you) Mazes and Monsters were created in the heyday of Dungeons & Dragons, a pen and paper RPG that holds the hearts of millions of people across America. I counted myself one of the geeks said so I never played D&D. In particular, I had dabbled in one of its brothers. M&M was created during the prosperity of D&D's major controversy - that was a strong commitment. Daring that people will lose contact with reality, worshiping Satan without knowing it. I think it is a legitimate concern at one point, if it is very rare - but it creates a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> We met with 4 young students who played. Name Mazes and Monsters for socializing A little time from worldly life Except that the proposed merger is more tedious than their worldly life There is nothing appealing to the game here and Jay J's request to bring M&M out of the 'real world'. It's an excuse to make one character go crazy everywhere - up to that point, we don't really care. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel should be different - but they are all the wealthy WASPy prigs that have problems. No one has <br /> <br /> But things continue to worsen in many ways. The low budget is very clear. (I like the 'entrance' symbol and the cardboard that has been cut to the forbidden cave.) Robbie / Pardu shows why he was not a warrior in the scene that was heavily hunted and paid on the top of the tower. That was not hilarious. Tom Hanks' sobbing "Jay, what am I doing here?" Makes me laugh the last minute. The lowest point in his career, of course. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it as a derogatory word that is just a fraction of the 80s trash TV that is laughing and you still have a good time. That is if you can be alert The most boring But it's worth it for Pardu's loss at the end. At least Tom Hanks is better, no matter how worse he is.
