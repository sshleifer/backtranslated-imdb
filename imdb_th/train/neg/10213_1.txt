A lot of people seem to like this movie, so I feel bad that the review is bad. But after sitting through 96 minutes, I felt I had to do Where is the story of this movie! I have to miss it. I'm waiting for the story that opens and nothing happens. Of course, the ending "Quite shocking" but they didn't create it. I forgot who was half the time so they didn't really develop the characters. The performance is fairly good. Most believe it. But I can watch all the time, so ... without abandoning anything. I must say that if you don't like the actors in the movie, there is no reason to watch this movie. I may misunderstand But I do not understand why there is very little or too much of this movie I can't decide what kind of it is. I don't even know that renting will be a good idea, price and all ... <br /> <br /> Synopsis: 0/10 Character: 1/10 Character: 2/10 Overall: 3 / 10 I feel too high. Actually, I am with my vote at the top.
