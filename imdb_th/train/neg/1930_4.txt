Some people praise _Atlantis: _The_Lost_Empire_ as a Disney adventure for adults. I don't think so - at least not for adults who think. <br /> <br /> This script shows the beginning as an action movie that makes someone become the type of person you are. Can not be sold to adults anymore "Cracker" of many old adventure movies has been done before (think _The Dirty Dozen_), but _Atlantis_ is one of the worst movies in the standard. Weak character Even the background that each member jogged out seemed to be the best and the most embarrassing. MD / Medicine Man Tomboy, whose father had wanted a son before, if at least we had never seen these things before, we saw the habit. Strange story about how a friend, Vinny, played by Don Novello (Fr. Guido Sarducci) goes from a flower shop to a totally unbelievable destruction. <br /> <br /> The main character. Only Milo Thatch in Atlantis fascinated scholars voiced by Michael J. Fox have any depth to his search for Millau Atlantis continues to go from his grandfather raised him up. The scene revealed the younger Milo on the knees miraculously, as his grandfather placed his core hat on his head. <br /> <br /> And while the character is the thinnest in the good part The most about _Atlantis_ is the talent voice. Perhaps Milo's depth may not be thicker than Fox's charm. Commander Rourke has nothing to be voiced by James Garner, although Rourke is a soldier in stock. But Garner shows his ability to breathe life into a character just by sending him. Garner's sound performance is the highest point. I'm sorry to say that the king of Leonard Nimoy's death is nothing more than responsibility. In addition, Don Novello, as a demolition expert, Vinny Santorini is famous for one or two funny jokes. But I like Father Guido Dodo Dee. <br /> <br /> Well done as well. Computer animation. Background animation that is The character animation wasn't bad for Disney because of the simplicity that made Don Bluth go out the door. The character's animation doesn't do anything if it doesn't create a flat character. In addition to the terrain, buildings and vehicles, there is nothing impressive. <br /> <br /> The storyline is the worst. Some people say that they are ridiculous or repetitive. I'm not sure about that. Any plot that serves can make a new thing with proper treatment. Shakespeare often begins with a known story and plot, and is famous just to wear a new color coat. So the treatment is what and _Atlantis_ obviously lacks. <br /> <br /> I can't start to enter all logical spaces without spoilers. Bad story Plot the plot of the plot like a big line and the ending is not reasonable. If you want to add scripts and animations, will be filled with annoying dirt. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** <br /> <br /> 1 At first, when Milo Reveals that the runes or celtic symbols have been misinterpreted and "the Irish coast" should read "the Icelandic coast" we have problems The script writer must know that England uses Eire or Eireann as "Ireland" and doesn't care about Hibernian in older Latin. But more than that, they need to know about the conspiracy of the Vikings to call an eco-friendly Icelandic island and Greenland. <br /> <br /> By making it a "letter" that doesn't Correct. Writers can write themselves again to get the English version of the runes and the post-Roman dates on the script. Because for a long time after Atlantis should sink into the cave under the sea And if there is no visible clue and less technology that Milo has made the inscription less reliable, <br /> <br /> 2 Shepard's journal cannot be written before Atlantis will Sink or do not know anything about caves or crystals lying in the eyes of the king It must be written after the sinking. But without the technology that Milo's survey has And how will it know more about it after that? And why is it written in Atlantian? <br /> <br /> The writing and automatic clairvoyance or traveling on the stars can explain these things. However, clairvoyance and travel on the stars do not need to use shepherds to write in Atlantis. Therefore requires automatic sorting Since no one left in Atlantis can read it, it must be the spirit of the message that shines the crystal on the surface. This will make more sense. But can still be explained in the movie: Milo can discover that this power calls him all his life - appearing in dreams, etc. This thing needs to be explored in the movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Lantik should not understand modern languages. No one expected that the original Indo-European people would be able to talk more in Europe than the Romans would understand that "c" or their days became more difficult, becoming French "ch" (pronounced like "sh" !) <br /> <br /> 4. The Atlantis people are still living in the presence of disaster - when they are clearly able to read But now I can't read what they used to do or use similar machines. <br /> <br /> 5. The Mass. It seems that nothing has happened to this culture. Seems to be floating in the air until Milo can save his life Although it seems that life is not struggling for survival But no one wants to write poems or write novels and maybe it is a combination of the Atlantian school system that has fallen to the end and there is no good novel that makes Atlantis fall ill. <br /> <br /> 5. Kida can make excuses without knowing how to read or use the machine if she is very young when the Cataclysm of Stupidity is set - but it is true. ** There is her father's qualifications for being a parent !! Kashakim's folly almost wiped his only one from being alive. Kill a bunch in progress (Not many were killed here But he oversaw a large slide in culture and progress) until someone could kill everyone if they didn't boil lava first because of the giant robot Not there to protect them. <br /> <br /> The lightning of the blue electric current should make Kashakim's image crumble when Kida tries to join her father's image and the band of the great king of Atlantis. <br /> <br /> 6 Although Milo is the only one who can read the Atlantian, Rourke and others know well enough to read gibberish books and search for the face on the crystal - which he knows. That is crystal and not astrology Or stylized some steps of the sun "Diagram <br /> <br /> 7 If Milo's grandfather told the disease about this, it still didn't explain why Rourke would suffer from that. Milo reads it as part of this book, tearing out - which is the ear dog in Rourke's hand. Although Milo finds that there are no signs of a torn face in this book, it is obvious - just to tip the audience that "There is something wrong." In addition to the word "crystal", there will be a warning signal in Milo's head that someone is trying to steal it. Milo will not doubt anything. It's just a bold guess. <br /> <br /> 8 "double-cross" crews are not changing characters. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie have collaborated with Rourke from the beginning. However, "change of heart" falls. It is a change and requires better motivation. Difficult to do with characters that didn't get what they started with. <br /> <br /> 9 A little bit of lava flows through the dome instead of filling in the rest of the area that we look at in sequence. It is liquid It will not flow through the protective dome until full area below. <br /> <br /> 10 STINKS endings! - and there is no other reason to appease political correctness. By restoring power from various sources, Atlantis is no longer the weakest power, so coddling the giant robot defender and the blue cycles that shoot the blue lightning, suggesting that they are less afraid of us. Technology is superior to us and, of course, until the beginning of the 20th century. In the end, Milo needs to teach the Atlantis people what to read? The whole idea is to let the culture that is calm and being chastened only, not sent to Hyper Drive. <br /> <br /> ** Rear spoiler ** <br /> <br / > Perhaps the forgotten world plot and setting at the turn of the century should give a hint that this is more of a show of respect than the failure that I met with the film. Agree with this idea. But I am in a loss, why should I pay to see some characters and plot the story just because of a little fiction? And stories from the story are part of "Shit that they can't sell adults anymore" However, we are more complicated and our pulp must grow as well. Raiders of the Lost Ark loses the feel of the pulp and avoids badness. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - fun movies, but I think about the plot
