Altman's director's experience expects us to want to spend time with or care about what happens to the lead character who has a nervous breakdown as an irritated drinker who doesn't qualify for redemption - that is an important puzzle. about this The work that is deeply confused by the garbage, in addition to this disheartening defect, the plot line takes a serious concentration in tracking. The setting that the Branagh character walked into was a clear scene from the beginning until we wondered whether the writer and director lost respect for all audiences. This latter problem is the heart of the film: It represents self-direction with profound insult for tastes, values ​​and intelligence of the audience. Very unusual for Mr. Altman. <br /> <br /> Patrick Watson
