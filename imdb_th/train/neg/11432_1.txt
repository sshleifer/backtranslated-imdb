I watched the movie yesterday and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh generally had to have this unbelievable awkward chapter for five hours. (Or longer than actually) from the beginning, every element of this film is unbelievable. This movie makes me laugh many times. But most of them are shocked that the director / writer expects us to believe that the many disruptive elements that try to cut the film together. <br /> <br /> The interest of this movie is Graham (Graham) and her problems with intimacy Interesting things when she realized that she and her brother had unexpected ways in common. <br /> <br /> Interesting and interesting. However, instead of making this story a reliable and satisfying thing, the director brought a gray twist to a ridiculous twist that never had any reason. As an LGBT persona, this film seems to reflect that heterosexuals All thought we had to go through the process. (I will be insulted if weird writers) If not the lovely chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which is compelled to be easily understood) I will give 3 negative stars.
