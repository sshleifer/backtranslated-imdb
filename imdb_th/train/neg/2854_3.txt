Dreyfuss played the leader of a group of people who lost their minds, but now "fixed" Lane is his woman who is busy with his number one (Gold Blum), which should have something. Happened to the sister of Lane (Barkin) <br /> <br /> with what everyone can consider the actors supporting the actor Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even the appearance of Richard Pryor ) Could not help this because Dreyfuss proved that he could not "probably Users "and tried to kill everyone /> <br /> You see, not <br you do not know what will happen. The first ten minutes were nothing but those who tried to tell Goldblum what was in store when he left Dreyfus. But I will help you out. Problem: Skip this movie. <br /> <br /> The reason I chose This movie is because I've been a player Diane Lane recently and tried to watch all of her movies. The real surrender for me is not just a scary plan. But also the fact that she didn't appear until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (Although we heard about her throughout the story) even though being a big fan of more than half of the actors couldn't help me enjoy this movie. The part that should be installed, the suspense found me laughing at what actually happened. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars
