What is it about? I saw the Matrix and was amazed. It's the most beautiful movie ever created. What used to be, the Wachowski brothers made this movie beyond me. <br /> <br /> No plot. You can't argue with that. Essentially, this movie is all about talking and not understanding me wrong. I have no problem with movies that speak a lot. But all the discussions in The Matrix Reloaded are the driver's burden. Then there will be a battle sequence that lasts too long, then no longer pointless, and another fight scene that takes too long, and it creates the ultimate defense scene. The little beard spoke with a cow that couldn't understand for 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> In addition, Keanu Reeves also performed his worst performance. I know he's not a good actor. But it is a joke If you watch his movie in order, he is in it. He seems to be getting worse when they go. God knows what his acting is like to receive! Keanu Reeves: Only one board to become an actor. <br /> <br /> After the beauty of the first movie, this story became a big disappointment. If you haven't watched the first movie, I suggest you watch it. But don't waste time with this mound. <br /> <br />
