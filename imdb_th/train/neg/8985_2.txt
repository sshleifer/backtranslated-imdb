The previous comment encouraged me to examine this when it appeared on TCM, but it was a huge disappointment. Lupe Valdez was great but didn't have enough time on the screen. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette played a familiar character <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the character of Lee Tracy's character, which is the best character. The reaction of "public" is unbelievable and Unbelievable, making "Shenanigan" seem like a bad writer's invention. And it is provoking to believe that the character of Lupe Velez may fall in love with him. <br /> <br /> "One satire" mentioned in other reviews must be based on observers. Is being created
