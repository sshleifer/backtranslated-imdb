My family and I have screened Underdog the night before and not as good as the Underdog (my four year old likes it so much). Hot Rod makes it look like Oscar's precious material. Evel himself retired from retirement to slap Samberg in creating this film. I will admit that the soundtrack is good. I'm not sure if this movie was created in the 80s, but there are songs, mostly from Europe or not. Who knows. If I were you, I would pass. And stay home and see the test format on your local TV station Or if you are dead in watching this thing, people under the influence may enjoy it
