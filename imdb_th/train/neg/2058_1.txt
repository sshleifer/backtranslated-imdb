I can find good little things to say about this movie. I'm sure the ideas and scripts look good on paper. But the film and acting that I fear is not the standard I expect from some talented people. I wonder if this feature is high on their CV Filmography. Michael Ken appeared in his role as a doctor and sometimes I don't believe in his character. This story is unbelievable, especially in the story of the hapless son. Some scenes are reminiscent of other movies that sometimes I wonder if it's a tricky thriller. Sometimes the light is dark and this adds to the feeling of watching an inexpensive movie with a big star. Wondering why I have to be careful to watch it
