I'm a very scary fan. I also enjoy horror movies that some people think stupid. I also like the blood, the more merrier, as much as it has one point. <br /> <br /> After reading other people's reviews on the website, I'm sure this movie will be a little gem, but my disappointment It proved to be one of the most pointless movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The performance is terrible. The conversation is stupid. The plot is pointless. May have been fixed by people who have died in the last 2 years. I often find that all these characteristics create great horror movies But not in this case. <br /> <br /> I am 11 euros waist to get this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you don't enjoy movies that are pointless. (Such as the movie "sh * t" that is intense) Avoid any costs!
