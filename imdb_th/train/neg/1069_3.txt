I saw this film at the AFI Dallas festival. Most viewers, including my wife, enjoyed the comedy. But I didn't show Lucas Haas. (Alfa Dog Brick) Molly Parker (Kiss, The Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, the secret art school). The director is Matt Bissonnette who is married to Molly. The three actors Parker worked well in this film about 3 friends, their two marriages, and an infidelity involving a third person. It happened at the lake house and it looked fantastic. This movie wants to keep the title of it as a joke first, then it will be a drama and I think it must be another way.
