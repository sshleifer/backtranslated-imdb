The failure of ABC-to-TV ABC is not fair with great fantasy fiction that is A Wrinkle in Time Ms. Madeleine L'Engle takes children and adults into a strange, strange and strange world like never before Before This novel, which for the first time in her 'time quartet', is a beautiful life, universe and time. But it is easy for children or teenagers to understand His uncompromising morality is widespread throughout the book. The adaptation of this film can be seen as nothing but a mockery of the art of Ms. L'Engle. Honestly, what are they thinking? The effect looks cheap and ridiculous. The plot is soft and uneven. The conversation is profound and almost all the magic characteristics of the novel disappear. This is a terrible attempt to bring this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that one day, a wise and worthy director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar√≥n) tries again to bring this book to the screen and understand what is true. : This adaptation masterpiece can be compared to the art in the hotel rooms that are boring, fake and cheap, which does not cause any impact on the audience.
