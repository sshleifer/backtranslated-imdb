As far as I don't like saying 'I too' to respond to other opinions - it's completely true that the first 30 minutes of this movie have no connection to an endless raid that consists of 90. This <br /> <br /> Some of the bans did not make the movie look. Just because it is not similar to Hollywood products, it doesn't make it reliable. <br /> <br /> Moreover, there is no separate plot. (In addition to the many mud places in Russia and many people The old woman drank a lot of vodka.) There are many images that make me feel annoyed unnecessarily. I go into the second package of Rolaids. <br /> <br /> For a spoiler-good, this movie is without any thread. I can't write it if I try. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money and don't get confused with good Russian movies.
