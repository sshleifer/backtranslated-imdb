After what I thought was a brilliant performance of two roles in Man from Snowy River, why did Kirk Douglas be replaced by Brian Dennehy in the sequel? It's not the same if without Spurs and Harrison as Douglas shows. Maybe he remembered how bad the plot was. - Jim returned after a long time to find out that Jessica had been pursued by others. He couldn't expect any girl to wait for a long time without contacting him and found no competition. For this Disney movie, there is an inappropriate language, including the most unnecessary parts when Jim and Jessica put keys without marriage - very weak, insulting many intellectual people according to my family members I'll stick with the first one and try to forget that I've seen the sequel!
