This movie may take 15 minutes if it's not a fight between the son and father. Expect a lot, both "celebrities", men have to slap their faces hard! You want to cheese with "whine", two chuckles ... and a headache. I can understand why my mother left her husband after 47 years ... I don't know if she spent that long! The first 5 minutes that made me want to close a movie that I never paid $ 3.99 to see! This film is not good and painful for a long time. I watched the clock, hoping that the time would fly faster ... It wasn't possible. The script was repeated so many that the author had to fill the space positively ... The scenery was quite a fall as the season I liked the car 40 Ford was quite good. This film has been rated D-close to F.
