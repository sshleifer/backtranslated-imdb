I caught this Cuban movie at the Art Film Club. It was shown shortly after the 1978 Silly Symphony cartoon, which the Isle of Symphony reconciled with the Isle of Jazz, what Reuben Gonzalez had just died, delivered via a ballroom speaker, an old theater and Cuban flag. Hanging from the stucco pattern, stucco pattern, this scene is held to celebrate the creation of films that are engaging and mocking But the movie started And the color that peeled off the cinema was more interesting than the clutter on the screen. <br /> <br /> The story of Nada Mas promises a lot. Carla is tired of envelopes at the Cuban post office. She survived the only monotonous existence: writing letters and rewriting, changing the relationship between basic people to become BrontÃ«an's anger. Many of Cuba's pictures are taken with the bliss of joy, sorrow, fear, fear and the same. <br /> <br /> The problem is the simplicity of storytelling is enchanting with field trips. That is endless in the movie school The brothers of Marx hurt themselves and even - during the correction, especially the trick - celluloid scratches of the defacement school onto the character's face. <br /> <br /> Dimensional character Cunda, the boss at The post office is dominatrix-nosferatu Without humor Her master conspirators Koncha pointed out the fingers, crushed and screamed Cesar, the dollarhead and interest in romance, revealing hidden abilities when Carla. Traveling to Miami, the chase scene (in fast-forward fast) was sent to the temple appropriately. All of this should work well in Mortadello and Filemon comic strip, but in the black-and-white flick - the FX center that has a high hypocrisy eyebrows. <br /> <br /> Nada Mas tries to cross the barrier between 'strange Amelie's strange-heroine-paired-stranger and Il Postino's 'poetic-as-great-redeemer' theme, as well as Amelie. The protagonist of this story is a strange white woman who fought with demons. By trying to bring magic to the lives of strange people Repeat And just like Il Postino, this film is not reversed from the poem's lasting poetry and the postman on the bike is a romantic leader. Unfortunately, Nada Mas failed to capture the greenery and transcendence of both films. <br /> <br /> There are two things that might make you watch this movie in a TV stupor late at night. The first is to open the image from the top of Carla on the tiled floor, examining the cut with the crossword puzzle she is working on. The second is to see Nadamas as an example. Warning: Our post, Buena Vista Social Club. The fascination with Cuban art works often blinks us to accept any junk that has drums in the soundtrack. g This film should not be distributed around the world - movies such as Waiting List and Guantanamera cover more similar areas successfully.
