If you've seen other movies like this, they should be better. Omega man came to mind In the studio's credit, they avoid using large, unnecessary and large budgets that determine the film of this family. In addition, the settings and location are excellent: the four people that the past is not related to us are trying to escape from life-threatening infectious diseases. The worst thing is everything! I was bored with the stupid, incompetent, inefficient and arrogant characters in the movie. That is quite a description of everyone in the movie at some point. I rented it and found myself shouting at the TV repeatedly, "No, don't do that!", "Why are you so stupid?", "Be careful!" SHOULD gives a strong personal connection to some characters so you are interested in what is happening. This is not possible. Also, there should be a length that is more relevant to the movie as well.
