Executives who are very successful in their work life But unable to live a familiar life, met with a boy with Down syndrome, then escaped from the house The two characters feel lonely and obviously the less intelligent people will show the executives the beauty of the small things in their lives ... For this reason, the atmosphere like Amelie and sensitive music. Movies that are morally disgusting However, because there are some interesting scenes (Sometimes boys are quite serious) and the interpretation of both actors is Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne. It's a very good story. I decided to go to the movies. In general, French theaters have the ability to show something that seems to be very lively compared to more stereotypical American movies. But for this reason it is very frustrating to see after the ridiculous death of the boy's undead death, the charming voice, the happiness of a morally cheap executive family, the laughter that could not bear Waving from heaven while Michael Landon ... really disgusting in my opinion
