please! Don't waste money on this movie. It is nothing more than a tear of the German Blair Witch created by a high school boy. I can't watch it until the end, and normally I like watching all types of B movies. How can they find a distributor on this planet !!! Good joke: Take a look at Wikipedia to see "dark areas". Those who write the text must completely leave their hearts. Maybe he received a lot of money from the manufacturer. Money that should be used with actors, cameras and editing Although it didn't help because there was no interesting idea behind the film. Unfortunately the "dark area" gets too much attention. Please, the director, the producer and the creator of this movie made STOP create a movie like this ... You don't do what you like. The world will be a better place without this film.
