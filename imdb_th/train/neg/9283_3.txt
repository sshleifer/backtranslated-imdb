I do not know whether this film received many positive reviews on this website! I am a big fan and familiar with the story of this original movie that is beyond belief. But even though I'm not a poor actor, the actor is very handsome. (Shaun Astin as a sportsman and everyone around) Harrison ?? That person is perfect!) And writing that is lower than standard causes the rag to not appear at all. Some people point out how much Maculay Culkin is cute if you read and think it's pure humor. (Sadly, it might be the most funny part of the movie). You might like this movie. But if you are a fan of Vonnegut or don't lose consciousness, don't see it please.
