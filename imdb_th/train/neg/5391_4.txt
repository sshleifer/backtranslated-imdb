I hate most of the movie world. They show how Hollywood people think about the rest of the world, and they think that we are sadistic idiots. I've been to L. many times. I have a family working in the show business and I just want to say that these are the last ones that we should look for. The disaster movie, at least, draws a picture that is wise: Children of Men, Monkeys 12. But usually the message is just "People will do everything for survival. All dark and sad and pointless. We should all be ashamed of ourselves." /> <br /> Don't understand me wrong. Test the courage of the people in the horror face, and I believe that some people will act like this movie. The image, however, is a lustful, foolish person. Human's every man for himself, that's just insulting.
