I should check this for the website and I look at this thing optimally that at least it can be a joke. But it's fun and it's not good enough. <br /> <br /> "666: The Child" may be one of the worst supernatural thriller I have ever seen. (Worse than "Godsend") with a scene ripped from "The Omen" without shame The ending is similar to the way that the "prophecy" ends. <br /> <br /> Don't just say that acting, writing and stories are just knowledge. If these movies generate revenue, I regret to see which Asylum is heading for. It's embarrassing.
