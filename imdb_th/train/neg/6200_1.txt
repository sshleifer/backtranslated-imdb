This is the most annoying movie I've ever seen. It makes "Requiem for a Dream" look like a Disney movie. Although technically, it has been created fairly well, acting, movies, movies, music, directors and others are good. However, the final gang rape scene is the most shocking and violent thing I've ever seen and I hope I won't Have seen it really I was afraid that it would haunt me for the rest of my life. Although I think everyone will find that this movie is very annoying. But some of my wife and her friends were victims in a very similar manner I saw this film at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas and there were no actors or teams to join. I want them to have the opportunity to protect the violence in their movies, which I feel is too free and unnecessary. The previous scene was successful in conveying the emotions that they clearly tried. But do not rub your face in severe and clear sexual violence This movie should have a large warning sign attached. For these reasons, I will not recommend anyone to see. You have been warned
