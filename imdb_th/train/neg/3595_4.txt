I'm not "lucky" as everyone else commented on this movie: I've never seen anything from ... We'll say ... "fecund" Sarno's heart. I agree with many. People: Some actresses who spend most of their time and dancing (go-go) are not very interesting. I like Fraulein Crank (?) ... She's a warm person. She's so cute! The show is quite tepid. But sending a chapter in a second language can cause many problems. Trying to follow the plot is a hard task: is it really? I fully agree with other opinions: For vampires, there is not much blood. Yes, if you want a good blood flick, try using a classic hammer, such as "Horror of Dracula" and "Brides of Dracula", which is my personal favorite. (Inadvertently) is where the female doctor makes her clothes torn by bats ... which you never saw! ... bats. I mean, <br /> <br /> Okay, like it's time if you can catch it. Cable here in the Great White North, but for the sake of heaven, do not rent!
