Oh Geez ... There are many movies I want to know ... I'm stuck with my nephew over the weekend and this is what he wants - yes ... <br /> <br /> me Used to see this show when I was in college ... it's not interested, kinda fun, and quite focused on action The list has a good heart ... and cute characters. No one was killed or severely hurt ... It was like a lively cartoon cut to 2005 ... What happened? This is not working. As everyone else said, it wasn't a tough story and the acting was weird ... almost annoying - of course, not honest with the original characters ... the whole thing was like a TV panic! This is one of the few times that I was hit by EMBARRASSED. What are their thoughts? The best that I can say must be to market toys and other products. All I can say is that this person dies quickly. It makes Hazzard's original Dukes look like a Masterpiece Theater ... <br /> <br /> I think the only thing to do from TV is Gilligan Island ... Good luck!
