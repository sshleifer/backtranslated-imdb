One of Scorsese's worst. Average thriller; The only thing that would suggest that it was De Niro playing psychosis. In general, the ending of this type of film is the northern region, where other villains are invincible and have painful immunity I don't like the original 60s and this version has not been much improved. I don't know why Scorsese wasted time with the remake. Then again, consider how bad his latest movie is. (I mean his boring Buddhist movies and everything with his new favorite actress, Di Caprio blonde). It's not bad. And considering Spielberg wants to do a remake ... maybe worse
