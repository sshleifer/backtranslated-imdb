I am an Irishman and I have lived in Denmark for a while, so I am looking forward to going home last week so that I can see the halftime. And I will continue to say: <br /> <br /> This horrible movie <br /> <br /> It's not bad, like "The richest man in Ireland" but of course not standing there with other Irish movies such as The Commitments, I Went Down or Michael Collins. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of this movie are funny. Really like Colm Meaneys gardas, American style But this movie was filmed entirely wrong Bouncing around the camera and zooming in steadily, zooming out will try to make the movie look sleek as if it were a witty drama, but it's not. This is the Irish stock lock and two smoking tanks and should be Get fired like this Should have smooth movements from one shot to the next shot This movie looks sloppy and is thrown together. <br /> <br /> The performance is ok. One of my friends said to me that they just followed Colin Farrell around Dublin for a week. He gave a good performance as the Dirtbag of Dublin, but had no comparison with his performance in the Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. The best performance was from Dierdre O'Kane, a middle-aged female player with sexual problems. Which had just been left by her husband's bank manager to be a girl I think she should let God stand and focus on her performance. <br /> <br /> Overall, whether it is as expected by the Irish media or deserves That will be considered as one of Ireland's best movies. <br /> <br /> I expect to have a backlash from these comments because most of the people I say say it's great. Much But before you answer, ask yourself: do you think this movie will be great if you are in England or America?
