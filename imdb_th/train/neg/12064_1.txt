This film is one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen, because it's a terrifying god. John Carradine has a very limited screen show. Every character is amazing. Bored and the story is terrible, and I also saw both twists at the end, several miles away! Good settings and creepy houses will definitely help if it's not boring and there is no single character to take root as well, including I hope it will reach the bottom 100 because it deserves Will be there In my opinion. When John Carradine appeared at the end, it was a pretty good scene. But it was too late and when other screens that he had in the incident, including the bloody scenes in the movie, were when the character received his face confused by Bee's because it was quite full Blood I received this in the DVD Horror series called Back From The Grave and everyone commented too much in my opinion, plus luck that it was included in the set I bought, otherwise I would throw it out. Going out the window! This movie is one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen. It is a terrifying god. John Carradine has a very limited show time and I said that I avoided the plague. ! You don't want to suffer That direction is terrible! Carl Monson doing terrible things! Working here makes everything contempt, losing his potential to create an eerie atmosphere and just make this film incredibly boring. The performance is not as good as it should be. John Carradine is a good person in his scene. But after that he barely got in other movies and then staged (Carradine ruled !!) Merry Desmond acted too much here, like Laura. She didn't believe me. Ivy Bethune is okay and quite creepy, but overacted. She has an eerie smile in the episode. End though The rest of the actors, I didn't pay enough attention because I had many problems in passing it. But they are terrible Overall, please avoid this. It's not worth the pain! BOMB from 5
