I was forced to watch the whole set of movies as a child and I was told that they were real! Talking about child abuse, I will be afraid of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is suitable for those who believe in this nonsense and those who want to instill in their children the same belief. In addition to the obvious problems of brainwashing and implantation, there are also poor performances, poor writing and "Special effects" that are not good. They are horrible and terrible movies. Yes, believe (and scary) for children, but I can't imagine buying this growing concern. Although I must say that I will be interested in seeing them today as adults. They may have feelings of midnight / certain cult movies.
