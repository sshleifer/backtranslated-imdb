The series is too short and too short. (Two bad seasons) is about experimentation and unlike anyone else as a truck driver who goes to the strip bar. I'm not sure what they mean by "breaking the floor" and "original" when they cringe around Lynch and his stupid TV opus. What are the criteria of original things? Of course, when compared to "Bill Cosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues", it is absolutely original. Next to "Law and Order" TP causes the left and right initiatives. <br /> <br /> Fans TP's often say that the program is canceled because too many viewers are not smart enough. "The alleged intelligence of the forest or whatever As a big fan of myself, I have to correct that misunderstanding. There's nothing about TP too. It's just watching. But the stupid detective that circulated in the circle spun in every corner, but (or because of it) finally got nowhere. Strange things that should always be forced; The characters do not have as many strange behaviors as they behave in unusual ways at half-time. There is a difference ... <br /> <br /> Whenever I look at the "weird dreams" in "Living In Oblivion", which dwarfs criticism of the director (Buscemi) for help for the weary - The ancient thought that is in my dreams, I miss Lynch. Do you want strange? "Eraserhead" is really strange. It's too strange to be abstract. Do you want a unique TV program? See "Prisoner". Do you want an actor that looks strange? Felini and Leone's film proposes that TP looks like an overly TV crime drama in which all young people look like fashion. The cast makes TP look plastic. Kens & Barbies en masse <br /> In fact, one of the producers. TP said Lynch is looking for a "unique face" for a unique face series like Lara Flynn Boyle? Sheryll Fenn? Like the "hunter" who faced a straightforward problem from the men's catalog (Or gay magazine)? do not get me wrong There is nothing wrong with getting a charming actor, especially with the beauty of Fenn. (The way Madonna will look if she is more than 1,000 cute) but don't say that you are acting "strange to someone who looks strange" and I never understood Lynch's delusion with Kyle MacLachlan (I should have Accepting coins for distractions to spell his name correctly) He is not a nasty person. But lack of talent seems to be too polite and offensive His character at "Scary" is not interesting, just one of the many times Lynch tried to force the bizarre, trying hard to live according to his reputation. Everything that Lynch created was "Elephant Man", a very sub-story compared to his first two movies. What follows is a moderate effort that relies on a relatively small fan base. But Lynch's fanaticism for him to be in the public eye by interpreting it as a compilation In other words, Lynch is the love of all intellectuals. <br /> <br /> Her father, Laura, was killed ... He was possessed by demons or such nonsense. That is the best thing that "great heart" can happen ... You have a horror movie about B-movie that ends with more originality. <br /> <br /> Lynch isn't bright. Or working hard enough to create a great story. <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and watch "TV and Movies: 150 Worst Cases of Baptism".
