OK, this movie is good, but I gave 1 because the idea of ​​a computer virus became an organic virus, a pure fairy tale. This kind of shit just adds to the delusion. Paranoid people are paranoid about moron that the computer virus is like an organic virus. First of all, a string of code and number 1s and 0s combined into a computer virus. Organic viruses are much more complex. Although considered to be one of the simplest forms in the universe But the organic virus is stuck in your cell and attached to the RNA Maybe radiation can affect the user's cornea that turns your eyes into these viruses. I can see But clearly the author did not think so
