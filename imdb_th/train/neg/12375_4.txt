The good thing about this is at least freshness: almost no movies about dance music and club scenes. (If done) hit the cinema And it also spreads energy from music to Ibiza's description. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is that it can't decide what to want. Although it is like being a mocker in the genre of This is Spinal Tap, the producers realized that they didn't want to play in imitation. However, it failed a lot with jokes because it was not well written and most of the characters were underdeveloped. And it has no arc in its script and leads to 90 minutes, so why not fix it down to 75? Production and movies are still trying to keep that day. (Such as Paul's house) <br /> <br /> In a strange and unexpected way, everything that goes missing Pete Tong works better as a simple drama in a nearly famous genre. With Beatriz Batarda offering the power of acting. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's a messy story. It is quite entertaining at a basic level. But you should spend time in your favorite club
