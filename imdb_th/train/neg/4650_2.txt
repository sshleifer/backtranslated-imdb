With a strong British actor and a favorite photograph in the United Kingdom in 1950, I hope and expect more entertainment from this movie. Unfortunately, I found myself stuck to the wrong reason - I couldn't believe how bad it was. I have to watch thousands of old movies and are always ready to allow them to be their work at this time. But it was hard to do it. <br /> <br /> As everyone else noticed, the main problem was that it wasn't possible. Seems to know what it's like: romantic comedy, gentle, slapstick comedy or musical drama. I'm a little gobsmacked when Jeannie Carson broke into the song for about 15 minutes! Unbelievable at all levels, whether it is the story or the fact that Daisy never appears to have any threat to her at any time. Noen (Songwriter for the benefit of God!) The fact that he has Diana Dor for his fianc√© and seems to ignore her a little. (I mean Diana Dors! Come on!) And a laughing scene in the music publisher's office. The most stupid thing in the worst way That everything was great
