Lil Bush is a 30-minute comic show consisting of 2 15-minute episodes shown in Comedy Central. It takes place in the comic characters Washington DC and the center around the satirical children's agent George W. Bush, Condoleeza, Rice, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheyney, other politicians were satisfied with the same style and served as a secondary character. <br /> <br /> The pilots of the little bushes According to the expectations of this critic, proved to be a relatively shallow and mysterious production Its outstanding contract: look sarcastic at the current presidential administration. While we must acknowledge that the evidence of the program is certain, although it is difficult to imagine that the acting based on the profanity of a single political person will survive in order to produce the next episode after retiring. already That can be described as sloppy, the best, and the most terrifying, the worst, has marred the little potential. Show <br /> <br /> Lil Bush, which may be technically classified as "words", tends to Don't care about it The actual use of the tool, especially of the comedian, to deliver the goal to them in a rude way. (But not particularly original, fun, or funny). The continued weak performance of the writing often consists of more than Bush / Cheney's joke recordings that heard nausea elsewhere and put it all in one 30-minute period of television. Therefore, most jokes presented by most writers are nonsense, some of which have been in public for more than 6 years. For example, comparing with Vice President Darth Vader may be a joke during 300 first time to hear in daily shows / reports, Colbert / Report / Letterman / Conan O'Brien / Leno alone - but not funny here. As if it were not enough, the plans of the program seemed to exist only to add to the funny humor that the writer made the center of the list. <br /> <br /> In the defense of the program When the writer dares to write in a truly original joke (Which seems to be rare) It is usually quite funny If the show will expand its depth and place the character in a new situation, the situation is more exotic than the original mistake and the "quagmire" that is revered by the Bush administration, so do not have to rely on the same jokes again. Considerable, quite tolerable and possibly innovative. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is difficult to determine which defects that are causing the Lil Bush series the most damage; The lack of clarity in originality and weak writing quality or ambition in the heart that painfully narrowed down There is a reason to expect Lil Bush to be able to maintain a small left-wing fan base, that is, if they are able to tolerate extra bad writing. As long as the program continues, Lamphun, the Bush administration thoroughly Nonetheless, most viewers will soon remember the program for what it was a brutal and rude effort that was brutally rude, and the words and refinements in searching for more intellectual stimulus might be cheaper.
