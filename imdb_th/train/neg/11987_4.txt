In my book In the class, we just finished doing the Hatchet book and this movie is not like the book. (1) Brian didn't eat worms in the book. (2) He doesn't know the name of the pilot. (3) His mother is cheating on his father in The station wagon is not in the forest where anyone can see. (4) The man whose mother is cheating with no black hair, he has blond hair. <br /> <br /> Now for the part. Unrealistic of the movie: (1) Thirteen years old could not punch his fist through the face. <br /> <br /> And for showing the boy who plays Brian as an awesome actor, <br /> <br /> But I believe that the scenery is impressive even though I am Would be very skeptical that the director read the book <br /> <br /> This film is good if you haven't read the book by Gary Paulsen, but if you have to start a letter of complaint to the director
