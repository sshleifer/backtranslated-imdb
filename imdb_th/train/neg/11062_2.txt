The way to go ace! You have just created a formidable story about a deadly carnivorous human being that turns into a soft and cool drama. Obviously, the movie, Dahmer, seems to be one of two types: horror or documentary, right? This isn't it. It's not close to any detailed facts (in fact, there's almost no content at all. ) It's not scary or scary, or doesn't try to be very disturbing (as if you have to try !!) What is this writer / director thinking? This is one of the most true examples of ill-murdered serial killers and we have been shot badly, rape, bad gay roof bars and a long, long history of being alone in the old guardian's house. That Jacobson tried to present (or invent) the 'soft side' of j.Dahmer
