This film failed to capture the mystery and intrigue that this book offers. The main issue of this book is the insights that are almost unimpressive when letting the audience wonder why everyone has made a big deal about them and why they risked their lives. <br /> <br / > Character development is not good at all. No background or personal development makes viewers uninterested in what happens to them and the order of action. <br /> <br /> The original search ends suddenly and there is no real explanation. Leaving feeling satisfied with all the searches. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst adaptations I've ever seen. It's scary and time consuming. If you haven't read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you read the book, skip the movie and read it repeatedly. <br /> <br /> It's almost like the purpose of the movie is to make the book derogatory. It is also a shame because it can be a good thing if they are big on the success of it and they may get good movies and good actors. <br /> <br /> Please do not wear. Must waste time reading books !!!
