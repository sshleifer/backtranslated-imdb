As I can do, I believe that this movie is a waste of time. I did not find the movie 'Warm and pleasant' that others do. I find it boring with songs that distract from the movie. The story is light, the character is pulled out and the footpath. <br /> <br /> Fooey <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to write more about this movie, so I created 10 minimum lines And compactness is important, but IMDb is the lowest The bitter, old age turned to drink a lot and taught very little. Conflict arises While I don't think this is a spoiler But I added a warning in the event that there was too much of this information. <br /> <br /> Most of the time I just found this movie boring and pretentious. Waste my time I honestly don't understand what the fuss is, the most small things on this website, about the superior quality of this movie. I think it's worth avoiding. But while Dennis Miller once said that "I might be wrong"
