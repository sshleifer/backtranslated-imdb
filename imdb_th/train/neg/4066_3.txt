In Eric Stanze's 'ISOYC, IPOYG' director, three men were tortured at the hands of women who were sexually abused. The first victim was forced to eat his own crap before being thrown to death. The next doctor became a bullet in the target after refusing to have anal sex with the body of the first man. But it was the third man who made it the worst: he had to watch Emily's "star" hack with a big tattoo naked and help himself with a broomstick (Oh, he also took his butt!) <br /> And unfortunately we did that. (Seeing you help yourself, is that ?? Don't get a broom handle to handle our butt!) <br /> <br /> Yes, 'ISOYC, IPOYG' is one cruel viewing experience, not because of the unstoppable violence but because of Haack, which is clearly Under the misunderstanding that she has a body of goddess (As opposed to being the principal of Tu) It's not a cute picture. <br /> <br /> In addition to the non-stop nudity from Haack that filled the ink, the audience also saw the horrific direction from Stanze (who thought the grave and tree pictures). Endless It's a fun show) Really bad performances and fat penis <br /> <br /> Strange enough, I rate 'ISOYC, IPOYG' at 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than the current 2.9 average. That's one point for a busy ax attack (which I really enjoyed); One point for the bit, the fat man gets his face pushed in a chocolate mousse that is masked as a stool (hilarious); And at one point, making the real nerve shows that this film may be the sequel to Meir Zarchi in the classic exploitation of I Spit On Your Grave
