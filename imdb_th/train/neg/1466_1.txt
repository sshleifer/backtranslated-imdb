<br /> <br /> As usual, I am looking forward to watching TV / new movies in my favorite stories - creating great changes from strange familiar documentaries about Kursk or Stalingrad on the historical channel. > <br /> I'm looking forward to Pearl Harbor and Enemy at the Gates - but being taken down to the ground rudely with a sense of Hollywood's stupidity and stupidity - and the ability to use luck for sure. Tripe <br /> <br /> so Again, I am excited about. 'The rise of evil', especially when I heard that Ian Kershaw was involved while I liked his book. I can see why he resigned. <br /> <br /> To refer to the man responsible for this garbage: <br /> <br /> "Kershaw book is an academic work," he said. br /> <br /> We need more events. "<br /> <br /> The event? Are they all nuts? Hitler's life could not say that there was no 'event' - yes, two Hitler biographies of Kershaw were long and detailed. But they should be <br /> <br /> The thesis behind 'Rise of Evil' should be: <br /> <br /> Hitler is a very bad person - no. He is a very bad person. Hate the Jews, and in the event that you miss this story, we will focus on the truth in every scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is no attempt to try and explain the mood of the time and why Hitler might. Use the views and strategies he made No need to say - unlike 'Nazi - a historical warning' that is generally excellent - this film neglects to point out the fact that almost all leaders of the Communist Party of Munich are increasing Jews. And this may make his perspective - and the true connection of Jews and Bolsheviks - very important to understand the majority of Nazi era. <br /> <br /> But no A lot of understanding - the filmmakers didn't go. Went there, so we got everything we already knew Of course, we did not get the interesting facts that Kershaw cited, which Hitler had become a socialist / communist in a short time after WW1. Of course, it would be too complicated to handle and might distract. Going out of words that never stop. 'He is a' terrible mantra that results in uninterrupted. <br /> <br /> We know that he is a bad person. However, we know that he is an attractive person, both as a public speaker and in a more personal situation. He may be polite and sympathetic, and of course he has made certain perspectives such as vegetarianism, anti-alcohol and anti-smoking, which many readers of Guardian agree. He still loves famous animals. For this reason, because of all the invented dog scenes, <br /> <br /> He is also a brave soldier in WW1 as we see him. His iron cross, we never saw how he would win. (Acts of courage are not in the script, no need to speak.) We also don't understand why he was fired from the war experience while Sassoon, Owen, Brook, Remarque and others. Many find it a nasty experience. And again, as well as the point above the Jewish / Bolshevik link. This is important to everyone's understanding of the subject. Why he loves war so much Why he thought it was always a good idea, even though there was a lot of evidence on the contrary. Why did he ignore his colleagues who had died? Or maybe he could do - but still get the wrong conclusion. <br /> <br /> This film has nothing to say about this one. <br /> <br /> All This too often Movie Day is a classic example of 'Create history that is relevant to the present' and invent things or leave the awkward facts to be consistent with the 'present' - which is often the lowest response to the common denominator. Don't have to trust your audience in just one finger, so you just unpack their neck. (Sadly rightly) that you will go with it because there are many stupid people in the world. <br /> <br /> History is about making us relevant to the past and see how it is today. We make it better and worse. This garbage is a good opportunity to disappear again. They spend millions on impressive locations and large scenes. But did not tell us anything and did not promote the understanding of this dark period in human history. <br /> <br /> WT
