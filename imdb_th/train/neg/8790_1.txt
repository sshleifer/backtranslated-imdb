I saw this on cable recently and enjoyed it. I read the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half. Personally, I like the first story. (Terrible that doesn't expand) I think the second story is cliched and that is "California Dreaming" if I hear it again ... Chungking Express doesn't matter, but it's not what the main audience will see. Crouching Tiger "
