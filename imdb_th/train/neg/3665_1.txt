Obviously this is what happened when the director allowed his 14-year-old nephew to write the conversation on the scene as he soaked in alcohol during that time. As I said earlier, though, I always wanted to capture Paul Naschy's werewolf, but this cruelty is my introduction and scary as it is. Of course, I still intend to follow other programs in Serie <br /> <br /> Even though there is a great disappointment, such as THE HOWLING (1981) of Joe Dante, I love werewolf images in general. But to be honest, I lost my interest in the movie "plot" and stood there. That my TV screen is ridiculous as before There is too much to say about them here. But I have to say that both of which make me particularly hilarious are the schizophrenic characteristics of the individual werewolf. (For example, going from one beast to a zombie-like state in the next - as if he were walking midnight in the countryside and playing a completely different wardrobe to boot .. And yes, I know the reasons before) including "Phantom Of The Opera" looking at Wolfstein characters! But what I know - perhaps the full length of this mess can be a classic horror story that is very scary!
