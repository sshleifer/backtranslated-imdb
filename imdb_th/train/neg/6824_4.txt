After watching Koyaanisqatsi Two or three times and love it every second. Finally, I have the opportunity to see it as a sequel to life in change. I was truly disappointed because it was not close to the high standards of the first 90 minutes with a basket on their heads, not my opinion on the good movie. Philip Glass's score for this model is neither beautiful nor Strong at first When compared with Koyaanisqatsi This movie looks slow and has no point. The watered version of Baraka is the same concept. But can do better I hope that the third movie in this series will not follow the example of the story.
