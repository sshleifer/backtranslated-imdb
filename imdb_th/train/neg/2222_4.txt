Carlo Verdone once combined great comedy with intelligent and intelligent social analysis and criticism. <br /> <br /> Then something happened and he became a director. <br /> Il Mio Miglior Nemico can be summed up as much or as little as one line. "Labor = type and warm while the upper class = hypocrite and crooked. But love wins in the end. "<br /> <br /> Like clich√®s for the wise director. <br /> <br /> There's not too much to talk in the movie. Every character is a walking image: self-made people who forget their roots But who will become "good" again. The wife who despises the stubborn rich woman who fell in love with the honest but poor ... The performance is almost average. <br /> <br /> Disappointing Very much in all aspects
