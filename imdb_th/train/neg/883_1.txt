There are many problems with this movie. But I will try to talk about the most obvious and most annoying problems. First of all, while the theme introduces many vignettes about Manhattan's life, the truth is that everything is normal in movies and television. It's about strange things, often with sexual characteristics. The story is slim or impersonal, and almost every scene, camera, dialogue and emotion that is displayed is a real fake. Eventually it came to an hour after that, causing the heart to trance the junk that I walked away. (Something that is not strange for me in the past few years) I will guess the fi9lm directed by the film director But I believe that the director Mira Nair (once pre-Amelia has the ability) was involved in a disgusting imitation, so perhaps the director's ability in America was descended from the toilet
