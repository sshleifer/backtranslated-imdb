Yes, this is a totally unbelievable word. We know that French people tend to have distorted thoughts of the United States. It is a purist and has a sexual perspective. As an American (Hoosier) living in France, I have the opportunity to observe these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived ideas may be true, not one of the elements of the Midwestern cities shown in this film is true. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years ago that his penis is too big? Where do you find the juke box in the bar that plays only the ancient Bluegrass? The city may have 16 people, less than two hours away from Chicago. But there is no important gas station, no TV in the house, no McDonalds, no children ... populations that know each other's intimate details Family that hates each other Adult male grown booing cushions at local cafes with farms But don't harvest, kill the men they don't like in front of everyone and seem to run away and everyone is equally emotional? The French woman who had the freedom to screw a 17-year-old virgin boy due to her sexual generosity, too much flesh that went out into the field by the breath of wind from Illinois alone to help protect the old farm boy. 17 years, the same person also helps! I was bewildered and amazed by the ridiculousness of this movie, which I didn't express clearly how ridiculous it was. Go see it for the A-to-Z primer with things to avoid. Gosh, I hope I won't destroy it for you!
