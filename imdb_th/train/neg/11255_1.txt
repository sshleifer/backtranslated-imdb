This movie is boring. It has no life and spark. The big problem is with both sides. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow do not have any chemical properties. They are boring and she is annoying. <br /> <br /> The pictures are interesting. But did not make the scene better If anything, the image will make the audience separate from what is happening on the screen. There is no realistic action sequence, and because of this, the film cannot create a true drama or feel dangerous. <br /> <br /> This film has potential. Better director I always think about this movie. You know that this movie will be used if Harrison Ford is Sky Captain, Karen Allen is Polly and Steven Spielberg is the director. <br /> <br /> Don't care about critical reviews for the movie. this story Critics that I think praised the film because they wanted to like it and wanted it to succeed, even if it failed in many levels.
