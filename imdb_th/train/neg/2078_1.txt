I went to watch this movie yesterday and although I don't have high hopes for this movie But I'm still bitterly disappointed! Actually, I don't believe I spent 96 minutes in my life watching this movie ... It's terrible !!! The story is shameful and the performance is terrible. (Although there are big names like Uma Thurman in it) The film uses a lot of special techniques ... but they don't affect me. I hope the id never looks and I warn everyone not to watch movies. this story It is a total waste of money and you will be disappointed thereafter. My advice is to save your money, go shopping, treat yourself. Do not go to watch this movie ... You will live to regret.
