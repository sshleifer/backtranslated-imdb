After the chief group Vic Moretti (the great late Anthony Franciosa) killed his woman, who was cheating on him with Derek, chauffeur / their new Vietnam vet and blaming the poor people. Derek found himself in the prison he had to fight with The corrupt guardian, Corden's brother, Vic, who takes care of the prison and oh yes, the illegal trial conducted by the shady CIA staff. (The first major type and director John Saxon) to turn prisoners into zombies Of course, things were already gone, and it was up to Derek and the remaining undeterred prisoners to save the day after the infected person went to jail. <br /> <br /> John Saxon is A talented actor & as a Saxon director ... a very talented actor To say that this movie (John's only director dating to the present) lacking visual acuity will be a trivial matter. However, this movie has not done anything without merit. Conversations while being stupid enough to sometimes have humor Sadly, this film is not enough for this film alone and it takes forever for the movie to begin to come into its own. (Which is quite slow in the movie), so what I recommend the most is saying that if you are a Saxon fan (Which I am the real one) It's worth watching just go with low expectations and you should be fine. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dana Lis Mason and Tane McClure get the top <br /> <br /> My grade: D +
