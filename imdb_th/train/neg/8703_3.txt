Primal Species (1996, Dir. Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists were surprised when their products became living dinosaurs. Now the army commando team has to think completely if they want to prevent the extinction of the human race instead of reptiles. <br /> <br /> You look at the cover. That is very beautiful The performances are only accepted by a few characters. Bad stories with movies, both based on the army and the Marines trying to kill dinosaurs. This movie came out three years after 'Jurassic Park'. This movie seems to have come out 13 years ago. 'Jurassic Park', dinosaur costumes are not doing well and I mean costumes. Obviously there are people who dress up and this movie doesn't try to hide this. The scene in which a dinosaur runs along the path is created in a way that looks like someone is riding an organism. One good thing that comes from this movie takes a short time in just 1 hour and 15 minutes. Your life is not wasted. But still trying to avoid it together. <br /> <br /> "It's like Friday the 13th nightmare" - Officer (Brian Currie)
