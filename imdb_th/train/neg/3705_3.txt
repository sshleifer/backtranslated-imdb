I like Chris Rock But I feel that he has lost in this movie The idea of ​​creating a paradise is normal. But the builders follow the turkey meat that is too close When Eddie Murphy remade, Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he did it all new - so they became Murphy's movies / vehicles, not just new ones. That's why they are successful. If Chris did the same thing, this could be a much better movie. A few laughter came when he was doing his daily routine - so he might have made a concert movie. It would be more fun if a white person with a body is a truck driver or a countryman. So why does Hollywood continue to do this kind of garbage? Because people watch it - because they like Chris Rock So give Chris a good script and give us a better movie! Don't make bad movies at first!
