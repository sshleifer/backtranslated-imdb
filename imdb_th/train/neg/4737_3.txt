I love the movie "Azumi" for the first time. I've seen Ueno in her TV appearances and I've seen a fair share of samurai and ninja flicks. I must say that this movie is weaker than I expected. <br /> <br /> From the actors and setting up in "Azumi", they should have done a lot better with this movie. But it goes slowly in some parts and sprinkled with bad performances, untrustworthy and woodwork. <br /> <br /> When they care about referring to the first and weak movie in " Azumi "The best character of the elite killer group in" Azumi 2 ". She seems to be less and less impressive. <br /> <br /> Don't say it's a total loss. There are good fighting scenes and some popular characters. Unfortunately, the film was affected by the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri were not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The two people later truly captured the "manga" feeling in their screenplay while the past was not. Used to "get"
