This shit may have been honored 60 years ago, but is one of the most racist films ever made to a Native American Indian played by a white man, James Stewart, the Republican right wing, a racist class. In real life, as with his close friend John Wayne in 1971, Stewart has a cast of Hal Williams sacked from "The Jimmy Stewart Show" (a short series that fell benevolently) just because Williams is a black man. As if it's not bad enough, this movie is old and boring. Watch "Dances with Wolves" instead. To see a little racism, <br /> <br /> Stewart is in his forties when this movie was created. And even with his ridiculous wig - old Debra Paget, I was surprised that even allowed <br /> <br /> 0/10
