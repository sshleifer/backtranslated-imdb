This movie is a joke! The name is pronounced wrongly without attenuation and the plot is twisted and gnarled as something that is not recognized by literary enthusiasts And they have the good water to deliver the weapons / artillery to ridiculous Beowulf Beowulf doesn't want that weapon! In the poem, he tore the arms of Grendel with his bare hands! And I can't believe that the scriptwriter has done this. The way that Grendel expressed is impressive. That and the actors are just a plus point of features. My English teacher will lose consciousness if she sees this nasty thing. Unless you are a big fan of the epic poem "Beowulf", avoid this film at all costs And even then I would not recommend
