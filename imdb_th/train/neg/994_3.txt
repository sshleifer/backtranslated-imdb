This movie is sucked plain and simple. Okay, so generally about women who were raped and for revenge. She received another man to rape the rapist. The villain threatened to be a victim. But the victim, the girl, has a part I mean, they are both in the mood and start kissing and things. But when the rapist tries to have sex with her, she doesn't allow rape to rape her. And the rape scene for girls is very short and it doesn't reveal or show anything. But when talking about rape that raped it, it was a rather long rape scene. Nothing in the story is worth watching. <br /> <br /> 3.2 / 10
