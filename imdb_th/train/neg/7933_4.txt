I am a big fan of Randolph Scott. But this movie is absurd The whole thing felt like fake cans and sound, with truly scary images on the back screen. There is a good idea that the scriptwriter has already embedded the nitwit script, which allows the audience to not be able to truly indulge in action scenes and pay attention to any characters. The director is a pedestrian and will emphasize that the script is not good, rather than helping improve. I've seen "Sound Production Productions" that are a lot of fun before. But this is not one of them All this makes you impressed with the more elegant Scott / Boetticher movie. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is a tan. Cut and shine a million dollars around. He is always happy ... even in the worst movies. In addition to Scott, another main reason I want to watch this movie is because I enjoy Ms. Wymore in Errol Flynn's movie "Rocky Mountian" in "Man Behind the Gun". She is beautiful and you can tell. That she is a good actor But she was forced to say something that looked boring and the block that the director received was really scary. I only saw Phil Carey in "Operation Pacific" and he played the same character here ... The pain in the butt that you want to overcome is unconscious. I think it proves that he is a good actor ... He makes me hate him. In my opinion, there are times when I feel relief at comic relief. Although there are many elements that must be tapped, I must say that I found myself enjoying two Spanish songs sung in musical numbers ... but that is not the reason we went to watch Randolph Scott. <br /> <br /> There's a worse Scottish movie, and this film can't stand it. But it cannot be overlooked
