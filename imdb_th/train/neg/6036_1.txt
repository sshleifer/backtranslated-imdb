Starring an unknown actor who seems to remain that way "This movie" is another dab that surprised me that this story was released. I have no problem with the horrors and especially slapstick. In fact, they are my favorites. But when they do this BAD, it takes real monkeys and it's not surprising that it has a difficult time. The story is as old and as imaginable as possible with many people in the cabin in the forest that has been hacked and hacked by zombies / ghosts. The house serves to control the quality and the horrible soundtrack. No need to mention laughing effects and creating incredibly lazy movies - these mental retardants are outside in clear daylight hours. What is the director thinking about this movement? What, he only had one day to shoot all this in? Is he afraid of the dark? (Hilariously seeing the police walking around in a pure daylight with a flashlight that is as black as it is) At least they might have escaped from this movie without being noticed. I'm sure one of the "teens" plays bingo in a local pub - but she is 40-45. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's good for laughs. But it is a waste of time for movies and times
