This movie is not made by anyone who fans. The best time that fans will be waiting in the mix is ​​Tommy. Half an hour will be missed or simpler: on Christmas Day, they don't show Daltry's scream after the line " Tommy doesn't know what day is today .. They show that almost none of Townsend's guitar images in the Pinball wizard have too many crowd shots in the best moments of Go to the Mirror and that Yay Most of all in the second half, we did not reach you), they robbed us almost every shot of the guitar chords of Pete obvious. The large movie was shot from the back of the band. It is a very appealing movie and does not deliver products. I don't know if director Murry Lerner is not just a fan or worse for him, at least if he * is * who is a girlfriend and this is an eight * camera * that can be delivered to him. Its credit has a number that is hard to find before Tommy, including some who like to shoot very well and sometimes the editing is great. This may be enough to make some viewers happy as long as you don't expect Tommy. The overall sound is moderate in the signal I watch from DirecTV; May vary in video or DVD
