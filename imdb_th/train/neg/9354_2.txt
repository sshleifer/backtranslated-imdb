There are important aspects of the movie that Jobson seems to have forgotten - it has the ability to tell the story by showing you. You don't have to tell the audience what to think because they will see The action here is interspersed with the most unsuspecting public narrative - the purple prose of the fifth past. And it is not necessary because it is a good character here. Perhaps Jobbo feels that the basic story needs a little support. And he may be right. It lacks basic credibility: the 70s. Edinburgh was not full of young women with beautiful brains and like underground velvet. From clothes that look neat and new, too, that the characters wear with the thought of tricking the neck that tries to connect it together. It's what I want.
