Special during the December holidays, such as traditional Frosty, should be produced with quality music and useful stories. They should experience the mysterious magic of the holiday. Basically, they should have a sound style and feeling ... good "special" and they should have a proper and proper December holiday description. <br /> <br /> So when I saw Legend of Frosty the Snowman on TV. List me for my children (6 and 8). Pump to tell the original Frosty story and show how much I enjoy being a child. While my wife and children cozied up on the couch to watch movies, high expectations, but 10 minutes in there, my children were yawning and my wife and I and I gave each other "look" and rolled our eyes after 35 minutes, my children are really asked to go to bed - I think they are bored with languages ​​that don't feel and don't have any parts. In fact, I'm embarrassed about their disappointment (and my) with this movie. <br / > <br /> Unfortunately, the Legend of Frosty the Snowman is like a bad scene of a rather strange parents, Sponge Bob, rather than a classic holiday movie. Don't understand me wrong ... those items are good and I like them as much as the next guy. But when I watched a somewhat strange parents or sponge Bob, my low expectations (For medium color outside the idea center Now dazed) Always satisfied. <br /> <br /> We picked out a good book and spent the rest of the evening reading together. Better choice than the infamous Legend of Frosty the Snowman.
