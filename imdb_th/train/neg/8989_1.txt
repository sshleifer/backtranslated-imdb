There are some good things about movies. Great music and movies Alex Wilson is hot and Ryan Bauer's great performances are also hot. The production is very lucky to drive them because they value the film production. Jonny Vincent (Sean) and a lot of boys in movies that aren't talking too cute. Why did the actress who played Amy not appear on the credit? Brandon Alexander gave a great comedy as Clitarissa Pink. <br /> <br /> The worse thing about the movie seems to be the star James Townsend. He can't do anything He looks very skinny, doesn't look good at all. His arms are like spaghetti. It's disgusting They have no muscles at all. No wonder he had to create his own movie. No one else will make him fall in trouble. <br /> <br /> James Townsend is unbelievable that someone who has a girlfriend because he is gay They should take others as leaders if they want the best for movies. Then again, he might want to use this movie as a vehicle to start a career in softcore pornography. But not the actual performance because he will learn to perform In addition, anyone who has made a porn movie is blacklisted in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous thing in this movie is the selection of a latina latina as a mother of Devon. Sonja Fisher doesn't look like an actor. Overall, this movie is a soft-core porn movie and is no better than what you see in Skinemax. I think even Alex Wilson is probably the best thing about this movie, it's an embarrassing story. And don't want to relate to it There are no pictures on his IMDb page and there are no other items, so Alex Wilson should be a disposable name. In addition, I recently met him in West Hollywood recently and when I talked about this film, he turned and walked away. I understand. If I had worked in this movie, I would Would be embarrassed and not wanting to be involved with it as well
