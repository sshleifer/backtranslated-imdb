The thing that most viewers will remember is the bad headaches that the movie gave to them due to the flashy, camera shake and fast and confusing cuts. I didn't resist those stylistic devices if they were correct, such as Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh. Prove with most of their movies. But in this case there are too many ways It looks like skipping and flashing lights that come with every flight around the city of Mexico and every important scene is there to divert your attention from realizing that this is quite thin and that all things are very predictable. The greatest disappointment lies in the fact that you can understand how all things will end. For movies that pretend to be violent, brutal, and immoral, it is forgiving that the story has been told many times and has more depth and character development. That is another disappointing aspect of the movie. If I want to watch popular action movies, I don't need any reason, but this movie tries to prove the fun of Denzel Washington's character and fails to perform a convincing performance. The first half, or about the first half hour, was nothing more than that, except that the stupid archetypes and clich√©s were transmitted and when the action began to roll, it was cut so quickly that you didn't know what had happened Therefore, movies cannot work in both drama and thriller levels or in action movies. Of course, this movie was not so bad last year, some people are confused. But I can't understand why many people claim that this movie is fresh and cool. For video clips it is too long and for movies there is too little content.
