The only reason I didn't give this score is that Sibrel shows that he has expertise in film making techniques. It is a movie with technical expertise. <br /> <br /> This has been said to be a film made of lies and distortions that are quite easily proven. Most documentaries take time by using propaganda techniques to beat the program, rather than the reality. Sibrel's "irrefutable proof" that counterfeiting platforms is easily debated if you know anything about the orbital mechanism. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend watching this thing. Your curiosity
