I know that this movie should be terrible. It's funny. So I entered that expectation. I just found it so bad that it was very boring. A fun theme song is a joke for about 10 seconds until you know there's nothing wise about it except deliberately annoying qualities. When seeing things that happen to the tomatoes, they will be aged in about 30 seconds. There is nothing wise or funny about movies except the location. It may be funny for 3-4 minutes, but this is not just a feature film with many imagination.
