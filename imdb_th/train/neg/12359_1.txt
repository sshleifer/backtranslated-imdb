I think this is a really scary movie - I found myself shouting at the TV a few times. One or both of them leads to being gay as a mistake; There is no chemical reaction between them and Richard Ruccolo. It seems that he wants to kiss the dog. This film covers their long and painful courtship by focusing on rest and makeup. But did not develop any reason in detail. These reasons would make the characters interesting, not fight or make-up scenes on the bed (Lame even if you like movies) <br /> <br /> Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine as their characters. Does not make movies worth the rental, save money.
