I don't know why I spent the time to check out the movie that was broken at this time. If you stick with it long enough to hope for a satisfactory conclusion? Good, bad or surprising ?? Do not, in the end it will disappear after a rigorous conversation, predictable formulas and performances. The scene in the building is very bright. You think that if the camera is zoomed out for a millimeter, you will see klieg light, costume, dress, and set of flour, pressed and flawless. Should we imagine people living like that in the early 20th century of Arizona? The comparison of Sam Peckinpah's other opinions is insulting Peckinpah. At least the director will use violence in the context of chaos. The blood of a hardened man is an unreasonable blow from the imitation of the bad guy's manicure with beautifully decorated hands ?!? I can believe that Heston thinks he might do something valuable to this movie. (He will grab the gun in the cold hand) but Bern? I will not guess why he applied for this imitation. Want to see a movie about the end of the west as we know it? The end of the West as we know it. See SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN again. LAST HARD MEN is a mockery of the bad news in the west.
