Dee Dee is as good as version 1 of John Carpenter released in "Masters of Horror". This is the opposite. Of course, he proved that he was still the head of horror with "Cigarette Burns", but "Pro-Life" may be the worst thing I have ever seen from him. <br /> <br /> It's stupid. atmosphere Welcome even if it takes less than an hour The script is ridiculous, the characters are frustrating and unattractive, and the conclusion is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> For those who really buy DVDs (one of them is me); Do you see how Carpenter described this film? He was really proud of him and he said that it was his best work for a long time and he appreciated the script. And in the criticism that he noticed the obvious screw which made it to the end, he just said he didn't feel the need to correct the mistake and he let it be there I was afraid that the old boss had completely lost his touch. I sincerely hope that I will be proven wrong. <br /> <br /> I want to leave a positive note and mention that wonderful creatures, but technically, this movie is a movie that Has been the number one popularity with powerful lighting and makeup effects
