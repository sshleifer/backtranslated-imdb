To be honest, I was surprised with the positive votes that this film received. The film took 81 minutes of life and the audience suffered all the way. Actually, there are some good times in this movie. Charlie Spradling gives good performance. She received a pathetic dialogue and she managed well. Scott Valentine (Merritt's girlfriend in Family Ties), in contrast, is a rough watch. I guess the highlight of his performance is to see men wearing tiger pajamas. Valentine also shows the horrifying and pathetic images of the suffering vampires who missed that day. (To see the credible interpretations of the tortured vampires, see Denice Duff in "Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4"). The movie moves very slowly and is separated only by positive, and to be honest, Charlie Spradling's dance scene. Charlie Spradling's only dead (which I am and I still have time to look at!)
