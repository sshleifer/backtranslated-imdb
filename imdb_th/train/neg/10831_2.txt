I guess this director / writer has something to say. Let's see what it's going to be ... A creepy frog storm. I ask people like Tom Cruise to say "C" many times and it looks like Patrick Rafter isn't good? Chuck my wife and take her to say "F" every 2 seconds. Also, I like the beginning and the frog storm. The rest is a constant failure for too long. Glad you, many people enjoy it! <br /> <br />
