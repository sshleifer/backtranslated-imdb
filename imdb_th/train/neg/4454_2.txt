First of all, the background; I am a British and live in London all my life. I've been to many games at 'The Den' and other clubs in London. I'm familiar with the type of person who has been rogue and I know how they act and how they speak. Must say that this is a movie that is bad and bad I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies I've ever seen. I spend most of my time watching movies with shame. I feel that I should write a short review because I feel I have to point out the little things. <br /> <br /> a) People don't say that in London in real life. The creator uses all the slang things too far and makes them look stupid. Unfortunately there is Huligan. But the person you see in Green Street is like a parody. B) The actor playing Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) Unfortunately, listening to 'English' or 'Cockney' in Osama Bin Laden, he came from the north in Newcastle and I'm just surprised that there are other actors who can show his face straight to him - should we take him seriously? Why don't they just But taking someone from East London to play that role is beyond me. I can do 'a bang up job' by myself. Hehe c) Mr Frodo. I mean, how can I expect to be serious? Elijah Woo Kicking his ass twice as much as he is Actually, it is difficult to watch this movie. I'm pretty sure this movie will explode here in the UK. It may be a little better in the United States because Americans do not know (or are interested in) that it is wrong. <br /> <br /> Please, my American friends and foreigners do not believe nonsense. This actually exists But all that is underground and extremely quiet and has a much smaller size This movie received just 2 from me because they filmed some stories in London. They often try to shoot these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something and expect all of us not to notice.
