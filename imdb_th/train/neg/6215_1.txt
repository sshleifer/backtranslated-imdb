This is really a waste of time ... This movie has a weak story. The story breaks into pieces and ends abruptly with many vulnerabilities .... Even if the animation is top notch. <br /> When the movie begins, I try to benefit the question by telling myself that it might be interesting later. But it never repeats This same plot is played over and over again. But what makes it worse is the big plot hole, the whole story about how to kill baddies ... Writers can do more with all the concepts. That he or she does not have their heart and wants to close the movie as soon as it starts. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's too much hype but can't deliver
