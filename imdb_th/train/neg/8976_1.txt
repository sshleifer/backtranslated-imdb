The first point that calls attention to "Forever Mozart" is the lack of a plot summary in IMDB. The explanation is simple, since there are no stories, movies, stories, or anything that may remind the film's minimum structure. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most exaggerated and pretentious directors in the film industry and this ridiculous nonsense is one His most mysterious movie I believe that he himself does not understand what is about; But there are intellectuals who explain the reason or explain this messy movie and it's a joke to read their reviews. <br /> <br /> My score is one. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil ): "Para Semper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
