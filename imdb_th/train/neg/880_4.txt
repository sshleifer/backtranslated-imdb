Garson Kanin wrote and directed at "Modern Day" Las Vegas and the gap between the models, which is his first attempt since 1940! David Janssen is quite confused as the owner of a large casino that reunited with his son again ( Robert Drivas, who seems disconcerting like the old Jason Bateman) Janssen approached every scene in the same way: with chip protection on his shoulder. Playing this role is cool and relaxing, is too much request from Janssen who barks with everyone like a disgruntled husband. (He also chewed Don Rickles and made him cry!) His son never did a good job of finding his identity, making hip comments about how young people look down at Vegas. (For them for another ten years) and the disapproval of his father's life caused friction. Brenda Vaccaro was cute as a secretary and Edy Willaims had fun as an audition actress. Unfortunately, "Where It At At" does not have anything more than the current uprising about the ethics between adults and their children. The rapid T&A shooting and satire in the world of gambling - most of which Protected by now, nausea. Advertising ** from ****
