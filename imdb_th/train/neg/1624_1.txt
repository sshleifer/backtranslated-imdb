I saw this movie a couple of years ago. I can't sleep and nothing happens. So I watched it What makes me really is that it is unreasonable and that is why it interferes. Richard was tied with Cock wire and Jarvis began to do with Richard's woman while she was unconscious. Then Jarvis's friend, Troubador, was playing a silly song on his guitar. The next morning it shows Richard's woman talking to Jarvis and Trouby. She then returns to Richard and looks at him as he continues to tie Then they played happy music and the movie ended. I mean what happened? Are they braking? And what are you saying to these 2 men (Trouby and Jarvis)? It puzzled and broke away. I can't stand watching movies that are annoying and unreasonable. This is the worst movie I've ever seen since the 90's version of Lord of the Flies.
