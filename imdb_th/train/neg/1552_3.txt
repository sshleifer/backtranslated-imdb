This movie is very well advertised. I am a person who likes to watch movies and see examples of this movie for many months. While I was quite skeptical of how funny this movie would be, my friends thought it would be great and made me excited about it. Then I went and saw it. I was sunk in my seat almost asleep until I remembered that I had paid for this film. I make myself laughing with things in the movie the most, so I won't feel bad and destroy the good emotions I have, including I want to make my money more valuable than movies! I often go into a movie with an open mind, not trying to enter them with too much expectation. But this movie is not funny. Now it's not the worst movie I've ever seen. But it's worth it to wait for HBO. If you've never seen this movie trailer before or you like slow and repetitive comedies, you may enjoy it. But for comedians, Id really might try. Kings of Comedy again, there is something telling me to meet parents instead !!!
