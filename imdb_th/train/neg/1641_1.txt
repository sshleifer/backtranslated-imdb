This movie is not a joke. It's not fun. It doesn't have the originality or intelligence for one second and it doesn't make you interested in the characters or just a little situation. Add to it that it is about children and youth. Movies are nothing in recent memory. As if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school students who had never met or had a relationship with a girl of any kind, sat down and wrote a movie from the wrong imagination about what an adult would be. This story is boring, disgusting and disgusting, and sometimes it is disgusting and disgusting. Very much. It has one or two moments that make you laugh. In addition, it seems twice as long as 85 minutes of usage time.
