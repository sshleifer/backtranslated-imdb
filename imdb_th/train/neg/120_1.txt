When I saw the first glimpse of the film, I noticed the actor playing the role of Lucille Ball quickly. Rachel's image of Lucy is extremely scary. Lucille Ball is an amazing comedian with incredible abilities. If you think of a legend like Lucille Ball that shows you how she is in this movie, it's very scary. I can't believe in all the actresses in the world who can play Lucy better. Producers decide to get Rachel York. She may be a good actor in other roles. But playing the role of Lucille Ball is difficult. It is quite difficult to find people who are similar to Lucille Ball, but at least they can find people with similar looks and talents. If you notice the image of York's Lucy in the episode of I Love Lucy, like a chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin There's nothing like showing her pronunciation or movement. <br /> <br /> Going to the highest point. Pino plays Arnaz. Desi is terrible. Pino has no qualification to play. As Ricky, he is small and slim. Actually, and his performance was unbelievable again. Although Fred and Ethel are not the same But it's not as bad as Lucy's and Ricky's drama. <br /> <br /> Overall, the actors are extremely scary. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I recommend watching Lucy and Desi's A&E biography. Read the book from Lucille Ball yourself or PBS 'American Masters: Search Lucy if you want to see the documentary. "Before the laughter" will be a better option. Selection of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before the Laughter" is much better compared to this. At least there are more similar images than nothing.
