Buck's role as The Kahn reminds Bob Barker (from The Price is right) is the same country that he performed. But there are many more to laugh. Kurt Thomas is a "hero" who has to face the baby, showing some acrobatic skills. But does not show any talent. There are a few terrifying moments (in most Crazies villages) and the martial arts sequence is mildly impressive, but the "ninja" movie that gets more entertainment And you will not feel guilty of laughing
