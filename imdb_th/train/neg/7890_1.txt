So sad that there is no option to post a lower mark. 1 I watched this nonsense and hardly believed what I watched. Every part of the movie is terrible. Music, acting, direction, story, everything, everything I found myself laughing loudly at various points in the movie. I liked the bit that our hero rushed through the hospital with slow, soft focus movements and knocked the clipboard out of the nurse's hand because ............. Just because. Product placement? Cross (crucifixion) everywhere. If you are a Christian that is very reliable and satisfying, you may like this movie. If you like this movie, you have to go out more.
