REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES (2 outta 5 stars) No, this is not an ancestor who disappeared with George A. Romero, a classic zombie. This is a cheap potboiler from 1936 which may look cool for the audience at that time ... but it seems to be a routine today. Actually, there was a fairly good scene when the soldiers began to shoot his pistol to a nearby zombie swarm ... and a close-range projectile came in one of the bare breasts. The results seem fake today, but in 1936 I was sure that the audience had gaped. The story involves finding the secret of mind control ... obviously to create an unstoppable zombie army ... but later is the way in which one character wins the girl he loves. This movie took almost an hour. But moving slowly so it looks like the length of the movie. Believe me! There is not much to suggest ... You may get fun from shooting in a studio that pretends to be a star "Wade" through "Overflow". An interesting ending ... So I will say that this movie. Worth watching at least once More than likely you will see that it is a special feature in the collection of "4 movies per 1 DVD", cheap at Wal-Mart for five dollars. Hey, it's worth the money ...
