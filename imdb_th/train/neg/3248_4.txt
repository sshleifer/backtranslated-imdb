Why am I going to watch this movie? Honestly, because Jim Carrey is in there, and in the past he made a hilarious movie that made me cry with laughter, so you really blame me for expecting again? In addition, the location of the comedy trailer, Jennifer Aniston's involvement and the fact that it is a popular movie that motivates me. <br /> <br /> However, while My "one line summary" shows me that I'm disappointed. For various reasons, <br /> <br /> Reason 1: It's not funny in my 2-hour movie. I laughed about 5-10 minutes ... too. All the time I rest "I should really get ice cream." I agree that it might be wrong to judge Jim Carrey in his previous movie. But what he really expected when he created Gem, such as 'The Truman Show', 'Liar Liar', 'Me, Myself and Irene', 'Dumb and Dumber', 'The Mask' and the movie 'Ace Ventura' created in Bruce Nolan's speech, like an ordinary movie? <br /> <br /> Reason 2: The role of Jennifer Aniston is written by criminals. I mean hello! She is now in the public eye for about ten years and in this film she will say about four wrong lines. <br /> <br /> Reason 3: One word - Clich√© <br /> <br /> Reason 4: Temporary adaptation of a particular American reference - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite 'Sweep the Week' - is a clue. This film attracted the attention of growers in particular. "Teenagers say they don't take drugs and yes, education - that's a miracle! Want to see miracles soon? It is a miracle! "God told Bruce, which is a heavy confidence that seems to be practiced in the United States. But may face severe resistance in the market that still has ink problems for sensitive In addition, I went to school and the statement pointed out that I and all my friends were miracles ... or maybe it meant that we had brains. <br /> <br /> In this movie there were moments. That is funny enough that Carrey makes you laugh and prevent Bruce Almighty from becoming a total disaster. But you should start to review your expectations lower
