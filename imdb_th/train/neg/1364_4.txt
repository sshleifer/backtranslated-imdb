The more I miss it, the more there is nothing to redeem about the movie. <br /> <br /> This I saw it 9 months ago, so my memories may make it worse. <br /> <br /> But I know that at least as bad as 4 from <br /> <br /> 10 <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I met the director. He looked ridiculous. <br /> < br /> like what he does or what he does and as far as me <br /> <br /> can tell that he doesn't care about the movie this Although he agreed that he <br /> <br /> didn't really know what he was doing and he was forced to do something because it was digitally filmed. <br /> <br /> I feel that the movie tries hard to adapt to the formulas <br /> <br /> created for myself: "9 people all have to be connected in some way. <br /> <br /> We will receive from the point 'A' to the point 'B' "So in order from the whore <br /> <br /> at Seeing in the beginning and coming back to you at the end of them 10 <br /> <br /> Minutes for each character's relationship with other people. <br /> <br /> Make people feel choked. By 2 dimensions, pulling the character <br /> <br /> not good <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I just thought of part of the movie redemption .. <br /> Steve <br /> Bouchemi has a scene that is amazing. That's it. <br /> <br /> Say ... 4 out of 10
