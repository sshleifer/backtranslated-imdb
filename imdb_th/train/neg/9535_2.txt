Believe it or not, this movie is worse than the third, slower than the show, and the story is very weak. It's not good to talk about this movie. The fight scenes are more boring. Number three and I think that is impossible. This is 90 minutes. Very slow. Actually, I stick it through. Hopefully it will be better. If you want to watch this movie, you should try to find. It's quite rare (For the purchase, that is) and probably because of good reasons, such as the number three, this movie is not related to the first two, it is the same in name only. I can best give the best: no warning is 2/10
