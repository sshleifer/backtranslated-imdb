I really came into this movie. I wanted to line up. I think the place has a lot of potential and is ripe for interesting movies. Don't understand me wrong here. I don't expect Citizen Kane. I will do this to watch the movie B that says it still lacks expectations The historical aspect of the story is glazed and the ending makes me a little cold. The performances in this film are made of wood. Overall, I give 4 points for a good idea. But movies may have a much higher score, with a focus on basic movie creation. Is it worth watching? I don't want two hours earlier. But I don't know how to recommend to others
