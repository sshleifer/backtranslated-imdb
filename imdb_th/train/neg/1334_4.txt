So I finally saw the movie "My left foot" last night after my mother was told that it was amazing ... Day-Lewis's central performance was amazing and amazing. The job should not expect anything. <br /> <br /> A serious mistake in my eyes is obsessed with proving the normality of this man. This film chose to show him that it was the most complete and jerky person. On the other side, I can see that this is a logical relationship; Humanity has the ability to be disgusted and disability should not be concealed. I just hope that the unbiased audience will not forgive the unusual behavior and think that the situation will automatically forgive. They can't Performances are normal and yes, disabled people do the job - but they do not because of the disabled. They do because they have no reason. Physical disability does not give you the right to throw the right in public, just because the person you love makes you disappointed. <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not wise to do, whether you are disabled or Can -bodied to someone who is implicitly allowed to boot the football directly to your head for the purpose of installing alone as one of them. (Accepted I used to record blame from the school's star striker with my face. But I belong to it and it is not accepted). Participation in the bar controversy is another. The revelation of the fact that your father expanded your friendship with you after you've proven yourself able to jump over the physical loop. All these things are stupid and suffering through them as a way to show your courage, not making them less stupid. <br /> <br /> So yes; Just because you overcame obstacles to get great things, don't make you jerk less ... Being good is important. Inspiring sample settings for the disabled should appear in the list.
