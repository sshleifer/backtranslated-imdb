I like insect killer movies that are fun to watch. I have to watch this movie because it's one of my favorite horror books by Shaun Hutson. <br /> <br /> I met him and I hope I listen. He, while this movie is terrible, as he said after he said that I was still dead to see how bad it was. <br /> <br /> Story: People are dying mysteriously and horribly and without Who has a clue What is the cause? <br /> <br /> Only health officials only. Mike Brady has a possible solution. But the killer's theory was laughed at by the staff. <br /> <br /> When the body starts to count only More and more ammunition experts from England began to spy around or did not start to look like Mike had the right idea. <br /> <br /> This movie is a movie that has been used too much you have seen In the movie! Slamming in this film fast (usually) and it looks like they are fast forwarding the scene! <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing like this book. This book is ten times more scary, full of blood, ten times and more. <br /> <br /> I don't like movies. This story! While I'm a big fan of Slugs, the book and the second book named Breeding Ground! Both books are excellent. <br /> <br /> Read the book and watch the movie. You may like it more then I give it out. 2 10
