I have a 'guts' that will let you know, please stay away from the' Dahmer 'biographical movie according to the real-life story of a serial killer that fearsome `Dahmer' more homeless in relation to the idea of ​​a focused story. Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed more than 15 young men and ate a portion of their body, probably the most inconsistent serial killer of our generation. However, the real patient is the filmmaker of this terrifying phenomenon that should be examined before deciding to change to this horrible "dahm" project. This is not an easy movie, although Jeffrey is easily digested with some appetizers like "brain" or even real life. Potato movie * failed.
