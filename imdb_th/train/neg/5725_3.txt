2005 gave us a very good "Gore Porn" hostel and in 2006 gave us a live feed. The hostel is not good. Live Feed will follow the same formula as Eli Roth's previous movie, except at this time, stupid children in Asia than in Central Europe. The plot focuses on these stupid children and one of them has created a nuisance for one villager, so they find themselves in trouble. The villagers decided to lock them all in the theater and kill them. Although I have heard bad things about this movie before But I still hope that it might be appropriate for at least half because director Ryan Nicholson has created a rape and revenge movie for '45 minutes'. Obviously, this movie tried to return to the old age of the Grindhouse cinema (which the hostel had done), but it didn't really come out. Surprisingly, considering Nicholson's previous work with special effects - even impressive blood ... even though it's better than acting! There's nothing more I can say about this movie ... It's not good and it's not a good way. Avoid it!
