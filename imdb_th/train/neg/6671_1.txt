I felt that this movie started well. The show is a point and I feel for the whole character situation, even if the true family unit is not completely revealed. We never received enough information from her father to truly feel his pain for all of his contributions or to create a hatred for Tobe. In another scene he just took off his head. Another problem of this movie is that it doesn't solve and lose all focus at the end, and I ask it to end. All movies that have long and painful content that should not be automatically ranked 7 or higher for the show We are looking at the quality of the entire movie experience. In the case of this movie, the ending is terrible. I seriously thought about just walking out of the theater. This movie pulled me in and threw me out.
