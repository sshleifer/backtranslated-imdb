Going back to Cabin by the Lake, just .... not enough. Must have a very low budget because a number of movies have to be shot with a normal video camera. So in the same scene - you will get a picture of a quality movie camera and a simple video camera. It makes a very strange combination! I think they should find a way to not use some "home video" effects! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth seeing it if you've seen the original CBTL because you can compare and see the difference. But if you haven't seen the original CBTL, you won't want to see it if you see it first! It may seem too magical to be and make you ignore even the original.
