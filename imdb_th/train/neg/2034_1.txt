Really bad. How bad is this movie created? I'm still waiting for an interesting camera reward exchange point, or at least free, but I have nothing. I just watched the Cabin fever and I thought it was a train wreck. (Except nude and pancakes) but looks like a genius compared to this ship's wreck The best screenwriter in the world can't record the stink of stinking crabs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that will happen for this movie is that it will end. <br /> < br /> I'm a headache. Just think about this movie and try to write something. Ugh, I'm glad I paid only $ 5 and soon it will become rubbish.
