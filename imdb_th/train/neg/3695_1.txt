Not the best film of the actor, the director focused on the anticipated actor instead of good entertainment. May be the hero of his own, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it But of course it's not worth it for a neutral audience. The fight scene is all funny. Average music, this film is the biggest failure for actors. In spite of having too many advertisements created in this movie, this movie failed miserably. Don't think of this movement even if you want to kill time. You can watch cartoons instead. Good movies can't digest this shit for 2 1/2 hours.
