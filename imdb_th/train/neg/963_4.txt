'The opportunity to' is a big mistake to see. You can know director Emile Ardolino from 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and should expect something funny from him. But I think I have to let you down. He created a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> As Christopher McDonald died to be a child. The baby grew up. Robert Downey Jr and Jr returned to his hometown where she met his daughter Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated, right?) <br /> <br /> They fell in love. Then the former junior wife Cybill Shepherd and Junior fell in love with her as well. I guess I don't have to mention that she loves Ryan O'Neill. <br /> <br /> In the first role of Robert Downey Jr. in his worst role, he copied Michael J. Fox <br /> <br /> After 'Moonlighting' Shepherd proves that she is not suitable for acting in the movie. <br /> <br /> However, there is one thing that the comedy that doesn't use this story: is a remedy Sleepless
