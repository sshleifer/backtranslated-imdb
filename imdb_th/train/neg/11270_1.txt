I've seen bad movies But this thing took p *** There is no reason and all the characters swear every few seconds. Oh and I think there is a low sperm count. It's a good thing Welshman plays offensive people. The evil English bloke plays a disgusting evil story of paddy and fire that is less than a dim tart. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And some Russian gangsters Oh yes, some people have guns and may talk about junk while the drug is high. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague.
