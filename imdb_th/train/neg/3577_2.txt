The first generation of Pia Zadora vehicles used the familiar Harold Robbins formula: the ambitious main character in decay while walking to the top of the world at random. But even if it is a completely predictable formula But this film was handled at the same time, completely unbelievable. Zadora (calling her without experience as an actor to do charity) never console him as a screenwriter. We expect movies to create movies with in-depth information about their industry and creative processes. But the script did not give her the qualities that made the movie character writer interesting: practice skills with words, relationships, love, hate and their own creative ability. Her character is empty like a donut hole. And this is just a taste of incompetence on the screen here The movie was dark and sometimes difficult to see what had happened. And the scenes never really hang together so everything seems to be a random moment in a Hollywood party.
