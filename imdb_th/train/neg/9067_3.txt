Although I have hope for this movie, especially when I enjoy the performances of Jason Segel (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared), I have to say that it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in the style. Remember the latest (Loser and Dr T and women are on that list too) <br /> <br /> Yes, there are two moments that laugh loudly, even though this movie is much better. The place is not bad, their frauds via the college find their partner when they are discovered by someone who has a proposal for them. The problem is that not all characters are offensive until I don't care about them. The blackmailer (played by talented Jason Schwartzman) is a psychopath who is not funny to watch him - he's not mad at it. Funny or charming way, he is a loser, which is quite dangerous and Not fun to watch Editing this movie is hard to follow - it still has a cut between fantasy and reality and it is often unclear which is what The fraud of two or three gangs was actually shown. You have to accept with the belief that they are really fraudsters - showing their outline should make the movie better. A love story that is called ridiculous and unbelievable. Actually, it's a silly story and bad writing and directing. I can talk about the shortcomings of the movie. But you will get ideas Not worth the $ 4 rent or the gas fee to drive to and from the movie rental shop!
