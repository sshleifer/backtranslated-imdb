... and the way they bore you away from your mind! Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD movies from the 70s, made with no actors of any record, embarrassing scripts, bad directions and tireless desire to fuse "horror" with light comedy. This film introduces paleontologists who find paintings of dinosaurs under water, crater lakes ... Meteor falls from the sky and dinosaurs, aquatic animals of a variety of clay. Begin stalking and eating people around Crater Lake. All matters are taken care of by our local sheriff. Most movies - when not showing the remaining blood from what we think should be an animal restaurant - spend time with the comedy of two people, Arnie and Mitch, who rent a boat. They tried very well to joke that we received the call, like looking at the business label. Mitch spoke to Arnie, "You spelled the victim wrong. It spelled B-A-T-E." Laughter is quite rare here. Then we saw them drunk and imagine that the tree trunk was a dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy Beware! Fake dinosaurs But this movie is fun And at least the lake is beautiful
