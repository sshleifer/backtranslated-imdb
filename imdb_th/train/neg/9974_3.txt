I have to admit that I stick to this one on the US network. There is just something about the true folly of this flick which makes me want to watch whenever it is turned on. Yes, you were right about the sub-show, the plot that is only seven years old, will like etc. But I can't feel sympathetic to some actors Then again, some of these actors registered for the sequels that were even more cruel.
