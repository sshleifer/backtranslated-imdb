This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Someone left the theater, others slept. (Okay, it's a late night performance) ... This is a movie that has no reason for one who can make you don't want to see the main picture again. I like to watch the creation of this movie because I am interested in what is in the minds of these junk authors. They laughed when they created all this ridiculous things or did they think they were doing interesting things? I wonder if ... the soundtrack is scary, apart from some devices that remind you of the previous Bjork album. Even if you're a Bjork fan at home, it's the best thing to do. A small piece of melodious music that has no reason for you to go out and send you into this torture. God! ...
