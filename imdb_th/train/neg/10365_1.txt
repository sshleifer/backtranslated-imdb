Scary. This thriller should be buried. What is a scrap? The writing is terrible, the character is less than the horrible Schlock belief !! B-star stars in the POS are written intensely to try and give a little credit. But it failed miserably If I don't have to write ten lines about this movie, I'll give a review of the words that it starts with 'sh' and ends with 'it'. <br /> <br /> The horrible ending is delayed Who wrote this shit The ending of this movie is very weak, as if they didn't know what to do with this story or they had run out of money. It is most likely due to the number of pendants in this movie. It's good that these actors are going to leave because this will be a killer career. Good thing for them that hardly anyone sees it. At least no one is as important as investors in the future. It may end up in thousands of different ways. But as it is, I feel that I have been outside my precious time. <br /> <br /> Do not mess with this thing.
