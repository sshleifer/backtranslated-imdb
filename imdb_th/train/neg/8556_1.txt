OK, I like the idea of ​​this movie. I am in the population age group, and I distinguish some stories. Even tacky and meaningless conversations sometimes seem semi-real, and in other films may be forgotten. <br /> <br /> I try as hard as I can to avoid the garbage in this movie. Others do It's not easy when filmmakers don't try. <br /> <br /> The editing in this movie is terrible! May be the worst fix I've ever seen in a movie! There are many things that you don't have to go to study at a movie school to learn a good solution, not one of them. But identifying the bad thing is <br /> <br /> and the picture ... Oh my God is a big match! I can't tell the details. But sometimes we see the random things that emerge and the connection with the fix will give you the most painful movie viewing experience. <br /> <br /> This movie is creating With a low budget or none at all with 4 actors and teams, it's not an excuse as well. I've watched a short movie on youtube that has more artistic perfection! Joe Gereta, I don't know what you think. But this movie is not easy for you. You should be ashamed of yourself! In conclusion, this movie is like an amateur porn movie that is really lazy if it's filled with 3 or 4 sex scenes that are separated by a long boring conversation and a nasty orgasm scene. If not what you want, avoid this!
