Not that I was really surprised .... The movie was never as good as the books they had originated from. I am looking forward to watching this movie because it is one of my favorite books, even though I know it might suck. I hope to be surprised However, they lost their way from the story of the book too much and the movie version didn't say how terrible this house was. The ending is different. Lara Flynn looks terrible due to bad cosmetic surgery. The show doesn't have the best meaning. Maybe if there is a drama version created so that they don't have to be in the box "Made for TV movie" of Lifetime. It will be a better flick. If you see this movie, I suggest you follow this book and read it. I wonder if you will be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as I do every time I read it.
