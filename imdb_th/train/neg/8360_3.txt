There's something like this movie. <br /> <br /> It's color! <br /> <br /> There are impressive underwater photos! <br /> <br /> There's a rhythmic music score in the background that works well all the time! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes music is accelerated! Especially when sharks or baddies are moving in! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's slow! As if to convey to the audience, it is about time for compassion! <br /> <br /> Another person bites the dust! As if in the "spagetti Western", this thing is very similar! <br /> <br /> It's not that the Italians can't produce quality work!

But alas, you won't find it here !!! <br /> <br /> I think it was built around 1960! Sadly, it's 20 years old, as seen from the scene of the funeral near the end! <br /> <br /> Then there is a sharp bite of a fast shark that repeatedly causes red dust in the blue waters! <br /> <br /> In the midst of everything, whether it's a quarrel in the bar room, or in observing the latest blood-demolition by the hungry hungry sharks, the hero's friends look through the little glasses of He as if He was tired of his relentless role amidst the lack of evidence in planning or developing anybody's character! <br /> <br /> At least the hero indicates a quick concern for his ex-wife! <br /> <br /> But of course, even if the song fails to make us wake up, we hear the horrific sound in the voice of the bad person, as if to nudge us to see that other dark acts are going to happen. up! <br /> <br /> and near the end When we think it's all predictable! But keeping track of people for you might find another twist! If you are watching closely! So more or less warm your heart! <br /> <br /> Follow the hero's advice and drink beer at the same time! It will make your "Night of the Sharks" more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> You will be ready for something like the movie "007" to help you return to reality when this story ends !!!
