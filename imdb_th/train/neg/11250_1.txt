I like the moment I like the effort. But watching a movie that looks like I'm watching through a Coke bottle causes me a headache. If I play an unclear computer game and do not focus, I will upgrade my computer. It may be that this is the look that the director has taken. But it doesn't hurt and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I didn't take someone with me in this movie, I went out there. Although it is a series and not a movie for speech, Band of Brothers has done this successfully. They made it look like World War II images, just touching the grainy, but it was also a pleasure to watch. Movies need real people with real scenes and places to actually use CGI when appropriate, not for the whole movie.
