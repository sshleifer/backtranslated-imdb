The only redeeming quality of this great melodrama is the view of the south of France and the sound of Nana Mascouri singing songs. Stephanie Power is someone else and betrayed by a fake accent. As mentioned above, she is too old to play for 18 years and looks too young to be a grandmother and granddaughter of a college age. Lee Remick is a good person, even though she is emotionless. Still under active and can still look young forever when Robert Rich (Her middle-aged son) is married to Grandma Stephanie Powers. Finally, Stacey Keach's incessant arrogance makes you wonder what these women see in him. Do not know how the audience is related to his excessive depiction. Ian Richardson gave the most reliable performance that made the rest of the actors look like professional players. It is a provocation to believe that the handsome man in this epic will remain unmarried while they are patiently waiting for the love that will eventually allow them to accept. Who can believe that the handsome Robert Urich will remain unmarried for decades, waiting for Stephanie's power to accept his endless marriage proposal? WW2 participation between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is ridiculous. To begin with, the Germans did not occupy the French Provence until the end of the war. It was controlled by the French Vichy puppet government. We saw the French resistance showing a daytime attack on Mistral's villa to steal the plate after they all sat under the bridge to wait for the Nazi soldiers' trucks to surprise and destroy them. If you want to see a series of mini-series that have good results overseas, don't see Mistral's Daughter. The better option is The Thorn Birds.
