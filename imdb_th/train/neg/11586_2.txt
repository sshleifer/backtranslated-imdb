A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. No escape I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character in horror. But even though I am a fan, I can't help but watch this movie as normal Now they just give up They didn't try They are the producers. Of course, hoping to get a little more money. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't attract your attention. It's so easy to almost disappear. <br /> <br /> Alice, the survivor of Episode 4, is pregnant. Freddie comes back to the baby's dream. At first we learned to stop him. Alice had to meet his mother. And that is it. <br /> <br /> The story progresses slowly as there is a little plot, which means it's boring after passing bad conversations and scary performances. In fact, it is only a terrible thing. Acting due to death is not even great. <br /> <br /> The characters aren't interesting until we don't care about them. br /> They don't look as interesting as they can. Both actors reminded me of a bad amateur theater group. I saw better actors in school plays. It's really embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox can still bring the class to this. She is beautiful, sexy and has special abilities. But the content doesn't let her shine Unfortunately, <br /> <br /> Stephen Hopkins' work is close to the great direction of Renny Harlin in the Dream Master. He tried to shoot imaginary pictures near the end. But the tensions that Harlin and Krawen created well in the previous movie could not be found. <br /> <br /> The dream of a child. br /> <br /> The horrible end of Freddie once It's too sad to see him now.
