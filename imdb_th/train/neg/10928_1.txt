Just saw this movie and something that wasted time This movie is predictable and slow. It is the bad news of Mormons who play basketball sanctioned by the church. Instead of watching this movie, I should have a root canal. The hijacking was clearly driven by support / funding. This film has potential due to the outrageous behavior that Mormons show when they play basketball that is punished in the church The performance was terrible except for Clint Howard and Fred Willard. The appearance of Thurl Bailey in this movie was not necessary.
