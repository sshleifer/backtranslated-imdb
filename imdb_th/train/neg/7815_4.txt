As a big fan of Superman from the comic through the 1950 series, the first two films of Chris Reeves and Lois & Clark and eventually Smallville, I'm * really * hoping for something smart with "Superman Returns". > <br /> Instead of us Lex Lexhor once again tried to convert real estate again. The order of the Superman was attacked while wearing kryptonite and internal inconsistencies: he couldn't stop himself falling in The ocean when attached to a 6 "kryptonite" but when Lois broke out 3 "of it * let the rest buried in him * can he lift * the continent into space? Really, the only hero in this story is the partner of Lois - I can't remember his name. He does things that save lives perfectly, nothing but courage and expertise - no power, no consistency ... a normal human. <br /> <br /> They make Superman small. Much Why don't we have Superman fighting the brainiac or fighting to protect the universe from General Zod instead of Lex's little plan? Oh, I forgot ... They are doing that in Smallville. <br /> <br / > Yes ... I think I will stick Smallville ... <br /> <br /> You should be too ...
