I saw the movie Wooden Allen recently because I was a fan of his work and I wanted to see everything he did, even though this movie review made me expecting a frustrating attempt to them. Right, this is a confusing movie that cannot decide whether it will be a comedy, fantasy, romance or drama about a midlife crisis. It failed all three. <br /> <br /> Alice (Mia Farrow) is a restless middle-aged woman who marries great wealth and brings a life of luxury that is pointless to a boring husband. Their two small children This rather plain planning concept has come to life with the same unbelief as the ancient Chinese folk guardians who made her invisible with some magical herbs and ghosts of past lovers. (Which she flew across Manhattan) If these additional things sound too great for you, then there will be something more boring, such as the story about saxophone players <br /> <br / > I'm not sure about what this messy thing is trying to say. There are only a few funny moments in this movie and the ending is a fascinating touch of Pollyanna. <br /> <br /> Rent 'crime and crime' instead of the movie that has been cooked. Excellent With regard to ethics and morality seriously Or return to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan"
