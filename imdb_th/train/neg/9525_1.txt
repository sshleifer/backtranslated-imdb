This film is boring, ridiculous, ridiculous, devoid of spirit and vain. It is the final proof that the world can forget about Danny Boyle and the movie. "Trainspotting": "The Beach" has taken care of this. Something strange in this low budget, just to maintain his place among those who started well. But completely disappeared in drugs, liquors, ego, narcissism, poor management or anything that led to the director's rapid death. <br /> <br /> The evidence is without Substance: Two losers (Ecclestone and Bimbo, some Jenna G-rappers should) meet by chance and start singing with enthusiasm, similar to a frenzied fugitive - which they become Their friends - those who are even more illiterate - become their managers by smashing shop windows and stealing video cameras which he filmed in "action". Interest in this matter. Garbage. Now I know that the UK in the past few years has left an incredible garbage. But it's ridiculous The song makes the oasis look like The Beatles during the recording of the studio-double-strand - changing the lyrics in every use The song and trash the most, but "actors" it's anti-social; These newcomers should call for shooting. It's too stupid. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> The conversation isn't fun and nowhere, and the story of a rag without a point and no reason. It often feels improvised - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete idiot. This terrible piece of junk that looks embarrassing I.Q of Ecclestone has to be investigated to acknowledge that it is part of this nonsense. Anyone who gives 1,000 pounds, this joke should leave the movie business before ending up selling their own underwear at the corner.
