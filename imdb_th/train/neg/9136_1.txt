When this film began, I was shocked to see that filming using a cheap video camera! In fact, the camera shakes and looks worse than ordinary home movies. Even directly to DVD movies should have a better production cost! Heck, the home video uploaded to YouTube has a better production percentage! Often this movie seems to be created seriously by attaching the camera to the tripod and activating - without a camera! Close-ups and things that are similar to camera work are in some scenes that can be used, and in some scenes there are many close-ups or too low quality. Yecch! <br /> <br /> This movie Is about two gay men who want to get married As if it were built almost a decade ago, their only option is to marry in Vermont - the time has certainly changed. However, accepting the latest gay marriage could not be attributed to this film - if anything, the gay marriage sponsors returned instead of helping a foul movie and never trying to solve the problem seriously. From this film, religious people are stupid in one dimension that carries the Bible everywhere and shoots people, including wives with gay husbands, having a cramped mind when they learn that their spouses are liars. I am glad that it gives an honest opportunity to both sides on this issue! <br /> <br /> The bottom line - there is nothing about this movie that represents professionalism. Even less, I hesitate to call it this movie. It is like a movie in the house, and is not included in the IMDb or included in the Bottom 100 list of the worst ranked movies of all time. The performance is terrible. Writing is bad. The direction (if any) is scary. The camera work is terrible and the storyline is terrible. It's a movie at home !! There is nothing positive that I can say about this in some way, except that it makes Ed Wood's movie seem to be an Oscar rival in comparison, and I'm sure Mr. Dick's ghost smiled every time. Someone looks at this mess! <br /> <br /> I don't care if you are gay or straight - this movie is not worth your time and I don't know how they manage to create a DVD. I suppose an actor burns them on his home computer during their free time! Seriously, this gives a new meaning to the word 'bad'. <br /> <br /> By the way, if a woman in this film is a true lawyer, the ability to read will not necessarily be important. I just say in my heart <br /> <br /> Finally, when gay marriage is an important and serious topic, can we have a better movie? This one is sad, just laughing.
