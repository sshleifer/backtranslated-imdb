In Texas, seven friends meet at the bar to celebrate Halloween night before going to a party. At the same time, they call the American pirate radio Nightmare for fun and confess their greatest fear. The serial killer who is listening to their confession makes their nightmares come true by killing each of them with the means of "American Nightmare". A strange, low-priced movie with a terrifying start: no words Explain before a woman killed two couples in a single camping area, as if it were Friday the 13th. Then the story changed to a bar where seven friends were celebrating Halloween. From now on, the story has a lot of potential, and unknown actors have a very effective performance, showing beautiful breasts and naked figures as always in this type of production. However, at the end of the screenplay, no explanation For killing instincts and motivation for nursing behavior, Jane Toppan feels that the budget ends before the conclusion of the shooting. With a better start and conclusion, this strange story will be a movie with limited budget. My score is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Agonia" ("Agony")
