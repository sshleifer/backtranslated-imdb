I'm afraid that I don't like this movie a lot. In addition to a few dignity, there is nothing to write to the house. <br /> <br /> J-horror has flourished in the last five years. But this film is contained in more than one account, corny and copies of previous successes This is one of them. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a supernatural slasher movie. The beginning of the contract with the cold scene from the morgue where the dead girl had her eyes sewn together. But not long after opening them However, after that it quickly fell for this flick. <br /> <br /> I'll start with what I like about "Gawi". On the positive side, the picture is flashy and the movie looks good for its genre. For those who like horror movies full of murder scenes In addition, we have received a little suspicious order / piece set. <br /> <br /> However, there are a few disadvantages as well ... <br /> <br /> First of all and the important complaint of I'm about This film is a short story and crosses forward and backward through time with shocking violence. Usually that's not a problem for me. But here, where students seem to be the same, no matter how old they are, I'm confused more than once. <br /> <br /> The performance is ok, I can guess (hard to tell when you don't know the language) but look A little too hard And for horror movies I don't think it's scary enough While I'm really boring, <br /> <br /> Being a fan of the giallo movie, I expect from "Nightmare" quite a lot. Unfortunately, I'm very disappointed.
