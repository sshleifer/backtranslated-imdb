Although I don't like being a person who denies the personal taste of others If you like anything, it's good. But this movie is very scary and there is no way around. I don't like Ani Difranco too much, but she is a great guitarist and songwriter that I can accept. But I cannot accept that there is a qualification in exchange for this movie Many people think that it is the correct image of the problem that a high school student may face, but everything is transmitted far beyond reach. There seems to be an attempt at "naked guns" - esque jokes, but when closing, there is too much gap between each actor as if they were laughing (none at all). They tried to cram multiple issues into one movie, almost never developing anything. (Especially the girl who was a naughty teacher) I didn't laugh at all throughout this movie I was too insulted by the effort of humor and satire to do everything except my screen.
