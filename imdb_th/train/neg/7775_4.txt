I'm not familiar with the ending. But watch this movie last night in Showtime The movie looks very well done with the design of the scene and the movie. But the screenplay is full of wood The performance is not quite good, thinking that the two female actors are useful. You never believe what the supporting actors say has a pattern - the Bible - characterized by an implied respect for a little difference, the dictator's captain, the military, the hot head, and so on. Lock it straight to Canada. Telefilm Canada credits. Let me know that I'm a scary person. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'll miss something at first. Here they were surrounded in the fortress by werewolves and men were wasting time and energy, causing two young women to be attacked without reason. People who focus There is a little more pressure than your wall than these women will be lesbians or not, that's just my inference about the hostility that reaches them. If they can aim and shoot, you may also be good with them. Questions about their "immortal spirits" can be solved later. <br /> <br /> In addition, I think this is related to the rest of these women trilogy should be the protagonist. One of them killed the Indian people at the end, which saved one life. I think one is just a victim of her condition that can't be blamed for her actions. But another one is just a murderer who doesn't deserve her happiness
