I enjoy the feeling of opening a few minutes, but in 20 minutes I use the fast forward button freely. Too far the image of Stewart (Michael Seligner) walked from one room to another, followed the path through the door and along the road. Impressed me that the story had a short meaning (20-30 minutes) and then expanded in a way that was a love job between director Grieve and Zelniker (they co-wrote the screenplay) < br /> <br /> It may be more fun if any character has something to say that I have never heard the name of another movie before or if the ending is not - disappointed - the person I predicted for three minutes Into this movie (Unusual for independent / smaller studio movies) at least at the heart of it in the right place - it's not the nonsense of your traditional Hollywood adaptation formula
