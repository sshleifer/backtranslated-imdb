Obviously, there are some abilities attached to Maria Bello, but this is just a sad and depressing moment. Draw every character as a disgusting person and be used for someone. People can create movies from stories that are 'interesting'. Well, I hope they get it out of their system. Unfortunately for viewers, there is no insights, no sensitivity, no context and no humanity. Which is good, except that there is no humor, no horror, no context and nothing to say about the story that is trying to tell Bad things happen. You sit and watch. You don't care. So, 99% of the time. The word 'true story' is unintentionally warning the audience. Means that the director and screenwriter are lazy and passionate about certain events that they hear about somewhere, so they throw them on the screen and expect the true nature of this story to make The audience felt something of work. I hope they are happy with making this movie. It stinks on the ice.
