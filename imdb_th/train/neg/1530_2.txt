I hope I will record the MEN IN WHITE tape so I can see it again. <br /> <br /> "What do you mean you really like Theo?" <br /> <br /> No, I mean That I can see Again to see that it was a foolish and unassuming mentality that I remember. <br /> <br /> Many people claim that it was created for children. Can I recommend that children do it themselves? Because the entire structure of the script does not have any discipline in the part of producers and writers, and seems to be included in the series because it seems to be a good idea at the time. <br /> <br /> Actors don't help but I began to feel truly sorry. Actually, you can believe that during the filming of this movie, the actor must lie to their family that they are filming a hard core porn movie. That is an embarrassment to appear in a depressing story. Like this In order for you to understand how bad the performance is, every time BAYWATCH, Donna D'Ericco disappeared from the lecture, I waited patiently for her to appear again after a few seconds. Can this movie star from BAYWATCH appear and a few seconds later you forget that they are in the movie? This tells you everything you need to know about the standard of MEN IN WHITE. <br /> <br /> In fact, it tries to be an action cartoon like GOODIES (although THE DISMALS will Is a better adjective for this film), although this movie deserves credit for comedy in the bathroom But considering that this is a movie for children (This did not stop the ITV broadcast at 23:00) so shouldn't be near the humor in the hand.
