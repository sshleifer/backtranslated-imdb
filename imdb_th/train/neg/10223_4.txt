I remember the name very well. For me, it's Flora Robson with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting roles. And the voice of Vincent Massey from behind the beard. Flora Robson is very good for me. Her next signature is "55 Days at Peking", the same role, but with different luxury gowns. And the same sound For the fleet, it is a subtitle. I like black and white movies. Is everything done at the time of Eli Bethan at night? Sometimes it is talkative and difficult to understand. I can't tell how interesting that love is. Is it Spanish or Vivien Leigh? And I do not believe that Elizabeth I will be a great strategist in recommending that the fire ship be sent to the fleet Obviously it worked for the empire. But not for scripts This may be more accurate than in the past. But Betty Davis has a more attractive script. And I missed the daytime!
