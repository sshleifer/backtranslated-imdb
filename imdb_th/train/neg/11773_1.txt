I have been out for many years lurking on these boards due to the lack of intelligence that was transmitted through the reviews that appeared on the film's IMDb space periodically. I saw this film of the New York Film Festival in Asia. (Which has a well-selected movie this year, watching the snake movie CHA NO AJI, Survive Style) and regretting every day with scenes from that movie Disengage yourself from the back of the mind and become a bright memory. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you can read the summary of the movie outside the Subway Cinema, which is probably why I made a mistake. From dragging my friends to movies Description Create a horror movie that I have dreamed of for a long time, a story that requires true fear instead of a cheap horror. P has a difference in reality. It relies on cheap laughter. <br /> <br /> An incredibly annoying announcer described this movie as "Lesbians collaborate to fight monsters." Not totally true. There is a sub-plan created in this movie to look like the relationship between a girl and Pookie is going somewhere really. More lies. This movie seems short for "Are you afraid of the dark?" The story is ridiculous and has succeeded in waking up laughter and confusion from the audience after they canceled the effort to watch this movie in a serious manner And trying to forget the 9 dollars that was lost at the door I almost want Spool Paul to be an audience so I can laugh at him and ask him why he lost 5 years in Thailand to create a soft horror horror movie that is in bad condition. The only successful spice channel Expelled from her family and caused a bit of excitement at the Belgian film festival The only thing that caused this thing was blood flow in the lower intestine because it couldn't extract itself from sh * te. However, I hope I can oppose anyone who makes a terrible mistake when seeing a movie. This is really one of my worst 3 movie experiences.
