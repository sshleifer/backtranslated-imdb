THE DECOY is one of those independent productions created by the obvious newcomer. But without all the usual flaws that overwhelmed most such films It has a clear story, enough performances, very good photography, heroes and bad guys are both awesome men and background music is not too much. This is the latest DVD, so people will look here to see if it's worth it. I do not know where the 10th came from, because there is no way that this movie will be good --- even if you are the mother of the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The last movie we saw in the movie theater was a book. Popular and excellent is the Order of the Phoenix from Warner. In comparison to THE DECOY and PHOENIX, consider that PHOENIX (as Warners warnings) does not have a story. scary I give the Phoenix a "1" because the size does not decrease. DECOY is 4 times better. - Everything. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to give DECOY a chance Any nonsense, it's original. If your expectations don't come from stupid "10" scores, here you may enjoy movies in terms of yourself.
