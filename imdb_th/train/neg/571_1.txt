I just rent this because I like the first movie. However, calling it John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a scam for you to rent it. He is a producer in reality and is clearly not involved in the creation of this movie (Who Jeepers Creepers?) <br /> <br /> Sad stories, terrifying special effects and Jon Bon Jovi is a reliable vampire hunter all the time. It's not a bad comedy And performances The bad It's just a low budget. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague.
