This is a waste of my time. There is no plot. Performing below the standard should be used as a model in the classroom. Performing things that should not be done. It was just a copy of the commercial version of Universal Soldier earlier, which also limits the scope of the tank that serves. It is sad that VD wants to confirm his ego every few years and sadly still that people will pay good money to sit through it. This schlock makes the Martial Arts movie a bad name. By comparison, Segall, Norris and Arnold were able to see almost the ability. <br /> <br /> Maybe VD should follow Leslie Nielson and follow his directions. At least we can laugh with him instead of coming to him.
