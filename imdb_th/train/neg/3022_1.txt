I'm very excited about this movie when I saw the sample for the first time. Usually I will see this example well and I immediately bought this movie. There is something to tell me ... You know it must come first. I'm glad I made Keira Knightley destroy all future movies for me with this role in the movie Pirates. The second story, when it came out, I went to watch it. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated her more. I think that is related to her hair and must be cut short for Domino. <br /> <br /> Who is Domino? Who is Harvey? I don't know yet or really interested. I don't know who you are in real life or who you are in this movie. I didn't care about her character, and even though Keira was naked, especially it didn't make it worth the movie. Certainly lacking direction The writing is repetitive and shallow. The correction is terrible. I don't care too much about this style than the poor. There is a place for it A good example of the lack of style, MTV, colorful editing (Not sure if there is an official name) or not, Fight Club; Just close the upper part of my head Even the enemy of the state has a semi-similar pattern in some ways. It is used tastefully and is not used as a crutch. I mean, this is the same person with the popular gun and crimson tide director. Tony Scott, please give me time. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are many people who like this movie. I guess that the idea that you will love this movie completely or hate fair evaluation Frankly, I hate it.
