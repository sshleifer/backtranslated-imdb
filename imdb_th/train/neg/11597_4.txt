I will live with the plot of Alice after surviving from the previous episode of the Nightmare series. Meet the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger that starts again. At this time, the ridiculous murderer was striking and sleeping in Alice's womb. His intention is "reborn" in the real world. The only person who can stop Freddie is his dead mother. But Alice will release her soul in time to save his own son? This movie started very well when we saw Alice dreaming of being Amanda Krueger, trapped in the room and raped by 100 Manics. She then rushed to the hospital. But then she was not a pregnant woman anymore. <br /> <br /> Alice and Dan are the only two people who came back from the movie 4, then made a new friend shortly before Freddie will start killing again. I don't like the first dead person to agree. Not as good as death or other dreams. <br /> <br /> Freddy himself doesn't seem scary in this movie. The nightmare is really boring. They're not scary or creepy. <br /> The film's performance is ok for the fifth movie in the series, but overall I think this movie is really boring. (Not the worst movie in the Freddy Dead series, the worst) <br /> <br /> 4/10
