Just so that movie fans will get a point about this movie, I decided to write another review. The last time I missed something ... <br /> <br /> At first, the script Second, the show Third, Jesus Christ, they are thinking of making debris like this and expecting us to enjoy it when there is no redemption of any features from the beginning to the end, except when Joseph Finis was blown to the point Unexciting balance br /> <br /> I can't believe that I will lose money on this matter when I give to a homeless person or a bus driver or something interesting! <br /> <br /> Did you get the picture?
