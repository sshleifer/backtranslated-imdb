In the unlikely event that some directors who are reading these comments, I want to give advice (free!) From the perspective of the audience. If you want to create an exotic adventure movie If you want to create an exotic adventure movie Don't try to do both at the same time. It doesn't work. For example, having a character The stupid "cartoon relief" is killed and the head is cut and followed by the monkey shaking the tree and putting the coconuts on the head of the cannibal. This is boring, meandering, being racist .... You get a few moments of clever images and some nude pictures from Kathy Shower (the method that is too messy here) is hardly worth your trouble There is a reason everyone forgot about the existence of this movie (* 2/1)
