Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Marshall Lawson (Steven Segal) was assigned to conduct French patrol missions in France. Along with three young men hit the new team after disobeying direct orders from above However, on the night before they were beaten, all of them were brutally murdered by a murderer with an inhuman power. When the French police investigated themselves, he searched for the person responsible for himself, only to expose the military corruption in a life-threatening new drug that changed the DNA of the person and made them stronger.> <Br /> Bad cover, bad name, bad post-production modification And bad trailers Movies that are not good enough But I must say that I don't think his attacking forces are the worst. I know that this will make me unpopular with most other critics here (maybe not Steveday!), But I think a lot of criticism arises from all the bad news that happened before the movie rather than quality It's true. <br /> I have to say that there is nowhere near as much dubbing or editing as I believe. Scrubbing has (which makes him look like Martin Sheen. issue The clutch!) Is quite frightening and quite often. But didn't use it for the majority of this movie as I thought The plot runs smoothly as well, considering the chaos of the movie, ending the original story called Harvester. This film has a good Gothic look which is a new touch for the Seagal movie. <br /> <br /> The lowest point of the exact killer is the lack of perfection and exciting action. There are only a few scenes of badly filmed scenes for fun. <br /> <br /> I must be honest. But I want to see this story again than Flight of Fury. Today you die or die for killing **
