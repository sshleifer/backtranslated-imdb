"I just watched this movie last night and I don't think I will think the same way with any actor involved because this movie will be stuck in my heart." <br /> <br /> Above Orders can be thought of as good or bad. I mean, every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in the movie, I think "A Few Good Men" which is a good thing. Now, every time I see Ron Perlman or Kristy Swanson, I will think of "Tinseltown" which is a terrible thing. <br /> <br /> I picked it up, thinking that it might be a wise thing or at least. Makes me laugh with Arye Gross and Swanson and Perlman. As mentioned above, I think at least it's not bad. You can tell that this movie was created according to the size of Wheeling, Indiana (where exactly), but sometimes they spend every dollar to make a good movie. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't funny. Fun in terms of a particular word It was there and lasted for 84 minutes. During the slow, thrilling time, <br /> <br /> The characters are like paper. You are almost interested in the characters of NONE and because the two leading actors are struggling with Hollywood writers with dreams that are both struggling writers with dreams that write this, you have to know about With them Okay, two REAL writers know about themselves in the on-screen version, so they think the audience. They didn't think about character development, except trying to tie the story back to "Gilligan's Island". <br /> <br /> The story is strange. Two men live in a storage center, one of them collecting beds and twenty people living there as well. The rest of this story is planned and foolish. Have you ever seen "Lamphun's favorite deadly sin"? The second story with Joe Mantegna is about a television writer who can't find a good story to create a television movie. So he created Now, instead of a television writer for the screenwriter morph Mantegna to be an annoying actor for half an age, then take a comedian and you have this movie. <br /> <br /> Actors try Kristy Swanson. In the movie about 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie She is still hot But it can help if she really is a movie star instead of making CAMEOS all the time. For others, I don't think it's an actor's fault because they have bad content. <br /> <br / > Go to Lamphun National Movie But stay away from this movie
