The author / director Bart Sibrel seized his work here around the can of the movie that he said was accidentally sent to NASA. He said that it shows that astronauts pretend to be a television image on a trip to the moon using a camera trick. The astronauts are in low earth orbit all the time, and the editors on the ground are assembling this raw movie scene in just a few seconds of ready-made movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sibrel's research is so smooth that he Not understanding. The "backstage" was actually filmed mostly from a 30-minute live broadcast (on that reel), with millions of viewers not hiding in the NASA storage room when he was talking. And we have to wonder why Sibrel laid out his own conspiracy in the image of an astronaut because he heard the astronauts with their own words clearly spelled out that the astronauts had just tested the camera, not pretending to be a picture. <br /> <br> Finally, anyone can see a clip for themselves without having to buy a Sibrel hacking version (he shows you the movie Zapruder's JFK assassination Than the "smoking gun" of him) Sibrel thought he was the one who saw it. What is more revealed is a clip from a raw video clip that Sibrel chose not to use, such as clearly showing that a world far away is appropriately obscured by window frames and others destroying his claims on the matte and plate. clear Create an illusion of a distant world. <br /> <br /> As with most movies of this type, Sibrel relies on satire, does not understand the assumptions, does not understand misleading reviews and selected words to deal with the audience. Conclusions Not true evidence
