One more item in the weak third season 'Is there any truth?' However, there are at least one main planning element that is very different. The main character is an alien who has to be carried in a black box because his appearance is horrible until he makes him lose consciousness. It's terrible that now you can't live with this incredible evidence. Obviously I thought it was a mistake to ever 'show' an alien because his true face had never even created such horrible things. What we get is a Star Trek psychedelic light show that is used for various things at different times. Usually when a ship runs through a magnetic storm or something like that. In any case, Mr. Spock was able to withstand the appearance of Colosse, at least when Spock wore a special hat. (For the longest time, I think the alien's name is 'Carlos', which I find humorous. Spock must consider Kollos at one point. This is accomplished, but when Spock / Kollos returns to the end of his mind by Golly Spock, forgetting his hat. Oh oh. He's crazy. Finally receiving help from Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers This may be a wonderful and strange episode. But it's not good at all, and there is still another season already in the previous season.
