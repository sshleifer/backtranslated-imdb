This movie sucks It's really my death. The show was brutal. Short, long, short stories. These "terrorist" people are pathetic by mad killers. But failed to fight in any way And this is after they use a raft to travel, camping without equipment and appearing at a camp that consists of food and clothes and daughter's headphones In addition, after their boat disappeared, they were shocked that they were trapped in the forest. But after that, the girl appeared and they never thought that they would be able to climb him out of the forest as he did. As I said, this movie is terrible. Complete jokes Don't let your girlfriend talk to you.
