First of all, when I saw the teaser preview for Wendy Wu, I was very excited. Brenda Song, one of the most famous girls on Disney Channel, will do martial arts and I'm fine ... until I watch the movie. Action is not good, this movie can't let anyone know. Fighting is unrealistic and it sucks ... along with the story. If you think you are a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a girl who is the heir of another warrior who is a woman, the girl wants to ignore her claim and wants to be a homecoming queen. Fight the ancient evil. The idea is not all traditional, time consuming movies.
