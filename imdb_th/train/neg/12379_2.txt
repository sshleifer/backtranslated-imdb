Based on the above positive comments, we saw free screening last night. Now I know that the filmmakers put positive comments because there is no way that one person can write these things. "Destination to become 'Classic Cult' "?? The theater is full of friends and family of the production team because we have only a handful of people who walked out in the first hour. <br /> <br /> The song is the character I heard the most ?? "Do not cut short the way that love has wolves in the forest .." Debi Mazar's eyes flashed fiercely as she tried to sing. Fortunately, most songs lasted only a few lines. <br /> <br /> Now, anyone who plays wolves in this story should be charming and seductive. He because he is not very old He did not speak softly with a 50 pound weight gain and a high-grade makeup and beautiful singing. Seriously, is this guy in the lead group? The remaining actors are semi-sufficient. But can not do much about the script without imagination Do you know that it is possible to write for adults and children at the same time? Look at "Pixar" <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the virtual outfit looks good and blends well with the actors. And it is not as disgusting as "error"
