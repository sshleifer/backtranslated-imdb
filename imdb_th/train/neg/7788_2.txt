I noticed that the other reviews of this movie talk about "wholesome" and "entertainment". How do these people have to leave home more often? I do not know why they trembled for ridiculous, absurd pieces. Pat Boone has no talent for acting and his stupidity is beyond his co-star Pamela Austin, a former model. (But another reason that makes the malignant laws of incompetent modeling Bad habits to this day) Good actors (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Horton, others) try hard to get this feeling. But not useful I noticed that two directors shared credit, although "credit" is not a word that I will use (not "director"). For "pure entertainment", there are a variety of movies to choose from without suffering the people you Love by forcing them to sit and watch Find one of those movies and skip this movie.
