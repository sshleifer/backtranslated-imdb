From the star of "MITCHELL", from director "Joysticks" and "Angel's Revenge" !!! These are the tag lines that will normally prevent me from watching this movie. And the worst part is all the messages mentioned are true !!! Ook ... Joe Don Baker eats every five minutes in this movie. It's like a bad remake of "Coogan Bluff".
