I was afraid to take my nephew to watch this movie because I didn't think it would be good. Children 6 years and 10 years saw it, so I collapsed. I have to admit that it's not as bad as I thought. But still a far way from the book This movie seems to be correct with understanding and humor. At the age of 10, I found that a 6 year old child understood what had happened and he was presenting a solution to the problem. Finally I have to explain that sometimes movies don't show the best solution because it's more fun to see what happens if they choose "stupid" or "stupid".
