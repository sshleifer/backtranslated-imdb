Wow ... Where to start ... Choose the Big Lot for only $ 2.99. That's three coins. I won't see it again ... ever ... and for what? I'll tell you an hour and fifteen minutes. Of boring and boring boring chat which seems to be suitable for a lifetime movie rather than a horror flick advertised in a box (Maybe the market maker who designed it burned in hell for all eternity) followed that with a little cheap blood. (Not even the good blood that reminds you of ...) and plans at the end that come out of nowhere and without reason Scary, scary, scary ... <br /> <br /> Is there a qualification for redemption? But at the level of Joe Bob Briggs, there are six related breasts. But that was not worth the loss of my three coins Without these things, you can use sci-fi that speak two or three in the morning ... <br /> <br /> Bmoviefreak
