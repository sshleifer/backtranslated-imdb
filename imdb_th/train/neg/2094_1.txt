I have to endure the suffering of middle school teens and family conflicts for almost all programs. I don't care about their relationship at high school level. I spend time with hell in dealing with these problems and I don't care about the teenage characters that face the "lite" horror that I want. That's the only reason I came here. There are science fiction a few seconds to show the end. In the end, we saw Proto-Zai. It's good, but there is one problem. The eye, its red spot, will lock in with interesting objects. We all know that Cyon's eyedots will scan to make the world map. The red dot does not stop moving. <br /> <br /> I hope the author corrects this violation before the second episode.
