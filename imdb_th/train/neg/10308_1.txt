This is really bad. Lamas shows how the second-class actors act. But what makes it worth watching is the scene in which OJ is angry, grabbing a fellow police officer as if he were going to kill them while the jukebox plays music with songs. (Made me want to hear the rest of the lyrics - from David Gregoli and Leslie Oren, but I couldn't find it in iTunes) talking about seeing the future ... too funny for words The rest of the film is remembered. Scores and songs are more interesting than scripts. Same as the sequel Which raises the question of why they did the sequel My understanding is that foreign sales drive many of these B movies. Did not say much for the habit of watching the world
