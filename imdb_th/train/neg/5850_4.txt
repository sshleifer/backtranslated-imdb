Nell Shipman tried to plot the story that would lead to the final scene of the chase in 'Back to God' last year and she failed miserably. This time, she can do better, even if it looks ridiculous. 'Something New' is hardly a plot placed outside of the chase. There is a short summary that creates a hero. (Shipman's co-author and girlfriend) to help the young woman (played by Shipman). From there, it was nothing but a thrilling and incredible chase from there. Of course, it plays like an hour-long ad for Maxwell Sedan, but this movie is both nonsense. It seems that she doesn't learn much from the last minute movie of DW Griffith or the parody by Mack Sennett and other comedians that she imitated. <br /> <br /> One interesting thing is Shipman. Wrote and directed himself in this film as the writer of the film, the writer (Shipman again), although she didn't do anything wise or had humor in this story, even if she tried it Again, others were the pioneers of the writers' jokes in subtitles such as Anita Loos and 'Wild and Woolly' or Frances Marion and 'A Girl's Folly' (both 1917). At least Shipman felt that she couldn't. Seriously to yourself or the movie seriously, and I can't get 'Something New' despite claims.
