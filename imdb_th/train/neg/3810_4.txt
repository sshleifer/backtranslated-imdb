When I was young I liked this show but now ... BLECCH !!! This item has content that is not polite, not funny. All three actors are good and funny actors. (Saget's stand is better than what this show had happened, just as it had previously stood up better, and Stamos is better than the general actor). up (Who can blame him?) Eventually, the show was canceled when many actors requested extra money. <br /> <br /> Here are some things that make me crazy about acting: <br /> <br / > 1 catchable phrase - how many times a person can tolerate boring phrases such as 'vulgar', 'you get it', 'nerdbomber', 'cut it off' and 'mercy' at 24 hour <br /> <br /> 2 Kimmy Gibler - the most annoying character ever written on television <br /> <br /> 3 Writing and writing Groan as Oreo cookies There is a good cliched writing and bad cliched writing. Full House has bad writing. <br /> <br /> 4 Three men live together in San Francisco - enough to say <br /> <br /> 5 unrealistic things - too much to recall <br /> <br /> 6 trendy kids - girls have the latest fashion in the mall and you can see the poster of the artists they <br /> <br /> Now, this performance is in Nick @ Nite. I hardly call it classic. I have nothing bad to say about the people involved because I think many people have the right to their own right. But this performance is very sweet. I can't stand it for a while.
