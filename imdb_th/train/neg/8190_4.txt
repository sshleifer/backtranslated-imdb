My Take: Funny Christmas Tired Recipe The laughter is tired and the ability behind it is the same. <br /> <br /> I love the holidays as much as the next man. (Although I often have bad cases of holiday blues) but it seems It's just dumping for holiday comedies that will be a bad movie on any day of the year. But that didn't make them less painful during the season As if we already have a SANTA CLAUSE movie (there are three and * shit * still count) Who wants to watch a movie about his brother? In the plot to stay home with Disney's SANTA CLAUSE franchise (occasional rude humor notes and Santa's "Little" assistant wearing a short skirt) FRED CLAUS is a funny place that takes 116 minutes. Of course, Jolly Ol 'Saint Nick has a younger brother, but where does it go? <br /> <br /> It's really a shame. FRED CLAUS has been blessed by the actors who can make it a funny movie during Christmas. Will melt along with the snow But it would be much better. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob. But we were led to believe that he was a lost brother from Santa (Paul Giamatti), who invited his brother to visit her. Santa (Miranda Richardson) hesitated and, moreover, Effective expert (Kevin Spacey) came in and watched Father Christmas and this close to being shut down! And guess who is Santa's mother! Of course, Kathy Bates, Elizabeth Banks, is Charlene's assistant, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves, and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's boyfriend. SI doesn't know whether I will watch the casting or beat it. Here we have a familiar face to increase quality. But there is still a way to work too little. <br /> <br /> For the best humor, the FRED CLAUS may happen to be Santa's brother. His exact opposite and some jokes about the Elf DJ. I have to admit that I have a few gigs related to Fred joining the group counseling for the famous brothers. (In which he was joined by Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), moreover, the movie surrendered to the feelings that should make us "feel good" and teach lessons about with "What does Christmas really mean?" Clearly, Christmas means Hollywood. How much money can we get from buying the remaining Christmas? <br /> <br /> Score: ** From 5
