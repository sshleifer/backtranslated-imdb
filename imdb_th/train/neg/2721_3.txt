I am a big fan of Sci-Fi 50s, but this is not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the movie is a natural vehicle for a classic small sci-fi bopper flick, the director counts too hard to perform the movie. Obviously he works without money because the whole movie is full of uninterrupted conversations. I've never seen * killing a lot of time in movies. <br /> <br /> There may be "blob footage" less than 60 seconds in the whole movie and the rest is people who are involved. In many unsupported conversations It's fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. But how good heaven ... casting? Think that everyone in the heart is right to believe that they are teenagers?
