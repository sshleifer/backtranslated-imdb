I can't believe that I'm very angry after seeing this, which I am writing for a review on IMDb for the first time. <br /> <br /> This Disney documentary isn't anything other than Planet lite. Received a new update Now I know that it's being advertised as "From the people who brought you Planet Earth." But I don't know if they're going to use blatant cuts like the famous mini-series. I recently paid $ 8.75 to see what I had on the DVD. Disgrace in Disney does not remind people that there is nothing original here. (James Earle Jones recorded and 90 seconds of sailfish that I do not believe in Planet Earth) <br /> <br /> But the biggest crime of all is that while Planet Earth uses the story The misery of polar bears is evidence that we are killing this world and being a catalyst for ecological changes. Disney has brought that story into family friendly rags. After the death of the polar bears, they showed their children growing significantly a year later and threw some garbage on the way they were ready to continue in his memory. And the world is a beautiful place There is no mention of grown-up children who are dying due to the same conditions of their father. They must be patient. There is no warning of problems for future generations if we do not do anything together. Just a montage of things we've seen in movies. (And many times if you are one of the billion people who have seen Planet Earth) <br /> <br /> I never leave the theater at all. Ashamed and cheated in my life
