We like School of Rock and Jack Black. We can't wait to see this movie. It's the only time in life that this movie is terrible. I want to go outside. My husband hates too. The only comedy is in the trailer. My husband and I want to stand outside the theater and tell people to save money. Very bad writing It has all the stereotypes of the Hispanic people that are most disgusting. This movie is not too long. But for us it seems eternal People in the theater are restless and quiet, like watching dry colors. I make my husband live because I'm sure that there might be some redemption but not saving your money and time
