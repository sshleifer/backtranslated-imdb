Slaughter High is a symbol in the 80s that is your symbol. The prank went out of the hand, leaving the pale man to burn horribly. A few years later, a brave man came back and started killing people who attacked him. Now the story may sound interesting and fun. But what makes the horror movie different from the 80s slasher film is that it has a lack of humor and continuous errors. <br /> <br /> The performance is horrible. However, it is actually not as bad as to doubt. Although it doesn't help all the characters in this film dirty and unsightly, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is the greatest torture of all of them and she is the person we should share our opinions with. Sympathy and roots Not to mention the guy who is too narrated in a narrative and I think that even those who like to act like being disgusted and rude by him are geeky. So when he is crushed, is there anyone really interested? <br /> <br /> Laughter is possible. The lack of talent in Munro's performance is quite clear, which makes her at the same level as the rest of the actors. However, the most fun is very easy when the film tries to create Munro, which was in her mid-30s during adolescence among teen actors. And when the time came later and Munro played her true age, the remaining actors did not go through adulthood. All of this goes well with the hilarious music of Thrash Metal Heavy Metal, along with crazy laughs and screams. "I'll take you." When talking about Slaughter High, it's not a great flick. But it has bad entertainment May be necessary for hardcore slasher fans But do not expect any embarrassment, doubt or credibility from it. Scary !!!
