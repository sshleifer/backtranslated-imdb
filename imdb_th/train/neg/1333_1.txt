I am very disappointed with this movie. I have read other reviews here and have much higher expectations. I expect the drama to develop more intense characters. But that never happened in the movie Daniel-Day. Lewis is a good actor. But not as good as some critics here make us believe I think he repeats the same 4 or 5 movement sets in the movie. I will rate his performance 6 of 10. <br /> <br /> Performances: 6 out of 10 directions, 5 out of 10. The script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Remove the movie from My DVR in 70 minutes into the movie The movie came out much better ...
