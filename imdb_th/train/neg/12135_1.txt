Although 2 years have passed, I still remember that there were all the garbage that contained all the stories. Unfortunately I found this movie after my friend and I chose it while browsing the new movie at Blockbuster. We decided to choose a movie because it was the only thing we had never seen and listened to. Although it has been quite a long time since I watched the movie, I still remember the lack of a plot. (Seriously, no real plot) and wasted time spent watching movies If you are in a video store and this movie attracts your eyes, walk on and find better movies. If you end up seeing this movie, I understand your pain :)
