Have you ever noticed that in his next film, Bert Reynolds' laughter, like a screaming brakes, <br /> <br /> must be with Hal Needham too. <br /> <br / > From the look of the Ace ", WAY too much. <br /> <br /> Do you believe that this is from a book? But I was like that And may not be the best seller. I will bet. <br /> <br /> Bert is a good boy in the NASCAR industry, which is tied with Betty, a fried chicken with a pattern on his team. Anderson's interest in love and what Nabor did was impress his Gomer Pyle as a repairman / best friend. <br /> <br /> A lot of people here are Bert's friend or Hal Others must have a job. And even the real NASCAR driver is still doing this job and looking for someone who is more talented than those who use the SAG card. <br /> <br /> As far as laughter, Bubba Smith (before "Police Academy" ) Making them a Beatty driver and Petersen in the full Elvira mode, receiving great admiration as a woman who wants to get to know Lugs really well. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Burt spends time and effort. In the movie, such as "Stroker Ace" It does not matter whether he would or not. They are not interested in writing the script for him. Why should I be interested in showing <br /> <br /> two stars, mostly for Petersen and going out at the end? Now they are funny.
