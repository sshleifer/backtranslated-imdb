Everyone, while Disney made a film that surprised everyone The person who makes you wonder, finally, in the tradition of Pirates of Caribbean. This movie will become a ghost and kill and rape your village. It's scary. have I believe that young children may enjoy this thing as they like when Good ALWAYS wins. But I, I like movies that are thrown, who will win. This film never made Bad Guys superior. At the end, when the remaining heroes in the hole "can't see", you know that they can go out. Everything works perfectly for Cage and his friends. He doesn't have to think about puzzles or clues for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complicated it is. Watch this movie if you want to see an impressive set of designs, not whether you want to see a good show or a good movie. Going to the Superman movie, it is much shorter and the kids like it more. For example, the scene where Cage escaped from an armed gunner and the bullet was diverted by a fire escape (And I'm not talking about a fence or anything, just one LITTLE POLE). This film shows the decline of movies and the film industry that makes jokes cheap and boring.
