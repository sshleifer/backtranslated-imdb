I used to love charging because of the script and the characters that were excellent, but recently I felt as if it had become an emotional soap. If you watch the promotion / poster of the bill, you will now see two officials hugging / kissing or doing something with the friendship while the promotional image of the bill long ago shows the crime. This proves that it has changed a lot from being a very dramatic police drama to an ordinary TV drama. When I watched, I felt like watching a police version of Coronation Street or something like that. I must say that I still like the bill because I am interested in police work and that. But I miss the greatness that The Bill used to have I want to score 2 out of 10 because you have to admit that it was destroyed by someone who took the money. <br /> <br /> For the script and the characters they both are the lowest. Of the great characters have disappeared (Although I still have a few things that I think) and I'm not saying that the new characters are bad or anything because they are not, of course, it's just that they lack a difficult look. Which all the old characters used to have because most of the new characters relate to the silly relationship and family problems. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the only police programs on television today. Something very interesting to watch But as I said, it disappeared from a lot of uniqueness. (If it is the correct spelling) and will now be classified as a scary and unreal television soap
