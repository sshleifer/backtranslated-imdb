Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal combos are golden in color, with the likes of HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA. So I went to see the movie. (Doubly India) with high hopes Unfortunately, HULCHUL, before this movie, was a very disappointing story. <br /> <br /> Like everyone else, commenting on the location of the film, which has already been started. Or more deeply rooted Soon after, you just want the movie to end so you can go home. (If I watched this story at home, it would be easier to reduce my loss.) Akshay Kumar's performance was the best and John Abraham shouldn't try to play comedy again. The funny side of the movie as a whole is quite good. I only remember giggling like twice as much of the whole movie. Of course, there is no laughing on the abdomen that makes me have to drink in HERA PHERI or even a little in the AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA Paresh Rawal. There are a few classic moments that are expected. But overall, since his role and character didn't have enough space to grow, he didn't make much impact in this movie. <br /> <br /> Neha Dhupia, who created only the appearance In the movie, enjoy watching while she is on the screen. And some songs are fun Especially the opening and closing songs of ADA and KISS ME BABY, respectively, or you would be better off just forwarding this story
