This is the worst piece I have seen recently. Nothing good about this movie. The plot is normal, the dialogue is not reasonable, funny scenes, never heard anything about true humor. Actors do not play. Even worse, they do not try. The script is quite in the same league as Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. The only good thing in this flick is fighting. They have been well designed as everyone expects from Hong Kong and is the only reason to see Prince of the Sun, although I believe the fight should fill the empty space for the script writers to not worry About the story However, this weak and ridiculous plot may prevent you from looking at the end. Avoid it unless you are a big fan of Lady Dragons, Athyn Rock.
