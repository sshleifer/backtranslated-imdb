Sky Captain is probably the most scary movie I've seen for a long time, full of amazing CG and special effects, along with the A-list actors (Jude Law Gwyneth Paltrow. Jelina Jolie and Giovanni Rizizizi) and racing movies to watch. <br /> <br /> 'Probably' is an important vocabulary here. <br /> <br /> Jude Law plays Joe the Sky Captain with a bold accent - smiling at the heart. But you can't do anything to get out and even the cold delivery and his good-looking appearance can't record the dialogue of the rock. (If he slapped Giovanni Ricci on the back and said "Good boy, Dex", again I might have a problem with the person in front of me.) Gwyneth Paltrow as Polly Per Not less than this, the nerves of her nose wailed and the not-too-sarcastic comment in the first ten minutes of the movie. Maybe she spent too much effort in playing the 30s comics heroine who knows who? I expect more from you Examples of how to play similar characters (And played well) in the late 90's flick, "The Phantom" starring Kristy Swanson and Billy Zane. Rent this movie and you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie are The celebrity in this movie (Angelina Jolie is incredibly hot in that story, I will accept it). In a few short scenes, both actors try to rise above the weary material and deliver the performance at More inspiring than the actors <br /> dry dimensional progression and story >> Br stable that old, boring, and it's just a combination of all the great scenes from the movie action over thirty years ago. That stroke occurred quickly in the first half of the movie and the snail's rhythm in the second period gave the audience enough time to guess what the final conclusion of the movie would be. The match is quite conservative as well - Polly Perkins and Sky Captain reunite after separating from the bitter love that has ended for many years and their stories are not charming. And blend as much as it is annoying and inconsistent Finally, when they came to the common sense at the end of this movie, no one was surprised and no one really cared. <br /> <br /> Props for the director to see the value of Ling leaves enough. Will dress her in vinyl Sky The integrity of the film and for the interesting tone sepia that acts as a color throughout But Captain Sky, despite all the necessary elements of being a great movie, is not worth the $ 2.75 that I paid to go to the theater.
