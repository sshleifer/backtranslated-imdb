For domestic audiences, I can see how they applaud the film. For outsiders who do not have benefits, it is not reasonable. The Germans were regarded as incompetent and heroes of Russia. The expected romantic angle is not necessary and not distracting. The girl can 'love' the lieutenant just by looking at him as ridiculous. She can do as mentioned at the end of this movie, never married, just because this passion is beyond me. I talk about the Germans as an idiot and it is extreme in chasing into the swamps. Hundreds of German soldiers went ahead, pushing Russia into the depression. So Russia hid and the Germans stopped at the wetlands and stood there to listen. I think they don't want wet shoes. But I'm sure the staff will order 20 or 30 people to go in the water to find the swamps But that will end the story In addition, the Germans also entered the barn where Russia hid in the attic and didn't have to shoot into the roof. At worst, some soldiers have to throw a hand grenade into the attic and not climb the ladder to go inside. <br /> <br /> I don't see some critics who say they cry when End I wonder why? You know that this little band will perish and they have nothing to pull the heart.
