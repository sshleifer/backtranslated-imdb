Two old friends were sent to Japan to receive genetic research with a videotape stolen by a black ninja at the beginning of the movie. First of all, they just have to learn ninja skills because "Only ninjas can defeat the ninja." <br /> <br /> Killer Sakura tries hard to be a fun ninja. But failed badly The whole movie is hollow and hard to predict. What's good about this: The same plot has many different styles, dozens of times. Previously, the characters were pulled out too short. Even in the final scene, which by itself has reduced the value of the movie. <br /> <br /> Even the ninja ninja fans who understand the beauty of junk movies are hard to find, although fun. It doesn't offer anything new to viewers, whether at eye level or in the plot. Shuriken was thrown away and Katana was swinging. But it is not enough to bring the direction of the film that it refers to and recur in a similar fight scene, stunning even the most stubborn audience Movies for everyone Even the clumsy performances of Franco Nero in "Enter the Ninja" still fall in love with Sakura's killer ninja. Even in the film, the visuals do not have a ball and waste time trying to find the best fight scenes in this movie: None. Overall, one of the most useless ninja flicks I've ever seen. Not even interested in curiosity Trust me on this one <br /> <br /> Â½ from 10
