The type of movie that is undoubtedly used to dive in this story. The big problem is inconsistency. I know you have to create a difficult situation that will cause doubt and the tension of what will happen next. But this movie is predictable and unbelievable I found that the more I watched this type of movie, the more I continued to talk about what the actors brought them from danger. Continuous bad decisions are just silly. If they take the time to make it more real, I might enjoy it a bit. Have to say that you should be better than this person
