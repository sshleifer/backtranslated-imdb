This movie must be consistent with the most boring movie in many years. Even Harrison, who is wood, is unable to record this movie from sinking to the bottom. <br /> <br /> The murder in this movie is probably the focus of this movie. But not nothing interesting The actors are not bad. But the script is terrible. I just sat as surprised as possible in this movie and thought that everyone in the world could find this movie. <br /> <br /> The film maker is very smart. Boring movie But hides well with the names of good actors and actors in their performances People will go to the blockbuster and maybe watch this movie and think of Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe. This must be good and rent this movie. (The boy was in a terrible time) <br /> <br /> If you like being torn and renting this movie, some people really enjoy this movie, but I like watching movies that have meaning.
