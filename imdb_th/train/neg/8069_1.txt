The disorienting disruption to the extremely deaf soundtrack "Soul Survivors" is the latest in "Those who are dead and who are still alive" type of horror movies A younger teenager, Sean and Cassie, with Matt and Annabelle, prepare to go to different colleges. But before they are separated until Thanksgiving Break, they join the last party, Annabel Cool (Eliza Dushku, who knows the faith of another vampire killer). Too much attention to Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller), for reasons that have never been explained and soon Quartet leaves the party Driving their SUVs, they were chased and passed by ghosts that were inspired by the intention of doing 180 in the middle of the road, causing a nasty and serious accident while the SUV flipped over Dam and dived into the river. Sean was killed (or is he?) And Cassie spent the rest of the movie dealing with loneliness and guilt. (She was driving) when she was not haunted by the haunt of Shaun or chased by spirits. The inconsistency did not explain Cassie's mental state deteriorated until we had a predictable conclusion. So who died and who lives? After ninety minutes of this cleansing, who really cares?
