When I saw an advertisement for this, I was all about seeing it. Now forgive me But it's been a long time since I saw that I didn't remember how it was. When I can say that the movie I see is not similar to the "movie" that they sold to me, <br /> <br /> I was bored, annoyed and disappointed with this movie And if it's not bad enough, they have to sink it with the awesome reggae song Not a song that creates a mood for horror movies, right? I guess if you have never seen an ad (Or for example, I think) you might think that this is an interesting thing For my money, the trade is better.
