<br /> <br /> I've read the book "1st to die" and want to see if the movie follows this book or not, so I watch it. Most of it is done. There are some minor differences. (The position of the final violent scene) But not much, and most of this movie is still true for that book. So, most movies <br /> <br /> may be wrong - movies This story is perfectly handsome with Pollen and Bellows especially - I'm not impressed with this book. Or let me take it back I started out with a lot of impressions, gradually becoming more indifferent, and at the end was completely dissatisfied and felt almost rotated. Unlike movies, this is the reason. <br /> <br /> There are no "rewards" in books or movies. I read a book that created a horror movie that was rarely created with the final resolution, and I hope the movie will be a little different. <br /> <br /> All - (He did it, didn't do it. No, they both do) - not interesting, not fascinating, confusing, confusing and depressing In addition, the love of Lindsay's life ended. (After her disease was clear and she cried at his grave) .. then cut off where she thought of suicide .... Then suddenly she fought for Her life and the real villain that was washed after being arrested .. But it turns out that he and his wife are together .... Hello !!! Now this thing becomes "General Hospital" instead of a good old-fashioned thriller I felt cheated and ripped the book and watched the movie. (I have to admit that it is very interesting - the performance is very good for TV movies). I hope not to follow the books that are affected. <br /> <br /> I still think that this movie can be watched as well. Some reasons do not make the taste in your mouth as bad as the book. (Or maybe it's just what I know about) but I have to say this The story that has not been resolved is not good at all.
