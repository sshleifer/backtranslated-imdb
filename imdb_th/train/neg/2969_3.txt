The story is very reliable and powerful. The technical aspects of the movie are quite good .. even the direction of it. The main problem is with casting that makes the film become a local idea and normal, with a lot of lack of impact and lack of impression. In addition to his father's small role, Raphael (played by Asi Dayan impressively), other actors are not in the best. The role of a blind senior woman, played by Taly Sharon, is fresh but without any violence as a leader, so the numbers she shows become non-violent and low profile. There are times and episodes that look more like real movies. But after all, it is a good starting point and for a major improvement in the future.
