I tried to watch this movie twice and quickly forwarded annoying parts. But can't make it to the end. <br /> <br /> I don't understand that this movie * received really good reviews. I think these people give good reviews like this, trying to advertise movies for marketing purposes. Their opinion seems very unrealistic and seems like an internal job which makes things more pathetic. Movies should be truly positive opinions about their own steam and not being involved !! <br /> <br /> The performance is reminiscent of the most amazing porn, not a joke. I don't mind low-priced movies that have bad performances if they know how to work with it. <br /> <br /> I find the characters annoying. His facial expressions and humor are unbearable. I think this is the intention to make the conspiracy of women look fun and founded. But they are even worse. <br /> <br /> The script is very awkward. (His boss spoke too much about business) and unspeakable sarcasm. <br /> <br /> I didn't find anything to exchange about this movie, except for some attractive women. <br /> <br /> I never felt that scoring was misleading. I am interested in the location But afraid of everything else Of course, see if you want. But I don't want anyone to hope / waste their time. <br /> <br /> Maybe because I ... may not
