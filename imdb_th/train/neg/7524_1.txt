Critics took the first hand to receive this film award with positive comments. I do not want to dispute their opinions. But I strongly disagree When I first watched this movie, I was slightly impressed. But after comparing with other films, especially with the late teacher Bruce Lee, I quickly changed my mind. In fact, if it's not for the title of the movie, I won't buy it. Game of Death 2 is not related to the original Game of Death (except it has one character, Billy Lo.) <br /> <br / > I was shocked to see that Game of Death 2 is similar to Enter the the Dragon. The plan has remarkable similarities: both Bruce Lee and Bobby Lo are doing a mission to avenge their relatives. Both places are similar, both of which are isolated and surrounded by thousands of Blackbelts. There are elements of prostitution in both movies. (The women will be sent two guest rooms in both movies) Both Han (wearing dragons) and Lewis's minions lost their hands. They are an underground drug operation in Enter the Dragon. Believe it or not, there is one game of death. 2 Han has a pet cat in Enter the Dragon. The director uses his imagination and rewards the Lewis pet monkey! Next item <br /> <br /> About other aspects of the movie, such as the script and the show, I feel it's terrible. For me, it seems that the director is looking for a group of martial arts artists to perform in movies and pray that they can do it. <br /> <br /> Positive. I can't deny that the dance is impressive. Although the fight sequence has elements of strong acrobatics But not how effective However, since the plot is not enough, I cannot relate to the characters, so the fight sequence is more organized than the meaning of the movie. <br /> <br /> In summary, I will say that this movie Suitable for martial arts fans But for those who like stable action movies with good stories and strong characters, I will not recommend this movie seriously. My opinion on this film seems to be biased and one-sided. But when Bruce Lee created a new standard in the martial arts cinema, especially after his masterpiece: Into the Dragon, this movie fell. fluid If anything, they imitate a truly excellent martial arts movie, hoping to gain the same reputation. <br /> <br /> From my evaluation, the award for this film is very intense. 1 Out of 10, this movie can be watched by barley and thanks to the sequence of battles it does
