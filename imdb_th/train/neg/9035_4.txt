Born in the 1960s, I grew up watching TV. "Weekly Movies" in the early 70's and loved the creepy movies that were regularly shown, including "Crowhaven Farm", "Bad Ronald", "Satan Girls' School," Kolchak Night Stalker "etc. Just plain stupidity, apparently the writer tried to take advantage of the horrific Manson murder a few years ago. The movie starring Dennis Sweet, the famous "McCloud" and "Duel" as a father who brought the family to camp at the beach. The family found some hippies for some reason, decided to threaten the family. This reason has never been explained and Weaver's calm attitude is difficult to swallow. For the sake of God calling the police overcoming their hell or something, just don't sit there and whine about it. The performance is quite weak, unbelievable stories, etc. Susan Dee looks cute in bikinis. But it's about it Ignore this if ever broadcasting on TV.
