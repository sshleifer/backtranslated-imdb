One of the worst romantic comedies (Not the worst movie) I've seen a boy (who works as a psychic phone!) Must pretend to be gay to move into an apartment with the woman of his dreams. The hilarity is not followed. Boredom, gentle gay beats and scary conversations. If you read Brad Meltzer and like his crappy dialogue, you'll like this movie. <br /> <br /> Be wise. Avoid this. If you see it, destroy the copy.
