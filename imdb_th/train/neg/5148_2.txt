There is a huge mistake with this image, starting with a clear and repetitive script. Courtney Cox plays a comic book artist who fled to a small desert town after being raped twice in a big city. She was stalked by local people who seem to not be respected (Craig Sheffer) and anyone trying to imitate Mickey Rook. Third rate DB Sweeney is a local police officer who is expected to Protect and serve At the same time, the script controls the audience who is really good. Logic flies out the window after the first ten minutes and doesn't return and has questions that are not answered more than they should be if you think " Blue Desert "may be recorded by the excellent Philip Baker Hall. You will be disappointed. His part is not as important as the whole movie - MERK
