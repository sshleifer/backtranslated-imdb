Strict daily activities by the West (Directed by Andrew V, a type of McLaglen, so is it a surprise?) Colonel Army Brian Keith Sparks and the bandit criminals Martin Dean, who kidnapped Colonel's wife (Honor Blackman, who never met her after playing Pussy Galore in "Fingerfinger"), punching, punching, robbery, Stagecoach swings and Denver Pyle in supporting roles ... said In other words, nothing new or original. Talking in low tones throughout Keith will play with prostitutes. (Something shocking after he worked on the TV show "Family Affair"), but this low-cost rental material loses Keith's lovely talent. It's bad news for Dino that doesn't seem to notice or ignore. The direction of hacking, bad writing, and many ridiculous attempts at low humor * from ****
