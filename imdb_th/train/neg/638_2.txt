The Good Earth is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen in my life. The story is slow and lacking. The show is a funny boundary line. While I love Paul Muni, I can now say that I have seen movies that do not represent his true abilities. The only thing I can save from this movie is the production value. Using hundreds of special services in movies, creating an environment that is reliable and interesting. In addition, the beautiful effects that are used to create the illusion of the per million people are easily sold and are revolutionary at that time. Apart from the production value, I can say a little good or have fun with this movie.
