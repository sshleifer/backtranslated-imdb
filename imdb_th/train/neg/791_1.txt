Imagine a scene in which a script writer sat around a table and one said "Let a black woman approach the suspicious (black) public member on the street and ask him if he is a black person or not. Other writers laughed until someone suggested that they repeat every episode. More laughter Now, if you think that the place is funny and the show has many types, such as situations, you will enjoy this show. For the rest, use your zapper and find something more entertaining, such as watching dry colors. Those who write a report that glows from this program should go out more or be forced to watch a TV drama that is really funny. Another example of humor in the show, the young woman trying to get out of the checkout at the supermarket checkout cashier Marginally trying to hypnotize the joke for the first time, but why repeat it over and over again in different lists with cashiers different? I can give other examples, but these things may be seen as spoilers, revealing why this comedy isn't so funny.
