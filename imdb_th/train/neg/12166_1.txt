Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen, yes, she's involved with Bruce) The killer from the first movie depends on her old technique again. She is one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls in the camp are good and away from sex, drugs and various swearing. But a few steps across the line and Angela kills them - bad jokes are broken all the way But there are some good points This is rocky and nasty too. But without a good score The plot has made it to death and this will add new things to the formula. Here there is a killing full of blood in here. (The people were burned alive, the heads were cut off the slashed neck), but all the blood was a fake that was obviously a joke. This also has the smallest number of camps I've ever seen and almost everyone is too old for their role. (Especially Higgins) as expected. There are free female nudity. (Provided here by Valerie Hartman, who was not largely compensated) and a good girl / good boy team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins) with the exception of Springsteen and Hick. Gins The acting is disgusting - even according to the slash movie standards. There is also the cruelty of this movie that one character was drowned in the house! Bored and sick with a stupid plot, ridiculous nudity pictures and bad blood crossing it.
