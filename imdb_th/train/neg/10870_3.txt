Bill (Buddy Rogers) was sent to New York by his uncle. (Richard Tucker) to experience life before he inherits $ 25 million His uncle paid for three women, Jacqui (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard) to look after him. One woman, Cleo (Geneva Mitchell), appeared at the scene to not. like a woman We follow this because the girls get more money to show on the show instead of taking them, which they agreed to perform in the 3 months that Bill is in New York, while Bill meets Cleo and another woman. At the end, love is in the air for Bill and another story. ............. <br /> <br /> Poor picture quality and sound quality in this movie. The story is interspersed with musical numbers. But the song is not good and Katrina Crawford has a very bad voice Rogers is not good as well. He is very happy. But is lively when playing drums or trombone only There is a very annoying character that plays as a taxi driver (Roscoe Karns) and this movie is boring.
