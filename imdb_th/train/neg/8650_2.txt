If it wasn't for some foolish idiots, I knew that I watched "Documentary." This story I would never see this movie! This movie is full of bad scripts and ludicrous moments. In particular, one of the police / Afghan soldiers arrested Don Larson for filming on the streets while they allowed the photographer to arrest him and drive away. Still shooting. Then there was a scene in which the car crashed into another car that was overturned and parked well on the road without evidence of a car crash or collision. <br /> <br /> I was surprised with this. Currently receiving an existing rating (5.8 / 10), I think IMDb users have more feelings.
