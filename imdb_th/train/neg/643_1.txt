I'm a big fan of the TV series Largo Winch. This movie is painful for me. I have to use fast-forward to not sleep. It's boring! How can someone destroy this name? The story is only good. The actor is D. They can't live the role. The main actor (Tom ...) is void. See other roles of this actor. The fight scenes are incredibly boring and cannot be tracked. In any way, they didn't follow the situation. Like other critics, the low-budget movie with poor performers may be the next time others can do better in the name. French can't do the right thing with big movies like Alien 4. That's the bit brrr after Alien 1,2,3.
