That's the problem I have with movies that come out on television when there's nothing to see again. I was sucked into a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> But this one can be seen. The concept of being the only person left on the planet after the comet, finding the zombies around makes me laugh. And that's why I gave this movie a second story instead of 1, that story was stupid ... but in this way that makes you laugh Because the men from Star Trek are leaders, I was surprised to see him as a younger person ... and he is just a funny character.
