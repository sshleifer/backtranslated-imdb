"The Second Coming Of Suzanne" is another of the surreal movies that are trying to be extremely complicated. But what is done is to let the audience sleep. As with other types of movies, there is limited dialogue. Everyone is more interested in the beauty of the image. However, the movie has a foul odor, so there is nothing to interest you. <br /> <br /> The video box states that this movie is "One of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen in the movie." Yes, of course. It was there while watching exciting events such as melting ice buckets or turtles walking one mile.
