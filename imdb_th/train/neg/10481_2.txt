This film has a low selection, except for some old Hollywood names that are familiar with other performances using unknown names (such as Jennifer Gabrielle). Not interesting. this Unfortunately, this is one of his worst stories. Maybe this is a reflection of the screenplay? <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Kim Bassinger and Pat Morita's performance helped the film be forgotten. I enjoy Pat more in Karate thinking There are many good movies to watch and in the short term this movie is not a movie. Save your money and celluloid <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
