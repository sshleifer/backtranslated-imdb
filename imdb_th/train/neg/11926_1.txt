I don't really like this comment. But after sitting at Rankin's most horrible movie, I felt that I was really entitled to say what I felt about it! I couldn't get it to the end and became one of a half dozen or more. Going deep (about 1/3 of the audience) after the ragged plot This film gave rise to and without art. Every style and without substance It weighed down by horrifying performances, truly scary scripts, films that were indifferent and the student class production values. Getting funding begins and ends is a mystery for me. I bet you a million quid. It never goes to general release. The right critic will tear it apart. Really bad movie Not shockingly bad It's a really bad effort, and that's not talking about the moment when a new kitten is born. Completely meaningless, lightest, put together badly; This movie is embarrassing for a movie theater in the UK.
