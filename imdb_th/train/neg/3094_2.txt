**** Minor spoiler *** As a bad movie connoisseur, I have to watch hundreds of bad movies. Classic badies such as "The Creeping Terror," "The Mighty Gorga" and "Manos" are not as good as from beginning to end. Watching an embarrassing fight scene, I thought to myself that this is a truly bad movie. I don't know if I just saw the best thing that this movie offered. This film uses the biggest nose in the celluloid hell during the "Club Scum" that is not appropriate, which is a continuous line of jokes. Only this film, director Rick Sloane proved that he deserves to be mentioned next to Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors. How bad will the movie be? Watch "Hobgoblins" and wonder anymore.
