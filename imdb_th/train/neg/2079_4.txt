I'm a big fan of Ivan Reitman - I like Evolution and who doesn't like Ghostbusters. For example, you already know that Uma's character will be dropped by Luke, so the collection is clear when she frees him from his superpowers. But the payout is not there. Throwing sharks manages to get a (slightly) giggling. But again, everything is in the trailer. <br /> <br /> No one does not breathe like Uma and Luke is food at Owen on his good day. If not for Riann Wilson, you will sit there. With a smile from constipation until your cheeks become cramping, this is a joke, right? <br /> <br /> It's not scary - it's just sitting there like crackers behind the fridge. Will be a great superhero and feminist movie But both failed. Let's see if Jason Reitman can save the family name.
