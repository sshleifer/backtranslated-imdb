The intense and furious imagination from Paul Verhoeven Verhoeven is a mystery: it is difficult to say that he uses his evil impulses seriously with the intention of satire or complete forgiveness. He also seems to ignore the fact that all the beautiful images in the world (And this has some outstanding parts) can not hide negligence with stories, conversations and performances Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who discovers invisibility and uses it to propel himself into moral bankruptcy. Bacon is a favorite actor who sometimes shows his dark side (`Wild River ') in an attempt to compensate for his childish appearance; However, the content that Bacon did not hate was enough to force. Other employers are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, both of whom do not have enough talent to impress and when forced to send ridiculous conversations. The important point is that education in dominance and unbelief must be truly suppressed.
