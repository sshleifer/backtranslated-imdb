One of the worst movies I've ever seen Pathetic action scenes and really bad performances didn't help. The only good point is the different parts of Gary Busey. It depends on the movie rating of B and passing the test with flying colors. Lose my money even though I find that entertainment starts with it's annoying after watching a few. I do not recommend this movie unless you watch for free or as a gift. (Gifts that you can request for a receipt and return it for a full refund) <br /> <br /> Really BAd <br /> <br /> 1/10
