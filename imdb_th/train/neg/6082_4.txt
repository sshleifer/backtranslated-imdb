Although there are many familiar "television" names associated with "A Man Called Sledge", there is nothing special about the movie itself or about any acting. In fact, the only thing that distinguishes it from The television series of the 1960s-70s, such as "The Rat Patrol" is a much bigger and more intense actor. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the greatest actor and thinks he should try to Separated from the funny things ("Maverick", "Local sheriff support" - "Gunfighter" etc.) Unfortunately, his soil's favor worked with him while Sledge was a humorous character written to The money in the popularity of the western characters of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti, but Eastwood's stuff is not flat and not interesting. <br /> <br /> I think "A man named Sledge" may be a spa. Getty West has even spaced. Will be too slow to match the sub-genre. Fans of the "Combat" television series with a slow rhythm will feel the connection immediately, while Vic Morrow directs the film and co-wrote with Frank Kowalski. The image is slow, partly trendy, and cross-breaking, which demands attention for yourself rather than telling the story. <br /> <br /> The plot is what it is. "The Great Robbery Standard" (inserted "The War Wagon" here) by Sledge plans to rob his $ 300,000 gold delivery gang, including Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that while moving the shipment Is protected by 40 outriders and while stopping it is locked in a tomb in the territory prison I think there is one episode of "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" with the same story. <br /> <br /> The story will make good TV hours. But old, very fast, like a long film that is full of features Garner does not allow any of his charms to leak into his style and the movie does not create enough suspicion to attract the attention of the audience. <br /> <br /> Finally, things are Collapsed and burned after the robbery All invented and illogical card games <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I am only a child
