At first it was interesting. Ranger Parks (Colin Firth) is married to a beautiful and mysterious woman (Lisa Zane). He knows each other for a short time. It seems that they are happy and she disappears without warning. He searched for her and after a few lives, she met a child who was abused and the past was not busy. Then it seems that filmmakers don't know what to do with this. The beginning, although at least not as suspicious as it should be Then it stopped to be interesting or to make a lot of sense. And the ending was crippled and without excitement or ingenuity. You would think that the screenwriter didn't know what to do with it and was bored. So sad that there is a good idea!
