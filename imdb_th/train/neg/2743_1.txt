I have to admit that I didn't finish this movie because it was silly and not worth it. I watched it with a room full of children who didn't laugh with stupid and rude humor. Director Bob Dolman seems to be obsessed with the sphincter and genitals so much that it overcomes the true story that I grew up with This is not a good movie for kids! In addition to the fact that the content is rude, this movie is stupid, bad, and without intelligence. It's a good story. If you read a book when you are young and love it, don't waste time watching movies that make it worse until you get angry. Buy books for your children instead.
