I just want to start by saying that this is the first review of the movie I made on the internet. I feel like having to warn people about this movie because it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After reading the interview with the director, he said he respected constructive criticism and therefore I would try to avoid bashing on this movie just for the sake of it and offering my opinion on why I found it bad. Actually, <br /> <br /> 1 Actors I know that the budget may not be allowed for a great priest, but with Nicholson working in this industry for over ten years, he knows That some of the average performers, at least <br /> <br /> 2 incredibly weak cosmetics and special effects Obviously, the budget again interfered with what was originally intended. But after working for makeup for many years, there is no real excuse. <br /> <br /> 3 clear similarities with the hostel While not being fraudulent, of course, try to use the money in a successful movie in the past. The only problem is that Roth knows where he is going and how to go there ... <br /> <br /> 4 songs. Not disgusting or even haunted. Just annoying. Just annoying. <br /> <br /> 5 scripts in general All conversations are forced and scary! And subplots about the theater and those who came to help them weak as well as later. <br /> <br /> 6 WTF correction, how to vibrate and not in a good way. Nuf says < br /> <br /> Seriously, I want to hear the director's thoughts on my post. (He has no doubt that his face on IMDb) makes friends ... what do you think? At one point during the filming or editing, you know that the yolu turkey has in your hand ... sorry I don't want to be violent. But you have to be more talented. I hope your next feature of gutterballs is better. Hopefully the training will make progress. <br /> <br /> But at that time, avoid this like my plague Need 81 minutes with interest (At least I didn't pay for it.)
