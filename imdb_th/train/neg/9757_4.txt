Not the greatest movie to remember. Paul Naschy by <br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst swordsman I've ever seen. Zorro is ashamed! His only salvation occurred when the competition was not the same. <br /> <br /> The film is described as an adventure and horror. Forget the horror - no, no, no nudity, no blood, no monsters Just the adventures of Robin Hood and the evil Baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to be a king. <br /> <br /> The main feature of this film is to see Graciela Nilson, who produced four films in two years and disappear from U.S Where is your sad loss?
