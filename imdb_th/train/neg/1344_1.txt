Movies with nonsense titles like "The Bagman" should automatically attract the attention of bad movie lovers. Bagman is not a good movie. It is in the category of movies that seem to be filmed on home video cameras. The performance was terrible. I have never heard of and have seen a wooden act like this since Troll 2 has many scenes with nudity and sex. But they jump too fast The character is completely retarded and completely forgotten. The ending (which I won't lose) can be easily expected after watching the first scene. Because of the nature of this film, nothing but the truly terrifying production value. (Great efforts in realistic scenes, driving scenes that are stationary, etc. Recommended for those who love movies that are not only good.
