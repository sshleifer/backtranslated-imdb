Of course, I'm watching BG. I like S1. I like Season 2, Season 3 is ok and like the last one. Yes, there is a spin-off show! I don't know about this. One of my friends told me about it. I'm really excited. <br /> <br /> I watched the first 3 episodes ... garbage in pieces! Teen drama drama There is no science fiction ... uh, hardly at the end of every episode, we can see Zilon. That's all Who cares about this Do they decide whether the next target group will be women under the age of 18? Speaking of boring religious nonsense, groaning, biting ... and much more. <br /> <br /> It's sad that there's nothing to see. Destroy Stargate, BG ...
