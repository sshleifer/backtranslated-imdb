This movie must be the worst movie I've ever seen. Her sister and her boyfriend went to rent Zodiac (2007) and received this accidentally. Thought it was a joke in front of a real movie This is terrible. I am waiting for it to be scary and it has never been done. This movie does not have real facts about the real zodiac killer. The filmmakers clearly don't have to worry about researching anything about killing. They just like the name ... so they decided to write a script about a name that is not true I'm upset. I didn't realize that it wasn't a movie faster than this. I try to like something from every movie. I don't hate movies ... forever ... except for this movie. If you don't give the stars, I'll definitely have 1 out of 10.
