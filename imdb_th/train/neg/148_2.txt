Now I'm in Iraq, working to give time to watch movies. We also have access to many pirated movies. This gem comes with 11 movies and this is the worst story I've ever seen. I have seen other reviews claiming that this film doesn't care too much about myself. But actually, I think that is concealing the fact that it's scary. It's not the language that Cheek wrote. They think that they develop blade movies. This movie is just one trace on the Vampire Assassin, which if you haven't seen me recommend At the very least, that movie is so bad that you laugh more difficult than you think. This is the point where there is no redeeming feature like it used to be. From bad performances to ancient thinking (Such as opening credits) to Adobe Premier special effects They could not get a gap for the gun, which may be related to the location where the movie was filmed. But if you use effects For the actors, it seems that they just went to study class Bae and took the first, ugly chicks that went out again, like Ron Hall in the Vampire Assassin. Don't let the folk performances they can't. In addition, comments about this subject are "The Return of the Old Vampire Movie" ... No, it's not. This is what a new vampire movie about Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Blade, Underworld. They are all about superstars fighting vampires. This is the newest vampire type that has bad blood, screaming, fake and wonderful than acting. Obviously everyone who wrote good reviews about this story was involved with the movie or the actor's friend. But what interests me, I paid 33 cents for it. However, to summarize this, someone in the first semester of the movie decided to create a movie. I gave them credit because it was better than I could. Of course I know that I can't create a movie so I don't try it. I know how to watch movies. I work 12 hours a night, 6 days a week. I've seen thousands of people in the past year, and this is so bad that halfway I hope to have a mortar attack.
