This movie is not even a single story. This is the most time consuming. It's about movies and money. It is not offensive. But everything is provocative and nasty My spoiler is something I think everyone should read. With full nude pictures and nasty language But not only that, there is no plot, the actors are scary, the accents are horrible, the actors have little time and I'm excited to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I rented for Brian van Holt (which is only fifteen seconds). I think this may be a mistake for the director and editor. But they repeated in the same section two or three times by adding a new sentence. <br /> <br /> The movie that is similar to this is Eraser Head, the most annoying movie in existence. No plot lines and no jokes. Although it is not trying to be funny. Do not watch movies
