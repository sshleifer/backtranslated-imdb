I think this one absorbs ice because it leaves the cube and gives us information about who it is and why the original CUBE never left the cube and left everything in your imagination. Shit, this festival gives everything and I don't like ... even though the performance is strong. But I think the reason for this is worse because other than the original creator, if they have Vincenzo Natali doing this prequel or sequel, I think it should be better. So I suggest you stay away from this place and HYPERCUBE, another movie that I don't want to talk about ... (I gave 2 stories for the show only)
