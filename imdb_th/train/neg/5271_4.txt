An American family who had been bickering on their way to the west discovered a strange ghost town in the desert. I always like mysterious horror movies like this. Spielberg's "Cube", "Duel" and "The Birds" are excellent examples of movies that have no answers. However, it makes us more interested and wanted. Clearly "disappeared", writer / director Walter Klenhard tried to create a movie like that, and he would succeed or not depending on the audience. I think he got there half way and the film just sank. <br /> <br /> Every actor is just "Ho-hum". They're not particularly bad. But we, as the audience, never felt scared and responded to situations in unrealistic ways. Is there anyone else who is sick, the character who just went out to check the strange sound?!?!? At least give some reason to them for doing so!?!?!? <br /> <br /> As far as movies created to watch on TV, director Klenhard should be praised for milking the real desert environment for everything offered and some scenes are impressive. There is a really cool scene where two characters find an old nuclear test yard that the sand has been melted until the glass is visible. I wonder if it's real. <br /> <br /> Don't talk about life. 'Or what the hell it was after these people had never shown, not to mention that We never get a true clue to what they are. (Mutant aliens, ghosts or evil ancient Indian spirits ?? Oh, it's really narrow for us!) Or from <br /> <br /> There are many ancient ideas as well. Why are the townspeople in this type of movie always really stupid? Why is there an old man that everyone thinks is crazy right? why? why? why? What is the new situation ?! <br /> <br /> "The disappearance" tries to be different and intelligent. But in the end it failed in many ways. It is familiar to our fans who are horror animals straight to the video. Hey, I've watched movies that are much worse and the disappearance is not bad on average. <br /> <br /> 4/10
