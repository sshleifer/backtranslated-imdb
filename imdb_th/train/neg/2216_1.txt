I am a lover of the movie B, give me a genetic mutant bat and I am in heaven. These movies are good for you to stop thinking about everything that happens in your world. Even stupid movies often make me laugh, and I still think it's good. Then there is Hammerhead, which is terrifying that I have to register with IMDb so I can warn others The first is the science of creating sharks - men, which the movie almost doesn't touch at all. In order for the audience to be interested in them, just make sure they have blood every few minutes. During one scene attack, the camera moved out of the attack. But you see things that are obvious that the blood tank is thrown with one hand to let you know that the attack is bloody. Back to science, I thought it was very interesting that the female test group was caught naked and the testing equipment needed to be examined through the breast tissue. However, this movie has a bad development, a terrible story and I'm sorry to say it is not good. No, even William Forsyth, the hunter Tylie, or Jeffrey Combs, can help this impostor.
