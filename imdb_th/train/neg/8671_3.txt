I watched this movie on March 21 this year. I must say that I'm disappointed but better than "Tridev" enough to talk about this story about Prabhat, who lives with his father, wife and brother. The film opens when he However, Azghar Jhurhad plans to kill his brother. He plans by sending a few men. They come to school, pretending to be friends. Prabhats kills that child. His father throws him out of the madness. After that, he returned. He and Aakash went to Kenya to find him. Sunny gave a good job, the most annoying Chunky. Naseerdun was broken. Divya did well. Sonam wasted. This is very cute. He is sad to kill the cute girl character. But it is annoying. Other children do well and others do well. Kiran is enough. Arish and Galshan do well in both Indian movies and Kenya, weak script But there are some good conversations, dragging movies, music is ok Like only one song, "Saat Samundar". The lyrics of the song are good. Other songs can't remember. Don't watch this thing. Rating -3/10
