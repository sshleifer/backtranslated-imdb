A memorable line from a short live performance after watching the episode when the line was introduced to the football team. My brothers and sisters started using the line to destroy our huddle. Instead of ready / taking a break, our quarter tells that football and the rest of the team responded to you being bet! A fun way to break the huddle with our opponents scratching their heads while only a few people watch the program. Using this line adds a unique element in our season that I will never forget. We have the best season during my time in college that year and in a small way. It's because of the fun that we use on this line. The performance is quite smelly. But it still lives in the memory of the 1977 national flag football team Pi Kappa Phi at West Virginia Tech
