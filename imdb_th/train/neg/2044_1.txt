This movie is not good. I do not mean 'bad' at the moment; "Oh, the script is not good" or; "The performance in that scene is not good." ..... I mean not as good as some people who are responsible for criminals in destroying the steaming pile that has not been subjected to unsuspecting people. I will not honor it with the explanation of (Plot ??). If I can refer to it that way, I can think of one more time in 40 years of watching movies that I found to be drained. My spleen in the movie I mean, after all, no one goes out to do a bad movie deliberately. Do they? Yes, obviously, they do ... and the wrong person is the writer / director Ulli Lommel. But the worst thing is that Blockbusters are renting to their customers! Get advice Let this shit stay where it is Stuck on the shelf to collect dust
