This film is a festival of bad performances and bad scene designs, including tasteless stripes and weak plot. But it's very fun to watch Everything about it is funny. The basic plan is that a group of scientists from the future will go back in time to capture the evil colleagues who intend to destroy them all. They contacted him in 1146. Scientists 'future' lab in 2033 is a room that resembles eighty-eight, with a 'future' flashing button and time capsule that looks like a lawn. The actors present their genre with self-confidence, which is not difficult to understand when considering that the lines are often shaking the world like "I checked everything twice!" He checked everything twice, twice or not. He checked it four times? Not only that But they also let you create all the evidence of the movie in the first five minutes and continue with a quick shot until they enter the Middle Ages. When Roger Corman runs out of money And have to stop traveling through time and make the scene different Medieval dresses are caricatures of anything from the late 10th century to the 16th century. Any costume that they can find them is used. I think the chain email is not in the budget. 'Because every man wears a sequined shirt, wears a mask as armor. The fight scene was ridiculous, with men throwing cardboard, swords and dying by throwing bombs with sounds that sounded scary But i enjoy it every time i watch it The only line is enough to fit you and everything comes together to create a great B movie. If you are a mischievous gangster, I suggest you watch. And when you read comments about unknown movies I like to hear them pointing out the humor and horror in the movie.
