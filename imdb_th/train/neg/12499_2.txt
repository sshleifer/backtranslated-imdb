I went to see a movie as a sneak preview in Austria. So there is no idea what I will see. The story is very normal. This movie is very long, I believe it should be cut to 1/2 without causing problems with the story. Is a type of movie that you can see on a boring night where you want more bored! Ashton Kutcher is very good. Kevin Costner is ok. The movie is talking about the US Coast Guard that they have trained their lifestyle and the problems they face Because there are not many effects in the movie So if you want to watch it, there's no need to waste money and time going to the cinema. Will be more effective when viewed on DVD at home
