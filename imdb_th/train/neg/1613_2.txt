Now Che (2008) has completed the screening of a relatively short Australian movie (very limited: 1 screen in Sydney after 6 weeks). I can join both of "At The Movies" in bringing Steven Soderbergh. Mission> <br /> It's normal to watch the film director change his style / story, but The Girlfriend Experience (2009), the latest author of Soderbergh's story, also disappeared. A (And editing?) Seems to be Soderbergh's story. The main challenge is strange. After 20 years in the business, he may not be very good at lecturing, just hide it in the "frustrated" project. Any thing that he has today is almost completely failed, as David Stratton warns, "Two parts of Che can't (even) do it all." <br /> <br /> Epic biography in the name of Che ( 2008) barely qualified As a feature film! Of course, it doesn't have legs. In any way, except for the highest resolution that has never been before, which has been forced by history, the variance that lasts up to 4.5 hours of Soderberg is nowhere. <br /> <br /> Even Marga A pair of Pomeranian, notes about the recurrence of Soderbergh (HD digital storage): "You are in the woods ... You are in the woods ... You are in the forest ..." I'm weird. Soderbergh did not give us another 2.5 hours from Somewhere between the two parts of his existence, because he still left a large stone of Che's "revolutionary" life. <br /> <br /> For the biography of the historical person, but infamous Soderbergh makes it strange. <br /> <br /> 1 Never give the most of Che's story. <br /> <br /> 2 Determining the length of the film that is unreasonable while doing. <br /> <br /> 3 Don't care about understanding <br /> <br /> 4. The rest is the scene <br /> 6 Ignoring the appropriate context for various scenes, what we can do is to get stuck in a difficult time. <br /> <br /> 7. Languages ​​that attract all audiences (Even Spanish speakers are confused with inconsistent productions in English); And <br /> <br /> 8. Wash his main object to be white, aimlessly. Why in this late T-shirt franchise success! <br /> <br /> Our feelings about hate are caused by Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen based on their screenplay. Therefore, just like a poor student who has read only one book that is allocated for his assignment, Soderbergh's products are extremely limited in perspective. <br /> < br /> The audience is confined to the limited knowledge of the scene and the situation of the "revolutionary", but that does not arouse our sympathy. But it turns out that we "So Soderbergh tries to wander his audience like a Latin farmer at that time." But these are Latino farmers who are illiterate, who sell good doctors to their enemies. Why Soderbergh felt the need that Must compare us and them and make us equally imprisoned? The strictness of the viewing of such audiences must be the aim. <br /> <br /> The second episode is more chronological than episode 1, but it is a stupid idea of ​​repeated beatings. The misery of the expectations of Che's DelToro does not have the opportunity to grow as an individual while he is struggling to educate the military without discipline. The only surrender was humor, while Che dealt with "revolutionaries" who sometimes didn't know deeply. Some lacked the ability to control themselves around local farmers or food. We do not fully understand what causes conditions or any strategic analysis of their guerrilla terrorism. <br /> <br /> The thrilling countdown of Part2 is still Scary scene: again, nothing. Telegram or context. Therefore, even the scenes with Fidel Castro (Demián Bichir) are unexpected and confusing. Any selected event will be presented at the very least and Latin as the center with the interview Part1, replaced by a change of time between the President of Bolivia ( Joaquim de Almeida) who is corrupt and the US government officials pledged that the intervention of the CIA (!) <br /> <br /> The rest of the "woods" and the blue filters on the day Today just makes the viewer feel as angry /> <br /> I look out DelToro frustrated <br more than the Latin Americans. True history that has not been affected by Che's exploitation in their own country. When foreign governments still do not send free media to their people - for whatever reason - then anyone can see that popular American indie producers may travel to attract readers who are not good. Can read or write But I don't know! "- cf. Inspector General (1949)) went to their own local cinema The obvious omission of the film and the misunderstanding of the distortion are significant, with the aim of understanding the WHO STILL SPEAK LITTLE English. If they do, they will read the script. And then analyze the relevant social issues among themselves - learn the history lesson as it should be. <br /> <br /> This understanding is something that The sharp demand - and not just the illiterate for the rest of Latin America, Central and South America - but it's what Che (2008) failed to deliver and have fun. Soderbergh is his leader because he is weak in storytelling. I'm gobsmacked why Benicio DelToro deliberately chose Soderbergh for this project. If he knew this, it was 44 years ago. Is a very desirable thing: it is what I went to watch this movie But the director robbed us cruelly. <br /> <br /> David Stratton wrote in Australia (03-Oct-2009) noted that while Part 1 "is not consistent" Part 2 "Downhill "From there" created the final campaign of Bolivia in Bolivia in thrilling details "which" ... felt almost unbearable and boring "<br /> <br /> Che: aka guerrilla Part 2, did not travel to Bolivia, depicting misery and misery Subject The entire second half was redeemed with such humor and tragic drama. But sadly, the capture and execution of this movie <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is endless, just a confusion-shock for the Soderbergh film to avoid all costs. It is bound to destroy the hearts of everyone who knows even just a little knowledge about the subject (2/10).
