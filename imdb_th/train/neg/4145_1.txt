Okay, I have watched this movie twice, and I have researched heavily on the internet. I have asked many people about comments there. I read the original length of Sheridan Lafanu Classic 'Carmilla', which is a book that this movie should be based on. I feel that the best way to check this movie is to describe the game to play while watching. Since the story of the movie seems to have no reason at all, this is the story of the book. <br /> <br /> Laura lives in the castle in Syberia and her father, Mr De Lafontaine. They live happily and peacefully. One day, they received a letter from General Man who made a mission in life to avenge the dead daughter. He claimed to have supernatural powers working and explained that he would visit them soon. At the same time, having a chance to meet a strange woman, resulting in Lafontaines taking care of her daughter Carmilla for several months. Soon Laura began to be possessed by a strange dream and began to come down with a strange illness. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And what do you do with the conditions of Laura and the generals? <br /> <br /> I have created this game and want many people to play this game and let me know what their results are. I still have a catchy name and will have a jingle as well. But I can't pay attention to that It is called a game. "This movie doesn't make sense." <br /> <br /> All you have to do is while watching the movie, trying to create a complete storyline that explains what happened. I mean complete, answer all questions, everything is perfect. <br /> <br /> It must answer questions like ... <br /> <br /> * Why do vampires walk around each day? <Br /> <br /> * Why are they all lesbian? <br /> <br /> * Why do women call Bob? And why she shot herself. <br /> <br /> * When is this movie a dream and when? <br /> <br /> * Why is killing a zombie a part of life? Acceptable <br /> <br /> * Why does Travis Fontaine see and run away from the zombies without slowing down while driving? But when faced with a woman with a clear hostage behind Her car accepts the pretext that she is a zombie. <br /> <br /> * And why did he release a woman who later revealed that he knew that he was the vampire head driving with him in his car? <br /> <br /> * Then let her drive alone with his daughter in the stolen car. <br /> <br /> The hospital scene is all about <br /> <br /> * What is the green goo about? <br /> <br /> * Why do vampires head? Begin to dress like nurses? <br /> <br /> * Why don't there be vampires to fight? Zombies? <br /> <br /> * What is the meaning of the necklace? What is it made of? Why is it killing vampires? And Jenna knows how. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's really fun to get a lot of questions about this movie. <br /> <br /> I have my plot. And I have to admit that it wasn't there <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Vampires vs zombies' don't have time in there. In fact, vampires are fighting against zombies. Everyone in the movie seems to know what has happened. But they seem unwilling to let the audience participate in this And how it depends on the 19th century classic horror novel? why? What happened?
