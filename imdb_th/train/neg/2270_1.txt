The only thing that prevented me from vomiting after watching this movie is the fact that these are just actors and not strange items that often appear on TV.

It approaches the deepest depth of bad movie production, even worse. I will not waste time explaining this film in more detail; When I was able to say that I had compassion on people who had problems with cameras that had to suffer from this first look.
