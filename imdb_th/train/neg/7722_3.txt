A terrible action movie starring Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee, stuck in a close friend role that doesn't seem to be a gel. The action is best, average, a little naked, and yes, Tia Carrera uses a double body! <br /> <br /> Set up as a normal blackmailer who is forced to break into a new partner in a big case. The manufacturer, at least, tries to make the formula turn to Lundgren as a cop with values. East and Lee Modern city shake But without the development of the character until it was almost a joke, Lundgrens, the Oriental warriors for the big show, had to be believed. Action sequences based on numbers and leagues (Who will do great in the crow) has never been given the scope to express any particular martial arts talent, but because of his famous parents, he must be under heavy pressure and perform well. Than without having to live with his father by taking a very different role in The Crow, which shows that he is a unique actor If not because of his tragedy and death, <br /> <br /> If not a Lundgren fan who is not hardcore or is a fan of the 80s style action movie (think Cobra, for example) Avoid <br /> <br /> Bad 3/10
