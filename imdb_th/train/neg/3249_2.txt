Jim Carrey is one of the most talented and funny comedians in this film. With his more agile actions and his tires, he is crazy and we love him. He has the ability to create a mediocre comedy (ala Ace Ventura) and make them a good comedian. Or in the case of 'Liar Liar', making them one of the most hilarious contemporary comedies Carrey also proved himself able to play drama. He is excellent both in 'Man on the Moon' and 'The Truman Show'. The man is outstanding. <br /> <br /> Then 'Bruce Almighty' is the ideal vehicle for Carrey and the place that should work. Carrey, after complaining about God and what his life looks like, activating with the power of God However, the script is pure recycled waste. Now, no matter how bad the script is, Carrie's only adaptation makes the scene funny. The problem is that there is very little chance that Carrey will be freed because most comedy movies rely on stupid special effects. Only some stories are funny Carrey rarely can burst because he has to use special techniques. Clearly, the author thinks that the special effects and these superpower sequences are funny because the rest of the film is just a filler that makes Carrie not have to work other than characters. Playful It seems that he likes our interest for 5 years. I want the audience to find that he's doing something funny when it's really annoying. <br /> <br /> I'm always happy with Jennifer Aniston in 'Friends'. And she is excellent in 'The Good Girl' last year She also has gifts for comedians. But the script is a straight line, as she just gave the bitter girlfriend She found that scolded, dissatisfied and without chemistry between the two stars. <br /> <br /> 'Bruce Almighty' seems to be a comedy that works. But it doesn't have the courage to deal with issues that make it fun. Religion. A little giggling. (His internet is Yehweh) But it turned out to be just a comedy. Not to mention that it is a sound that changes from stupid to tough and even black comedy sometimes. Movies fail at almost every level. That is not to see it without laughter. But it's close All movies that feel the need to include the scene of a pee dog to make it laugh. But wait, if you find that funny jokes <br /> <br />
