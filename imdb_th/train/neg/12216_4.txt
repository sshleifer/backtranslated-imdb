Don't understand me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love the series as well as the movie, but enough: Death On The Nile Everyone does this! We know who died We know why they died. We know who is the murderer. We know it's finished. So I said enough! Mr. Suchet is able to use another great talent in Agatha Christie's novel. I would say that every actor's performance is excellent. The scene was fantastic and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul, but I was surprised that he looked 'scary'. I hope he doesn't look like that in 'real' life! I can not remember from other films honestly, whether it is the ending. Somehow I don't think so I think that is a great feeling, whether you write it or not. I want to get to the end of that episode, lost in prison!
