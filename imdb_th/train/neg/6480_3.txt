It's good to see familiar characters again. But the story makes me annoyed We love Ariel in the first film - why the second story centered on her daughter? The new characters are annoying and I don't like this plot. Christopher Daniel Barnes didn't return like Eric! Disney, please stop creating classic movies with these imitations.
