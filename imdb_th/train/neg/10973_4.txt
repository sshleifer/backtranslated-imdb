If you love "Pulp Fiction" and like a mobile camera, you should love this movie. I like strange stories. (Although I felt "Pulp Fiction" was the most rated movie since "The English Patient") and found that the character was unrealistic, it wasn't "On the Waterfront" or "Citizen Kane" and had a burden. By pride in Europe But the worst part is the mobile camera It was a distracting and annoying thing. I found myself waiting a lot for the movie to end. I don't know why the new director thinks that the filming method is great. If you have a tendency to get drunk, your mobile camera will make you feel nauseous in about 10 minutes.
