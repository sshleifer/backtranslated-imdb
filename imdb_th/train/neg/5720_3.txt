Some lovely friends recommend "Live Feed" to me and in general I can't really complain because this movie has a lot of soot and buckets that are full of sleekness. But of course not a very good movie Rather than apparently happening in the latest trends in horror movies called Torture Porn, Ryan Nicholson tries to overcome all other matters in this subcategory. (And that includes the model "Hostel" and "Saw") with sickness & twisted makeup effects and disrespectful images of those suffering from trials and begging for their lives No real plot to explain. Twenty-five friends, the most stupid, five people travel to Asia. One of them has the foundation of Asia. But other than that, I don't know why they chose to travel there instead of going to Cancun. Obviously they do not care about the culture of the continent and even cause chaos when they see cute dogs in the market. A group of people dive into a terrifying night life and one of them insulted the leaders of the criminal tribe inadvertently. The apology is clearly not enough because the gangsters follow them into the adult theater. One woman had her breast plugged in, and another poor girl had a poisonous snake pushing her neck down. Yikes "Live feed" was surprisingly boring, despite the bloodshed and production costs Expertise is difficult to overlook, even if you are familiar with watching a garbage cinema. Independent fans like this This fat man appeared on the cover, which was the S&M commander. Oriental was quite cool and he was the most talented in the group because at least he was always gagged. I will not recommend this dirty pile. But hey, if you like metal music that is loud and ugly, annoying, torture images and dim losers ahead and see!
