How Grinch Christmas Stole is a wonderful Christmas cartoon that everyone can easily enjoy. I have never seen a reason for rework. Not to say that the remake created with the cartoon is perfect enough. What is the purpose of this movie? But it looks a little strange that Jim Carrey is the Grinch I mean, he's a great comedian. But he as the Grinch? It's not reasonable for me. His performances are slightly superior and unintentionally laughing. Not to mention some of the added conversations that are young and not fun. The whole story of Grinch and Cindy Lou - who did it and didn't want They just destroyed the story. <br /> <br /> Everyone in Whoville is preparing for their best Christmas season, but Cindy Lou - who is curious and worried about Grinch. That lives above them and he will not receive Christmas as good as others He kicked her out and decided that he didn't want Christmas this year, and in fact he should steal Christmas together to show who is his Christmas model. But soon he realized that those who might know that it is more than a concrete Christmas version <br /> <br /> How the Grinch Christmas steal is not necessary and is a bit at the top I suggest you stick with the cartoon just for the fact that this is a rather annoying version, at least in my opinion. The make-up and presentation of the entire movie is a little finished, not to mention that How the Grinch Stole Christmas! Is more meaningful than being a cartoon rather than the version starring Jim Carry
