Look, I like PROPER's Anchorman movie, but it's terrible. The kind of bad thing that makes you wish you can go back in your life. The bad thing that makes you think. "Things that are on the planet. They are thinking of filming this first thing." The bad thing that makes you wish. You have to spend another 50 minutes when stepping into the kitchen to find snacks in a bad movie that makes people leprosy look bad fun that makes you think you want to rent a Pauly Shore film instead ... seriously. I don't. Can explain how bad it is. <br /> <br /> I have to say that ... there is a laughing laugh. But all of them are less funny than Anchorman. Sure, they try to make it fun and fun. But all the plans from the Anchorman that have been here are truly left for good reasons ... It's not a good thing. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor (or in America as a favorite) and don't Watch this DVD ... It will make a good movie that Ann Corman is bad and you don't want to do that. <br /> <br /> Okay ... I'm okay.
