First of all, I do not want to watch this movie because the trailer impresses the general movie and that is too much anticipation ... but recently I was happy to discover "Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité "which is directed and beautifully written by Laurent Tirard (the author of" prête-moi ta main "). I changed my mind and decided to try" Prête-moi ta main "as good as" mensonges .. "And it's not like that. The script is not bad. But it is not directed like "Mensonges ..." Actor who is not generous (Especially Charlotte, as boring as she usually is) such as Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac and honest. I still don't understand how that shit will be successful despite the casting ... However, the story It may be an excuse to create many interesting plans, but not as good as Tirard's "brave men ..." although it is written by him as well. It is easy to work, not surprised and lazy. Set the value too!
