Here. Finally, the movie came out that I can say that it's worse than Larry the guy cable: health inspector. But I am willing to bet on the wayan brothers (hilarious) to make more money than I ever did in my entire life in what is sure to be one of the five worst movies of all time outside my fifth grade outside. The law of romeo and juliet. I mean, really, why are all those who have watched this movie unless they get paid? The comedian was weak and funny from the distance from the subtle story that was revealed in the ad. The last word is that this movie is a terrible thing for me. And the ads look very bright ...
