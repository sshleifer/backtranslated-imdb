I never watched movies in a little time. The only salvation is the bird function waiting ahead on the DVD player. It's like watching a CBC movie that is not produced well. Obviously there is no money for lighting, scene filming, editorial locations, actors ... Oh, no, of course! I have to write a ten-line comment ... Bad, terrible, scary, miserable, devious, tricky, disingenuous, nauseous, disgusting, ugly, ugly, disgusting, subtle, inconvenient -thumbs -down and I don't know if I can continue to complete all ten lines of this shit-matic-bad production!
