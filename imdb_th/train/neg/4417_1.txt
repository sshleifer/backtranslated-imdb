I am a Catholic who teaches in a parish primary school by a nun taught by a Jesuit priest in a high school and college. I'm still a practicing Catholic. But will not be considered "Good Catholic" in the eyes of the church because I do not believe the exact thing or do the exact method just because the church told me. <br /> <br /> So back for this movie ... It was terrible because these two people were killed by this nun, which should be the center of the religious female thinker. There is no joke in that story, and satire does not happen well from Diane Keaton's performance. I never saw playing But if it's very different from this movie, it may be good. <br /> <br /> At first I thought the gun might be a fake and the first shot was made by the female team leader. Four former students in an effort to demonstrate the emotional and intellectual passion of Sister Mary. But it turns out that ammunition is true and the story has a tragedy ... the tragedy of losing life. (In addition to two former students ... the life of a baby that has been abolished, the life of the student's mother), an illogical tragedy The authority over the love of people, the tragedy of religious organizations instead of true faith in God. This is wrong with modern Islam and Judaism and Christianity yesterday.
