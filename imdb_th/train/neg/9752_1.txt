I do not believe that things that have passed for entertainment now, death (and death), violence, sexual abuse, adults who threaten children, vulgarity, drinking by minors, drug theft, parents That is not perfect, the shepherd from hell Of the house in the middle of the night - definitely sounds like a movie for me - no !!! Add dark and scary elements - dead women occupy and transform into houses and make prisoners love her husband inside for over 20 years and also make the village frightening - cute for children, parents - this is what That you want your child to see - this is what you want to teach them about life! <br /> <br /> This movie is too scary for kids and I'm afraid that teenagers. Today may be living in some situations of this film - and why is it rubbing their faces? For mature audiences - you won't find it scary or amusing - just boring and predictable. And the character is unusual - naive parents, stupid police, stupid and annoying friends, nasty and manipulative nannies, and beer / boyfriend fans. Excellent material for kids - this sounds Does it look like a movie for children? Even computer animation and good sound are not enough to exchange this terrifying flick. Save your money, save your time and help to keep the minds of children - go to rent Ice Age, Monsters Inc., Incredibles, Shrek, A Bug's Life - they have a better way than this horror movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis - embarrassing for both of you who have suffered such a disaster and billed as a movie for children / families !!
