The scientist and his girl friend drove away when his acceleration caused the car to crash. He escaped danger But she was headless He helped to maintain her head, brought it to his house and made it live (!!!!). He then proceeded to search for models and dancers for the perfect body for the head. His disabled assistant kept his head, which began to talk and had a telepathic link. (Or telepathy) that connects with strange shaped creatures that are stored in the closet .... <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is a silly story, but I have some passion. Like for it When I grew up in the late 1970s, the local television station screened this movie about 20 times a year (without exaggeration). They always performed it on Saturday afternoons. TV - not cut. Seeing this on TV at that time was great Much! Clear blood and blood, along with horrible monsters and hardcore sex - who would be interested if it's good When I saw now, I knew that this was really a flea. <br /> <br /> The performance was so bad that the production cost didn't exist. (In addition to disgusting blood) This is a boring thing. There is also a gentle cat fight between two women and the big monster that was accepted at the end. It also adds in the ending which makes a ton of loose ends. On the one hand, this is an interesting example of the exploitation movie in the 1960's. It's not a good movie. But it is a must see (Only once) For the awesome fans and Gore, <br /> <br /> The head laugh is creepy. Record the credit that made the wrong TITLE (called "head that won't die")!
