I watched this movie purely for settings. It was filmed in an old hotel owned by a friend. The plot is predictable. The performance is best at a moderate level. The fear is something that is not scary. <br /> <br /> I can't remember that there are many things and I think that is Because Not much to remember. They do not use the hotel to its full potential ... Great beaches and hotels are located on the peninsula. During low tide, you can walk into the bay for almost 1/4 mile, which is a surprise in the morning or late at night when the wind blows through the cracks. This story has a remote in your hand so you can move forward quickly through action scenes. (And I use that word loose) the scene and stop at the beauty of the environment!
