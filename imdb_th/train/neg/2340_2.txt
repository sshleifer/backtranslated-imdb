Stories about the lives of the common people from Antwerp. Take their lives. So I spoke and there was nothing to tell about it anymore. The movie is as fast as MTV. Flick and shoot well and we feel that the director has the ability and should make more movies. So we will forget about this and hope for the best with Deus-Barman.
