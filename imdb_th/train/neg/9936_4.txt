Selected for 50 cents at the flea market. Very excited. <br /> <br /> I found it fascinating. About 15 minutes, then repeated and boring. <br /> <br /> It looks neat. Mick and the gang in their prime, I hope not to have anything more than dialogue, so I can hear what is said and played. <br /> <br /> The game is out of politics. And Monty Python's incredibly naive, poorly written on acid I spent more time looking back in the late 60s of England and what really happened in the silly game. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good reminder that time has changed. Really stupid. Good music, but now DVD is played to death.
