The beginning of this film is good. It started to be really stupid after he told the person he wanted to commit suicide. I think if I came from a small town like this, I would be offended after watching this movie. They make these people look stupid and crazy. These people have little ways to follow them throughout the day. Many times these people tell me how to kill themselves like they are urging him to do. How many people will have respect for others? I still think they should do better than the ending for this movie. There are some good parts in this movie. Some people may like it, but I won't recommend this to anyone.
