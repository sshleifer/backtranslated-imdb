For Shakespeare's first taste on the stage, I can't believe that these people played perfectly well. <br /> <br /> - Can you start well? - <br /> <br /> Alan Rickman doesn't matter, although some of his conversations will get a good feeling. The remaining actors have to pull it together. <br /> <br /> Romeo Romeo, why haven't you died? Romeo Actors while not only But only made of wood and Dead Sea Scrolls, can not read his words with gusto He didn't intend to have a problem, even looking at Juliet's face and not Grace with the line he received. Anyone who has removed him should be punished. Juliet almost passed away But she does not focus on her character and seems to be unable to experience the drama at all. Mercutio looks very creepy and does not have all the characteristics of his conversation. <br /> <br /> I'm forced to endure the production of a Romeo and Juliet half-face. The performance was presumed and the costumes didn't distract. I saw the puppet show of kindergarten with more effort. I just wish I could rate this movie to zero.
