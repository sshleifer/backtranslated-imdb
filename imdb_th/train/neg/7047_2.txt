Be warned: Both Zeta Jones and McGregor do not play as a main part because you believe it is a poster. Their role in reality is inferior. <br /> <br /> This film stumbles between a dramatized comedy and a realistic drama without really participating. In particular, I found that it was impossible to gather much sympathy for the main protagonist, not to mention his fellow footballers and the sex that was obsessed with his fiance The plot dragged horribly and I closed it after about 2/3 - unusual for me because I liked doing what I started to finish. Good performances and beautiful settings take from 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
