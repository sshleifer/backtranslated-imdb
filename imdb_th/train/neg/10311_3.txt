SPOILER ALERT in general action movies and memorable Lorenzo Lamas behaves as usual / cute boy OJ Simpson is a visiting detective. He disappeared quietly. Translated: Cable TV fillers There is not enough skin to assume that this is wrong. <br /> <br /> The script has some vulnerabilities. Best / Worst Moment: In the scene with the acclaimed scene, OJ's partner expresses hatred towards the morgue. OJ replied that some parts of the body are quite hot or the words that have an effect. This is enough offensive. But in terms of the murder that occurred shortly after the film was released, it was truly shocking and therefore entertaining in an unbelievable way. I was so shocked that I laughed until the champagne came out of the nose. Now that is a miserable happiness. BC
