This thing must be one of the worst movies of 1990, when my friends and I are watching this movie. (As a target group, it is targeted at) When the rest of the people in the theater just started talking or crying into their popcorn that they really paid, they worked to see weak excuses It must look like a good idea on paper. But in the movie, it seems that nobody in this movie has a clue what happened. Shit shows, shit costumes. I can't understand how interesting this story is. Save yourself your hour and life a little .........
