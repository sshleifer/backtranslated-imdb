Although there are many ways I agree with other reviewers, I find that the story and the idea are very good. Many actors who are very talented The serious problem of this movie is Ellen Pompeo. I'm sure I have never seen a "actor" that is less capable than this person in a movie or television. I can't imagine. In my opinion, she would be better as a Wal-Mart. To see low-skilled individuals involved in paying, ask questions ...... "You know someone?" I want to see. This movie is newly created with some abilities. I'm not wrong with writers because the failure of this movie is worth the time to watch.
