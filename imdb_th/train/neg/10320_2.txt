I sincerely hope that this will be a comedy show that gives all the hype and clever example clips. And talk about hype. I have heard interviews with BBC World creators today - programs that are broadcast worldwide. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this program is not close to the presentation. All jokes Apparently a funny voice the first time you hear them. But after that it looked stupid - and they would not be treated or twisted. Every character has one dimension. The performance is - good - medium (I'm a good person). It's a classic CBC formula - a formula that always fails. <br /> <br /> If you are a Muslim, I think you Must be stupid to believe that there are white characters and if you are white Feeling slightly offended by the fact that almost all white characters were shown to be big, big, ignorant or both. It's not that creating fun for white people is a problem - most of the best comedies are rooted in that story. It's a problem when it's not a joke - in this program <br /> <br /> Canada is full of many funny people that we regularly send to Hollywood. So why did the producer of this program not find it?
