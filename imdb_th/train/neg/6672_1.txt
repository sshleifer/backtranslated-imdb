I am 47 years old and I live as much as I can remember horror fans and sci-fi movies. No matter how quiet they are, black and white, no budget or big budget, few people I can't find anything. That said, I will give this film credit for the good effects of blood and life. But that's all This is a case of impact rather than matter. The truth is that we are in very little time left to see in horror. Therefore, for all kinds of movies that really entertain, it must have a good and original story. Good stories can beat bad effects and bad performances. But the bad stories with good performances and good effects are still bad movies. This film has no good performances, has only a good impact. So if you can't do just about the blood, pierce through this thing.
