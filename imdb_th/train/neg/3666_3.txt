This is a very confusing movie. This film is very difficult to follow and the story seems to be unreasonable. The Fury of the Wolfman was created in Spain and I think that when one of the films is called from one language to another, it can't be. Translate as it is right Perhaps this is part of the problem. But I wonder if it can explain all the problems of this movie? The dubbing of the voice is quite bad and the sound doesn't match the character well. The scene is lacking. There are many strange and irrelevant characters that make the audience more confused. What I like about this movie is my own image and the scene he attacks. Now, if they can combine and make it a reason, they may have something. Don't waste time on this.
