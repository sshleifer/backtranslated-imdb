I just came back from the free screening and "Osama Witch Project" is the worst movie I have seen this year, worse than "Catwoman", which is appropriate to pass itself into fiction. br /> <br /> In "September Tapes" is a "movie team" of "documentary journalists" heading to Afghanistan - although not well prepared for travel conditions and oh yes, spiteful and vain. their The filmmaker chief avenged his wife on September 11 - to follow Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br /> They "made" eight tapes on their journey, which is now "recorded". Of them and of course Tried to kill the terrorist leader (Eight tapes thank you to all the significant endings in the lecture, which is convenient for "documentaries") <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A funky character. May learn to watch "MacGyver" - ignore anything in his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of stupid accidents I do not know why he not only put a mark on his back that said "shoot me" <br /> <br /> The translator of the crew should hear the reason - reason, rather than sobbing. And dazed when the stupid hero leads them to disaster. <br /> <br /> You hope that they will take someone to travel to call them wise. <br /> <br /> Around the "tape 4" I began to take root for terrorists to film the movie team.
