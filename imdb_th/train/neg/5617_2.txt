This documentary film is based on considering the incomplete evidence that Brian Fleming may intend intentionally, not to mention the opposite evidence. Perhaps his most important mistake may be one of the first moments: His claims about the inaccuracies of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ ignore important facts such as: ** The existence of Some doctrine in Paul's letter These doctrines point out that most central claims about Jesus have already been defined in a statement of faith which may be possible within a few years after the death and resurrection of Christ. ** Testimony of Early Christians could not be driven out of imagination. There are many people who claim to be the Messiah during that time. But there is only one of them that remains: Jesus. Why? Because it would be an amazing thing for anyone who really believed that Christ was the Messiah and died for those beliefs if they knew that he was not resurrected ** even though the Gospel is dated That is more independent, we still talk about the story of Jesus written during the life of other witnesses who will point out the inaccuracies in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospel was written much earlier. <br /> <br /> What I say is Fleming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-service piece that Causing different arguments and evidence to serve anti-Christian views Don't be fooled by bad investigations.
