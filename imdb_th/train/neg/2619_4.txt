It's a great movie for kids who love dogs. It ran a little slow. But will end if the chaos of De De Vil increases. The basic plot is the same as the first movie. The bright side of the movie for adults is that the birds say that they think they are dogs. Birds speak like humans (Eric Idle of Monty Python) and bark like dogs. It's a funny movie that this movie needs more. Watch in the afternoon so you don't have to pay the full price or wait for it to appear in Disney.
