Anyone who sees the original must go out and destroy this terrifying remake. Alex Baldwin tried to mimic Steve McQueen's end with the words "New words didn't work." While Baldwin had an admirable work, this was a failure from the beginning to the end. McQueen was charming, never tried to compete with celebrities. For Kim in the role of Ali McGraw is enough to say, McQueen looks dangerous, scary and credible as Doc. The film is exciting and suspicious. Baldwin and the company make this a joke. That I saw a miserable movie And awesome hairstyles for Michael Masen, one of today's exciting and reliable actors! The makeup of the people is for Michael, what are they thinking about if you want to see the movie making in the way that it is under the direction of Sam Peckinpah? Get the original!
