This is the first sequel that I see (other than the Return of Jafar) and I think honestly before seeing that it is close to the original <br /> <br /> The story is basically the first chapter with a few special characters and the situation has changed. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody, who is not happy with life on land. She wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel kept her past from her daughter because she wanted to protect her - and when the melody knew she was upset and angry. Then she decided to flee and she became a mermaid. So she was happy with swimming and Ariel set out to search for a mermaid - <br /> <br /> The story wasn't bad. But the scenes and scenes repeated from the first movie are just too obvious and adding to the fact that the overall melody is extremely annoying and the movie is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> There is also New characters, both Tip-Dash and Dash, are both characters. They weren't too bad as characters in themselves - just try not to think Timon or Pumba! Songs also give many wishes as well. They do not have the magic power like the original songs. Obviously, the animation doesn't have a lot of workloads, both of which are scary and don't use much imagination for the character's movements. <br /> <br /> Another piece of advice - try. Forget the original character of Ariel while watching this movie. Beautiful and stubborn teenager, curious 'All grown up' to become a boring wife and mother and her red hair is stuck too. This will look a lot better if you have never seen the original - you will have nothing to compare with it. <br /> <br /> However, overall, it may be worse - not as bad as it should be. Like Cinderella II, but it's not in the same league as the original But for your collection if nothing else But if Disney continues like this, they will lose all their ex-fans.
