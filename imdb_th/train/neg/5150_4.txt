I received a DVD from the library, hoping to get a good idea of ​​how things can happen in the production of the big opera. I must say I am very disappointed. Subject has a lot of potential. The production scene of Wagnerian needs to be elaborate and impressive, and the story behind their creation and use may be an excellent educational experience. But what we get is a collection of clips of people moving around the big scene, helping with comments that can't be interested. I found myself listening to the background clips of the songs from the opera. I was impressed with the enormous effort required to produce - which was quite good and the next time I was at the theater I was confident that I would remember that part if this video - but felt cheated By lacking in detailed comments and explanations
