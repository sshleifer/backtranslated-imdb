Before I saw this, I saw a rather poor Christmas movie. But when I saw this "Jingle all the way" looks better than "The Godfather". "Santa Claus" is a jolly movie about Santa that helps some children. But it almost felt that the devil was watching Santa Ho Ho Ho was replaced by the evil laughing demon that I am sure has made many children out of Christmas. The story of this massacre is very strange, which is suitable for all performances and conversations. Santa lives over the world in the North Pole, where he and children from around the world prepare for Christmas. But Santa has an enemy named Pitch or Satan. Pitch tries to destroy Santa's Christmas by causing the three boys to misbehave and create variety, such as moving the chimney and making the door knob warm. When the curve causes the dog to be attacked by Santa, it is up to Santa Pedro and the Merlin Wizard to take Santa out of this pickle. <br /> <br /> Everything about the movie. This includes bad things. It's really amazing. Satan dances a lot and he actually looks more cheerful than Santa. Santa talks about delivering gifts to all boys and girls. But it seems that he will deliver home to only 5 children in Mexico The reindeer are toys that wind up and when the reindeer laugh, I was surprised that it didn't cause the tears of the kids ... It was scary. Everything was terrible. The first 10 minutes were just Santa playing the organ at the moment. The children sang may be one of the most strange scenes, Santa shot a butt in the butt with a small gun and suddenly laughed while the pitch danced around in pain. I think parents should tell children where children come from. Better show them. The only advantage is that it will make you laugh like crazy if you can appreciate the bad cinema. <br /> <br /> My score: BOMB / **** 85 minutes
