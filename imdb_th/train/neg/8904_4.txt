I like the "prophecy" of 1995 very much. Christopher Walken used to be excellent and although this film is not perfect. But it is an eerie and original horror / fantasy movie that is very entertaining. The sequel to 1998 is inferior. But mostly because Walken Walken is one of the greatest actors in my mind, and he once again stands out in the role of Archangel Gabriel, who fell for a second time here. Again, the war between fallen and loyal angels has been brought to the world. Gabriel came back to prevent the birth of a child, a child of angels Danyael (Russell Wong) and a woman, Valerie (Jennifer Beals). .. As I said above, Christopher Walken is great like Gabriel. In addition to Gabriel, however, "The Prophecy II" also includes extremely annoying characters. Valerie's character is annoying, and Danael makes me even more annoyed. The biggest pain in the ass, however, is the character of Izzy. (Played by Brittany Murphy) A suicide woman who refuses to close her mouth Still, Walken's performances are not just the quality of movie exchanges. This film is quite boring and can be shot well in dark colors that cause a lot of atmosphere. Gabriel's first resurrection scene was quite impressive and one of the greatest moments in the movie "Prophecy". "The Prophecy II" remains the weakness of the three "Prophecy" movies that have Walken, of course, Christopher Walken, the only person who shows entertainment. But nothing more than that
