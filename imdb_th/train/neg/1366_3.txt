** There is a spoiler ** <br /> <br /> A truly wonderful Sean (In some scenes with her hairstyle, it seems that Elizabeth Taylor) will stand out in the opening moments of this film Sitting behind the police car waiting to signal her chest, face and body taut and distracted. Unfortunately, the breasts of the young men were badly changed. This is one of the most disruptive actors. <br /> <br /> There is only a comparison of Young and the actors playing with her colleagues and best friends Arnetia Walker to understand what was lost in Young. Walker is open, emotional and comfortable at all times ... There is no clear obstruction between what she might feel with its expression. She is an open book. On the other hand, the young man also shows his angry and self-conscious posture that you might expect your neighbor to show when they are thrown into the movie. Essentially, she has no clue. <br /> <br /> With this important space that appears in the middle of the movie, we are left to ponder the impossible story. For example, after Miss Young was kidnapped by a criminal and locked in the closet, she broke down the door when being left alone. She actually dressed in underwear and panties only. But in a similar situation with a psychotic arrester who will come back at any time, you have to hurry to the door ... or take the time to dress up his clothes, take off and dress up. I guess this scene and other scenes Is trying to introduce some mixed emotions that the character of Miss Young is facing, but Young cannot convey this complexity. <br /> <br /> There are moments that affect a few movies. Such as brief police interviews with former victims of criminals But overall, this was a pointless effort. It was terrible that Miss Young was replaced while filming a pair of comic-style movies that might take advantage of her limitations with humor (BATMAN and DICK TRACY) because she struggled in While trying to play real people, watching Miss Young try to show at least the "thriller". This is a sad picture.
