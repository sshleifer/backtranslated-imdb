This is one of the worst movies ever. I like magic movies But this is terrible Where are the pictures in the movie on the box? I think spending more money on DVD box illustrations than in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Why does the company release the DVD that is misleading? I felt like an idiot who rented this movie, especially on the box. As far as I explore IMDb, I should do a little research and make a list before visiting my local video rental store. I have no one to blame except myself I need my money and time. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Although curiosity inspires you to stick a cocktail umbrella in your eyes It will be more fun You have been warned!
