This movie is a rather strange viewing experience. This movie is based on playing. Now I'm sure everything in this movie is good to play. But in the movie, it just feels not interesting enough to watch. This movie is too 'stage' and they don't care to change some conversations to suit more movies. But what is presented at the moment is the filming of the stage drama again, with characters and dialogue scenes. For this reason, the story is ineffective, and the movie becomes a complete and obsolete viewing experience. <br /> <br /> It takes a moment before you understand that this is a comedy that you watched in At first, you thought that it was the drama that you were watching with a strange character in it, but when the movie continues, you will notice that this movie is more tragic. And chapters Generation is what makes this film a strange and unparalleled movie, sometimes it may not be acceptable. Of course, the actors are excellent. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York among others, but they do not raise the film to the level 'That can be viewed' <br /> <br /> The story is completely confused. Basicaly, what the story is about and focuses on the character of the brother / sister played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what is the story? The movie feels like pointless and outdated with very little to offer. As I said before I'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage. But it is a film that is inappropriate and ineffective. <br /> <br /> The editing is horrible and time and it becomes Even the bad laughs in some scenes Worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
