The great skill of Arthur Askey as a cartoon is the way he communicates with his public. Jokes for children and youth, stupid music and his crazy dance dwindled because he was able to engage the villagers and pull them into the world outside his walls The lack of a live audience is a clear disadvantage for him and he never feels comfortable with the movie. He has his time in The Ghost Train and Tommy Gander. His characters are tailored to get his highest talents, but Askey, the actors need to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Support Askey's in this movie is not strong, Richard Murdog joins the show regularly; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham are intoxicating honeymooners. Linden Travers stepped past the top spot as 'Mad Woman' Peter Murray-Hill, who is On the screen, married Phyllis Calvert as one of the leading actors who gave gentle reading in this chapter and Carol Lynn, a leading woman. It was left for the actress Kathleen Harrison to easily steal the movie as a young woman who loves the broken parrot of Dr. Brandy. Moreland Graham
