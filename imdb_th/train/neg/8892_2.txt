Must accept this version, disgraces Shakespeare in advance! No one can do it except the nurse I like! Juliet has good skills as a teenager. But she can't give a deep emotionality to her field and we can't connect with you She's worse in the scene when she thinks of drinking sleeping pills ... God stops whining! I will pour in her mouth to close her! Anthony Andrew ... Oh! Considering his other great films (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), he was quite shocked about this. And don't let me start at Romeo ... puhleasssssee! It is also good to see that you are pursuing to see Romeo and Juliet, all who have created in the history of the movie or not. Olivia and Leonard's versions are still the best models, followed by Leslie Howard's version. And Leo and Clare present!
