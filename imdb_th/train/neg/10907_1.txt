I expect this movie to be similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I like. However, this fool seems to be forever. It was one of the flicks that enjoyed the sad laying of PG-13 while not suitable for children. The jokes are not just low eyebrows or jokes. They are rude, obscene, and many actions across the boundary. But only bad taste It seems that there are many scenes that have been shuffled to get the PG-13 score ... Too bad ... It might make the big movie ranked R if this movie is very funny. Do not recommend this movie It's a waste of time ... and I'm a movie lover and ready to shoot everything. After 45 minutes, this movie feels like it will end ... and we are ready for children. The ending is strange. But did not help to recover the rest of the pit / traveler traps of 1/2 star (glad that I saw it as a freebie ... would be uneasy to pay the hard earned money for this rag )
