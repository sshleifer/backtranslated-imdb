"The Dream Child" of 1989 is the fifth film in the series "Nightmare" (usually exaggerated) and eventually from this point the series becomes all garbage. The only good movie in this film is the original Wes Craven manuscript in 1984 and the third part "The Dream Warriors" of 1987. The second part is disappointing and boring and is the fourth part in which the madman. Previously, Freddy Krueger began to interfere with constant jokes. The fifth item in this series is hardly recommended at all, except for the pictures (excellent) and the creepy scenes dating back to how Freddy Krueger existed. The rest of the film mostly consists of crazy people. Our crazy-turned-jokester shouted stupid-torpedoes and the old recipe of a group of stupid people who tried to avoid sleeping because Freddie was old. The dream Lisa Wilcox returned to Alice's role. Johnson and a lot of vociferous stories, such as the creepy touch of boring children, were added without any other reason except there was a reason for creating this boring and boring sequel .. In the short term: no idea Initiate just a drop of old formulas and many annoying annoying jokes. My 3/10 (generous) rating is caused by great images and especially to emphasize. Usually the difference of the frightening "Freddy's Dead", which is awesome beyond belief. In the event that you are not a fanatic, Freddy Krueger should avoid it. "The dream of a child" and even if you are like this
