In the name of God, what happened here? One way to create something that is really knocking down the cheap price of Redneck Zombies? Zombie '90 should entertain somebody ... anyone or make a profit in dollars? But most of what happened here. <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence directed by Madman by the name of Andreas Schnaas, who specializes in broken world films such as Goblet of Gore and Anthropophagus 2000 and some There is rudeness in the title in the blood department. This does not differ much from the rest. Although the level of imperfection ... Okay, the vibration of the world. <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence is terrible, like Peter Jackson's dead-alive, full of blood. <br /> < br /> Being too specific with the story will waste time. Chemical-related accidents cause the dead to return and eat life. Concepts that have never been treated in this way The blood trauma effect is very low. Just a nightmare at level Z. I can't tell if it's a joke. In any way, I suspect that the English dubbing is true to the original script, but things have happened. The whole thing reminds me of a short video introduction about the Troma movie, except for this film. <br /> <br /> I've seen only one worse thing. Chooper <br /> <br /> To prove that Andreas Schnaas is a true director, I recommend Nikos The Impaler. If you think you There is no standard in what you look for in a bad movie. Try Extreme Pestilence, but you have been warned. Use the nerves of steel to pass through. But if all your blood is here, you can eat this food. Apart from that, there is no atmosphere and I mean no budget, no entertainment value. But most are not proud Show pride Schnaas 1/10 <br /> <br /> Updated on 7/5/09: After watching Zombie '90 a couple of times, I have a change of heart or I guess I just got it. Get it now. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so don't worry about cruel words, even though Extreme Pestilence should still receive only one star.
