For fans of Laurel and Hardy, 40s and above is a very sad time for the team. Their contract with Hal Roach Studios has expired and now they are "Independent agent" - able to work for the studio that offers the job for them Unfortunately, Fox, RKO, MGM (no cockroaches) and even the French film company that hired boys did not experience their comedic talents. More than that, Stan and Ollie are older and seeing this old man is pratfalls. Sadly, it's not a joke. In particular, Stan looks very shabby and Ollie's weight rises to the point where he can't walk - And it makes me feel uneasy to laugh and laugh at me. <br /> <br /> In addition to their age This film has suffered because Fox Studios has a role to support and create a parallel plot involving young couples - something that reduces their time on the screen and turns. They become Cute and cuddly. Stan and Ollie are very foreign to Laurel and Hardy in the 20s and 30s - and seem very strange and bad for them. <br /> <br /> Now, even though their age will have Used to be a good movie if it had been written well and if it appeared that the studio cares - and it is quite clear that they use "Unit B" here - with the best second class support In particular, there are only a few laughs and the last 10 minutes of this film are just scary, relying on a sloppy rear projection screen for stupid chase scenes that may be one of the worst types in Movie history <br /> <br /> For Laurel and Hardy's zombie lovers, it's probably the movie they'll love. But for the team's lovers who are willing to evaluate this film in good faith, compared to their previous amazing movies In the reality of their full-length movies before the 1940s, I couldn't think of something I liked less than DANCING MASTERS. Unfortunately, the post-1940 movie, this story may be one of their better movies. Sadly, it's a lot worse - with miserable movies such as big voices and nothing but problems. I just hope that kids will retire after SAPS AT SEA. <br /> <br /> Finally, I wondered if the criticism All positive for this film in IMDb may reflect the love of the investigator rather than indicative. Is this a good movie? For viewers who do not have a love for the team, I do not know what this movie will do but bore the audience. Of course, it will not make anyone believe that Laurel and Hardy are comedic geniuses. Still, intelligent geniuses also need valuable materials for their abilities.
