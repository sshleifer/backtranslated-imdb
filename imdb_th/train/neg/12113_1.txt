The Townies are the most lazy movies I've ever seen and I saw the Blair Witch movie (part one and two) seem to be confused by what it wants. It's not funny enough for comedy. It's not sad enough for the drama, not enough blood for horror, and it's not good enough for watching. There was a scene of a man who made "slapstick / bloody" karate, so I thought, oh, this movie will be in the veins of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Woman with mental retardation (Mental disability) and trustworthy mother Then it slapped himself as the only good part in the movie, which seems to be installed like a sitcom without laughter. The part I mentioned was the lonely TOWNIE, which was very lonely. He found comfort in the rotting corpse. That's just part of the movie that gives me feelings. The rest is the waist of my life. Then, just to show that CRUEL Wayne has any kind of document at the end of the movie Wayne (director) that makes Toby fun (star) in public, it makes me sick even if Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd. (Two more movies from Wayne) aren't the best. But at least they think that you will be entertained until the credit is over. I also like Killer Nerd a little, but there are still some lines that I still use today. <br /> <br / > If you like underground movies, if you like the underground movie and if you like to watch the feet They stay. You will not like this city. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (from ****) <br /> <br />
