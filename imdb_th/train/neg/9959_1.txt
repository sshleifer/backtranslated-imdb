Cheap and distorted This movie has no heart. <br /> <br /> There are also horrible conversations, unreliable characters and scary stories or no stories. It's just hailing from bad to worse, in an insulting attempt to unravel some emotions from hysteria and insecurity! <br /> <br /> and HEDGEHOG !!!! Porcupine, by the way of giving the most convincing and watchable performances in this ninety minutes For this movie The score is zero, big, fat with me. Strictly for dogma knicker-wet sub. Yawneroony! <br /> <br /> If you like Dancing In The Dark ... <br /> <br />
