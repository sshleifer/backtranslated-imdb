By Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> Perfect gang robbery plan Everything went wrong They are having problems Police outside They're on the corner. What will they do now? <br /> <br /> Listen to the sound. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be trying to combine the "Indie" movie theater and the theater. <br /> <br /> It is something that actors like - it's like a workshop or a drama, because it mainly consists of strong emphasis on the actors ... acting, anger, stress, stress, fear of conversation. Planning a plan - offering a free range for real actors. <br /> <br /> Three bandits, one leader, a cousin, a brother, come up with a big robbery plan .. and a monkey wrench is thrown. Into the work Above all there is "fender-bender" and one of the crooks that were flung through the back of the windshield <br /> <br /> The police were on their tails and they stumbled in the bar, the poem name (and lead) " Dino's Last Chance "<br /> <br /> Spacey, as a director, tries to focus on the actors' performances. He swept away the fascinating red cigarette ads of smoking. And he uses violence outside the screen. <br /> <br /> I think that's a mistake. Focusing on the violent and gruesome scenes will make the movie clear. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that it moves too slowly and suffers from abortion in almost every role. Matt Dillon ("The Cowboy Store" and "Wild Things") look too young and idealistic than being the leader of this gang. <br /> <br /> Gary Sinese seems to be lamenting and deep. Along with these guys and Joe Mantaga are powerful as a police agent, a crazy dog ​​that has traditionally broken the thumb. But he didn't really give anything here. <br /> <br /> William Fischter is the only one. An actor who has confidence in his role as an impatient person who wants blood. <br /> <br /> And the robbers are in a tense situation where they go to jail or try to figure out a way. This <br /> <br /> Spacey lacks the ability to create tension and keep it going. Most characters talk out, try to plan ... and they are calm and clear too. There is even a scene where the robbers are playing pool with a group of armed police outside ready to attack. At one point, one robber called the police outside the bar. Oh, brother, Oh, annoying. <br /> <br /> These police will blow it out or lock it. Shouldn't be buried that is a little scary. All the real actions happen inside. <br /> <br /> Some people shoot a baseball bat, which leads to a confrontation outside the ugly screen. Somewhat sad, but ... <br /> <br /> Faye Dunaway should spend more time with the local coach by improving her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich works well in smaller parts. <Br /> <br /> Police listening at the worst time is a good look. And the scene in which someone enters the rear windshield. <br /> <br /> The dialouge tries to approach David Mamet clearly and disrespectfully. <br /> <br /> Movies feel like it's too much. Actually ... It's a low-cost movie that has actors behind the camera for the first time, directing other actors. From the script that "not bad but needs a few more rewriting" Spacey shows that he is not a horrible director But he lacks the feeling of "Make a movie" and feel that he is just an actor being filmed. <br /> <br /> These actors are capable and able to work with content. But they all feel out of place As I said earlier, this movie suffers from abortion. <br /> <br /> I don't mean that the actors are wrong. I think they found only the right actors. But putting them in all wrong roles I think some role-playing will help tremendously. <br /> <br /> Having a professional actor like Joe Mantagna plays the leader of the Gary Sinese group as a police officer who is angry with her heretics in his megaphone. His forces make the fighters in the part. "His blood-thirsty blood" and Matt Dillian are like sacrificial lambs. That will be a big improvement. <br /> <br /> When some actors work They can also win an Academy Award. But many times when actors direct, they tend to focus on acting. Just shoot the actors <br /> <br /> sometimes use ... but they want a good showcase Excuses for it. <br /> <br /> The hostage situation is the same in real life, like the story of the era to come, so it is common for movies about them to go from point A to point. B as well. <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful parts in this genre. 'Spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about the hostage situation: "The Negotiator" <br /> <br /> Things This will not become a classic cult. Definitely one of AFI's 100, it has a few good moments. And personal touch But in the end it was immediately recognized and was the type of movie that would play best on normal TV <br /> <br /> I give 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Spacey's other credits "Beyond The Sea" is better news than trying. Hmm ... It might be true. You must fail before you succeed. <br /> <br /> By Dane Youssef
