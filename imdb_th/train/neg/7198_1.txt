After the live performance of George of the Jungle with Disney's flair, I had high hopes for this flick. Major disappointment Thread plot, nude, bad performances, bad effects This film is based on the lame, lame person, idiot. (And pointless) product placement I took two young children to watch and they were tired of their thoughts. The only laughter received from this movie is the poor standby mode when you want to laugh.
