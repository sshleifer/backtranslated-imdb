Fake scenery can destroy the image or not? You won't think so, but actually for me here. Listen to me. There are many classic movies and I know what to exclude, such as a driver who drives a car that cannot move in front of the screen. In the fake scenery, the fake mountains and flowers were shot after shooting as seen in "Brigadoon" received insulting after a while. <br /> <br /> As far as musical entertainment goes, this is always a personal matter. What kind of music that one person likes another might not be suitable to be part of the movie judging. (Regardless of whether people like music) I can blow this film for beautiful songs about dance, dance and characters in the 1950s, but that is the 50s and many people like things like this. In my 50s, I like the '30s and' 40s with a brilliant tap in the 50s. Knock out and this new thing - which I can stand - is it that makes this movie a punch? No, it makes the people I don't care very much. <br /> <br /> Despite the talented actors, good directors and high expectations, this movie explodes at the box office and with me. I should like it more. Being a dreamer and that is a good part of this story. I am not a mockery and a good city and good people make me feel good. If so, why can't I connect to this movie? Part of it is dance. I don't care about the stuff that replaces the tapping on the screen, but - no - the thing that really makes me close to the drama is that Scotland doesn't have a plateau, just a strange background to make it look like. And made me almost from the beginning Score one point for today's realism that they "Going in place" most of the time
