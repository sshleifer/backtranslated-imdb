Winterkill is based on Richard Conon's novel, which deals with the conspiracy to kill the United States president 20 years ago. I know that Condon also wrote Manchu, a candidate who handles similar themes. And looking forward to meeting the intelligent thriller. <br /> <br /> WINTER KILLS makes me cold. It's not a thriller - it's a nonsense story that may be the worst movie I've ever seen this month and boys. I've seen many bad movies in June. The problem arises both in the direction and script, and when William Richers is responsible for both, then he should be blamed on a never ending joke. <br /> <br /> There are two things wrong with the movie First of all is the way that everything is presented perfectly. It's not OTT, as I said, something like James Bond movies with David Niven and Peter Zeller. But everything has a different view This may be the right thing if there is entertainment according to the characters in the movie. But none As a very stupid word, it was almost stupid and almost impossible to overlook. The second scene seems to be cut so much that they show unconscious results. For example, the scene in which the hero is facing the leader of the volunteer army called Dawson. Dawson told the hero that he started 30 seconds, then cut the hero on the plane. The scene begins and ends without touching and reasoning. <br /> <br /> A scary movie which is a test that must pass.
