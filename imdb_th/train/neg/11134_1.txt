This is a werewolf flick made at a very cheap price. Dark and poor video The sound is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed. The script is a junk that has a character-like content, like a heavy detective who shot a werewolf with a silver pistol! [Filled with silver bullets] The acting is a wood that is an FX character that does not exist. There are many close-ups of jaws, werewolves and bites. The only thing that is shown is the soft-core T&A. A lot instead of $ 30 for this rag. Try to see a great werewolf image recently: "Dog Soldiers" and Sean Pertwee
