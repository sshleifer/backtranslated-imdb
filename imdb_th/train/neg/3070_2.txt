Oh, dear .... They have changed what is quite a provocative idea to become a frantic Testers Festival. <br /> <br /> This film in 1971 edition The original looks vague about our heroes. He is trying to drive from Denver to San Francisco to win the bet. Why is he risking his life with the price of a pair of top shoes? We are not really sure. <br /> <br /> We had a couple of events that saw us as an adrenaline junkie and assumed that he had spent his entire life trying to make it disappear. At that point you will see in the distance the left and right shoulder of the road come together and the road disappears. He lives only to be free and has no meaning to anyone. We see many times when an accident occurs. He stops to make sure that the other driver is okay before moving on. Following him <br /> <br /> When he saw the futility of his mission, he spent his life. Instead of being arrested and living in captivity He died as if living open. <br /> <br /> In the remake, Kowalski has a whole history. (Including the real name too) He tried to go to the hospital where his wife was suffering from complications. Her pregnancy He is a dedicated and excited husband with the expected father. He decided to spend his life after hearing his wife die in the delivery. But they let it be a problem when they suggested that he might jump out of the car before it ran into the bulldozer. They also give part of "super soul" which is a blind DJ (played by Clevon Little in the original) for JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?!? Let me take a break.
