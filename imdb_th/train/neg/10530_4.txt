The disappointing version of Anna and the King of Siam, Margaret Landon, filmed in 1946 by Irene Dunn and Rex Harrison Deborah Kerr as a widow teacher. Many of the children of the king - and perhaps perhaps teaching one or two things in this process! Stagy images start well. But will lose power and focus quickly. Yul Brynner, who shows his stage success as a king, is the commander But was used - following the story of the composer - as a clown Brynner looks like he has nothing left to translate the screen, except the blast. The second half with Anna and the moppets performing the musical version "Uncle Tom's Cottage" is quite ridiculous and Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs are mostly logs. Brynner won the Academy Award for Best Actor. But Kerr, who has a cheerful heart that takes care of these children above the water Protracted, heavy and outdated in the worst terms of words ** from ****
