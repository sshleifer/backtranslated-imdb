There seems to be an overwhelming response to this film. But there is no one who has a deep understanding of the criticism of its methods, which is very flawed. It still presents an analysis of the style of journalism, which is that the audience lacks knowledge and prejudice to cause intense emotional emotions and eruptions of negative words. <br /> <br /> Journalism 101: Tell the audience of some truth only to motivate them into the drawing conclusions that can be predicted.
