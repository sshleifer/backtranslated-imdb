So cheap, I just came back. Before I started the review, I told one thing: I wanted to like this movie. I know I've been negative in the past. But I hope to be surprised and really like this movie. I can't. <br /> <br /> It's not just the fact that every and not just the fact that they make everything. Little became a fear of jumping. (Walking into a baseball bat, leaving on the floor? Are you kidding me?) It's not scary. One thing that surprised me about: There was more blood than I thought there would be .. which didn't say much. <br /> <br /> The movie started when Donna dropped out of Lisa's mother at her house. She entered. Come up to the upper floor The camera of her father's pan died on the frightening sofa. She went upstairs, where the bat baseball scene happened. Found that her brother was in bed, apparently dead (How can you tell he doesn't see his blood?) The killer enters Madonna, hiding under the mother's bed. She ran out, screaming for help. The killer behind her: "I do it for us, then" cut for healing session. Many people are confused - everyone asks if her family actually died or if she imagined - and she said how the nightmare began to come back. The dialogue of the filler is as desired. <br /> <br /> They are cut to the chase quickly. A few scenes at the store, they go to the hotel. Of course, the murderer was there. (For some reason, he fled three days ago, but the police / family were not informed until he was there). The fillers are gone. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to talk about What happened in the movie because I didn't want to waste too much If you want to know who is dead, Horror_Fan has made a post about it. But in the matter of death, they were not that excited. People in the theater laughed out loud (an experience I had never seen before in horror movies, even when the name A Stranger Calls). The most hilarious 'scared' face I've ever seen The only death about any blood is Lisa and that is quite rare. Her throat was slaughtered. (If you can call it really black) smudges on the curtains Another thing is Claire's blood when we see her body. Obviously, Fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death. Um, ok? Is this movie one of the most ancient ideas I've ever seen? Let's see here .. Forcing off the glass curtain-BOM! Scene. Verify true twice. (You can tell that they are struggling.) Force backup in the monitoring program. There is also a backup scene to the lamp. But you all see Oh, do you say you need fear from birds? You already understand! (Yes, they manage to include one in here) and of course the scenes that we have secured on all out. But he still escapes me. Will I do it? <br /> <br /> For anyone who says that the character is not stupid, are you joking with me? "Oh, even though the big alarm is ringing by itself. The letter says that please make the building die and 3 of my friends disappear. I will go upstairs to get a conclusion. "These characters are some of the most flawed and stupid characters. The only cute character - Lisa - is one of the most stupid movements in the movie. "Oh, I just know that Psychiatrist is here! I have to leave my big girlfriend behind to run away by myself to remind you! Oh, shooting an elevator is going to be slow or not. Guess I'm going to take the stairs and escape. Enter the construction site! "Ugh. At the end of the movie, they all deserve to die. The only death that everyone feels guilty of is Donna's boyfriend. (I can't remember his name - is it that bad?) And at that time, the audience was bored with movies that were ridiculous. Br> There are some positive effects - the show is suitable for most and is a picture that good But that's about it. <br /> <br /> I'll give you 1/5 and it's just good to laugh. (And believe me, the audience is small) and Brittany Snow <br /> <br /> Oh and the reaction isn't good Very bad. People booed after the movie ended and the murmur after that was very negative. Expecting a bad leg for this one
