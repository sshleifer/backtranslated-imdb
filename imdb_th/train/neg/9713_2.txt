The first time I watched Cold Case was after using it for about a year on Danish television. At the time it came to the TV, it almost drowned in 4 or 5 other American crimes. The show aired at the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw it and I was bored until death. The performer is below the standard with a righteous face and morals as pain in the back. All the evidence that there is a lot of money has been investigated in order to solve the 10-20-30 or even 60 years of homicide. It seems unlikely. <br /> <br /> Time is a factor for them. There are only 50 to 60 minutes to tell the story, which means they stop to fix the case and bring justice to the surviving family members if they are still alive. This combined with the "personal" problem and the relationship of the examiner who had time for leaving the list of completely lacking clarity. <br /> <br /> I gave 2 star rating because the music was over. Which is actually the only reason to watch it .... which of course you won't do that because it's too stupid. The reason for watching this shit
