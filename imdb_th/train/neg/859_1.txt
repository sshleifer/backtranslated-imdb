I caught the explosion of this movie in the cable channel recently and was warned that I thought it was bad in 1980 when it was first released. Many critics are not old enough to remember the greatness that surrounds this film and the struggle between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. A very popular novel, there are many fans wanting to see the "Master" director wearing a supernatural story. Several layers on the screen "Salem's Lot" have been destroyed in the late 1970s as a mini-TV series directed by Tobe Hooper (he was from "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" celebrity) and received no management. Good cause the important villain of this book to become The vampires are not dangerous at all, so destroy all the evidence. Fans hope Kubrick's director will succeed when Hooper fails. It doesn't happen. <br /> <br /> Sure, this movie looks good. And has an excellent opening sequence But after a few successes, it ended. Jack Nicholson cannot be anything other than Jack Nicholson. He is often mad and does not bring anything to his role here. I don't care. Many critics here think that he is all in this clinker. "This is Johnny!" Even though it is ... he's just scary in this movie. For others, the character of Scatman Crothers, Dick Halloran, is important to the plot of this book, but Kubrick killed him in the most famous "shocking" scene ever in the movie. I remember the audience in the theater that I saw this thing, repeated over and over again in the last 45 minutes of the frustrating flick of those who were ... many others left. The King's books were never translated well because of the many stories that occurred within him and often metaphysical. Kubrick expressed the tension between living things and the dead in favor of the style here and the chaos that ended. The original material, which we eventually did not care about what happened to anyone. <br /> <br /> The film continues. Stink and why many people think it's a horror masterpiece that is above me.
