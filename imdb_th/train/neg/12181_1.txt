Unfortunately, there is no 0 for ranking, otherwise I will choose it. This film lacks the power of stars in many original movies. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocent of Aileen Quinn, newcomer and professional director from Pro John. Han (Angelica Huston's actor's father) is what makes this film charming. Even reminiscent of 1999 with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth, there are many more proposals. An excuse for this sequel. Before she did this movie, everyone, Ashley Johnson, was known for her role as Chrissie Seaver in the big show Growing Pains. She had some parts in the movie. But I do not know who thinks that she has the ability to show movies by herself and add Joan Collins to Lady Edwina Hogbottom. Nonsense! They have not enough performers to play important roles such as Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan and Annie, but they will sign Joan Collins to play as an English woman. Not surprisingly, this movie was bad as it was. Critics have the right to disagree with this film, although it is only created for TV. But it was a poor sequel to a cute movie
