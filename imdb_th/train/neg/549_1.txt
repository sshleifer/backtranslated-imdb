I can't believe that the Indian film industry is still throwing garbage at a third rate, like Waqt. For beginners, the story is unbelievable, right? The robbed son was thrown out of the family's home to teach him to be sufficient. And what will he do He was awarded the national talent contest by jumping the star in front of the jury immediately. (I'm not kidding here) At the same time, his father is dying of lung cancer. But kept secret from the son But he survived long enough to see his son become famous to see his new nephew and make a new toy giraffe with his own hands. <br /> <br /> That performance is blessed to be its hamminess ?? There is no attempt to try and act in a convincing manner by the main players in this film. As usual for Indian movies, the family lives in a large mansion and looks like no one is touched by the worries of the real world. Wise audience Who made a mistake in watching this movie, actors such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar will still be respected as gods by those who have nothing but faith in the Bollywood blind
