(Front spoiler) Imagine Russian "action" (and I use this word loosely) that I have been trying to watch for over a year. Finally I reached the end and now I hope I won't try again. <br /> <br /> In an effort to save your life for two hours, I'll tell you that he's planning A man with the ability to project a long blade out of his arm to see his mother. The ugly thing after he was hit by a mafia fan of an old girl friend He avenged the man when he brought the girl home. The mafia mother sent her out for revenge while the police began to look for him. <br /> <br /> Speak very little. There is no explanation for anything (such as why they lock ID fans). In the hospital) and most actions are all screens This movie consists of a man who looks like Adrian Brody looks violent and doesn't say anything, killing people (outside the screen - most actions happen outside the screen). It looks good, serves well, and has some reason for What happened, it could be a good movie. Hell, I would like the feeling of real character development or retrospective. (All we know is someone who is chosen as a child). The movie works better in two hours and feels like six hours. If they don't tell us anything, at least they can step up quickly, so it looks like they are moving too fast. No, we get the hero on board. The hero in the bus, the hero walks, the hero looks disturbed with his girl. It's really annoying because I think this is probably a good movie if they do something or someone says something meaningful, apart from giving advice on "Get this man" <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, about four hours (All my efforts to see this thing) I will not come back. Only for those who want to watch Russian action movies lamenting with very little action.
