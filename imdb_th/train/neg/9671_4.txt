I may give 6 or 7 to this propaganda movie because it shows when and how successful propaganda movies If there are people who watch this work and think "Then the Jews had to do something to be treated in the way they were treated in WW2." Then the movie was very clever to conceal. And false observations about people's lives What is the purpose of propaganda movies? The parts that are included in the American film about the Rothschild family have been used repeatedly. The question of why Jews do not give their wealth away from officials No one talks about the taxation system within that particular social class. <br /> <br /> In addition, the level of excitement. (Or the level of disgust) in the movie increases slowly and the end of the movie set Goals and requirements for propaganda The audience will go out with joy and gratitude at the time of the upcoming ... Well done. <br /> <br /> In the film, there is a kind of simplicity that responds to basic emotional awareness of audiences This movie is a story of history today, so there is no need to worry about this. However, in the simplicity of the words of ethnic degradation, the watchdog can find relevance to current cultural hatred, violence, destruction, as well as problems of integration. Overall, good trash
