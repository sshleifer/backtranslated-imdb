I almost cried until tears. Not from laughing But from the memory of the great Rodney Dangerfield movie, Candyshack is his first one and steals the best Easy Money movie for him and Back To School is a classic masterpiece in the 1980s. Then there are Ladybugs and that. Is when it starts to show Poor Rodney's age. (Meet Wally Sparks, a little step from Ladybugs, but don't say much) <br /> <br /> In my 5 wife Rodney plays Monza (The name that he must love since then is his name in Easy Money) The rich man (Not always him) who loves women and marries like nothing He now has a large legacy and since the land of Amish is in progress, he has inherited 5 wives. It sounds like a good idea for the movie Dangerfield. The problem is everything. The script was so bad that it seemed that Rodney would say one of his torpedoes with the camera and every character had nothing to do. The movie seems to be filming the video with a poor stunt scene, which is not Rodney Andrew Dice Clay. The show is a gangster that looks like he is dying to say F (which he should have because this film has been rated R but played as if it were PG) and Jerry Stiller had a 2-minute pendant. Don't understand me wrong. Sometimes I laughed a few jokes about Rodney. But the poor are too old and too slow We can see his jokes from many miles. And the movie changed as well as the PC, thanks to the horror of the 90s, 70s and 80s no longer working
