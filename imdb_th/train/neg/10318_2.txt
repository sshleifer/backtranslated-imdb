Who likes scary "funny" performances like the Little Mosque on the Prairie? There are only two people that I can think of those who watch this: one Muslim and a liberal defender who proclaims himself of all the ethnic groups that are very excited. There is a show about Muslims that it doesn't matter whether the show is good or not Or funny (which is not) the two old and those who have funny ideas are funny, unpredictable, poorly written and bad. <br /> <br /> CBC wants to see what they do. Of their audience If they really write a joke for the old man, actually guess what will happen, their audience will die soon and they will not have the audience left. I want to know who wrote this script. Do you think it's actually a Muslim or hip, a funny young person? No, I think it's a white person who wrote the same joke for the same bad CBC program since 1960. <br /> <br /> When you watch CBC's comedy program, Far Air, finally Just take it out of the air (Thank God!) But we still have weak ducks like this hour. There are 22 minutes and Rick Mercer we paid. Not to mention the bad excuses for a small funny mosque in the pasture. Satisfied and funny? Only CBC thinks that this show is offensive or funny. CBC's stigma for losing our tax money to show only a few people to watch.
