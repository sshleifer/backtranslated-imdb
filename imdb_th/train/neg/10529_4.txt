1st View 12/6/2009 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Walter Lang): I was disappointed by the position of character development in my opinion from Rodgers and Hammerstein parts. There are a few good songs and sometimes good funny drawings of the King of Siam by Yul Brynner - but this movie is not a good job to present the situation and environment. I can blame the script and show some of the reasons why we don't fully understand their characters and situations. I know it may be too little to ask about the musicals that are meant for the enjoyment of music and dance. But even though this part is not outstanding for me The basic story is about an English woman who came to Siam to teach children about luxurious things in Europe. We later learned that the king is the largest student. There is a love that is forbidden between the new wife of the king, played by Rita Moreno. (Latin as an Arab-back !!) and a former lover who caused some complications. Deborah Kerr is the main female character, Annie - it's okay, but it's unbelievable as well. Raja learned something because of her appearance and the film faded as he did. This is a synopsis with some songs and dances. But not really a great experience for the audience
