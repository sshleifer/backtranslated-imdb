Our teachers show us this movie on the first floor. I haven't seen it since I just previewed Looks like your first grade movie? I do not think so I was shocked with this movie. Mostly it was the scene in which Shirley McClain cut that girl halfway and had a boy with tomato sauce! I was surprised with this movie. Today, 20 years old, I wouldn't feel that way. I just want to share my experiences and opinions that young children may not be able to watch this movie, even though PG is aware of the possible results of this show with children. !
