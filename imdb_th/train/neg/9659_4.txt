After watching this movie, I was really disappointed - not because of the actors, stories or directors - I was disappointed with the film's ads. <br /> <br /> The movie trailer was suggested that the battalion. In addition to surrender or death (Polish infos still have a misconception that they have a choice between being killed by artillery or German guns themselves, they translate the wrong name into "Legion Battalion") This is the correct point and I bought the movie. <br /> <br /> The disappointment started when I realized that the third way was to sit down and count the bodies first, followed by sitting in the body ... Then I started to think that "Hey, this story is not that easy ... I bet that a wise officer will find a way to help save the rest of his troops." He didn't. They sat and waited for something to happen. up And I too. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the actual events of the First World War, so the writer can't use his imagination reasonably. But even then I found A little boring And as I wrote at the beginning - not the fault of actors, writers or directors - their marketers have raised my expectations to a higher level than this film can handle.
