One of my best friends brought this movie one night with the word 'Want to see the worst horror movie?' I always enjoy good laughs in bad horror movies and say yes. I expect your typical magic b-slasher But this is more than B. This is the lowest Z-slasher of low, with a clearly low budget. Very bad performances. Lightning is not good. 'Special effects' shake camera The only good thing about this is about 15 seconds of one of the characters without the upper part - she has very good tits. Most of the things I say in this movie follow the line of 'Wow, this is really bad.', 'This is the worst movie ever.' (Or lose money!)
