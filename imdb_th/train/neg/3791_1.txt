I cannot vote on this issue because I will not see the garbage from these people. They received my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore that it would not happen again. I feel that it is my civic duty to help people stay away from this trash. Go to the forum in this movie and read which actor members are trying to act like they watched the movie for the first time. A man responds to himself ... using the same name! There is a forum in the forum that says it's as good as Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... not even closing If this is the second movie of the company, it should be better than the first. That means that the 3rd movie should be much better. Otherwise I have seen What I want to know is how you distribute this trash by using the same name all the time. Having fun with friends and making movies on the weekend is a good thing ... but don't try to do that market!
