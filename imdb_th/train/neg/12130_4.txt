Massacre is a movie directed by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground) and produced by Lucio Fulci, Italian horror film director. Now, with this great talent combined, you will think that this movie will be a true festival. Can't add more from that The straightforward massacre on the face because it is one of the most boring slasher movies I've ever seen from an Italian movie. Actually, I struggled to wake up during this film and I never had a problem with The Italian horror movie <br /> <br /> The massacre begins with slowness being killed on the side of the road with an ax. This scene is used in Fulci's Nightmare concert. This is not a bad scene and it makes your expectations about the movie like a deadly ax. Unfortunately, the next hour of this movie is very boring. This movie has a scene of a horror movie that has been filmed and has developed many characters in every scene. But the characters in this movie are boring and bad that you are interested in starting to leak. The last 30 minutes of the movie were not that bad. But still much better The blood in the movie is pathetic, and because Fulci uses most of the Gore scenes in the Nightmare Concert, there is nothing new here. At the end of this movie is not good. But still didn't receive much answers and continuity fell on the floor. <br /> <br /> This is not a very good movie. But for those who are crazy about Italian movies This movie is a must have because it's very rare. 4/10 stars
