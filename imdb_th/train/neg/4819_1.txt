This is a low budget mess in the 1970s. It should be a documentary about the Bigfoot hunt crew through the Pacific Northwest. All characters are stereotyped, from Native Americans to cynical cowboy. Performances and lectures are complete jokes. If you hope to see many big feet pictures - hopefully there won't be much and what you can do in your backyard with cheap kits and video cameras; It will look better than this movie. <br /> <br /> Not that I don't like low fare in the 1970s. I do. It's a mess of bad performances, bad characters, lousy stories. And the excitement that you can't enjoy It is not suitable for the category "Very bad" and you can't laugh out how bad it is without the help of illegal substances. Most of them are boring pictures of people camping, hiking, riding horses and watching wild life. There is a big attack that is completely stupid. Our friend Sasquatch supposedly threw a stone on the camp from above while they fired the gun back to him. At that point, you're rooting hard to make Bigfoot put some stones on the filmmaker's head and stop everything.
