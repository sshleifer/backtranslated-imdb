The order with serious flaws in addition to the plot of Asinine is that the character does not reflect or respond. <br /> <br /> Two examples: a priest walks through the cemetery at night, being attacked by spirits After fighting with them, he started walking when his friend calmed down. "What's wrong?" His friend asked when he saw the attack. "Only some devil spirits don't have anything that I can't handle." No reaction. No surprise. Like he changed tires. His friends were equally disillusioned ... Must have received the standard training of priests ... ["Then you put the wafer into the mouth. Any question? Okay. Move to the devil to attack the demon ..."] > <br /> Example II: At one point, the priest needed an answer to the question and only a demon. (Or something that has been taken care of by now) how can it be? Why you have to ask people who are dying! Therefore, the devil has some random people hanging in front of both monks so that they can ask their questions to the beaters. "Hey, ya, kill him!" Or maybe "bad!" Will be more true then their response They never ask if they let the men go or stop. In fact, the closest to meet them gets is a slight nuisance. They ask their questions. <br /> <br /> I have to close it. At that point - my brain starts to scare. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br /> * / **** (One star from four) <br /> <br />
