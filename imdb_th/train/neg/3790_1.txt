I do not post comments But want to be sure to warn people in this movie It's an unfinished student movie that doesn't have a redeeming feature. At the technical level, it is completely amateurs - constantly fixed unintentional jumps within the fiercely dubbed scenes and more. The plot is quite ancient and the structure is ridiculous. I do not want to be too harsh: I have shared movies of students and they are scary. But there is no reason that this movie will go out in a world where innocent fans will have to watch it. <br /> <br /> A safe assumption that - just like actors - positive comments are fellow filmmakers. and family
