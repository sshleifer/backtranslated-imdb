This movie has many shortcomings, as before, it shows the legend of Alamo rather than history. Overall poor production makes welfare programs for many actors who may have to work with Hollywood Squares. This is my greatest flaw - I know the age and general character of the real Alamo protagonist and the elderly Of television actors who choose to show that they have never given any advice about the invasion Texas. I grew up with a fairy tale. Later I learned more about history. I can accept the proper production from both perspectives. (Although I need more precision in the past) But this thing never makes me happy about it. Even the version of John Wayne or Fess Parker has more life than this mess, while slightly less accurate. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing - avoid.
