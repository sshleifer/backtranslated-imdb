If I didn't read Pat Barker's 'Union Street' before watching this movie, I would like it. Unfortunately in this case In fact, it is my type of movie. It has been created well and I don't want to say anything else but the adjustment has failed in all aspects. <br /> <br /> A harrowing novel. With the reality of Living in a working area in the north of England hindered me and refused to let it go several weeks after I graduated. I was tears, tears, shocks, anger, sympathy and misery when reading about women in Union Street. Great. Novels that I sometimes feel I can't read anymore. But I'm a novel. I can't put it down. Yes, but I can catch it. <br /> <br /> The movie Oh, Hollywood love uses Barker's truth and reality and sweet icing. Beautiful, inspiring soundtrack, great performances, stories of hope and romance ... Yes, the adaptation of 'Union Street' ... No <br /> <br /> Women's Union Street and their stories are shortened to Fonda's story, their story is touched But many were left I admit that some of Barker's stories are too delicate and scary to watch, and the movie with the top 7 protagonists isn't actually working. But the content is not my main issue The essence and true perseverance of the novel is lost - the dark and rainy, broken windows that are covered with cardboard and the stench of poverty that is clearly described will be replaced by the beautiful sunshine house and William Wigan score. Bow> If you enjoy this movie because of the expectations and hopes of confronting the 'truth', I suggest you hesitate to read this book. Do not have to prepare yourself very much in the 'Schindler's List' list ...
