Honestly, I'm not kidding when I say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! This film does not have a single ounce of originality in a subtle dialogue or blatantly imitated story. I can't even begin to count the number of things in this movie that are clearly torn from "The Omen" and other movies like that. For example, "Lucy" mentors in this movie are one of the demons of the demon. That was sent to the guide and protecting Satan's spawning ..... making a sound like Mrs. Baylock and others. Another thing is the orphanage that they received the first child burned At the ground only a few months after he was adopted as in "The Omen". However, one priest survived the flames and escaped from a violent fire throughout his body .... but another coincidence One ?????? And above all, the priest who was burned in the hospital room with the image of Jesus all over the wall, like a priest in "The Omen" whose pages of scripture were plastered on the wall like a wall paper Please do not let me start the comparison between the ending of this movie with "The Omen" for you because as I said above
