Canadians are too polite to boo But the audience at the Toronto Film Festival leaves the theater to mutter that they will rate the movie 0 or 1 on their vote sheet. The evidence is that modern film makers are interpreting tales in the 17th century about the love of shepherds and shepherds who lived in the distant past when Druid was a spiritual leader. The work in the third generation presents many opportunities to introduce Anachronisms, including stupid and impractical clothing and strange spiritual rituals that are associated with really bad poetry. Couples are divided by jealousy and adherence to the code of ethics that arose from cross-gender dressing and many laughing situations. This movie may be hilarious as Monty Python, which looks too similar. But Rohmer's efforts were greatly reduced. The audience laughed at the joke. But otherwise lamenting slowly. The ending comes all in haste and is truly scary. This is a small movie and a waste of time watching your movie.
