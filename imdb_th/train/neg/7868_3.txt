I've watched many movies of Guy Maddin and like the most. But this really gave me a headache. The revision of John Gurdebeke was too strong and in addition to the Tour-de-Fort scene that showed the head line that was broken to look at one object, nothing but disturbing the ability. The actors in communicating with the audience. <br /> <br /> The other thing that I don't like about this movie is that it looks brutal than Maddin's previous work - even though his films have elements that Always dark But his sympathy for the character made the movie feel human. This seems to be more cruel. <br /> <br /> When I have to add additional text lines before IMDb accepts my review, I will talk about the actors playing "Guy Maddin" for monkeys. His face is quite good.
