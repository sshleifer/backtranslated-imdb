<br /> <br /> Looks cheap and ugly, this movie doesn't seem to entertain children in the audience, except for ridiculous jokes. Christopher Lloyd is the way past his prime, and actually quite boring in this role, although the excuse for the jokes by writers did not help Elizabeth Hurley have the expertise in the infamous cartoon role. Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid humiliation. There is no reason to create this movie, especially because it is inevitable to compare it with Robin Williams' excellent adaptation in Mork & Mindy. <br /> <br />
