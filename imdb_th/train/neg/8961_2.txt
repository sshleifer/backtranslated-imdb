This movie is another story that is a waste of time ... Why do you have to do this? Why do I continue to rent shit like this ... Someone can tell me ... Go back and watch the movie in hand: Cube Zero should be Worth it if you really like the first movie (As I've done) and just want to see what's going on in the latest movie Actors and screenwriters who hire, of course, this is the movie for you. But if you are looking for a good movie that has a good show and a wonderful plot ... * bad smiles * this movie is for you :-D .... ok i lie ... movie This is the best thing. OK, I have to admit that some of the elements in it are great .. well .. coolish ... and I laughed many times, blaming the wrong things, but I was fun :-) but in some things that makes the category "Ok" is not enough to make this movie worth Even less if you count "Manos - Hand of Fate" one of the top ten films ever!
