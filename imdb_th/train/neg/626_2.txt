The spirit of the murdered high school creates an animated scarecrow that will take revenge on everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me really annoyed. It has a monster that looks good, has some low budget effects, some atmosphere. But managed to short-circuit the good things that are not good, half the way that I began to move forward quickly, then step through the various chapters on the DVD Before closing the show, there were about thirty, and still there, they were expected to be in high school. You don't believe anything from the beginning. Scarecrow while looking good, no more than that. He said stupid one torpedo and moving in a manner that was designed to be funny then scary. Is this a comedy or horror movie? It is an issue that goes beyond one liners to dialog boxes and settings. It seems to send all the ancient ideas more than horror movies. I think this film was created for a very narrow audience. Horror fans who want to ridicule the genre more than accept it. <br /> <br /> Even though it's a good looking animal. Even if you pick it up in a bargain tank for less than five dollars, you pay too much. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
