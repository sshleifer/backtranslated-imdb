This film presents characters and relationships in the first half hour. No one creates interest or a positive response. I waited for the planning to start, hoping that everything would be better and ended up taking over until the end but there was no reward for doing that. For me, that action is not worth telling. No matter how bad it is, I think you can say that I have a problem with the script - i.e. I think it's foul. See credit will show you that there are strong actors here who have never been helpful. Most of the old advantages in this flick work well; Of the actors that I have never seen before, I like Deborah Kara Unger specially. That's all I can say about this picture.
