There is a scene near the beginning after shooting at a horse running. If anything red attracts you, it is because there is a white van parked behind the bush along the walkway. I think I've seen badly, but this is a white van in the west. Did they not catch this thing? Oh well and I paid the top dollar for rent. It will make you want to grab your friends and let them all put 10 grand and create better movies. Speaking very slowly, most performances are ok. But cannot be serious due to poor filming There is a door that the sheriff looks like today, especially the trim. I said watching this movie and moving the Cabin boy to # 2 at the worst time of time.
