There is a great reason Edison goes straight to the video: it will land in the movie theater and break down. This film takes too long and horribly boring. Just the notches on the bottom (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who obviously had two weeks of free time before their next movie). The bad guys would laugh and the action was close to Justin Timberlake's performance Hate to knock men But soon he realized that Pop was his right hand better. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad ... Mostly, I like the fact that LL Cool J has received what appears to be Leadership image He deserves it. And different from his musicians and co-stars, he can act Kevin Spacey was almost always fun as well. (You can see him gulp many times as he chews the scenery) and Freeman has the ability to raise this flick to three stars. <br /> <br /> When everyone talks and finishes the error The last of this movie is that it is a tricky, dull, pop-pop pop that is boring to fail to keep everyone awake. It also failed to make anyone give a good shit about any character. All in all, just plain boring. That was said to rent this when you are suffering from insomnia
