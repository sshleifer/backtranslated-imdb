Usually, any movie that has Sylvester Stallone often sucks Rambo's ass: First Blood Part II is no exception. The only film that Sylvester Stallone is in is a good story, Rocky and the Blood Drop. This movie looks realistic and boring. It has action But not very good I don't enjoy watching, and I won't watch this again. No wonder why it received the Razzie Award for Worst Picture. I will give this a 3/10. The only reason that makes it 3 is because it's quite good but not good enough.
