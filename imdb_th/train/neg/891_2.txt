After receiving the love of 'Paris, Je T'aime', I highly expect this movie and I agree that I have received high expectations. But was very disappointed for many reasons. <br /> <br /> Although I didn't expect New creation of 'Paris' in New York. I expect the same structure. What I like about 'Paris' is the collapse of neighborhoods. You understand the style of each director and the story they want to tell. In 'NY', there is no clear story separation at various points in the movie. Characters from various stories run together, which makes me confused about who I am watching and born what happened In addition, switching directions is clear. But confused because there is no current. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about the movie 'Paris' is the love that is different. It's not all romantic. There is a love between their parents and their children, unrequited love, middle-aged women who long for love, etc. It explores the complexity of love between many layers. 'NY' seems to be just an irritated sex. Have shorts that can be redeemed (The older couple spent the life of Julie Christie) but the 'NY' overall film didn't create any feelings for me. I didn't connect with the characters like that. I do with 'Paris'. I remember watching 'Paris' and feeling deep sadness, loneliness, longing for hope, wonder ... It only has souls. For me, there is no spirit in the movie 'NY'. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I get into that without having to 'Paris' appear behind my brain because this film comparison might lead More satisfying answers But as my own 'Paris, Je T'aime' again, I was very disappointed.
