What makes the idea of ​​watching this movie very interesting is the hope that it will depend on Charlotte Bronte's ability in the original classic. I am very disappointed to find that this movie, which seems to be a hilarious writing or filming, doesn't have features that make the original novel very powerful. The acumen goes between the main characters Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester. They seem to have disappeared from the screenplay or left on the cutting floor. The missing thing is Jane Eyre's charming feeling, which allows her to suffer from chaos and victory. Above all else, Jane Eyre was originally a hero. Women in this film seem to be not very successful, including one of the greatest parts of the story when Jane ran away from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. Her struggles to find food and shelter, the shame of having to ask for bread, threatening to freeze to death in the evening, all to escape from the man you love Out of this movie The character's name looks dry and doesn't get attention. The story is not interesting and for those who do not read the book, I can't imagine that this story is the least interesting. Screenplay and direction, not less if credited with classic stories.
