Conclusion: Doctor Markov has developed a new theory about how to produce energy, knowledge that may make the world unbalanced. He kept his knowledge secret and needed a lot from the Soviet Union. KGB on the other hand needed new technology. So they set the pattern in motion During the attempt to help Mark Freeman, KGB advanced to Markov, bringing a secret place and luring him to reveal his secrets, saying that they were in Sweden and working for the United Nations. As a backup, KGB kidnapped Markov's separate daughter. Now, the CIA sends their best representatives, the tribe (Swedish?) Team to block the KGB and help Markov and his daughter <br /> <br /> Comments: The cult movie that is not even Very desirable The movie is quite ambitious, but lacking in many ways. First of all, it is very dark, may hide the position and the effect is not good, which some scenes are difficult to understand. You can't see what happens. The second thing that is lacking is martial arts, even being a ninja movie. Of course, the quality is relatively low. But most ninjas shoot automatic or explosive guns Automatic guns also cause problems because they seem to have a lot of ammunition. And the tribe seemed to be barely able to escape from the bullets while the Soviet soldiers died like flies. <br /> <br /> What does it say about it? The most important thoughts and ambitions Actually, some stories and especially for Swedish movies, good action scenes, although not martial arts. Some good slow motion scenes have a lot of blood and ax. And the new weapon technology that is very interesting that makes the victim's heart or brain broken All the parts you look for in most B movies. <br /> <br /> Since it's a movie, B certainly can't make mistakes. But if you expect and watch it like a movie B, it's fun, but don't forget that it's not just But is the B movie that is set in the eighties For example, some women, in addition to wearing ... say "interesting", with a large amount of eye shadow and makeup. <br /> <br /> Every day, look at the status of ideals and ambitions. Fun and forget it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
