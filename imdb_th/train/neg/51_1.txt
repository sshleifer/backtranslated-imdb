This movie is important. The level of cruelty and relentless violence in this film creates annoyance. Some scenes are truly ugly and unnecessary. The main character is impossible to identify or agree with. The main character of the protagonist is smooth. Patient room / cafeteria atmosphere to lend to the theater Can't learn anything about the Spanish Civil War from this movie, little or no. Luckily I've been to Spain and realized that this is not true! In addition, the use of same-sex attraction as a terrifying "horror" is something that is disgusting and poorly managed, while DVDs are packed and advertised to attract gay audiences. The actors seem to be uncomfortable in their role as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess. I guess if you like to watch children and pets that have been brutally killed, this movie may attract you especially
