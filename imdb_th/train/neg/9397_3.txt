I saw most episodes of RMFTM being a teenager in the "Cliffhanger Theater" that worked after midnight in a local station many years ago and then again when the Mystery Science Theater riffed in the early 90s. > <br /> Of course, I can make money for special effects, which is quite impressive for the IMO 50 series at an affordable price. (IMO Commando Cody's flight scene is better than George And I can also make allowances for Ahem, "acting" and fighting with choreography - except for the men who play the role of Moon Men. He is an incredibly unorthodox person He looked and acted like a friend who came to repair your plumbing system, not the dictator of the alien race. Even the repetitive conversations can be used. Everyone, everyone shakes their strings, such as firecrackers, without wasting time or stopping for things like "think" or "Vipassana" because everyone does this. The audience finds it immersed after a while. One and even my current senses didn't bother me. <br /> <br /> The thing that really irritated me was writing and planning. I'm not talking about the sunny weather on the moon or baking soda that is powered by rockets or pilot sets labeled "up / down" and "fast / slow". I don't pay attention to the longing of Exciting solutions that end each chapter. I'm talking about the fact that our heroes are stupid than fence posts and don't have accumulated memory. And by the fact that even though interactive clips will look like express trains But the plot had to go through the same movement over and over again. <br /> <br /> Dig it: Commando, Cody and his friends pioneered the high-tech science laboratory with top secrets along with Protect the world (Or at least the United States) from the alien invasion But his office does not have a guard or security checkpoint They didn't even lock the front door. So the bad guy came in and beat the crap out of Cody and his team ... not once. (May be understood) but a long time They kidnapped his female assistant for a second try. And they never get smarter To further prove my point, let me point out how Cody jumped in his flight set and flew around to make a problem and didn't seem to succeed in catching anyone. He has done this over and over again. Cody also flew the boat to the moon. (Who helped the woman to cook) for about 30 seconds and then immediately turned back. Cody captured one Atomic Ray gun ... and lost it to the villain again immediately because he couldn't be locked to lock it. And if so, <br /> <br /> and you would think that if Cody's efforts were crucial to keeping the United States from Moon Men, he would ask for a few soldiers with carbines carbine helicopters And tanks or Two people to reserve him instead of working with the local police at all times This should be a military operation. But they act like a part of "Gangbusters" again <br /> <br /> It's hard to be pregnant. I thank the creators who were severely restricted in the scope of their stories according to budget and limited time ... and I appreciate that Cody is hombre that is reasonably difficult. (Although he lost half of the punch) but I couldn't help but shouting "Door! Lock the door! "When the gangsters just walked into his lab or tried to explode the ship and there was no security measure on the landing page in place ... not even the fence (!) <br /> <br /> Still Never mind in the three republics that I watched. "Phantom Creeps" has a better storyline and "Undersea Kingdom" has a more atmospheric (hah!) And a better hero than "Radar Men" but it's a good time. <br /> <br /> BTW ... Why do men "Radar" they don't use radar? Users should not use the Atomic Ray Guns nicknamed "Atomic Ray Gun Men from The Moon".
