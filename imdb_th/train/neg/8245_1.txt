I can't believe anyone would like this movie. I've seen many cheap indie movies. But this story is especially interesting Low budget does not mean that this movie must be destroyed. Horror does not mean that the movie must be insane. There is nothing scary about this movie. It is just a carnival and one task that is especially disturbing at The performances were moderate when considering that they had not heard before. But the story is pathetic. The conversation is pathetic. The movie tries to come out as "art" or something. This is not one of the great indie movies that cost just thousands of dollars to create. But incredibly well done This is not just an excuse for some seriously ill people who put a passion for movies. Other reviews here also say that the soundtrack is sucked ... that is because most are written by the same person and some songs written by a writer of movies There is no qualification in exchange for this movie. It consumes my time and money completely.
