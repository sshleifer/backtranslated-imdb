I often enjoy Loretta Young's early movie: her performance was light and cheerful and she knew how to wear clothes. But this one is only a loser from the word, except the funny support turn by Glenda Farrell Young is a hatching girl who talks about her writer's husband (Paul Lukas) as a bridge champion It's not the most playable movie game, and the middle lengthy talk that their marriage will be different, just kill the movie. <br /> <br /> There are interesting stories while Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk starts the game, the pinnacle, the quick appointment, the plane, train, football game or even a diver in the air. It is the fastest frozen frame I've ever seen in American movies. Want the rest to be creative and funny
