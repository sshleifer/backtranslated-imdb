This movie is the worst excuse for movies I've seen. In the beginning, I would like to say that the cover of this film is misleading. If you think you are going to watch a horror movie that is truly scary with a monster clown, you are wrong. In fact, the killer's face doesn't look like a little front cover. But it's just an image that they have to find on Google and think it looks cool When talking about the things that they found and thought that it looked cool, there was one scene in this film that some gangs were searching for in the old forest friends. Then suddenly the screen shuffled to the scene with the mother-raising deer In the sun ... I mean WTF seriously ??? This is related to the dark forest that they walked through. I bought this movie from a guy in the market, hoping it would be fun if it wasn't horror. At least it was funny, right? Wrong! The next day I will let my colleagues drive out of the epidemic named S.I.C.K. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: Don't watch this movie !!!
