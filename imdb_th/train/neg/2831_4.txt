I saw this thing recently with my wife and discovered that it was better than Ken believed, though not very much. The greatest screen actor in the United Kingdom seems to not be interested in this role, which is a pity that he may raise his playing confidence. Rex Harrison seems to be less attentive, perhaps surprising because his character is written very badly. William Holden is better. But when his screen disappears and his character doesn't get a good role, <br /> <br /> Beverly Johnson is a beautiful woman I have ever seen. This film may benefit greatly from focusing on her story. Ustinov stole the show, but in general, playing a comic character is quite consistent with the intense tone of the film The music is not good and Omar Sharif makes one of his many pointless pendants. (His career has taken this for decades. <br /> <br /> Richard Flisser must blame. Unpredictable film directors are angry and this is one of his weakest films.
