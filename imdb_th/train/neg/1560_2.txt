This film cannot say that it is not good because it is sad, just moderate pain. If the lack of intelligence or true imagination, a thin plot is stretched to the exact limit and `jokes' (which can be predictable and flaky) will spin out too long until boredom. Another mark on John Waters' tragic decline and reminder that things that "scare" or amuse us 30 years ago are not the same results now. We have seen it before and it is no longer forbidden any longer because it has been long gone. Miss important times
