I expect this to be a lot better. I like Tim Burton's work, so I'm really excited to watch these online short films. They are not in what I expect. <br /> <br /> I don't really know what I don't like. I guess they are boring. Noise and most of the characters, even though I like Roy the Toxic Boy and Stainboy. <br /> <br /> When Match Girl may get me the most bored, <br /> I don't like how some characters die As with the way that Match Girl built gas stations by general means or the way that Girl Who Stares died in general The death of Roy is surprisingly fun. Death by car, refreshing, very original ;-) That makes me laugh hard ... <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not suitable for children. Just language and blood That's all I have to say! 3/10
