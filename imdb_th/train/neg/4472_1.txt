'A Smile LIke Yours' is an unreasonable comedy movie. I don't mean that the story is complicated. But the whole plot depends on one thing: the desperate and expensive efforts of a couple who are trying to conceive a child who is trying hard to forget the choice of adoption. This film <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly plays Jennifer Robertson. Shows the feeling of freedom She is a boring character like a dream housekeeper who has nothing in her mind but has children as well as romantic comedies in the 50s. Greg Kinnear is her submissive husband who has no independent personality and from us without interest. <br /> <br /> They are the two most annoying and annoying characters. Rarely made for funny topics that should be presented with many accidents that should arise from couples who do everything possible to conceive Except they do nothing but go to a clinic that is rich and pays a lot to do what they can in their own privacy. (Except for the number of fertilizers outside the body), the plot hardly yields to any accidents because the couple didn't do anything to create a strange situation. They went to this clinic so what? <br /> <br / > Sub-plans are intended to test the integrity of couples, which are essential moral elements of the story, since both plan to give birth to children together. Jennifer works at a new age shop with her friends. (Played by Joann Kusak) and they are in the business of developing BPH Christopher McDonald plays an interesting buyer and Jennifer is a negotiator who is likely to have a good price for her and her friend's products. The subplots will hardly make you interested (although Joan Cusak will be funny in the restaraunt scene). <br /> <br /> Danny (Kinear) is an architect looking for a chance to make extra money to cover up. Clinic bill by accepting a job in Seattle, where his boss is glamorous (Such as a hopeless female character who is hopeless) who tries to convince Danny (Being dumb like him) to have a relationship with her With him and his wife (For the reason I don't care about giving) Jill Hennesy is good at this role. But her character is too predictable and is a necessary formula for conflict with Danny. It's silly and interesting again. <br /> <br /> The overall movie is the most boring and funny (save the scene. restaraunt and airline flight) The story has nothing that really attracts attention. Although the story is about two people trying to conceive But the author can think of many hilarious things to develop from that story. Secondly, the main characters are completely boring. They are the complete silouhettes of the 50s comedian with a happy wife and clueless husband. The characters themselves do not give anything interesting, even jokes. <br /> < br /> Joan Cusak should be the leader and others should be involved with Kinnir Cusak to make the jokes very scary (Sometimes she acts together with her here) This is the exact one that will pass.
