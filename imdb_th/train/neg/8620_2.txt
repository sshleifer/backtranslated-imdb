I'm not sure if Andy Sidaris will repeat his success with Malin Express with his film Fit to Kill. He has proven that Sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just one director. The plot written by Sidaris, which is ungrateful by the Academy, is a complex screenplay involving twists and turns that are invisible. The main character consists of works for radio stations that have sex. Known as KSXY. Wisely. KSXY is their secret headquarters in "Fit to Kill". They face Kane's long-serving deeds Which tried to steal Russia's most valuable diamond A poorly written script, a great performance from an actor, helps make sure that this movie is a classic movie. Directed by critics and box office, this movie will be appreciated in the next few years. It is now the same fate with Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver, but in the future it will become no doubt known. I am disappointed that there are no critics who accept the creation of Andy Sidaris movie. Special effects costumes help make this movie look more beautiful. It might be best if you don't care about the movie's 3 ratings and go outside and rent yourself. My personal score is 10/10. This play is as thick as the Runaway Bridal Blockbuster and the action is better or equal to the Last Action Hero, the masterpiece in the cinema. Andy keeps up the good work.
