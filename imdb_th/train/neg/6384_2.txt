Recently I was viewing a website that contains movies in the public domain. In movies with their long list is this movie and I think I have to see hallucinations from names and offensive evidence. But not that is what it is And because this film is only 27 minutes long, I decided to try If becoming a porn movie, I will stop watching. It turned out to be the most bizarre movie I've ever seen. The Danish production team tried to spend a budget of about $ 49 to create a Star Trek-style movie about a crew of gay men traveling about the galaxy, wiping out the oppression of women by killing every woman as they did the world! And in all cases, they met with cheers and thanks from the gay who is now in the world. <br /> <br /> This is not true. With the name of the most rude and the best character I have ever heard, I don't think I can write it on IMDb without deleting reviews! However, despite the madness of all, it looks strange and worth looking at. But as I said, because of the rough name and strange content (even if there are no nudity), it is only for adult movies. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie left me with 1001 questions about people. To do this, why is it so and who is the intended audience? It may not be the worst thing I have ever seen. But it may be the most strange and disgusting thing!
