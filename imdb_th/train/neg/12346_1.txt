The basic evidence of this film is a political cartoon. I think that for people who don't know anything about the realities of the army, this story is probably a "good" movie about gender equality. The announcer recently stated that: "It makes women know that they can do whatever they want to do." What claptrap! No one, male or female, can do whatever they want and unfortunately Demi Moore joins "SEAL Hell Week" at the beginning of Week 27 of the BUD / S program by exercising at the local gym and her wishes. only one Seals didn't make it like that. With a 80% dropout rate in what is a rough military training program - is a voluntary course that can not compete at the physical level, often physically injured during training or unable to cope with psychology Abuse I never received, in addition to the shallowness of the intentionally planned text of this film. In the real world, Demi will not spend the first 24 hours in this intense and lasting physical training. Hope alone will not do Skipping the film is a wishful idea and takes time to read "The Warrior Elite" better by Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001). For the best explanation about what actually happened in the training. this Press the bell at Demi! <br /> <br />
