I like Chiba in Street Fighter and I think hey, no matter how stupid the movie is, I can at least see him kicking the ass, right? Right. Of nonsense, half-way writing and meaningless planning There are a few action scenes, even fewer martial arts scenes and scenes shot and edited as bad as you can't tell what happened in this world. That dub is cruel, and perhaps the stupidity of this movie is the best example of the fact that it has Italian mafia features ... except all Japanese! Avoid the plague - You will see better martial arts by looking through the window of your preschool karate class for five minutes.
