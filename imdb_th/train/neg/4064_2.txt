This film is extremely boring. It tells the story of the gas station owner and her life. Nothing exciting happens. The director has "made it true" and feels like a camera that tracks women around as she lives. I have to watch other films of this director in class. Others are not boring. This movie is being watched for assignment ... It will be worth the boring with a good score !! Overall, if you don't need to watch movies But do not reduce other movies by this director because they are not bad ... and do not reduce other movies about Africa. They are always good, especially when Western directors do
