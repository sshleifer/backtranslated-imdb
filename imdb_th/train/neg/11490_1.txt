I have to agree with the opinions of most people that this performance is not as good as writing. The performance is not much higher than the lower production cost. But I felt that the actors were able to rely on the material provided for them and do their best. In accordance with this idea, I felt it was important to point out that one of the actors had happened. And has a determination to produce tasteless, becoming a highly respected and talented actor. I mean Laura Harris. She went through a lot of bad movies and programs. The locations for the HBO hit "Dead Like Me" in which she starred as Daisy Adair and her credit she dealt with this role effectively, I remember my childhood in general. In the actress in this series that she plays, Ashley, who speaks a wise 7th grade, but I feel as if anyone can "create" from this series. It will definitely be Laura Harris and naturally. Her true To receive respect from many manufacturers, who now remember that she has the same abilities as the unique Nordic blonde charm. If you have the opportunity to watch this series, I suggest you have something to watch in times like 'The Godfather' or 'Beach' to remind yourself that there is absolute perfection. And pay attention to this, and this series is just a low-cost reminder that how Laura Harris can talk about her time on the program and I bet she will quote the words of Young
