I thank God that I didn't go to watch a movie for this movie. I will be very sorry for the money I give. I saw it on TV and I couldn't believe my eyes. I wonder what movie is worse than this movie? They spend millions of dollars to make this movie. The situation is terrifying and scary. I think other people who write comments are those who work from that movie company;) It's a great failure! In 2000, can they still laugh with this type of movie? Embarrassing ...
