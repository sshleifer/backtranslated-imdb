My first attempt at viewing this thing ended in 8 minutes, roughly after the TV report scene, which I couldn't manage. It goes about this: <br /> <br /> Reporter 1: Um, there is our sky pyramid. Reporter 2: I think it's an alien. * Silence. * Reporter 1: In other news .. <br /> <br /> A few days later, I watched it until the end, and it wasn't as scary as I thought. But there are serious problems with this. About half of the plot can be easily discarded. And the other half should be expanded to explain the story behind or something The more amusing is the monopoly scene. "We all have the power of" gods "who live for life and in all games in copyright. Monopoly ?! Even Erich von Dainiken looks harmonious. <br /> <br /> The other half is missing. What does our protagonist do to free ourselves from frozen ice? Why isn't there a big event when he was released at the end? He has annoying followers. Remember? What happens to normal humans? What is the deal with the masked man? How does the blue girl appear? What is her eyes? Etcetera, etcetera <br /> <br /> See it. It's okay, whether it's more or less if you don't think of the Egyptian gods who seem to be walking on their heads with their heads.
