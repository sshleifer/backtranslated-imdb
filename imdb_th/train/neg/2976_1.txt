Amazingly, this is a very remarkable thing. I mean, it's not good. It's really bad. But while the original is not good - it's - destroyed - life - my bad. This is bad - it's - gently - not good entertainment. Yes. That's not enough praise. The production of rotting throughout the board, the show being excruciating and the words Romero-Wanabe can't imagine which side of the ecological fence is ridiculed. The internal logic uses the back seat to push yourself out of the refrigerator. The incubation time of the virus fluctuates according to the needs of the 'plot'. The bullet shows working with zombies or does the zombies have power to speak? Gore is an obvious draw, but the frame is slapdash. It's annoying. The conversation seems to be translated by the same computer that makes the manual unavailable and the size of the spread of zombies does not imply any intelligence. Of Romero's movies Everything is full of scary synth scores, complete garbage.
