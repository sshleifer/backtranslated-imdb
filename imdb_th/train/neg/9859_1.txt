This movie is just lame. Waste time and money overall Funny stories can be predicted. The characters are old-fashioned and the way they talk about gamers is not funny. The problem is that the writer doesn't seem to know how the RPG works and the most important is how to create a joke about this game. Of course, there are many losers who play RPG games like retro games and all losers. But for me, this is not the most fun way to create a joke about this game. The story is not reasonable. Who is interested in how long to play the game? The biggest problem in this movie is that writers and actors never even knew that RPG was creating a joke about it. I was ashamed when watching this movie.
