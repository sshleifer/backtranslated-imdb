What the reviewer and MST3K came out as the best part (and only the memorable scenes) of this horrible movie: There was a rape scene in a very good bathroom made by bad guys (Ben Gazzara loud Which has been said to be killed later through TJ's incompetence). Perhaps rape may be too severe. "Breeding rituals in the prison" may be more appropriate. Behind the scenes of this opportunity But the forced meeting was a hidden crime "Ben Gazzara" introducing him to the girls hanging in his pool. The 30-year-old blonde girl is breaking down him. But our villains have to be hit by her because she is currently engaged. His first move was to try to sink her until the patron mafia didn't tell him to do it. Like a woman in a high school that you don't like But still want to have erotic knowledge ... let's say that he catches up with her in the shower later
