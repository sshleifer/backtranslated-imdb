I saw this for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson. They thought they were police. They were, but Busey was in the opening scene. Then it didn't appear again until entering the movie for 40 minutes. Especially when he disguised himself as a blind hobo. <br /> <br /> The incredible thing about this movie is the story. In the movie Fred Williamson, trying to find out who traces and kills the phone service provider. At one point, I thought that was Busey, but it turns out that I was just part of Busey, not an assassin, but he called and threatened a woman on the phone. Why? I don't know. He's not connected to the killer. In any way, he just made to kick me guess.
