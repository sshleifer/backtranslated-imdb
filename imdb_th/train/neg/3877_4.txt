I just watched The Incredible Melting Man for the second time and it was more boring than when I first watched it. I do not understand why it became 'Classical cult' when it is boring and boring The opening scene looked bright when the chubby nurse made blood cans and ran for her beloved life. After all of this, the real thing is the molten man walking around the forest and some houses while having his life back as an astronaut. The makeup is quite good and his gooey face is very realistic. There is a cool scene where he throws a man's head in a river and it continues to float until it reaches a waterfall that falls on rocks and bombs Although there is not much to make yourself wet But most scenes are filmed in darkness and you can't see what really happened. At least on the DVD, Vipco, which I watched, <br /> <br /> No, the unbelievable person is great. I will vote for the cheese factor. But it's about it If you want a classic Sci-Fi / horror cult, watch The Deadly Spawn instead!
