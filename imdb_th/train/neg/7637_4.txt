This may be a very good movie if I can watch it. Mobile camera shake very much From opening credit, I'm worried Many of us see it feeling nauseous at the end. But we haven't finished because it's a charming and interesting movie that makes us understand the pop culture in South Africa. Black and white film helps to enhance the sense of art. The show seemed very real. Some conversations are difficult to understand. But a theater full of non-South Africans seems to find it funny. If you are drunk, you might seriously consider crossing this movie. It's strange, but not worth the nausea.
