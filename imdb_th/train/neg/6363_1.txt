I haven't seen anyone do this movie and I think I might be the first. <br /> <br /> It's terrible. In fact, I didn't watch the end of it. It's like watching a boring soap or a really good soap. (All kinds of soap are ridiculous), poor performers and bad stories. People who rate it 10/10 do not know what they are doing. The script is terrible. 2 People are talking with anger together about the threat and you expect the good person to say something really good. He said, "If you do that ... I'll hurt you." Ha ha ha If the joke is your story Please do not watch this movie because ... it is a CRAP !!! <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The performance is not good, the fight is not good, the script is bad. <br /> <br /> Don't watch! Of course this is in my opinion.
