This is not one of those movies. It is one of the biggest pieces of rag that I have ever had. The camera work scene is trying to flash, but actually it's just all the shit like a red shoe notebook. But without sex The only reason I bought this is that I want to try using a dvd and this is the cheapest price I can find. It may be the worst purchase of my life and may cause you to stop the DVD forever. The soundtrack is really tacky. It consists of repeated clips from the first two films that are endless. Why would anyone want to make a scary movie because this is something that is superior to me if they try to create an original movie and fail? I would be better in this review but They do not have the right to reproduce things from the first two, then edit and repeat in this movie, which may be less than 1 in 3 of the original, which is similar to The square base of film school students do not buy this movie. This DVD entertainment only available if you stick it in the microwave and watch the flashing lights! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTTER Incredible trash! 0/10 only if the voting system is allowed
