I am a big fan of Chu Zhang and will go to see a movie to see her, which is what brought me to the purple butterfly. As far as I want to like this movie, I have to agree with others who have opinions about this. It's confusing and very slow. Since every movie seems to be taken with a mobile camera, some of the important parts are not focused. <br /> <br /> The film has very little dialogue and things that don't tell you much There are endless scenes of people standing around smoking or sitting in a room staring at each other without conversation. How to change the time of the movie is confusing and difficult to follow. Although I have read a lot of reviews before and have a general idea of ​​what this movie is about, I still have difficulty understanding what happened. Was similar to the actor Ziyi Zhang, but before this I was looking forward to seeing her in different things She never smiled in this film, even though she admitted that she had nothing to smile about. I can do without having a sex scene like they have sex and there is no clear feeling between the participants as you can hope.
