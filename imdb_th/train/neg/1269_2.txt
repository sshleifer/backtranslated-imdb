This series received only 2 stars because it made Bleak House some parts of Dickens on film and maybe some people might read the book. Contrary to what might have been commented, Diana Rigg was poor as a Lady Dedlock. She was clunky and Lady D. was a reserved character but not Martinet Denholm. Elliot was wrong, wrong, wrong for Mr. Jarndyce. And responded to everyone who said: "I didn't read the book so I didn't have to accept the opinion of this man because he used his assessment in the book. True and not true For example, Diana Rigg is not good in her role because the performance is not good whether you read it or not. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is moderately Jarndyce (even if it's too old). To compare with books But because the plot and characters are not linked together to create a consistent, amazing, mysterious and interesting entertainment It's boring and flat. If you want to create a Bleak house that is likely to be possible, you have to spend 20 hours of filming in 10 hours, but I recommend that the manufacturer, etc., leave only Dickens (even A Christmas Carol). Dickens' genius is noticeably reduced in his clever plans and memorable characters.
