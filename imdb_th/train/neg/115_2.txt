Never show model and playboy bunny in your movie! Fosse's Bob 80 movie about Dorothy Stratten, in which Bogdanovich is obsessed with marrying her sister after she is killed at the hands of her husband, Patty Hansen. Not an actor .. I expect to see a lost masterpiece like La Orson Welles, but Audrey Hepburn returns in the jeans and horrible hairstyles of God "Paper Moon" and "The Picture Picture Show "I watch again and again.This exclamation I can hardly sit at once. This film was not released due to the brouhaha around the death of Stratten. I think the real reason is because it's terrible!
