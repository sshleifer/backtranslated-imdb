"Algie, the Miner" is one of the quiet and funny comedy. The duration of the pain is completely closed. This is a humor that has a certain sequence that makes you wonder whether it should be funny or not. However, the true quality of this film is irrelevant. This is a compulsory viewing for movie enthusiasts because it is one of the earliest examples of gay movies. The main character of Algie is a weak man, a girl who acts like "pansy" in general in the first film. This film has a general homophobic attitude. "Algie, the Miner" is terrible but interesting from a historical perspective (3/10).
