This movie is not what I expected. <br /> <br /> If this movie is called otherwise, no one will even notice the difference between the two. <br /> <br /> It's really strange. Because I didn't see the point Prequel and the sequel can only say that it doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm innocent but not vol 1 & vol 2 means pairing <br /> <br /> carlito is in prison on day 1 and dies in the traditional way and in the prequel he lives and doesn't have to go to jail <br /> <br /> The story is ok. But they should change some actors and parts of the story and the name of the movie and it will be a good movie. <br /> <br /> I expect it to end as elsewhere. <br /> < br /> If some people have comments on this post, please
