This movie should be "lighthearted" about Santa Claus and wonders. "Magical and mysterious" of him, but it turned out that it was seriously creepy Two things in this movie that stand out in my heart in the scary sense are: 1) What looks at Santa Dad - have you ever seen a Santa Claus that looks more scary? And 2) "The evil agent of Satan" Pitch's extraordinary dance is just worth seeing. Watch this movie only when it's a MSTed version or if you like a very good laugh. I can't believe that this is a movie for children.
