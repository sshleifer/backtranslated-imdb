This movie is terrible and worse in every fashion. It is not only a bad acting and a role, and it is all silly and distorted. The thing that made this movie in the hall of my shame was the struggle that the writers and producers made with this movie to try to make jokes. The actress who replaced Jean Reno's descendants was old and learned her lessons in the first movie, so they added a new girl who was about to marry. Almost all of the specials and jokes are back. But this time I wanted to rip out from my socket because it was a very good movie. The torture of the cut and the constant shooting of the camera in any scene in this movie can make the audience extremely confused. This second film brings a successful original movie and takes it out of the coffin and brings the corpse out into the public courtyard and decay. But our original ideas and heritage This film is different from the chic goose, unable to fly because it does not have a plot in the employer who returns as a 'necklace'. There is no script because of writing and adding daily. No interest in the camera or images in mind Bad light and special techniques made for the benefit of doing so. This film will not pass for the film of the students in Film Basic 101. This way through, no one can tell. It is a huge loss of investment and it seems that no one has the strength to bring this cruel and unnatural mistake from our misery. This movie has a good part ... finished! This movie is my # 1 worst movie of all time. "Howard The Duck" is not a goose anymore.
