This is a version that even the authors themselves hate. They let it be 'Happy ending' and many conversations and a large pile of piles 'Stage manager' is quite good. I believe he has a role, but others are in the style of acting of the 40s that really poses. One of the great features - music. This is one of the best scores ever recorded and is worth finding in a record store. Overall, I think the Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller model in 1989 is much better.
