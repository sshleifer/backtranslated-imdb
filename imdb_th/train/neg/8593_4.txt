I finally saw it. I didn't go when I first came out, because I said honestly. I was scared. Afraid of how bad it is or how frustrating it is Although not as bad as Menace and better than Clones, but it is not that memorable or satisfying. <br /> <br /> I am 11 years old when I see Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. From the collection of information to the final credit, it is a movie viewing experience that I will never forget. The timeless story of a farm boy bored of just knowing that he has more meaning, helping the princess and the galaxy from an evil threat while being counseled by a wise wizard, pirate, pirate and cartoon. Relief - in the setting area -opera <br /> <br /> And that's not punishment. Lucas used the old formula. It is an old formula precisely because it works. And for his credit, he has a new twist that makes it so special. <br /> <br /> Then the empire came and the story was bigger than the fairy tale. The darkness came into the picture and we learned one of the great movies, twisted all the time. The great villain, Vader, is the father of Luke. Wow, no one saw that it was coming. Of course, I do not believe that Lucas will not appear until it appears in the screenplay. Go back and watch Star Wars again. Know what you know now, especially in terms of the first three. /> <br /> which brings me to the problems I have Revenge is an entertaining movie - many effects, good action scenes. But the movie is still alive or dead in the story - the story told Oh, of course, a really good performance can save weaknesses. But the weak plans combined with poor performances - that is the burden that the director cannot overcome, of course, is not as bad as I am forced to realize that George Lucas is trying to direct the worst performance of a career. From their very good performers - Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson) <br /> <br /> ***** The front spoiler *** **** * Plot Gosh. Understand that he is disabled from what he Raised in the first two films, so it was an incredible burden One is too much for him to overcome. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have the true absurdity of the background. We found Anakin from being a child on Tatooine, which was the result of the birth of the first miracle - "the chosen person". This detail was not explained remotely. In fact, the closest explanation is Yoda's observation that they may be wrong. Okay. Okay. Our mistakes <br /> <br /> This same wunderkind now became the creator of C3PO. Hey, it's It's a coincidence. And he will return to Tatooine and never know that he is from there? Wow! How about that Are testing the suspension of old willingness to not believe there, right? George? However, we have children, cunning, temperament, frustration, young people who have to become one of the greatest criminals in film history - the great tragedy of Darth Vador - good people who fall from grace just to achieve Finally redemption <br /> <br /> How does this happen? Why did he have a dream that his wife would die in childbirth? Now, of course, he lives in a civilization with strong stars that treat gravity as we treat gasoline. But it happened to "Dark people who are" to examine the causes of medicine, perhaps perhaps this future society may do About this problem Why not, the only thing he thought he had to do was to kill some children because the bad guys were in the root of all the evil that they were chasing for two movies. Tell him that he has a secret that is immortal. <br /> <br /> Of course, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lucas can expect us to see such stupidity? How do everyone expect us to pay attention? Hell, why everyone wants this remaining child to be saved or exchanged at first. I want Kenobi to kill him because he is evil. But because he was so stupid, <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, Amidala finally died in childbirth. Why? They do not know the doctor, who is a puppet, and he himself represents an incredibly high technology that this society has progressed. "She lost the intention to live." Of course, she had Perhaps she eventually started what she was sleeping with. <br /> <br /> But here we are. We have all of Kenobi. He knew the origin of Luke and Leia. Know who their father is and know what happened to them Knowing the role of both R2 and C3PO, and in many years Luke has approached manhood and appeared with 3PO and R2 (curious about 3PO's mind being wiped, but not R2 - why ????) stated "I think these droids are yours," Kenobi, who knows that the droid protocol was created by the people he believed to be. "The chosen person" and the internship with the emperor himself and those who just happened to create on this planet said "Strange. I don't remember the owner of droids." <br /> <br /> Oh, great sadness. <br /> <br /> Lucas created it when he went. When he introduced VAder to be the father of Luke, sadly, the story began to stir from control because he didn't know what the story was like. The story of episode 1-3 is difficult to understand. Palpatine has no reason at all. And nothing is linked to the story he told in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> It's a thought later and it looks. <br /> <br /> I can't rate the movie. This is high. It reminds me of Triple X, a fun movie that has to be viewed but completely forgotten. Star Wars will be in my heart forever. Fortunately, this person and the two previous ones will soon disappear.
