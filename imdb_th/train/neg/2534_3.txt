* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> Sometimes this movie is called "Life Everlasting", often with references to the final scene. But precisely explained that he had died and buried this evaluated series after the sloppy and unreasonable export. <br /> <br /> There are kids "Hey kids, broadcast programs" about telemovie This can be loved in places. Some fans will feel like a band while they enjoy choosing a variety of pendant styles. Tom Fontana, co-author and creator, together with friends and contacts Please include a list of characters in Baltimore /> <br /> That's the real thing <br over the return of the whole truth. Members of television programs that have released your old favorites and later are not favorites. <br /> <br /> Often have high-quality connoisseurs like Barry Levinson, Fontana, James Yoshimura and the rest. The anti-BCC creative team that considers budget, who just needs a moral police process, such as "Nash Bridge", which routinely defeats "murder" in ratings The pressure said that it was a show that reflected between the realistic stunts that were over its form and the sensational stunts that reduced mistakes. Sorry for this film, Fontana, co-writer Yoshimura and Eric Overmeyer and director Jean de Segonzac just threw. towel They bring the most ridiculous stories from the series, with new stories that are unlikely and ineffective and put the burden of carrying all the clutter of weak actors. <br /> <br /> A short time has passed since the last episode of the show. The heart of the former Baltimore murder case is Yaphet Kotto, Lt. Al Giardello, now becoming a candidate like Kurt Schmoke for the mayor and Schmoke himself appeared as a cameo. But this promising beginning will happen immediately and a sad turning point. <br /> <br /> The spotlight turns into Giancarlo Esposito as Mike, the son of Giardello, a beautiful young man who works. Well, somewhere else, Esposito is one of the beautiful faces brought into prehistoric TV series. But the question for the audience is: Mike feels uncomfortable as Gee's son or Esposito, who is uncomfortable in the role. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Esposito didn't have a chance to play the main story. Without interruption That is because the writer chose this time to revive the story that uses the wisdom of the privileged people to show <br /> <br /> streaming video that has been promoted and appears to be true on the internet. After the red fish, the detective caught the suspect. But the state prosecutor Zaljko Ivanek was harassed and overworked, forgetting to move in time and the suspect was released just to be killed later. <br /> <br /> Summarize: He forgot to Make a document because it's not The most exciting case of his career because of the mayor, the attorney general, the governor, the entire Maryland legislature, US Attorney, NBC, TV court, BBC, AP, Reuters news agency, people, the sun, Washington The Post, The New York Times, LA Times, Time Magazine, The Times of London, Economist, Johannesburg Mail and Guardian, L'Osservatore Romano, Lefi. Caro, Paris matches, L'Equipe and the computer world To inquire about the status of the case, <br /> <br /> However, the detective gang and the old group of associates returned to Baltimore to help. There are many talents displayed. Unfortunately there is a limited amount of talk. Some people are just acting. <br /> <br /> Two of the strongest performers, Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, have been used in criminal matters and Michael Michelle should be used. Better time with ads The writer seemed to be satirical about this story by presenting Jason Priestley as the latest big detective. On the other hand, they make the scene easy to come and go easily. Michelle Forbes <br /> <br /> There is another selection of new actors with Lt. Gary D. Adidas. She is the center of the book. Causing the show to play another detective Invited guests to join other programs, such as Whitney Allen, to look just and innocent. "Miss Sally" from the children's performances that the inmates love "Oz." Fontana Dina Napoli from WBAL TV appeared as herself. br /> <br /> Although entertaining But these guests can divert attention Ed Beckley Jr. developed the real story of a brief appearance in the role of Dr. Victor Ehrich from "Another St.". He is still a lively character and suitable for the condition. Hospital environment So you can remember that St. Elegance did not become the imagination of an autistic child. <br /> <br /> The most useful pendant reflects the power of the organization. This film was created when Court TV bought the rights to the new series. The network has legal help by Helen Lucaitis, who had interviewed the murder team and later appeared in "Oz". The TV reporter worked effectively in the news summary, namely planning scores for those who came back. <Br <br /> <br /> Although she was so thin that she disappeared when she turned side-by-side, but Lucaitis also handled the comedy with Esposito. He showed the juice in his scene with Lucaitis more than any colleague. One of his Maybe these two people should spin. <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, the actor's cream will float to the top. Even though they were saddened by the loser, Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor had overcome them. Their performances made the audience think of a large number of murders, the best air shows and one of the television works. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see the pro. It's an embarrassing story that this movie doesn't give them more opportunities. True fans may want to watch this movie. But you can live without it
