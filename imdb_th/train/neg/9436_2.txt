Unhinged follows the general plot of the slasher trend. In the early 80's, a beautiful girl in danger. I have to give up for the filmmakers who use helicopters to shoot before traveling. You think that for a second, there will be quality in production. Seeing "Unhinged" is like seeing past amateur actors classes. It warms up Some of the brightest and poorest scenes of the long scene are played with Valium's overdose zest. I wonder why they don't just put the cue card on the camera so the actress doesn't have to change. Their eyes all the time Two main women were clearly chosen for their T&A factors rather than their ability. Laurel Munson is Terry's main chicks. Two nude scenes create excitement for teenagers, Janet Penner and Virginia Settle. As an eerie and cowardly daughter and mother, they find themselves stuck in the worst competition. A long pause, a strange expression, highlighting all the wrong words there and being happy for those of us outside who love bad movies. The scene changes suddenly with a long black color. You can drive a truck. Mack gets the lightning from the cartoon causing problems during the shot without having to disturb the sky. Eighty eyeshadow that hurt the audience. But you know it grows with me I feel sorry about it. I want to hug it and kiss it as a boooo and make it better. The ending did not compensate for the damage that occurred. But i'm smiling I have my own theory about all "flat" hype and hope that anyone who chooses to watch this movie is done with many addictive substances and humor.
