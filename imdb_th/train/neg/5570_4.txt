Focus on it. <br /> <br /> Entertainment: worthless scripts printed by people without intelligence in front of thousands of typewriters .. Pathetic performances that block the story ... Good production value set / location and beautiful girls .. -aging 4/10 <br /> <br /> social messages: movies without social messages It's a free idea ... but if I pretend I'm 10 and my IQ is 70, I feel that the message is: Don't be afraid to love? Ranking 0/10 <br /> <br /> Nasty things: There is nothing special, just a nasty and arrogant religious attitude of Jews presented by writers / directors in general and speaking well. Nothing bad-8/10 <br /> <br /> The overall score is 4/10.
