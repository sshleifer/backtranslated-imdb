This is one of the worst movies that Clark Gable created. Obviously only PARNELL. It is a very painful ancient idea and the dialogue is so scary that it is not something that Gable and Jean Harlow are proud of. Gable is a heel which is an illegal activity which causes his girl to go to the cage (like a gangster talking). She holds the hope that he will do the right thing. But he just left her there - both knew that she was "Family way" Finally, the gangsters go back to do the right thing and they tie it all together in a happy ending! It seems that they forgot about rap-like gables and spent many years in the hoosegow. Leonard Maltin said, "Their stars are the best here." What standards? Best to produce unintended laughs <br /> <br /> PS - After saying this, my wife thinks Leonard Multin is looking for me and kicking my butt. Hmmm. My opinion, I think Mr Maltin is the best critic and man on this planet. (I hope it will please him) <br /> <br /> Update - 2/2/08 because I don't like this movie for the first time. (Especially ridiculous ending) I decided to look again After all, sometimes when I watch movies again, I like it more and realize that I'm too serious. Although it was the case that there were many movies in the past few months, I still don't like this movie - even the second time. Mostly not because of the first half of the movie In the first half, Harlow's character is astonishingly stupid. But at least convincing But when she was sent to prison, it was a clich√© until the last vain wedding scene. The bottom line is that this sequence is dumb, embarrassing - it's not reasonable and is like changing a movie into a strange fairy tale instead of a love story about two disadvantages. I stood by my original criticism (although not "not helpful") and thought that apart from Parnell and maybe Polly at the circle, it might be the worst gable movie.
