Not as bad as it should be (Hooper made worse than this) ?? Very disappointing for me This imaginative concept, which had never been used by Hooper with his economic direction and even less so in the writing of smoke (pun excuse), it was scary and very common in a violent tone. And nonsense became nonsense and did not focus on letting pessimistic mysteries / conspiracy narrative conspiracy For this reason, walking is quite slow, and Brad Dourif (cool to see him in the lead role) seems to struggle with an unbalanced performance, even though he is showing strange emotions even though it is being dropped quickly. But with a technical attitude that is capable However, it seems that he didn't go anywhere from the original idea and wants to plaster in the nasty jolts. (Which some people work) and use excellent special techniques (flames, flames everywhere) instead of Hooper showing beautiful images with style (More and more until the end) and the camera's operation was quickly controlled and the score was smiling. The performances were all over the store, with the presence of William Cynthia Ben, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis. There were small but fun pendants, especially Landis. Nothing surprising But it is patiently involved
