I rented this car to see Vanesa Talor again. She can show. But did not get a chance in this clunker Must come from the archive because the movie is taken directly to the videotape Production costs make _Blair Witch_ look professional. There are really wonderful moving statues. But there are no other effects that should be worth observing This movie is not good. But not so funny Players won't have to mention in their resume.
