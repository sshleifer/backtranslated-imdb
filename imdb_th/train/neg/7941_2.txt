At the age of 2000, King Kong's sponsored daughter went ahead and announced that her performance would end. <br /> <br /> While Miss Winfrey was torn, I laughed and screamed like forest India from the old west <br /> <br /> What does Oprah do? She brought celebrities and showed her. Which celebrity? People who have suffered (Like her, except these people lose more than purity) They have to face a dissolved face (real story), lost limbs (real stories, see the end of paragraphs) and spousal abuse.) And Somehow, they came to the show and told their story as if we had never heard of tons and tons. (Bethany Hamilton, I heard your story about losing an arm to a shark from the first day, which is October 31st, 2003. Don't tell me that you don't have a heavy feeling.) But the biggest thing in Oprah is Michael Jackson's interview in 1993 after being accused of child abuse Sadly, Mr. Jackson has died. But one special show tells about Michael's personal life, something that many people do not know at that time. Oprah's true influence comes from middle-aged women and football mothers. It seems that they sometimes think that she is like Jesus personally. But all I saw in Oprah was a huge slum woman who made it big and she showed how rich she was. <br /> <br /> I'm glad she showed that she would end up in no time. slow We need better TV programs.
