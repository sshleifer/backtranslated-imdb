I actually rented this movie from the fact that the cover attracted me. However, as soon as the film started, I regretted it. It looks like they use a video camera at home to film this movie and let young children do it. They also use the faces and inappropriate shapes of ghosts to try and scare people. But I found myself laughing. I could gather it together and work better. <br /> <br /> For the story that I felt it Have a really good idea But because there are dodge lines and in some cases the performances they are obscured It has no direction. <br /> <br /> I don't want to sit everything because it makes me physically hurt to watch it. But I always end what I started, so I breathe deeply and let it continue. Of course, 98 minutes of my life is lost. <br /> <br /> I'll help myself hard. The heart knows that you can see the 'Haunted Ship' and find more fun things. I'm a big fan of horror movies with a low budget. But this is a big disappointment that I think there is nothing worse than this after 'Terror Toons', but this makes me consider it again. Let it be its line. <br /> <br /> * From ***** (the star is for the idea of ​​having the worst fear for them)
