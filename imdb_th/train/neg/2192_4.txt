Another movie that relies on repetitive and tedious words of mad scientists. The movie around the center of life's ambitious surgeon is bringing the dead back to life again. I know. I know ... You have never heard of this before! Of course, these movies go all the way, experimenting so much wrong and creating crazy and bloody creatures. For this trend setting, you would think that at least it is questionable, incorrect. As with many movies in this era, that idea is good. But the operation and the script are moderate Not the worst horror movie I've ever seen (No, Abominator: the Evilmaker 2 still uses cakes) ... but not one of the gems.
