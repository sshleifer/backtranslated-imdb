It seems that this movie is disjointed and overall poorly written. The screenplay will move along with 10 different people, writing and no one communicating. Obviously, they want to take the face from the miracle to the movie, Road 34 (original), but it was done in a bad way until the movie broke. This movie is for young children and even they also see the fact that anyone who uses the script knows a little about baseball, like: <br /> <br /> Or when the angel is in the place Finally, the owner doesn't seem to care and he doesn't care about the fact that his manager has just fought with his pitcher? On the hill? Or whether he will switch the play of the team by the announcer playing on live TV However, when the team is the only game from winning, he is devoted to (Which came from the age of 6 years) that the manager received help from a child claiming to see a real angel What sounds terrible The loss of violence from the team manager who lost 15 consecutive teams, right? Or a coach who wins in the playoffs that behaves strangely and helps children. The owner's reaction is not reasonable. And he changed his mind by Maggie and her words 'Straight out of the ancient thoughts during the press conference <br /> <br /> ?? Angels should play for the squad in the final weekend against the team. However, at the end of the game, the announcer said the angel will win the flag. "The flag didn't decide until someone won the league. Not a regular season name. <br /> <br /> Whitt Bass, goofball pitcher, is the starting pitcher and wins the game that destroys the broken Angels as the starting pitcher of the VERY NEXT. <br /> <br / > ?? Mel Clark (Tony Danza) has been said in the ninth inning to throw 156 pitches in a ballgame that has a generally low score in a game that scores low, the field number is much lower. Usually there are about 80-90 stadiums. <br /> <br /> "AL" The angel said at the end that "The championships must win by themselves" even though he and his angels will manage and fix it. Games throughout the second half of the season <br /> <br /> I can continue to play because there are many examples that the story is not well written. <br /> <br /> For younger children (lower 10 years) This movie may be entertaining. Is it too bad ?? Correct, this may be a classic Made this mistake and a memorable order to live forever in the form of UHF / cable on Saturday morning
