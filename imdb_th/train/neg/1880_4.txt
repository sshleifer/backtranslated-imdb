Despite being a big fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, but about 6 years ago, I saw 'Follow the Fleet' for the first time. At this point, <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, these songs are catchy. Just not like 'Bake Baker' while trying to find his long-time partner, he constantly sabotaged her career. His character does not have the humor and style of the other characters of the movie Astaire. <br /> <br /> Great value for music and Ginger Rogers great single-touch routines.
