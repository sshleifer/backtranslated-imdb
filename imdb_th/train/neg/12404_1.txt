I must say that this movie is Mork and Mindy, shocked when watching it. I feel chills. I still wet myself a bit. When that Korean man with a spider in his neck kicked me, like an Asian, my boss smelled and sucked, causing them to eat dogs all the time. Regardless of which path, Chuck has a terrible performance and lacks human intelligence that is not a robot. Some people will compare with his previous days when he was analyzing the car wash and believing in the Holy Spirit and ghosts in the past of Christmas. This movie is terrible. I put a new born baby in the box and leave it in your Norris mailbox. He can raise my child. I do not let him enter the world that he thinks Chuck Norris is a sick Karate expert. Let him see how hacking is in real life for the rest of his life.
