.... This mini does not improve with age. I saw this and it was a sequel, when it first aired and like others that were blown away in early 2002. I borrowed both WOW and W and R novels and were more impressed. Then I decided to see both again and invest $ 200 plus a DVD set. I watched the two minis again in painful detail and realized that I had done things backward - I should buy a novel and borrow a DVD. <br /> <br /> Don't believe it is a thought. Wrong? Read fiction and see for yourself Don't think this is a date? Scrutinize it for someone who is not old enough to see it broadcast and see the reaction you have received. (Warning - reactions from those from horror to belly laughing) <br /> <br /> Follow the topic. A little story for this mini Dan-Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum! Production quality, musical scoring, dialogue - a great story became a television drama in the late 1970s by ambitious producers / directors. This is the day that the minute is complete. <br /> <br /> Two minis are great when the original broadcasts and we who see them at that time pull the nostalgia that reminds us of the younger days of IMO - This mini hardly depends on the reputation and severely disappointed.
