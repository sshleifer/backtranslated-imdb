Hey Arnold! Is a slow and slightly boring movie The story is not very creative. The character Paul Sorvino (Shenk) is buying all the depreciated buildings at a low price to build a giant department store, department store and office building This plot goes back to the movie in the 1960s. Many things are boring. Paul Sorvino is not too excited, so his thoughts as bad people are not terrible. Gramps remember something about the way documents. The history and the rest of the film is about 36 hours ago when Arnold and Jamal had to search for documents with help from Helga's spies. Having to walk around the city with a bus, so the exciting chase scenes that are related to the bus are not only stupid, but also emphasize that the film was written for children. With enough humor to attract adults TV cartoons tend to play faster and have more imagination than this movie. Hey Arnold, this movie is five times more calm and is a great way to make everyone, including the little ones, sleep. Hey Arnold is a strong man who is constantly awake until the predictable and totally boring ending. If you want to send your child to a movie that is totally unpleasant I felt that instead of trying to make a 90-minute movie, the producer started with a 30-minute TV cartoon and tried to expand to 90 minutes. This Mall Story would cover TV cartoons. Hopefully Arnold will bet on a better writer if there is a sequel.
