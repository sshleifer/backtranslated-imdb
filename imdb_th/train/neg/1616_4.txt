Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The second episode of the movie Che. This brought the story to the end of the 60s, which the man had now moved his battle into the mountains of South America, surviving without enough food and water, and tensions between groups. Everything came when he crossed the border into Bolivia and the government forces added a campaign to disappoint him. <br /> <br /> Without separation between the time and place of the latest film. About the action on the hill and manage to be a boring experience And the more cautious the score was drowned, causing the second installment of the air of artisans to be more unpleasant, which proved to be alienating There is only boredom in movies that do not give up. You can't blame Soderbergh's ambitions or Del Toro's drive in the lead role. It's just a shame that somewhere in producing something that has managed to take a disappointing turn. **
