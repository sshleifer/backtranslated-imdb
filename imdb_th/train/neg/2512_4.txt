Tim Robbins has a gentle personality. Here, handsome as a car mechanic. In 1950, New Jersey fell in love with the impudent blonde girl who became Albert Einstein's niece! Although he was on the screen for the most part, the Robbins canceled the inner workings of his intense characters and faded into the background. (It's easy to forget him even in the picture!) A romantic comedy filled with tricks that Walter Matt plays as Einstein. (Which does what he can do with a cartoon character) otherwise it is sweet and sunny, quite sleepy by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but without intelligence or brain Meg is her normal cute character and her relationship with Robbins is as charming as her lovely sister and her big brother. ** from ****
