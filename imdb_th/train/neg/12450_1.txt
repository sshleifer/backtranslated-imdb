The ten-minute story that is stretched to the better part of two hours When nothing is important at the center, I should leave. But I still have hope And went away with the guilt that wasted time The performance is ok. But the story is very transparent and weak The script is lame as it should be. But again, the elapsed ten-minute period did not make enough space for discussion.
