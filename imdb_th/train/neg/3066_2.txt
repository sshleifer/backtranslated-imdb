This is a new movie created from the first film in the 70s. I saw the original at least 6 times. Version 1997 is a 20 minute movie. "Crammed" is 2 hours or whatever at runtime. A magical story that is completely different from the original. Significant government involvement has been drawn far. There is no current from one scene to the next. In the traditional way, you can go for a beer or go to the bathroom and still follow. <br /> <br /> Spend a few hours watching movies in the car's oil pan. In real life, it takes many times longer. People in the car noticed this. In addition, stupid people or fools who chose to leave the charger in 1968 and the use of inappropriate competitors in the 1970s should be shot with boring ammunition. The fact that they are not 'people in the car' is painfully clear and their passing will not be grieved. <br /> <br /> The actors do not have emotions. Everything is cut and dried. One step above the monotonous barmitzvah is exciting and energetic. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, DJ Radio issued a statement saying that the challenger hit the 180 or 185 (??) that is all garbage. Can you speak aerodynamic or lack it? Hahaha!! This movie is a joke. Don't waste time watching this thing.
