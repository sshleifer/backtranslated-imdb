Yes .. This definitely is there with some of the worst MSTifyed movies. But I saw it worse. Of course, I think that the Gremlins were rated R. Well, I met Rick Sloane at an amazing sci-fi meeting. It was one of the very low budget meetings that everything went on. Everyone brought something. (If you want to see shit, you should see what my friend and I brought in) <br /> <br /> He seems to be a very good person. Tell me that don't take it seriously and say that he likes the MST3K version! <br /> <br /> All Rick Sloane knows what he is doing. And I think it's not as good as attacking Mars So I thought I stood up for this film and gave it 5 and betrayed all my friends MSTies. Sorry, friend.
