I am glad to read many negative comments about Trier's plans. Everyone I talk to will say the same thing. They like the vulgar nature of the House and his intelligence. But did not like the vengeance of the following study plan It cuts into the true nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry with the police. It must have an attentive nature rather than a vengeance towards everyone at the hospital. There are also many questionable legal issues about what Tritter is doing. He alone cannot freeze accounts and have the power to stop doctors from writing prescriptions for patients. The vengeance that he has shown so much is hurting the seriously ill patients in the hospital and the story is not a good thing to show. I voted a scary episode, not because of the story itself. But when you insert the Trittor piece, it will close me and the rest of the plot is hurt by it. People say they hate to see the story line anymore. Please change. Get Tritter out.
