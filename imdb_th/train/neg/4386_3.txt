With a title like this, you wouldn't expect a great horror movie. But this thing is terrible, even if it has low expectations. This plot is really insulting and stupid: criminals who flee, wear Halloween masks, so everyone around him thinks he is someone else. This joke may actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not during the entire movie! The actors were not that bad. But their characters are quite stupid and the story is completely boring and stupid. There is no suspense, no excitement and a little blood (very cheap). Satan's little helper tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and has failed so much about that. It was boring until I finally stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. I didn't care what happened. Amanda Plummer was good at Pulp Fiction, but .. 13 years ago and she didn't do anything good after that So it's not surprising that she must sink as low as this shit .. Avoid or be warned ..
