One of the worst movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Low production values, bad thoughts, bad scripts, lacking performances ... and I can't think of adjectives that are suitable for Poverty can be directed to Joan River. I know that there is a special place in hell for those who receive this scholarship. Below the level reserved for genocide like crazy. <br /> <br /> This movie is a train wreck. <br /> <br /> (Terrible) x (Infinity) = Test the rabbit. <br /> <br /> <br /> Avoid this all the time. <br /> <br /> It's terrible. It's not funny how bad it is.
