Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** <br /> <br /> A few real movies. "Terrible, they are good" and Zombi 3 is not only bad. It is a pity. In many ways, it may be necessary to use a whole new language to describe them all. <br /> <br /> The more More than that, it is a movie that is credited to Lucio Fulci that even if his standards do not have a consistent reason or reason. However, we cannot blame Fulci because it is not really directed by him but Bruno Mattei, who doesn't have the style of Fulci to help carry this film. Mattei seems to bring a little story to this film. <br /> <br /> So I feel ashamed to say that I enjoy every minute of the worthless Zombi 3. For characters that are weak and lacking skills in making movies, Zombi 3 pushes the ship away. But in doing so, it's more fun than Nightmare City. <br /> <br /> "Action" begins when "Death 1" gas is stolen from the military base and is damaged in escape. Who is the thief? Why is he stealing and why do the US soldiers think that creating a deadly army is a good idea? All these questions and many will not be able to answer in Zombi 3 .... <br /> <br /> After hiding at the hotel, the infected robbers are angry from the green plasticizer growing on His face before being tracked By a rather stupid army decided the best way to get rid of his corpse is to burn it, sending "Death 1" to the atmosphere, resulting in ... zombies zombies! Anyone who attacks people and makes them become zombies! (If zombies are humans, why do zombies not attack other birds? <br /> <br /> Then we will meet our three "heroes" with three men and a female coach. There are two other men too. But they are not important - no one is important here. You will be hard pressed to remember everyone's face, let alone their names or find reasons to take care of them. They hid at the same hotel as the robbers. ("Last week, this place was full of life, now it's full of flies!") But there is no way to escape from death. <br /> <br /> By this point you will be sucked in. Or not closing things that are cursed The script is very scary, even the greatest performances in the world can't be recorded, so it's the same. They have the worst thing - and not just the characters. The human zombies shown here are always low. There is no consistency with the way that zombies behave shaky in a respectable style, while others are fully involved in fist fighting or darting around with machine guns, not to mention zombies that can still talk. A hopeless twist at the end) They died from a bullet to the chest. (Instead of the head) and even being hit with a good left hook How can you chase off zombies ??? !!!!! In fact, focusing on bad actions in the 80s often makes the episode look like V ... <br /> <br /> Zombies still spend a lot of time hiding, seemingly waiting for hours in Ridiculous place The property will pass and receive the horrors of their lives. They hide in the bushes in the garage, in the roof huts in the water and even under pregnant women. At one point, the zombies followed a woman up the stairs. To kill and eat her? No! In order to push her into the water of these zombies and their strange humor, <br /> <br /> There are many holes, limbs are hacked, wounds are pus, green swamps and there are many ways to eat meat. And the people who received their faces louder, nothing to match the original eyeballs But if the bad effect is your bag down, <br /> <br /> All of this and I haven't talked about the scary music, the head of the flying zombies can't explain. Really bad or cold punch .... With creativity at the original radio station that was attacked by zombies Zombi 3 makes us a real zombie DJ !! "He's gone to their side!" Before swearing to fight the Undead in the tragic sequel. Never come. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 is rubbish - it won't lose anyway. The world, if every print job is destroyed and all The record of its existence has been deleted. In any way, I felt that my life had improved because I saw it. <br /> <br /> Can I speak better? I mean, shorten 88 minutes ...
