This thing does not match the Castle of Cagliostro. Lupine is not funny or bizarre or over-cover. The scenery and music are not received and the storyline is not interesting. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is good about this is nude. (Only in the uncut version) by Fujiko. It helps to make the scene boring. CoC has a formidable villain and sets the movie for the fantasy scene. The location in TSoTG is not bright or engaging. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen do not provide entertainment in this great slide show. It's like they've just fulfilled their promise by appearing. <br /> <br /> The DVD is full frame with Dolby Stereo sound. But one thing that is curious There is no selection on the disc or the time displayed on the player when inserted. Even if you can still jump to the next scene number using the remote
