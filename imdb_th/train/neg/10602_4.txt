This movie is mostly a scandal and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because the actor Jean-Claud Vam Damme in this movie has a good action scene in this movie and the best scene is At the end of the movie <br /> <br /> The performance in this movie is terrible and the worst performance I have ever seen and two actors, Gold Goldberg and Michael Jai White, cannot be shown and the movie This Must be one of Jean-Claud Vam Dammes, the worst movies he has ever done and if you will watch him in one of his best movies, you should watch KickBoxer or Sudden Death blood sports. <br /> <br /> This movie is nonsense / OK and my rating is 4 out of 10.
