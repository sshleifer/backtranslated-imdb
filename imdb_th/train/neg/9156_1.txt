Ben & Arthur COULD was 10 years old. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed and produced the film. Sam should give his thoughts to the writer, director and leave a good performance for someone who can perform. This is a good example of one person who controls all production. No one told him that "Sam is really bad." <br /> <br /> Jamie Brett Gabriel's performance is just one good point. The actor who will work with <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. I think Sam Mraovich should be tied to the chair and make the movie look (twice). Actions and directions are very bad. As a joke You just have to laugh and in the wrong place. <br /> <br /> The second good point .... This will make it a great movie. After the first two minutes, you will stop watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
