Full House is one of the worst TV series ever! Why, because every character is annoying, it is impossible to play the best character, Joey. Although he is somewhat annoying, sometimes this DJ girl who wrote her character, I want to Kill yourself every time Speaking of when Danny started with his philosophy, <br /> <br /> Example: The DJ won about ten thousand dollars or more in the casino. However, she was not eighteen, so she should not gamble. In law Ready to pay you But Danny, her father, is yours and don't let her raise that money because she is not eighteen years old. Come to me and I will stop, right? Because I see it stupid and innocent. The scene that I immediately closed on television, something that they said in this series, not even children to buy anyone in this world who thinks Full House is fun and funny. Every word they say in this series seems like Shakespeare. wrote it except that Shakespere knew how to write and except that he was not a kid and a fool who would write something stupid, like written in the script for Full House! <br /> <br /> For everyone Have a bad heart or have a condition Bad medicine or life or any feelings in the real world. I highly recommend that 'Don't watch the whole house'! In the meantime, try to avoid this series, save yourself from foolishness and ridiculousness. This is the worst TV program ever! I want to see Teletubbies now. 'Don't watch this.'
