Follow the same path as the first sequel. Very good. The second one is medium and this one is full of bad performances and stupid dialogue and has a lot of unbelief. Like a boss with stupid eyes, there is much more that they can do I like the very first one. I hope they will go down those lines more than what they do here. <br /> <br /> There are too many unnecessary explanations to explain the old phones in Is that room? <br /> <br /> I understand that there is another place to work. <br /> <br /> Blah!
