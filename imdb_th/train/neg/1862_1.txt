It's not just the plot that makes this movie a boring story for the audience. It's a terrible direction with scary scripts and left and right mistakes that make it look too painful. I'm sorry. But I don't see 'fun' in this thing. A lot and foolish one I wonder how stupid directors think about their manufacturing companies when this film is first introduced. Probably a stupid person like a sheriff who goes into a pickup truck full of antifreeze and blood blisters. Oh! I forgot to mention this sheriff. But only a poor actor I guess he had forgotten when he won an exciting victory for the snowman.
