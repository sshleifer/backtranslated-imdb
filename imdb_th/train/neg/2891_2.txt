I started writing this review during my break when I watched movies. This is the first time I try to do that. But I have trouble passing this thing without a break from time to time. That's not because it's serious. But because it's terrible, <br /> <br /> It's almost boring and unbelievable, especially when Ryan's dying brother (Colm Feore) is on a tragic screen. Self-life, this is probably a much better movie if they leave that character out of the story. <br /> <br /> He doesn't add anything except blasphemy, Modlin, the melodrama that Very annoying Maybe someone decides that if they can't believe Ryan, they may make him disgusting. The problem is this: Who cares if the jerk is spoiled, loud and nasty? <br /> <br /> The only thing that this character has for him is the fact that he is dying and apologizing. But that's not enough Death does not make anyone special. We are dying sooner or later. It doesn't give anyone the right to expect sympathy while acting like a jerk. <br /> <br /> Two other characters and actors play him (David Cubitt is Theo and Chandra West is Sarah. ) Is much more interesting and their story without Ryan's self-pitying interruption will make the movie much better But it's not over yet and has time to play again May be a wonderful thing happened before the end .... <br /> <br /> Don't apologize to the turkey who rented this back tonight!
