I didn't expect this movie to be as good as "In The Line of Fire" or the episode of "24", but it seems that this movie is made for TV and works best. That the plot is predictable and the actor struggles (They try to do the best I think) through their bad script. When I watch movies, I feel that I can see this in other movies (better). In that, you have to chase cars, big shootouts, romance, twisted plot etc. etc.; <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** As soon as you see another woman talking on the phone with Cuban characters, you know who is behind all this and all the advice you have. Received ("You stand near the president too. Look from my point of view ..") The sound is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If it's up to me (And maybe it's a good thing that isn't) I write this plot: <br /> <br /> The First Lady ordered her murder The husband because she is sick and tired of writing checks to Cuba all the time
