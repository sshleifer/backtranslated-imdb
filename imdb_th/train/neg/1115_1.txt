We saw this on the shelf at a local video store. See "Coppola" on credit and excited. That was the only time this film was interested. I can't work out if it's an effort in a movie that has miserable humor. In general, all production seems to be incredible. The sound is particularly terrifying, especially in scenes shot in the little band; The conversation is repetitive in the unbelievable part. Very disappointing
