Because some people like me like to know everything about the movie, even if they plan to watch it, including the ending However, this is the end I remember because I couldn't be older than 8 years when I saw it for the first time and once on TV. But I will tell you, of course, that I am afraid of the little boy and I think about it many days after that, and it still stands out in my heart to this day, although some details are a little vague. or not? I do not remember! I can't remember the old Barnabas being in this movie and I love Dark Shadows. So at the end of the lead character (Belinda Montgomery?) Was tempted by the judge (Joseph Cotton, I guess even though I remember he was a family doctor or anything faded?) To the wedding venue, while I remember it was in some caves. ? Maybe i'm wrong And Shelley Winter is laughing, and the judge has a cloak and a camera angle looking at him and he throws his cloak back and he has a goat's leg and he announces that he is her demon father And she played with their hands (Satanism) because of the "human" man she fell in love with (I guess Robert Foxworth) became a man that Satan wanted to marry her with a demon With yellow eyes and yes, they showed Robert Foxworth and his eyes glowing in yellow There are a lot of close-ups during the last few minutes of the movie. Everyone laughed and was glad, except Belinda Montgomery, who was very unhappy, sang and screamed or screamed or something and that was the end. The bad guy won.
