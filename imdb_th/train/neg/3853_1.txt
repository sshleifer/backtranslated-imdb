I think Jason Lee has a high potential, but this is a wrong vehicle that tries to break out as a star. Funny scary plot is awesome. I laughed twice. I thought of relief because looking back they were quite funny. I found myself afraid of the future of Fletch and had to comfort myself that it was a defective movie, not Lee. <br /> <br /> Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot, but I recommend looking at Photos on this website to find out that instead of this movie Save your time 1 star
