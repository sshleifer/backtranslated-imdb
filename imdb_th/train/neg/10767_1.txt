Not only is the most expensive Canadian movie ever in BC But is still the worst thing that has never been seen before Director is not a Canadian But being an Englishman and a boy, showing us all, all done as drugs and monsters The spirit of the meaning of being a Canadian is absent, and this should be the reason we give this scholarship for the two classes. Of course, the British characters are normal. The rest is the sitcom drama. Can you say "Norm !!"? The movie shooting ranges from beautiful postcards to dark indoor shadows. The actor always seems to be restless. Are they tired of watching or being a movie director? Avoid this mess and watch the movie of Bruce Mcdonalds, a true Canadian boy with something original to say in the cinema. You will not be forced to walk in the HIS movie after 10 minutes.
