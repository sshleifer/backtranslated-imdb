Think of a darker version of one of the children performing like "Power Rangers" and you have this movie since 1990 "Robot Jox", a movie that you fight with giant robots, two men entering the stadium and whoever wins. Their country The robot is large and looks like a slightly better version of the list, mostly because they are less colorful, so while the film isn't good, it's not bad to watch. There is something I remember that the battle of two robots in this one ended badly and the final showdown. There is a plot that revolves around when a traitor is revealed. But in the end, the plot has nothing to take with you for how long after the picture is finished. Their battle looks like a giant toy on a rampage. But still looking fun This film will spawn a few other films with similar planning devices such as giant robots and tournaments. Therefore should be checked once But may not be more than that
