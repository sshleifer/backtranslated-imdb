Payback is a game played in this drama and the revenge story is canceled by a ridiculous story that sets the stage for fireworks to come later. Why did a man get involved with the brutal mob boss's mob in the gang's mansion with suspicious followers around him? Why the unhappy wife will completely stimulate the interest of strangers and expect him to take her with him and leave her husband and boredom behind to live happily after Her new love? Of course, the hero here, Kevin Costner, had to expect a reaction from a cuckold, which made the movie an excuse to indulge in violence and violence. Anthony Quinn, the great actor he deserves, definitely better, and Madeleine Stowe is a very tragic person who has to suffer a lot while she binds her charm. Her man Stowe is fine. But her Spanish accent does not work The player's pendant is less than good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland. It is interesting as the rock star is fading away.
