As a horror movie fan, I try to watch all the major novels of this genre, especially those that are the products of my native cinema. And I can say that "The power of fear" (or "Vedma" is the name of Russia) is one of the weakest films among them. First, it's not terrible, even a little boy. It's a slow pace and guessing that there is no place for true horror. Frankly speaking, it is terrible in every issue: from a foolish story. (I don't know why the Russian producer / director decided to change the classic story about some Ukrainian spells into American thriller. Previous auditors - it wasn't a bit exciting) and for the horror and horror of the actors All actors, including Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova, famous in Russia, look like a wooden doll or something like that, and it seems to me that they are not interested in speaking at all, just speaking their English without any expression and ultimately I do not understand why they filmed this movie in English with Russian actors? I think it's their fault. At least they can select some American or British actors to make them look more reliable. I can say that "The background of a small town in America" ​​which was filmed in Estonia and it seems The only positive moment I found in "The power of fear" is a visual effect. They are not excellent. But quite good for Russian movies And the song is ok, at least not to bother me That's why I gave two stars. Overall, if you want to watch a good horror movie ?? Do not waste time and money on this boring flick. And if you are looking for something that claims to be a Russian horror movie, I suggest you search for a copy of "Viy or The Spirit of Evil". It is a great movie made from the same novel as "Power of Fear. "But much better
