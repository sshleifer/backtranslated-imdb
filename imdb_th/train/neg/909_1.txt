Never considered excuses for apologizing for this movie before The way it was shot, bright, action, etc. was not reasonable. It's very bad. It's hard to see. Reload the clip again and again. There seems to be no 'normal' person in the whole film and the existence of the 'outside world' is good. And why the bald man was suddenly invincible? This film is beyond zero stupidity.
