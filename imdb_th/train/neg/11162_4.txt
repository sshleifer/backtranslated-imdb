Jack Black is an annoying character. This is an indie movie that is annoying for a 14 year old. Do I have to write eight lines? Ana de la Regura is happy to look like a nun. Mexican The rudeness of Jack Black, this film is an indie film version of PG 13. I like the movie with the courage to explore Mexican culture. This film explores the culture of the Mexicans deeply. I'm just choking cultural rudeness: Jack Black is very rude. White people like Jack Black are not my most valuable ambassadors in Mexican culture, as they used to be. Mexican culture is not the most disgusting thing like white people like me. Search car. I wonder if Mexico is present here. <br /> <br /> I think IMDb changed my opinion, others have changed their opinion as well, right?
