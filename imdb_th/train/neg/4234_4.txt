It's not the best slasher movie ever made. But for what it was, it was quite amusing The plot is weak. But killing is not bad. I must be honest, if you don't follow the band that is featured in this movie, you won't find that this movie is a joke like the one doing. I know someone who saw this movie and was really disappointed because the movie was low quality. But you have to understand that it was built in the free time of the tour while playing with the kids and drinking with friends behind the stage .. It was not taken seriously. It is a nice punk ubber cheese And with more than 100 types of killings, most of which are blood that is full of blood, it is a fun movie with friends to watch, drink and cheerful!
