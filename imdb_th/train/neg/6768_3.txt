Herbie Volkswagen, who thinks like a man, has now been driven by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing that is blocking her way is the current champion, Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who will do everything to stop them. <br /> <br /> The initial love problem is not good. Even when I was a child, I didn't remember how much I liked. I have some hope for the future. I mean, the actors are very good and the trailer makes it look like a fun movie. Unfortunately, Herbie doesn't get better than now. This film is susceptible to people over 12 years of age. It may entertain children, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I know it's a movie for kids and all. It's boring until near the end. Most actors seem to die in their roles as well. Lindsay Lohan is a good person like Maggie Peyton. She always gives better performances like Freaky Friday and Mean Girls Matt Dillon gives the best performance from everyone. He's very good as a bad guy, even though he doesn't have much work. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really there and they don't do anything special. <br /> <br /> Angela Robinson leads the director and She works well She tried to make the movie interesting. But she worked with a weak chapter Thomas Lennon and Ben Gardan wrote the screenplay and would you be surprised that they were responsible for the taxi and the Pacifier? Both created light movies. But they failed to make the story interesting or fun It's not all fault. But hopefully the next time they will try more. In the end, Herbie is a safe and predictable family movie that is worth watching if you are young. Others will be better if skipping the score 4/10.
