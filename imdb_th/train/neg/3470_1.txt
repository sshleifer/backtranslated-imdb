Like most of Ben Affleck's movies, the comedy is dry and the story is predictable. That is, if you want to call this story Many points are connected without thinking at all. I want to thank the director for not explaining better issues. I say that because that means torture will last longer. For any Ben Affleck's failure, this is no exception and can only be survived by other actors. Even though most performances were planned and unbelievable Traveling down the channel of memories with actors that I didn't see over the past years was not worth the price. Everyone thinks that they should be told. My choice is to wait for my car to repair or watch this movie. I made the wrong decision Overall, I will give one laugh ... mostly because that's all I got from it.
