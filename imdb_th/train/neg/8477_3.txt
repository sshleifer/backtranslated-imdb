I hate this movie personally because it can be predicted. The character is stereotypical and all the ideas are cut from "The Cutting Edge" and "Cadet Kelly". <br /> <br /> The main character. Is a vile woman sent to a place that she doesn't The place that hates her and makes things worse. There are hot guys who don't seem to like her. (See the whole school, all the insults can not stand you) Surprisingly, she found a way to match and make everyone like her, plus accepting men to fall in love with her. Then, as an alternative, she had to choose between figure skating and hockey. She chose hockey. She then went to figure skating under the royal patronage and joined the Olympic team. No wonder. <br /> <br /> This movie is a predictable story. You know what will happen before you see it. This was terrible. I almost slapped and by the time I finished watching it, I had a lot of headaches and wanted to shoot myself to see the shit. Don't watch this unless you are under ten years old or like watching Twee Crappy movies.
