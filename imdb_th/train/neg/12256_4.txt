Oh my God, I must see this when I am only 11 or twelve years old (don't ask). I may still be young. But i am not stupid Everyone can see that this is a bad movie, nasty, nasty, scary and very stupid. I have seen more impressive effects at Disneyland. I have seen better performances in school play and I have seen crocodiles that are more convincing in the zoo that they do not do. In the water. <br /> <br /> The story is located in northern Australia. A number of ambitious young people are trying to play new water sports, surfing in the waters full of sharks. Soon it became clear that there was something more dangerous in the water. They were rescued by a gritty middle-aged fisherman who wanted to kill an animal to avenge the family's eating. <br /> <br /> I thought I had seen all the crocodile movies made during the last period Fifteen years, the best thing is Placid Lake, and the worse is its sequel. Blood Surf must flick the second-worst croc that I think with Primeval and the Crocodile tail closely. <br /> <br /> Australian saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures in it. Injured or killed every year. Movies such as Blood Surf destroy not only But the fierce images of living things like this But a good hour and a half of the life of the audience If you don't really want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.
