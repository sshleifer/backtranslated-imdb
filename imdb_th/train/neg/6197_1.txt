At the end of this movie, I just asked myself: "Is it a movie that is worse than I have ever seen or is it a movie that is worse than I have ever seen?" Who watched this movie and thought about its meaning, you could not find any meaning, and you can remember the two rape scenes that are incredibly cruel and useless. For me, it seems that the director is trying to push this question to the head of the crowd: "What is wrong when compared to the horror of war and elimination?" With a direct war and it was scary (In the first scene, you can here, the girl who is raped, shouted, and at the same time, you hear President Bush's speech about the need to start the war. With Iraq, and in the second scene, pictures of the three criminals carrying a sword in the vagina of a woman will be tracked directly with the archives of World War II But in truth, I can't think of the relative gravity of The expression of the horror of these two types of humans is complete. I was very shocked by what I saw and felt. (Sorry for bad English)
