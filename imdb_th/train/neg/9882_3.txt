There are two good things to say about "fantasy" (both mentioned by previous investigators as well): <br /> <br /> a) The extraordinary beauty of the poems created Bo Derek's inspiration. She has a shot in this film that makes Catherine Zeta-Jones take her money and that's a very high praise. Her nudity is short and discreet. But just looking at her face is enough. <br /> <br /> b) Greek islands with sunlight and blue sea Sometimes it is a joke without intention. ("He touches you where you are a woman!") And Peter Hooten's character is an idiot. Bo expressed the innocence of her character. But when you have to work with bad conversations, it's not fair to blame the actors. (The fact that she still says "Damir" in almost every sentence is a big deal. Oh, and although the film is set on the Greek island, the Greek word is hardly heard - it looks like everyone there, from children to old people, speaking English all the time (*)
