I can watch good blood movies. I've seen some bad things However, this is one of the few movies that I find strange in a nasty and disgusting style. I like blood movies when they enjoy I like when they have a lot of creativity behind them. The blood in this movie didn't make it sick. It's nasty. It's completely unpleasant. For this reason, this movie is definitely not fun. This movie is a horror movie. But without fear There is only one reason why people watching this movie is about blood. But that is the most unattractive and ugly aspect of the movie, and that is very talkative. The performance is terrible. The plot is not reasonable and the music is really annoying. It took me out of the movie. Quite a whole movie is one of the longest tests. There was this guy who had a strange accident in the shuttle and woke up in the hospital to find that his skin had melted and melted out. I guess after that he went out and ate human flesh to slow the melting process. There are some strange subplots that are related to old couples who have been chased by some dogs that are floating in streams and endings associated with men who are electrocuted. There are many times that I try hard to enjoy it. But the only scene in all the movies that I thought was fun was the first scene in which a nurse ran along the hospital's path in slow motion. If you like horrid, horrid, horrible, unsightly commercials, this movie is for you.
