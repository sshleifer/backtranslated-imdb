This movie is quite confusing and ridiculous. The story is terrible ... but on the positive side, the performance is quite good with shouts and loud sounds. This time, Sharon Stone agreed ... less than half as good as your original idea. Murder is not as good as the first picture, which is a shame. It's not a mess that can't be predicted. Everyone says it's Sometimes having sex is quite clear, while others clearly see it as a fake. The script is almost always weak. But the scenes that are joking and arguments between Dr.Glass and Washburn are highlights Twisted storyline a few times But the ending was terrible The tension remains constant with the large doll of 'Oh my God!' The chase sequence has great direction and shock and the camera angle is impressive. Sharon Stone is also old. A bit we saw her breasts in the first place with pleasure. This time they are too scary to describe. The movie itself is quite normal. But it is worth it to go Mostly because this film deserves a good sound ... with the opening sequence being highlighted. Not important But if you like the first one - leave this one Do not break the run You will be glad you didn't open this stone.
