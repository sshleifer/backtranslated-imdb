I usually write reviews for movies that I hate or like very much. And as you can tell from the number of stars there, I don't like By now, I think you have read about the story or may have seen the movie so I will skip the conclusion. So divide the pros and cons: <br /> <br /> Cons: Concept: Assumptions are created to be interesting. Using chaos theory as a theme is an interesting story. However, it didn't do well. Correct me if i'm wrong But it seems to me that chaos theory is a kind of misrepresentation. The events in the movie seem more coincidental than anything. I think the effects of butterflies are represented by both "God causes the tsunami to bring the statue back." The presentation came out really sloppy. Some people call this genius. But it seems to be a famous action movie. <br /> <br /> Story: It's just me or it seems that Kamal will throw this story together so he has an excuse to play the ten roles. Have a lot of planning Wind still lost many bottles in an ambiguous accident. (His friend just mixed the bottle with the package that he sent to India. The crazy old lady just threw the bottle into the idol. Half the actor happened. Met in the same hospital unexpectedly, and the case with the idol just happened to get in touch with the famous singer) <br /> <br /> CGI: Oh God, CGI is worse than the effect Special in Jaws 3 and what sucked in I can tell which part is animated. Even my ten-year-old cousin knows that the underwater car is not like that. <br /> <br /> Gripping: Yes. Now, the action scenes in Tamil movies are unrealistic. But the stunt scenes in this scene are horrible and distract from the story. <br /> <br /> Up: I have to admit that they did better than expected. I think Kamal is playing with people who have the same skin color, so both white people and Japanese aikido who disguise themselves can't catch me. However, it is still not good. I can say that the masked person <br /> <br /> Song: The music distracts and is out of place at various times. <br /> <br /> Asin : Her character may be the most annoying scene in the movie. She is loud, cocky and obsessive about the idol. Actually, I think that she thinks she will die. <br /> <br /> Plot hole and logic refrigerator: Give me Get this: Monkey Lab is smart enough to pass a locked door with a password. But not smart enough to tell The difference between a chocolate bar and a bottle with a deadly virus Then, the former CIA agent who followed the bottle draft went to India. Instead of following him immediately, he married a pole dancer. The famous Punjabi singer with cancer examines the small town hospital in the third world when he can easily get the best medical care. He was also shot in the neck with bullets. You think he should be killed But the magic bullet lost his tumor You read correctly that the bullet was hit by a tumor. <br /> <br /> Advantages ... Character Naidu: Probably the only interesting thing in this movie is his joke.
