If you want to laugh like crazy, rent Cage. Cage is a war hero, two of whom are Billy and Scott, who are best friends. When Billy was shot in Vietnam, he couldn't protect himself, so Scott took him in. <br /> <br /> I had never seen a movie with gay as two main characters. Billy and Scott like to "fight" and Scott tells Billy that he is "Still painful from last night" Above all else <br /> <br /> Great catchy phrases like Pang Pong. Cut the sh! T "will make you laugh for hours. Native Americans who should play as Mexican gang members are the most important thing. As they say it is "At this time, Ba-ba-ba-ba." I can go forever. But just watching this movie and laughing out to $ $$. It's very funny that I go out and buy a DVD for $ 5.99.
