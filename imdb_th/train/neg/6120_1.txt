There are three types of bad movies - cheap, boring and without taste. The only bad movie that is boring and without taste. <br /> <br /> The boring movie is boring. If you don't go out fast enough, you will fall asleep. <br /> <br / > The movie that has no taste is really a fortress But the fact is that they are the ones who help themselves for those who are seriously ill. <br /> <br /> Only the bad movies are cheap. It's really funny because the creators want to make their movies at the end. hope The ability and resources available <br /> <br /> Bo Derek is naturally boring and without taste; Good luck, fate and lack of funds and skills to exchange her by making her look cheap too. This movie is hilarious and it may be a funny and bad movie. The latest story I've seen for the first time at the theater. I laughed so hard that I left my seat and with the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> It was clear that Derek and her husband's supporters felt that the film was part of the words; Unfortunately, Derek lacks the resources needed to pull that out clearly. So the 'satirical' element emerged as the impression of a young woman in the school about the impression of some gay young men about Frank Gorshin's comments on Batman in Batman trying to pretend that Robin - It doesn't fly over our heads. Any human head <br /> <br /> On the other side, there are some serious moments in this movie - it should be an action movie. Remember - that is amazingly wonderful. <br /> <br /> For Derek's infamous tendency to expose her breasts - I can't imagine showing less erotic nudity. She looks strange with Those broad shoulders, I can 'imagine what others have never seen in you. <br /> <br /> For the story - as it is - it's okay. Derek chases all over Africa and God knows that why Then her father - Harris - pretended to be acting in a frenzied puppet drama, and of course there was a big chunk of Otar San that seemed to be suspicious of the ad without knowing that the story had changed - probably because he didn't. I've seen the script - obviously no one has <br /> <br /> Unimportant camera work, low editing - if not 3-way with chimpanzees, this movie will not endure - <br /> < br /> as it is a real hoot
