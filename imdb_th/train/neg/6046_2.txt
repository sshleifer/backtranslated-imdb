In general, this movie is two hours that Dafoe's character drank to death. The only surprise in this movie is that you do not have enough clues or knowledge about the characters to surprise you. It's a scary story and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Willem Dofo is a great actor. Peter Stormare is a great actor. But this movie just sucked Slowly does not make the movie bad, but it is bad. The plot is mixed with ramblings. The art of anamorphic details is not drawn together in a meaningful way for the plot, except to emphasize some of the blood shown from many angles Finally looked at the end I appreciate the artistic vision. But as entertainment, it makes me sleep (Seriously, I fell asleep and had to watch the movie again - which was more frustrating) <br /> <br /> In general, I don't like to express negative opinions or express opinions about others' works. While they suck, but this movie is guaranteed It's terrible that these great actors have been embarrassed by this end result.
