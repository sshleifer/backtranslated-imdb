This horror movie is really weak ... That is if this is the right movie that I comment on. There is nothing really scary as the family chooses to use the cute little German Shepard puppy. I have a German Shepard and it is a really good dog. I didn't get the idea of ​​getting one from this movie, but from the comedy movie "K-9" that was all the other stuff together. This film has nothing to do with horror because the most horrifying scene has ended and it looks really magical. We also saw a man almost taking his hand to the mower. That is about it Father suspects something because his family seems to be somewhat strange. Some of them know that if you hold a mirror with them while they are sleeping, you will see that they are possessed. Overall, the horror movie is really weak, even according to television standards ... TV movies that work there because "This house occupies" quite well and has another haunted house movie about women and these strange creatures that are quite good. This one is really boring.
