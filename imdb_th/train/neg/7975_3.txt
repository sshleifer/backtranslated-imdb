As I sat in front of the TV watching this movie, I thought "Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock or even Brian Del Mama can do! Chances are you will too. It started interesting. The British Ranger Park, who lives in Collin Firth, is married to a beautiful brunette woman (Lisa Zane), whom he met in the park recently. Then one day she disappeared. The police couldn't find any documents that she had found and Firth made his own search. Until now is very good Just as he was about to give up, he turned to a female close friend (Billy Zane) and they stumbled upon her past life in drug use, nightclubs and late filmmaking. That Firth's life is in danger and the film is separated. There are no characters from Lisa Zane's past that are interesting from a distance. The movie is slow and has very little movement. There is a sub-plan about missing drug money. But it was just a flyer No chase, no exciting sequences and no doubt. Just a boring bash and many chats by boring characters. One thing that is worth noting is that Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brothers and sisters. But they never appeared in the scene together At the end of the movie, you lack the suspicion that something might happen and try to be alert
