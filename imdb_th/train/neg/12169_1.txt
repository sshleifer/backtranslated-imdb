This is a disgusting and disgusting garbage that will no doubt have to be Friday the 13th (1980). The poster clone for this movie makes it seem like there is a cross between Jason and Freddie, which should attract people. watch a movie There is nothing good or fun about this movie about this movie. It makes me sad. Just think that some people are stumbling on Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers (1988) in videos or DVDs and wasting time with saddened movies. <br /> <br /> Angela Baker (Pamela Springsteen) is Camp counselors at Camp Rolling Hills, who hope that other campers will be as good as you are and they stay away from problems.

You can forget those plans because you have just finished your life. "<br /> <br / > And the disgusting thing is - and without giving too much - the movie creates a room for the sequels. Why? They may have brought the tank to the water storage tank by creating three or four films. I missed the original Sleepaway Camp (1983) and after watching the sequel of the first episode, I hope to stay away from other sequels. And for parents, if you really know children who like this movie, don't let them date your children
