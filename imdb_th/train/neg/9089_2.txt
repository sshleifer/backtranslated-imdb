The movie has only one flaw. Unfortunately, this flaw has damaged all the credibility of the piece. <br /> <br /> Start by accusing Israel of occupation in the disputed land. Failed to mention the reason that the Israelites were Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attack Israel This is the reason that Israel "possessed" their land because those countries were lost in the war they started. <br /> <br /> The film also claims that Israel has challenged the UN without following the resolution. 242 The problem is that 242 was rejected immediately when it was started by ..... Palestinians became void. <br /> <br /> Many films were brought together and were able to show images that changed the mindBut remember when watching what Do not believe in what you hear and only half of what you see. <br /> <br /> Every participant in this movie is well known for the criticism of Israel and some of them express Public comment antisemitic. <br /> <br /> Every participant wants a real historical lesson taught objectively, not by Palestinian sympathizers.
