Not that I don't like movies for children. But this is a tears shop that has the ability to exchange little things. M.J. Fox is the perfect sound for Stuart and the remaining talent is wasted. Hugh Laurie is an amazing joke. But did not get a chance in this movie It's sugar that is sugar coated and hardly attracts anyone 7 years or older. See Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek instead of 3/10.
