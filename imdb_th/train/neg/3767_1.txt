Good actor budget ... Those who know these things are important. Do not waste time with this garbage. Effect with shit Acting is nonsense The only thing that can make this possible, even though T&A is a little cheap and that is being squandered for the first 20 minutes Is very rude It's like they found only 7 people on a world that never cursed before going out. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a friend in a bad suit, just go back and see the old prom image. The only way to flick Bigfoot into something good is to have a huge budget and some actors who are not from the Frogballs community theater.
