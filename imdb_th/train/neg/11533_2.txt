If things that you are unexpected and adapted from rape for revenge, you will find a rare treatment ... They really don't care about me. It looks like something straightforward from the 1980s, which is a different era when this thing goes straight to the video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Derry work well with weak scripts and boring situations. But Gillian Anderson is doing something related to this film after she showed her the ability to become Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year The director is said to have been influenced by witnesses, rape and his documentary work. But still, it's not an excuse for a strange scene. I don't think I'm the only one in the laughing theater. What I didn't understand was the involvement of the company behind the film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both were involved in the great British independent film in recent years. And Red Road - Straightheads Not worthy of being mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take notes: Is this the best thing you can do? How do British independent filmmakers have to judge your art? It is a very big deal for both your reputation. Listen carefully: Do you hear thousands of British fans cry desperately?
