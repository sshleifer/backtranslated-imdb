Once upon a time, a science fiction writer named H-Beam Piper, the author of the classic book "Little Fuzzy", about a man who discovered a species of fuzzy cute asteroids on the planet. another Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many authors today began to rob his grave before his body was cold. This is a book that they have received ideas from Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Skullduggery is so sloppy like "Little Fuzzy". I wonder why I was the only person who ever noticed. <br /> <br> But don't Use my words Here is a link to Project Guntenberg where you can download a copy of "Little Fuzzy" for free: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
