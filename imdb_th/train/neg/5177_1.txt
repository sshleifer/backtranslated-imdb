It's terrible. Very bad. The show is the biggest joke in history. Don't even watch it. I did it after 20 minutes and it was disappointing in the end. At the beginning ... I didn't really understand the taste of people. I'm a horror fan and I'm not fussy, but I have limits! Maybe it is one of the four stars that is better than the beginning of The Hoast, but that is so. So I suggest you do not waste 15 minutes to watch. I mean, acting is better than by monkeys. And the big brother who has the role of the parents is terrible They don't pay for the characters in the movie C? No, I have to say that it's not the first time I think horror movies are bad. But it is one of my ten movies and it will be a place with vampires like vampires on the lake of The Hoast!
