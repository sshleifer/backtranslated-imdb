I have to watch this thing in school. And to summarize it ... <br /> <br /> A talented actor, an incompetent script and a talented director. <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste of your time. Don't even watch movies. Don't bother. You will be very disappointed. My teacher said it should be good. She was wrong. She sleeps a little This movie actor is terrible. The best actor in there is an old man and that doesn't say much. It has a horrible plot with scary characters. So unrealistic and I can honestly say that there is no point. The script is not sensitive and confusing. There are various points in the movie when I frown and say "What?" There are also loose relationships and too many plot holes. It was really scary.
