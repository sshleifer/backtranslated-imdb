When I hate reading long articles that hope to get issues and disappointments, I will tell everyone that this movie is terrible, very serious and not surprising for the reasons mentioned in the first review I think I might agree with him because he gave the rating to this movie. But was reprimanded when reading what he said sadly I am quite ashamed to get the same side as people who comment on this film. "Lack of women that look absolutely good" Let me be the first to say "Wow! That is an in-depth examination that is absolutely serious. My heart is hardly able to understand the philosophical music about this movie. "Seriously. "Women who look good" should not be considered necessary for movies. If you are desperate for "Good looking women" You should watch other types of movies without having to fall into the sci-fi category.
