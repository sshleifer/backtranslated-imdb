Men wake up from nightmares about bats. He and his wife go out to the desert to picnic on a honeymoon. He seems to hear strange sounds and she is disturbed by the eyes of bats crawling across their picnic blankets. He wants to go to the cave, which has something about some work he is doing. But she wants to enjoy her honeymoon, relax, they go on a tour But leaving the group to do She fell down the ramp where she was bothered by the insects. He followed her. He heard strange noises again and seemed to know that the bat was approaching. Do one and get in her hair He fought it from her and attacked him, biting his forehead. <br /> <br /> They left the cave. But when they were in the gondola at the ski resort, he began to have seizures that he had Hallucinations or bat images attacking people He is angry when this happens. He couldn't drink alcohol without spewing out. His wife was worried about rabies and he started treatment with Pasteur. But reacting violently to the injection <br /> <br /> Some people were killed. We see some of the changes of humans as bats. It seems that it's not just in his heart. Biting a bat causes these changes to be unclear or not, because he has some symptoms before being bitten. <br /> <br /> While the name seems inappropriate, the meaning at the end is another person. Very good movie But I like the variety of deserts, caves and skiing places, steep slopes, and some strange scenes. I don't think it is as bad as others, and I don't think the 1999 bat movie is as bad as others think. (I give one score on 5/10)
