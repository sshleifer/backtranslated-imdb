The voice dubbing / translation in this film is a hilarious and entertaining comedy only in this movie. I didn't laugh hard in my life because I just watched Zombi 3 (and I've seen terrible dubbing in my life. Believe me). Seriously, the filmmaker can edit this film again and release it as a movie. Funny and making millions of dollars It's funny. <br /> <br /> But ... If your sofa is falling, laughing at the sound of the zombie movie, Fulci is not your cup of tea, so avoid all this costs.
