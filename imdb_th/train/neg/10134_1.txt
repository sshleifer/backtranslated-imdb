Steven Seagull's film never had the content of Oscar. But once each release, they will become worse. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the FBI picking Seagal up because he killed people. The soldiers that were stationed were saved from prison to help steal stolen aircraft, which will be used by the evil British villains that Hollywood is obsessed with, including today. <br /> <br / > Conversations that are almost always delivered with heavy cheese and lack of acting ability The story is not interesting and there are parts of it that are absolutely meaningless and do not add anything to the story of all movie characters, such as the 'lesbian' interaction between the two main women in the show. For gathering to receive audiences, but still did not cause confusion because it was not reasonable why it happened when it didn't need to be used. <br /> <br /> Short in a very bad chapter. Delivered by sub-actors, boring scenes, and poorly designed action scenes and some unrelated scenes that serve to achieve the closest goal and make the movie worse. <br /> <br / > Save 98 minutes from your life and give this to you even if you are a big fan of Seagal.
