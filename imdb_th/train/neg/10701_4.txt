Mergen Mad Cap in London is a treasure hunt, with a young woman intending to create her father, a married politician with a strong and independent young woman who has never had love. The first car that is interesting for Katharine Hepburn plays the Aviit-Armrix, an Amelia Earhart that is more relevant to himself than to give himself. For any man, the director (Dorothy Arzner) and the screenwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted Gilbert Frankau's book) were clearly assigned to this project in order to get a female perspective. But why are all old clich√©s still like frozen artifacts? Billy Burke shows the type of angry wife who sneaks to her bed when something goes wrong and the last scene of Hepburn is another sluggish person. Strange inventions but not classic for Kate watchers ** from ****
