This lifelong movie style leads the middle-aged divorce victim who later comes back to fight with a ridiculous new genre like cartoon cartoons. <br /> <br /> Here, 40 things are at home, the ex-wife of the protagonist, the lawyer who suffered. success (The daughter is at college) is starting a new life after her divorce, which has been helped by a female friend in college to open a new clothing store as an agreement to expand the franchise business. She started a friendship with her charm, maybe a little younger, landscape architect / gardener (black person), but then the horror of a terrifying middle-aged woman 20 things that a woman took her to be a tenant for the room. The rest began to "occupy" her life. <br /> <br /> Things that threaten a new woman Flirting with the gardener gently and giving him a glass of wine * * * * * * * * * * * Poor * in the fridge and hang her art piece (Africa) in the living room !! And others. You may kill cats as well. Yes, okay. The extent to which these things do not work well enough. But it is a little more than a nonsense, especially when it becomes a campaign. The truth of the characters is that a small part of this story will push this crazy woman. (So ​​why are you renting a room - and horror horror Is a younger woman? <br /> <br /> Think that this younger woman has arrogance, control and 40 things that our brave men must learn to fight this evil. But have this problem Every time there is something 20 begins to have problems, she uses her power - and just flirts with sex with some men and escapes the consequences. (In fact, there are some things for being able to see good 20 somethings. It can't be * in general * used in this way quite a lot) <br /> <br /> The place has been moved with the equipment of 20 Things about divorce in making an official rental agreement with a written lease made by her Of course, what 40 does not know about these things and what 20 has been helped. The lease gives the right to the young woman equal to the whole house during the rental period, with utilities being thrown into a fixed price. Even if the prosecution was dismissed soon, 20 things that were temporarily banned from the old woman soon were predicted because she was threatened with 20 things. Did you know that the judges sympathized with every woe-me? - of sweet sexy girl things In the end, the "heroic" battle of 40 things for returning home started. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is true or deceiving in this movie is the horrific simple way of TRO (or the order of Protection) for women to receive nothing more than her unsure words Just this with men Sometimes they are not fair and are motivated to take control of the house like here. In fact, fans who have moved in with their fans can take them out of their own homes or condos without any proof, but only claiming threatening and sometimes not even hearing on his side. Even though the investigation is not possible to argue against the threat (To prove that it is negative) regularly when the burden of proof is more effective on the accused than the accused (This is just one of the laws of America, which is true - and it is a sign of feminist dissatisfaction and the failure of a group established for anti-steamboats). Any movie in this life <br /> <br /> The ridiculous basic proof of this film depends on the explanation that the 20 things are psychotic and not Her drug Even though it is not reasonable. She is not a successful ex-husband, although she helps him. (With the anger of the old wife) in her search She is the caretaker of the house. (Technically, then drove out of the house during the rental period) This second woman is the man who left on the divorce after doing a story with 20 other people who have to stop her husband !! (The old husband does not seem to be bound and persuaded after the rush - not important. He is still lost !!!) <br /> <br /> The protagonist is good enough to look for her age. But her perspective, attitude and focus are small, full of emotions, bad emotions, and fully without imagination or life force that is impossible to pay attention to her. I think the core group of fans throughout life is interested in the average score that a small number of evaluators give. (I watched it just because it's terrible and it's a cartoon that has attracted from the camp. I can't resist how far they can take it.) <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** (If this is possible with this flick) <br /> <br /> Okay, this is a clue. The movie ends with 20 things bailed out of prison, promising to "listen" to her. 20 people are colleagues and sometimes are lovers and "Do everything he says" and "let him take care of her" (he means letting her take medicine anyway) - then fool him and go back home There, she climbed the ladder with a knife, stalking her demon nemesis. 40 There was something that was showered with a candle light in the idea that the girl was not in her life. Mother wins - by attaching 20 things with a syringe filled with anti-psychotic drugs she finds. Then she began to stroked her mother and two women with a bond of solidarity! What a cute.
