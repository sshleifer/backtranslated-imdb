The original story about Che. It doesn't care about the really interesting facts of the true character of Che Sodeberg. Changed Che's original narrative storyline, the arrogant and arrogant story of an arrogant Argentine millionaire until he became a Robin. Hood fought side by side until he was finally killed by the CIA. Yes, heard everything before, boring and unreal! The reality of Che Guevara is very different and can explode more! The facts show that he is a dictator who has openly worshiped the Messiah who want to reveal the dictatorship of Maoism in the world. He was crazy about the hottest times of the Cold War. He also asked the Soviet Union to go to New York, Washington or Los Angeles to bring the end of the world. CHe urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear weapon attack. US city For the rest of his life, he announced that if his finger was on the button, he would push it. When Khrushchev retreated and rescued the world literally, he felt angry that "betrayed". If following Che's advice, you would not read this review. The murder craze has become a pop icon. How to make a movie more interesting? Incredible that no filmmaker is brave enough to show the true side of Che and the media changes that have killed him. That will make the movie that won the Oscar! I think creating independent movies means taking real risks and being a fanatic! They only adhere to the "safe anti-culture model" for "cool" intelligence, "Wall Street bad", "Republican = Nazi", "Bush ex Hitler", "NRA is worse than KGB", "Christian is People who are crazy and stupid "etc. ... nauseous. Oooh, brave, mechanic. Tres against the mainstream and frustrated. I hope they will have real cojones and fight with Independent Film Oligarchy! That will be truly brave!
