This is the worst movie I've seen for many years! It started to laugh and continued in the same way. I don't know what will happen in this movie ,,,, and the performance is worse. The ending raised it a bit and recorded all the flop movies. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. I'm sorry, Tim Burton, Batman. But this one is terrible
