With the use of a mobile camera shake, presumably to make movies look documentary But the result was so exaggerated that I began to get drunk from watching movies. It seems that people with cerebral palsy hold the camera. (There is no fault with the CP victims, but I don't think you are expecting to be a movie producer!) The camera's work is annoying and distracting. My wife and I thought it couldn't be watched and surrendered after suffering 10 minutes. I came back to check again later. (It appeared on TV) and it didn't get better anymore. I recommend to miss this, if you do not need to get rid of bad sushi that you may eat!
