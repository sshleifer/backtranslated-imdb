As a man who saw the incredible picture of "The Hero", I wanted to see the movie that was billed in the same direction, but better than it was the highlight of my favorite actor: Ziyi Zhang. I bought a DVD from this film that was not seen as a mistake. It is not better. <br /> <br /> I know that these martial arts movies are flying through the air. These are pure fantasy. But this story has been extended to everything that has come to be believed in the distance. Blind women beat hundreds of opponents. Sorry, it's going far In addition, the important male character 'Jin' (Takeshi Kanashiro) is very annoying with his silly dialogue on his face and laughs as though he has destroyed the film as well. <br /> < br /> This amazing action scene for me - just doesn't have the appeal to make it a worthy movie to own. This movie isn't my "hero"!
