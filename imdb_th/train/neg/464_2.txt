This movie is not in the sense of humor. It tries to create humor with the silly and dull humor that the film has suffered for 2 hours. Throughout the movie, I was thinking of one that "When will it end?" One thing that you have to give to them is that they have a mildly funny moment, which is why I gave the two stars. Almost every old book in this book, even the first non-funny story It is a movie that makes a beloved blonde and a funny story of a blonde girl. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this movie is a terrible blonde humor. not good
