This movie has one nude scene: a man sitting on the edge of the bed with a penis that touches, dabbing in the middle of the screen is a rather long scene What is the point? I almost thought it was a joke. But we watched it with my mother and it was not funny to stare at us for what seemed like a full minute. <br /> <br /> The movie is cool. Of course, Audrey Tatou is cute, but her character is an unhappy girl. <br /> <br /> I don't want to recommend this movie. I expect it to be charming and refreshing. But it was depressing I wonder if the director came from a very high crust, was educated in the French family and he insulted these characters. <br /> <br />
