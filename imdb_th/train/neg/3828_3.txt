Still, instead of keeping the project and helping us not have to watch it, they go ahead and continue to do it. Obviously wanting an interesting post for the audience to watch the movie, they decided to make it violently and blatantly blatantly. Hey, it works with The Wild Bunch. Why shouldn't it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch has great script benefits. But the script of The Last Hard Men is plain old garbage. <br /> <br /> It's hard to understand how Charlton Heston and James Coburn attract them.
