I don't want to believe the positive comments of this movie - I think it's one of the worst movies, the worst. And the story is completely ridiculous (sp?). Did she start with him while he was tied to the chair? puh rent. The worst part is that it's not bad in a good and laughing way. Just terrible - I don't know why they care to show it on HBO. I think Belushi is stupidly ridiculous - no. I believe it's an "unorthodox" killer. I can go - again. I'm shocked by the positive comments. The only thing that keeps me watching is that it's interesting to see how movies can make mistakes and what makes them worse. And the ending did not disappoint in foolishness as well! "Live with a sword dead with a sword ..." Nonsense
