The main problem of "Power" is that it has features as well, which may be pointless characters and subplots that do not add anything to the movie. It's boring after a while, waiting to watch the scenes that are not connected to find things that propel the movie forward. You may pass it all because of character development. But all that was reused from the previous scene in the movie or just flat and not interesting. Lumet never gave enough time to let the handsome flowers. He should cut the character. (Hacking a wife) for a few and concentrating on others (Billings). It may be a great political thriller, rather than a messy story that has broken into the sea of ​​writing and acting. The bad truth that surprised me when considering the actors Even the acting of Gene Hackman did not work. Denzel Washington is the only real actor of the note. Here, Gere and others have a lot better performances. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet must go back to a man showing him. Made in the seventies (such as Serpico) and stopped trying to bring success back with "12 Angry Men" and "Fail Safe". It has not worked at Sidney and is likely to not happen Leave all the plays at Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> * / * * * *
