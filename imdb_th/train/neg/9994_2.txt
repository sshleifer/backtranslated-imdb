Well, the sports team is falling on the plane, stuck on a snowy mountain, and faced with a difficult decision to eat the meat of a dead companion for survival. Sounds familiar, right? I refer to "Alive" from 1993, of course. The only major difference here is that the big scare crow, the white drunk of the Yeti, appears a few times to drag the dead. I guess humans taste better than yaks. <br /> <br /> Stupid: Men in the first scene do not have reliable firearms when hunting Yeti and he doesn't reserve. <br /> <br /> The plane crashed. Go completely It may explode in both the air blast when it hits the ground or disappears. People will not survive. But hey, it's sci-fi. <br /> <br /> Stupid: They survived and they were cold. It may be a good idea to control some of the nearby debris in order not to freeze until death. The fire is warm as before ... <br /> <br /> WTF: The pilot formed on his face while he was still alive and talking. But strangely enough, nobody can do it. <br /> <br /> Stupid: One of them tells others to look for matches and lighters. But there are planes scattered around them. <br /> <br /> Stupid: They find coats and hoodies and still in the evening of the Himalayas. They fail to use hats! <br /> <br /> Stupid: They stared at the wooden pile when I reiterated that there were already parts of the plane burning. <br /> <br /> Stupid: The Himalayas are famous for storms. It is a normal feeling for them to collect debris to strengthen their structure instead of sitting outside the brawl. There are many pine trees around it. Its branches create great insulation. <br /> <br /> WTF: When in doubt, use the arms of the dead as casts. <br /> <br /> WTF: If a man Know a lot about the hibernation habits of squirrels, bears and leopards in the Himalayas. Why is he not known enough to build a shelter and trap at first? <br /> <br /> Stupid: When trying to trap wild animals, the unconscious speech in the vicinity of the trap will always help. <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how hard it is to cut? Ice The corpse with glass fragments! <br /> <br /> WTF: The group is ready and armed to fight against Yeti while the other two are standing there to protect. Yeti tore the heart of the man and stomped the head of the girl and the gang did nothing. Love <br /> <br /> So two Yetis and an avalanche that are convenient to bury evidence forever .... Or so we think Mwuhahahaa! The story continues with more stupidity. But most actions occur in the last 15 minutes as usual There is a good idea with spears and chains, although this is intelligence. (With a chain that appears astonishing) that they lack at the beginning of the movie when they can't even fire, even if they are around them. Br /> <br /> As usual for Sci -Fi Origin Love couples kiss each other at the end like nothing scary happens to them. (Not to mention they eat human flesh and do not brush their teeth for many days). <br /> <br /> The end is quote lame.
