I joined this website to see how people would comment on the real disaster of this movie. I didn't draw even one second. All characters are one dimension. They throw every topic that they think will have something to stick to. I'll bet (and hopefully) everyone involved in the teacher looks back in shame. There are great actors here. But you probably don't know Thank God for not destroying the career of Morgan Freeman or Judd Hirsh or Nick Nolte or Laura Dern. There is no vision, no labor of love here, just a horrible effort.
