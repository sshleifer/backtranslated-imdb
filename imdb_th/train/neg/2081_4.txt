This film has been screened repeatedly in the cable recently. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for these two charming women to fight Luke Wilson or the villain. This movie The actress is very cute and that is the only reason for watching this movie. I think it is 'funny' that Luke, even the most ugly friend / dorkier / stupid person, is close, but that's what we get. <br /> <br /> Whether it's a woman. Any Men in this movie for more than 5 minutes. What we get is that they cry, sob and fight, and more than 2 others that are best described on Friday the 13th. 4. Dead * @ $ #
