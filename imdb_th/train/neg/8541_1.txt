Welcome to the 17 movies in the 50 cold, classic classics that we will see right. Another movie that doesn't make sense. Seriously, this film made me confused at the end. I thought I was watching. "In the morning, they slept." The plot seems easy enough .... Well, that's until 3 seconds in the movie that a woman should kill a cat ... Uh ... bomb? I do not know what happened And that is before the topic screen It's really sad when I can't tell what happened in the first 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, it's a photographer with a big mustache that meets this woman after leaving another girlfriend. To take his photo Of something So we got there. But before someone steals their jeep to drive it 200 feet away to a suspicious city? so they decided to stay at this deserted village with an old woman Then, what blah blah happened and blah blah talked the guy with a mustache out in the fog for some reason, even though the old woman would tell him that he shouldn't do it. He lost his way back to him. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention this thing after 20 minutes of their incredibly pointless in the house of a man who seems like a man. Buggy eyes from Casablanca. Then they went out. This scene has no issues at all. It's just an internal space. If you cut it off, no one will notice or care. <br /> <br /> But sadly, that's the best part of the movie. Wait. Let me repeat this phrase. Really sad that it is the best part of the movie. Because the rest was so confused that I had to look at IMDb to find out what happened But of course, nobody knows. So I SOL <br /> <br /> Seriously, the last 30 minutes of the movie is the most incredible moment I've seen in a movie. They dress her up in the costume. He is kidnapped and let him run back to the house. At the end, the witch is in the house and it ends? Seriously. I almost never confuse the movie at all. I mean, it's not as good as movies like "War of the Robots". At least they get feelings. This film does not make that attitude consistent. The ending is confusing at the end. "Early morning sleep" and the storyline is much more boring. This film received 1 for evasion. "I don't know what happened in this movie," Witches mountain "makes the movie viewer confused 1 person from 10 people.
