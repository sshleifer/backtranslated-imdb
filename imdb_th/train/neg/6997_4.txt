I watched this with an increasing discomfort. Why did God in the form of Ian Hunter help these people to try to escape from Devils Island? And what did he do there from the first place? I mean, I know that God works in a mysterious way. But the rescue of robbers and murderers and prostitutes found that the redemption of forgiveness and the change of mind in this cursed place .... In any case, the thing that has been enthralled has been lost in the image of the sinner This Crawford's character is as loved as she had been with me, and the whole image of the movie made it look like it had been created 10 years ago. Continuing movies such as "Stagecoach" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" are prehistoric images.
