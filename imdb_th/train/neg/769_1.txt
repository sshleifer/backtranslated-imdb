The major mistake in this film is that it is impossible to believe that these people will be selected in the professional production of Scotland. Hearing the soft voice of David Lansbury tried hard with the famous "Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow" speech, making it impossible to believe that anyone I still believe that he is not involved because he is Lousy actor Not because the bigger name exists Then when we saw some of the dramas in rehearsals, it was hard to believe that the director had not mocked things with unreasonable hopelessness. Sometimes the director was worried about making their films he (And writers think that they have the ability to direct their own work) that they settle less This seems to be an example.
