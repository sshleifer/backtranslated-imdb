Wow ... <br /> <br /> I picked it up at Wal-Mart in the area after reading online that it was launched soon. I followed this online for a while and just had to buy movies. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> I guess the thing that struck me was the correction or lack of it. Storytelling (Usually the speaker and anyone he is with) will show walking ... and walk ... and walk. I'm not an editor. But I know that you can cut between someone who has left A to show them at point B. There's no need to show almost the whole trip! Wow ... <br /> <br /> Actually, I feel sorry for the actors involved in this story. It seems that they will not get directions to do anything in the scene other than watching fear or being happy depending on the action that will be added later. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why is the decision to make almost all effects that use CG beyond me? Even ILM still uses miniatures sometimes. One of the most distracting green screens in this film is the ongoing rush of people who represent citizens in cities and towns, including London. Sometimes these villagers come in. And go out regardless of the angle of the shot or the distance from the camera In one match in London, there seemed to be at least two men, six feet tall, walking behind the narrator's brother. (Performed by Anthony Piana, actor without distracting mustache) Not since GETTYSBURG, I saw this fake facial hair. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br / > Why Timothy Hines talks about this movie the way he is It's a simple and simple turkey on the positive side (at least for me). It gives a bit of the laughter that is the most loud of the hilarity I've seen for a while.
