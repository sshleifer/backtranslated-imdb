I see many people like this movie. For me, this is a movie made from writing 101 and that person failed in class from the time Lindsey Price, who made the video up to the end of the movie, can be very predictable. I keep watching. Where are you going? <br /> <br /> First of all, we have a widowed father, Clich√© # 1. Movies / TV. Always kill your father and mother. So much so that a single father will be a whirlwind with a dead wife and seems to take care of the children completely. Starting from my 3 Sons to 2 1/2 Dads, these movies are usually drama and comedy as TV programs. <br /> <br /> Think Bora # 2 on women who have had a video camera in hand, she will play a big part in the film. And there will always be an answer, even if the person is an airline <br /> <br /> Ancient thoughts # 3 If people in danger are foreigners, they must come from Latin And they must be illegal It is clear that there are no laws of Latin and Europeans that are illegal, except that there are relevant IRA elements. <br /> <br /> Latin thoughts # 4 say that there must be higher education in the home country of he In this case, he is a Profesor who earns 200 per month and a highly educated Latino must act like he doesn't think of anything in his head and let the head kick into the air. <br /> <br / > Ancient # 5. The fault that people create is not a crime but an accident. But since in this case he loses all the feelings he has when he crosses his boarding school, now he acts like a crazy idiot and now makes his daughter in danger by taking her to a mission without borders. Kick <br /> <br /> Ancient thoughts # 6 No one runs across the hoodlum that runs away from crime. This is because the parents of the children have to play a large part of the movie and because people who accidentally kill children can interact with ridiculous parents. <br /> <br /> Ancient thinking # 7 My name is one movie in the police One person is not an angry veterinarian and they are paired with a newbie. Although they are murder investigators who must be the most experienced police officers in the Sev7n police force and copy the cat and the law and order come to mind immediately. And the vet, although the tumultuous outside will have a golden heart. <br /> <br /> Ancient thoughts # 8 Try to look around the unemployed soap stars. Now I like Lindsey Price. And when she was in One Life To Live as Marty, he swinged from right to left every time she opened her mouth It's used to make me sick sea. She may be able to park on land better now. But she still can't do anything. <br /> <br /> This movie may look smarter if it's not full of old ideas. I do not think that movies must be expensive or brains will be good. But this is terrible. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler **** Now I won't make the ending. Oh, I will because I feel that it will be a disaster for humanity to let people waste time. They will not go back to watch this movie. It's related to the old idea # 6 and # 7, unless people have never seen a movie before. You have to see what will happen. Father made a stupid mistake from the police at the end and was shot by a furious veteran. You think she thinks that the poor person is innocent throughout the story and she accidentally shoots him. When you can't Now for the little girl that Father brought with Guess what happened to her? She is with the family that her father was killed !! Come! You all know what will happen because she is a replacement child !! That is the reason she doesn't go to live with the character Lindey Price. <br /> <br /> This film is underestimated as I'm worried. Because there are many ways that this movie can explore and go down But it chose to ride an ancient 2 star that was for 2 stars. The little girl I thought was very good and Lindsey Price, an annoying character But she did what she could My advice is to take a second and squeeze your head instead of looking at the wreck of this ship.
