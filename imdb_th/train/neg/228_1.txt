I think it's a movie set in New York: Wrong! It's an English country atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I think it's funny: Wrong! It's a drama .... uh, up to the third rank because after this story became "abracadabrantesque" totally a symbolic word for the mandate of the French president It means close to nonsense, even if motivation wants to bring a sincere feeling. <br /> <br /> What am I throwing away? May be a good actor: Yes, I know that they are 3 friends, but the red-haired police can't see me. The surprise of the high doctor with her punch and McDowell gives a good performance as usual. Everything is delicate, soft and almost dumb. This tenderness makes me confused because, as another artist or director, the same style is repeated. In her case, whatever the movie is, it is the same character defined by her sense of values. I still don't know how to set the limit (or fusion) between artists and works. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of this movie is the touch of women and the different perspectives that are interesting Each woman has their own way of life, even if they are single. It brings a lot of patience and learning to testify that the same and unique truth can be realized in many ways. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film can be viewed. Next vision
