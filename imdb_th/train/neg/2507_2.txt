This is not a good movie. It's separate, not all performances are good, and there are thousands of lame stories you've seen. Not to mention, you can see every plot point that comes from one mile away. The worst is that no one cares to tell Lonette Mckee that she can't sing. But anyone interested in her looks very good But I'm talking about nothing, nothing new here. The hot girl group has benefited from some people addicted to drugs. Some people are addicted to drugs. Some people go to hell. The horrible things happen. Surprise surprise Welcome to the music business. I can't believe how many people think this is a good movie. Many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when talking about giving black leather grades. I don't play! If you want to support these movies by watching them - great! If you enjoy it - superb! To each one of his own But don't try to tell me that it's good. Pleeeease! I hope that people of color will not repent in this type of movie just because they have black actors. Want to see good African-American movies? Seeing love Jones, radiation or purple, those movies will be great movies, no matter what the color of the actors will be. Why? Because they tell interesting stories with great performances that make you feel something long after you leave the cinema Just because our experience doesn't automatically make a good movie It's only good - when it's good
