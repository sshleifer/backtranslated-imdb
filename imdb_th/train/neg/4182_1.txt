This film is not as scary as sci-fi channel movies. Most of me are familiar with seeing CGI, gray blobs and special techniques such as fake blood transfusions which make it clear that blood is syrup, strawberry or other syrup However, I think I have seen all the lowest points that Sci-Fi channels can attack. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine one hand in rubber socks coated with syrup? This is the main alien vampire in this movie. You can see the finger inside the rubber puppet clearly. Hands speak from the courage of the victims and the vampires in the team of the vampire hunters can talk to the rubber puppet. How did the Transylvanian Alien Vampires learn the Transylvanian and Transylvania in Romania? So they should not speak Romanian language? Why do some small towns have their own language? If you can suppress the reflection, gag, and through the rubber socks, speak with a finger that moves clearly in the head of an alien. So then you have to deal with other alien vampires. There are "Leatherfaces" that like to wear victims' faces. Then there are many ugly people who seem to have a lot of scars on the face. Then there are the annoying Valley Girls and their girlfriends who are traitors and sneak into the space colonies so they can. Sabotage the defense system so that these space vampires can attack. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you think The above is funny and worth the laughs. You have to deal with the third-class actors of the Network TV. Denying that it is a team of these crazy crazy killers who are fighting all the time. Why do almost all Sci-Fi Channel movies have to use annoying lead characters that are rude or irrational? I found myself hoping that the rubber socks that I spoke would win.
