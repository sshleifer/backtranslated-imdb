I saw this movie at a real cinema (probably $ 2.00) with my cousin and uncle. We are about 11 and 12 years old. I guess and it's a really scary movie. I remember being very excited to see because of my super uncle. Let us choose a movie. (And we may never have done that again!) And very disappointed later !! Boring and not scary The only thing I remembered was the Corky Pigeon from Silver Spoons. And that's not all that wonderful. There are only people I know. I've seen bad movies before and this story is always stuck in my mind as the worst. This is what I remember, one of the most boring and disgusting groups, losing $ 6 and waste from movies. I read some reviews that said it was worth watching and I said "Each one of his own" but I didn't bother at all. Not bad.
