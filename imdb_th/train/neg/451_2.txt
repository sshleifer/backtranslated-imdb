I don't care how many junk will be nominated in order to get the best and that is this movie. I do not know whether to shut down the device or file a lawsuit against O.J. Attorney for wrongful damage to my mental health. I didn't get bored like this before. To call for entertainment, this is a slap in the face of every movie around the world. The whole story is stupid. The show doesn't get the attention. 'Drama' is emotionless. I am grateful. I don't have to pay for the ineffective experience.
