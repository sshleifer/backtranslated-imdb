For my life I can't understand the good comments about this shit. It's useless. Matthew Modine is a cunning man as a female leader. Gina Gershon, uh, others say But why do I repeat that stupid accent? Totally unnecessary And her performance was terrible I don't know if she was accented or what There is no chemistry between these two. <br /> <br /> And she likes Modine. Suddenly, she bows half a turnip in her mouth and stupid. Where do you come from? I think we should feel sorry for her when we see her marriage and workaholic begin to collapse. But frankly, I can't care about these people.
