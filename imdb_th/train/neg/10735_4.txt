Perhaps being a former Moscow Soviet and having a flexible sense of humor prevented me from throwing the film into the 'Art Gallery / Shit Festival' trash. It's not the biggest movie of the year 2005 or about incomplete There are many problems. I also sincerely doubt that this movie was banned due to 'Ideological fear' or 'conservative prohibition' or for any other reason, the film may be called 'brave' and 'uncompromising' abroad. It is banned because the sensor knows that 99% of Russian movie viewers will find that it is disgusting because of the bad tastes during the filming and editing of this boring movie. <br /> <br /> So we have open channels that match. The wiry photography, sound design, excellent location, excellent - full of meaning and symbolism. The use and placement of symbols will be the strongest characteristics of the film continuously. (Not the number 4 is a visual challenge) In the next 40 minutes, we have equally strong settings, amusing and popular bar conversations among the three characters (main?) And we feel Pathetic things for these people, the great country of Russia, the human condition and everything. Then the movie started to slow down. We began to wonder - the dawn - in the future. <br /> <br /> The rest is quite boring. Of course, people in the village tout their hearts and have a little fun time. Definitely good sound But the enjoyment of this film, not to mention the plot, was compromised by walking problems. And this, the lack of payment for sitting through extreme misery and frigidity is something that ultimately will make people angry at things that are 'aggressive' (personally, the offensive scene surrounded by love A pathetic, harmless way can appear. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a fun movie that the Russians have lost for a long time (The whole movie) See the list of National Hunt. The post-Soviet stuff is worth more. So yes. 4 out of 10 per 4 is good and is a symbol of the condition behind my movie.
