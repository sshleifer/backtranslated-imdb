Spoiler? There may be little details but nothing related to planning. Unlike what is important to this film, <br /> <br /> The rage of the air is torn from the infiltration of the central air of the executive decision. Ice-T leads the "elite" commando team. The person who wears a black shirt, a bag that we can only imagine, must conceal the invisible armor as a stupid tactic. (Similar to the 3rd graders when playing Star Wars on the playground) Gunshot <br /> <br /> The thing that impressed me the most is using a similar actor. You will remember Cyril. O'Reily can be immediately as someone who has ever acted in a movie that you really like, although it has been a long time since you may not be able to put it (it's Porky's). Here, Cyril plays Bill's great character. The most hilarious Paxton is Gil Gerard stewed pork. That is so fat that you don't know him as Buck Rogers of the TV. Instead of showing his gentle character in the past, Gerard gives the past performance of a stubborn fat man character that reminds John Goodman of the eventual Alex. Cord gives the same hybrid performance as Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas in 10 years since New Jack City. Ice-T's performances have deteriorated remarkably. It doesn't do as much as the regurgitation that he may remember. <br /> <br /> One of the items played in this movie is a CD of secret information. It was raised to the hand and it was not clearly and unambiguously encrypted. Although Gerard's NSA aura is a security expert As a joke I highly doubt that the information claimed on the CD will be included in the portable format. <br /> <br /> Even in a closed plane without a sound collector But the gun sound is as loud as the canned air and makes people uncontrollable. The selected weapon is quite funny. The use of flight attendants' coffee pots is a story that shows violence in movies. When she uses the Mini-Uzi pistol, which must be one of the worst pistol designs ever, that's just a stupid thing. A true elite team will carry MP-5s for this type of thing or maybe SOCOMM. .45s or customize Hi-Powers if they are really old school or maybe FN 5.7 The user's experience as a soldier, fortune ingredients such nonsense gun Mini-Uzi and Tec-9 is not shameful. A functional extension cylinder that is not a sound collector. <br /> <br /> There is only one realism that I want to fix. Another investigator: the flight attendant and Ice-T have reduced the craft to 10,000 feet for " Air that is breathable "before they open the door And I felt that the flight attendants were not able to close the door where she just gave up at that point As far as landing, there is no mention of the female genitalia until about 2 seconds before the sighing. <br /> <br /> There is only a dangerous duke that will lead Roscoe P. Coltrane to "pass" that can only cause This film is infamous for using stock videos. Obviously they chose the SR-71 (and retired) unbelievably because they couldn't get the F-117 apart from the fact that they were mothballed in 2001. We forgot for a while. The SR-71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of B-2 and in the empty range ... Okay, I don't have a specialist. But I wonder if it will not be seen in Radar. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, referring to "F-15s" when they show F-16s is that funny The details of the 747 are quite stupid. The airline will not allow that few passengers to start with 747. Not to mention everything that is stupid. Pay attention to the use of electric wires that touch. <br /> <br /> Wow, what is the show? Catch it on the star or something. Do not pay for rent. But do to see laugh In the fight against the worst movies ever, there was No Holds Barred, which at least had some originality.
