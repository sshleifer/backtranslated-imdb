This film was founded at Sponge Cake as soon as you put the actual evidence. The perfection gradually sinks into a large garbage dump, like Bart Sibrel, claiming that they must have many light sources because the shadows seem to cross. If there are two or more shadows for each object when Apollo 11 walks through the Allan van's radiation belt, they take 30 minutes. There is no 90 minutes claiming in the documentary and they receive radiation equivalent to Objects x ray <br /> <br /> Seriously research, learn what really happens. Do not let this document pose your opinion on what actually happened.
