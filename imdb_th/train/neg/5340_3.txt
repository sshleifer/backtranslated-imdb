*** Spoiler Alert *** <br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth. I really do it and he does the best with an unbelievable role. I can see that this is a movie that may look good as a script. But it's the most complicated, unbelievable and stupid I saw a fake death that was about to come a mile. Rene Z. tried hard with the insurance pieces and Patricia Arquette as well. (Which is not Chris Penn) is a great actor See if you're not smart enough to distinguish between movies that are so smart that you can't follow and confuse that you don't understand. See if you like magic camera work that makes you seasick. Look, if you like it, Tim Roth works with an unwieldy script. See if it comes late at night for free. Otherwise, renting a normal suspect
