Oh really, I've seen movies that I don't like more because of whatever reason. But I never saw a movie that failed to make movies on all sides. It failed to make a movie in the way that Hercules in New York could say. It's not my least favorite movie. But it's the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The performance is the first thing that makes you impressed. I never saw a movie that made matters worse than pornography. In fact, I have many pornographic movies that act as better websites. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's terrible. The camera does not work well. Correction is nonsense I think they can't buy the right audio equipment and that means that every scene in the car (And there is a lot) let them drive at a speed of about three miles per hour, and every scene that is outside with the same wood plate (and there are also many) is actually called from the studio to lend again <br /> <br /> Plot nonsense as many people point out. I will protect the vampires who walk in the daytime with the fact that although it was popular with Nosferatu, it was never a true part of the vampire mythos. <br /> <br /> Speaking Of the mythos, vampires, or at least see vampire lovers I'm not sure how I felt about this story, swayed by the impression that the film was bad. At least there was some inspiration for the Gothic novel that I liked very much; Or annoying from the best reference of the biggest hammer At least 'the General' is an insult to Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> It received two stars. But just because I can't take myself to vote one star for a movie that has or at least Claiming that there are both vampires and zombies in it. Incidentally, I watched Lifeforce (another movie with vampires and zombies in it) on the same day, and although it is a rather flawed movie But it is really a masterpiece compared to this story. <br /> <br /> So in the end, this is not a terrible movie. It's good or bad in a fun way, even drunk. It's a mess and worth the time that nobody looks.
