Steve Martin should stop trying to make classic comedy. He certainly doesn't suit this part. As well as the new remake of Out Of Towners. This film shows its face. Everyone who once thought that Steve Martin might come close to Jack Lemmon's wonderful performance was beyond me and the same thing was true for this movie. Dan Ackroyd should play Bilko. Better. Martin is great when doing his own original character. But did not succeed in trying to create other people's classical works It is a sad statement when the funniest part of the movie is placed on the first line of credit when the movie ends. The line "The producer acknowledges deeply the acknowledgment of the lack of cooperation by the US military" is the only line make me laugh If you want to see the true Bilko, watch the original Phil Silvers performance. These are guaranteed to make you laugh differently from mistakes that shouldn't happen. I put this movie in the same category as the classic Lemmon mentioned above and the psycho remake shouldn't happen.
