The most boring movie I have ever spent on money, this is the wrong choice for these great stars to lose their fame! boring! boring! Each character is presented in a way that is less inspiring. There is no ability to show at the show, just read the part. Alex is able to play realistic characters as normal. Gwynyth makes himself look ugly when not returning The ability to conceal in a feature that makes the desire for entertainment "Running with scissors" leads the public to expect great performances in movies that show deep tension and emotions. There was not a moment when actors were able to convey this interpretation on the screen. Maybe it's the director's fault.
