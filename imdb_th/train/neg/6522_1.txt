This is not an explanation for real movies, but published in the RUSCICO DVD for North America. I don't know if there are different releases and updates. But the disk that we rent is copyright 2000, if that means anything However, the sound that is mixed on these DVDs is extremely scary. The levels are usually yo-yo-ed up and down; When the scene is cut into a panorama on the battlefield, the orchestra tracks will thunder loud until I don't know what time to blow - my eardrum or speaker When it's time for interaction, the volume is often reduced to what is heard. Orchestra and Foley - The work will be loud while the dialogue is overwritten at a much lower level. My wife and I found that the only way we can watch this movie from these DVDs is if we one hand shook hands on the remote to adjust the volume continuously. And like other users have commented when we choose English audio, the dialog box will switch between Russian and English. And sometimes when the character speaks in French in native music, dubbed in Russian, so you will be SOL if you do not understand Finally we stopped tracking the first disc. Before you split $ 50 + for this movie on a DVD for your library, I suggest you try a copy of the rental, see if you enjoy this great flick or not. Never read a book and really want to understand the story
