Kareena Kapoor in bikini hmmmmmmmm <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar ... <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor .... <br /> <br /> Maybe Saif .... <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in bikinis ..... <br /> <br /> Good banner .. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in bikini .... <br /> <br /> Not a good reason not to watch this movie .... <br /> <br /> Or I think ........ These people didn't make it. JBJ ... <br /> Why o why I forgot about it <br /> <br /> For all the criticisms in the first half of the movie, it's not bad ... <br /> < br /> is planned each You feel the abuse that is mixed with the excitement that I feel when I see RITCHIE GUY movies like LOCK STOCK and SNATCH. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor is hot in a very thin style. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar, the only thing he can do. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is annoying. But a funny person, you will almost forget all the time that you can't understand him. <br /> <br /> Saif is a close friend of Ala Main Khiladi .. <br /> <br /> There are occasional laughter and Laugh a little, and a few goose goose during Karena-Saif's love story (Karena amid the rain, behind me on the bike hmmmmmmm) <br /> <br /> But most This half promises more than sending it ..... br /> <br /> Which makes every half past <br /> <br /> It is more nearly .... cheer when the time came, not only because Carrier wet because of what people think. <br /> <br /> We have been treated with a lot of torture, which is different from what we put in words. <br /> <br /> Soo seems like a close friend. Cartoon ... <br /> <br /> In addition to this, KAREENA looks sexually. You know that the second floor is now empty and her face looks big for her body. (Only women who observe and make other people notice the second floor) <br /> <br /> KAPOOR, his animal and SIDEKICKS get on your nerves. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only one. Perform crazy on one level But even if he becomes too much after a long time. <br /> <br /> Everything you get under one after another <br /> <br /> Why ?? What??!!! When?!!! Where? !!! How can I do this? <br /> <br /> The audience before every song in the second half, which is normal, even without movies. <br /> <br /> Can not relieve the injury anymore. Go .... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie begins as a sound that you can feel even when it comes out. But ended the movement slowly towards HEADACHE and quickly switched to full attack MIGRAINE that was attacked <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie for any reason other than academic interest < br /> <br /> + s Actors, Akshay Kumar first half <br /> <br /> +/- When, how, who is very confused? (Must have one book fill this information) <br /> <br /> + both half-actors (Must use many pages to fill) <br /> <br /> All 3/10 (I try to avoid 1s and 2s. It doesn't seem too serious. But don't make mistakes, this movie doesn't look good, no matter how good it is. The first half is)
