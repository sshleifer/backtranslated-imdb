How many funny people say that this is far more than the version of Romero tends to be very small. (Judging by their other posts) What we have here is a movie full of blood-filled action and "Whoopee" filling 2-hour MTV videos. Exciting editing, work. Of pop video cameras, "cool" music blah blah blah <br /> <br /> Actually it's not bad compared to other recent remakes (the chainsaw massacre is a total disaster) ... expected Completely guessing on the bet "Who will die anyway" and all the money in the name of Dawn Of The Dead that will make a lot of money alone by the fans of the manuscript to watch with curiosity ... <br >> <br /> No Must think of your classic, they really can't happen to the original thing? Why must create Dawn Of The Dead again? (Segment children think boring, so should be slow to show that when you get everything you need, you're still not happy) will disappear altogether. This is a simple and simple action flick. The sooner the better If you enter an action movie (And like this, the 2004 version did very well) but enough for everyone who likes the little content in their movies ... ready to sigh (again) ... <br /> <br >> Watching theaters in the next few years as we receive the new The Godfather series, which is currently being held by the most modern pop director and Star Wars, rearranged by all the children who say the new version is good. than The version is slow and boring and holds the camera for more than 5 seconds ... <br /> <br /> Not bad, but in 10 years they will still talk about the Romero version, not this pap.
