I read, "There is a woman in my soup" coming out in Peter Zeller's low time. Watching movies, I am not surprised Almost nothing happened in the movie. It seems that the status of the seller and Goldie Hawn should be able to help the film. It is not. Maybe I didn't see all the movies about middle-aged people who were elderly people trying to be hippies. But this movie gives a bad name. <br /> <br /> All in all. The movie is much better, so don't waste your time on this beautiful, worthless story.
