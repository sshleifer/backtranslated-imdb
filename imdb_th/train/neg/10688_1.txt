I spent almost two hours watching movies that I thought of all the good actors that were worth watching. I don't want to believe it when the movie ends and I don't know what happened ..... I'm angry because I can spend that time doing other things ... I try to think about it No clue Thank you to those who thought out and explained .... right or wrong, better than not knowing anything !! Which woman in the movie has dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away? How did the First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the movie, Kate says that she will eventually find the truth. Does this mean we have to finish the game 2?
