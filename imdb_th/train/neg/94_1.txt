ZOMBIE CHRONICLES <br /> <br /> Ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> While searching (body Font) The ghost town of the small news reporter (Emmy Smith) picks up the hitchhiker Gray (Joseph Haggerty), who tells two stories about the famous eating zombies to haunt the area. <br /> <br /> <br /> Wasting time ABSOLUTE, hobbled from the beginning by Haggerty of painfully amateur work in an important role Moreover, the two stories that make up a lot are more difficult by showing indifference and the lack of clear direction of Brad Sicks. Previously, he was responsible for CAMP BLOOD (1999). This is not a 'fun' movie in the sense that Edwood's movie is 'fun' (at least he believes in what he does and is sincere in his efforts despite his lack of talent). Sykes monkey film made of aggravation boring and devoid of all morality, and most viewers will feel angry and cheated by absurdly illogical as this 3D model completely wasted here.
