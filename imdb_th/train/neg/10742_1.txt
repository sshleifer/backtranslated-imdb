I tried to sit through this blockbuster. Recently, the catastrophe of the show was brutal, with a pathetic action scene that fell like a balloon, which was mainly due to the fact that the reaction of Actors only Didn't claim the truth In any way, the modern reworking of Hitchcock's original "Lifeboat", I think Hictcock will circle in his grave in the thought of what I can suffer. Movie.it has a semi-big name. Few But they didn't put effort into the characters But do you know that it's fair? It is someone's fault. I mean, I am pretty sure that the script exploded in the first explosion. LOL.it is likely that this ended when it passed. But for me, I am not willing to spend at least three days on the search, so if you have at least three days on the horizon, avoid this producer / 1/10.
