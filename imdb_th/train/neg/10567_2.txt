I think this movie seems to be a case study of how not to make most movies. Since I am a filmmaker, I give 2 for security. <br /> <br /> The problem remains from beginning to end with a very predictable plot using bits and pieces, if not all . Computer graphics that are created are too much like watching video games at the point and it seems that there is no director's effort to add realistic quality to the story. I am interested in the budget to get ideas about what he has to work with. But that information was not found. <br /> <br /> It seems that this project will push the limitations of the movie budget too low. Production that pulls the audience along with the story without imagination. The actors are not bad. But the plot needs more innovation
