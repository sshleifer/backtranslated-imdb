If I knew that John Wayne was in this movie, I wouldn't have watched it. Is an insult to Japanese people, which is a shame for Hollywood and is embarrassing for people with ideas But then most of John Wayne's films are like that. Hollywood in the 50s still believe that everyone in the world loves Americans when the truth is somewhat different. The film is related to isolation in the nineteenth century of Japan. Maybe it is Hollywood that should be separated to make it as clear as possible. This movie is scary. The jingoistic claptrap (from Madama Butterfly and bad music)
