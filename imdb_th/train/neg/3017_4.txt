Now I have the best intentions when watching this thing. I like the work of Tony Scott. Some of my friends tell me that it's a great movie even though I can hear from others. But this is only hopelessness. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott tries too hard. Allow me to do it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> Miss Knightley is doing too much and not In a good way People who do very well are Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Walken. But when their screen can't record movies, <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that jump out of their initiative. In any way, it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer. There have been some adjustment operations about 4 times which started to cause errors after the second time I am confident that I will not use the same song more than once. <br /> <br /> In addition, this correction is really due to the relatively high cutting rate. Oh, and the repeated echoes of some of Keira's lines caused a magical sound after hearing it for the second, third, fourth and other times. <br /> <br /> In general, my opinion is if you want. See some high-resolution and funny animations and you don't care about everything I mentioned above. You may like. <br /> <br /> (In the note: I'm not a Keira Knightley fan)
