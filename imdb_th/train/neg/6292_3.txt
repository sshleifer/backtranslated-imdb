I wonder if this movie is related to the movie "Bachelor Party" in 1984 starring Tom Hanks. Is this movie a sequel to the official? This movie lacks every department and you look better than not watching. <br /> <br /> For this comedy, this movie is not good or funny. It depends largely on the evaluation of their characters. But actually this movie has a good time, original and funny. <br /> <br /> Of course there are very few stories. You just wait for things to finally come out. There is a main plot somewhere. But it is not original and is executed badly in the movie that it feels more like as if it were non-existent I guess that despite the message and moral story there But this is a new and bad story in a movie that doesn't work. <br /> <br /> It's a typical teen joke. There are many jokes and sexual nudity without the main character of a teenager, which makes the whole story sad and without taste. This movie makes some unusual jokes that are misplaced for all movies. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to see this story. <br /> <br /> 3/10
