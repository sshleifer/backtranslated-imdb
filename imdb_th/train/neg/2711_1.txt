Although you can go through the idea that these boring characters have seen every important moment of the 1960s (Okay, so Katie didn't join the Manson family and no one died at Almont. ) This movie I received the impression that "the writer" had just locked himself in the room and watched "Forrest Gump" "The Wonder Years" and Oliver Stone's 60s film over and over again and called it research. One Canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode "Turn Your Head".
