I have read other comments and I have to accept comments that are not infinite. I think it will be quite good .. until the end It makes your mind work and then splashes. I didn't get a clue as to what happened in the last few minutes of the movie. It's like they don't have the money left to get a good death, so they improvise. First of all, they have a mysterious story that makes people disappear. Then, they have a man talking about Area 51 (which makes you miss the aliens). After that, they go shit. I think actors and actors do well. It's just a sour script. However, if you watch this movie, you will be disappointed at the end.
