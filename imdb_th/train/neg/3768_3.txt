The movie was written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and the family (Fred should know each other better than working on the 'Titantic' and 'Dogma' series). <br /> <br /> So the plot There are some scientists and forest officials and hot chick with large fake breasts. They are all bad in their work, including hot chicks. (Which I think should be a photographer But one would be interested because she wears a bikini). One of the wild Rangers commented that scientists are "professional people" which are good because it's scary if they are professional beetles or jellybeans or Ewoks <br /> <br /> They are walking through the forest to find Of a monkey with a strange monkey-like appearance and no one ever mentioned that the bones may be a shameful Bigfoot They just walked around and one of the Rangers clashed with the heat. We all hope that he will die soon (along with his sister who is determined to be a cute innocent person). But really annoying) then they, * gasp *, search for Sasqu ... I mean, a monkey-like burial Of course, there is no mention that it may be just the Bigfoot bones that they are busy with ... I guess scientists and forestry officials didn't think of those things. <br /> <br /> Then Big His feet and tribes Angry and killing everyone we don't like to expel the loser and bury the big aunt Muriel and his cousin Josh. (Those who died from an unfortunate trout accident) again. <br /> <br /> A boring conversation. (I divided it many times) The plot that doesn't exist, the character that doesn't like CGI is bad (the man in the monkey costume looks better) and the performance is not that good to make a movie that I won't. See again. <br /> <br /> You try it. It's a good story for some people to accidentally laugh.
