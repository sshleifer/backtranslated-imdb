The feast of Victor Vargas has failed a lot in what he is trying to do the most: it's true. Unfortunately, this film has no reality. The characters and situations feel completely fake and fake. <br /> <br /> Why? Bad governance Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems that Mr. Zolet will read somewhere that does not give light to his film to give the true feeling wrong! It feels bad. In the same way, shaking the camera does not focus on your movie. But it gives the viewer a headache and distracts from what is on the screen instead of improving it. <br /> <br /> Of course, what is on the screen is so painful. Fake as if Sollett wrote his script with the sole goal of trying to look at the "hip" for his Sundance friend and show that "edgy" is the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Overall And the only lasting impression This film gives you the things that the bad director, Mr. Sollett next time, will learn to write and direct a little class?
