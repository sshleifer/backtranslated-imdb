I am sincerely with Mr. Glover and Goldberg. I watched all the movies with my family and friends. I don't know what this movie is about. We all agree that this is not one of their better endeavors. <br /> <br /> It's not very well together. It's lacking, and it's a little funny. I'm disappointed. It should be better. <br /> <br /> I waited several months to see this movie from the record. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money unless you are an accomplice. To see all the films of Mr. Glover and Ms. Goldberg. <br /> <br /> It's a great way to spend the evening.
