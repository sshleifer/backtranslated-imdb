*** One of the ten stars *** <br /> <br /> Because if so, it would have been this terrible divine mother Mary. I mean, I give a reasonable accommodation every time because it matches the video film. But it disappointed me every time Like many other B movies, the basic story is good and filmmakers seem to have the right resources. But the execution was ridiculous It is a shame that they attach a good name of Halloween to this failure. <br /> <br /> The basic place surrounds some Douche bags that host their annual party. Fling the young boy into the living hell That is the idea anyway. But instead of most movies devoted to showing the relationship of these nasty boys who are full of evil lesbian plans Very few true stories devoted to Halloween or mysterious spells. Actually, it makes me angry that the filmmakers think they can escape with this kind of childcare. <br /> <br /> This film is about the relationship of boys. This is not what the movie was charged. I was tempted to follow the manufacturer and at least threaten them with physical abuse. The performance is not as good as it should be. The script is unintentionally funny. The movie was quite lazy. All movies are amateur nights. This film makes the movie production of SyFy look like a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the movie feels like the filmmaker realized that they didn't produce a TV series and had to throw some kind. Horror sequence Eventually, the evil spells came into play and changed everyone in the haunted house to become the characters that they dressed as I almost felt crying while writing this review. Wow! I mean wow! This is a disaster that cannot be decoded.
