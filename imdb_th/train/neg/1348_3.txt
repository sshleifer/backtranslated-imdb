The film Inspector Gadget, this animated film is quite lame. This story is quite weak and has little action. Most of the characters will get a little without doing anything. This movie is mildly entertaining. the best It has no point of view. But there is only and there is no place close to the capabilities of the TV cartoons from the 80s. It is not a movie that is repeated. At least in my mind, it's about 74 minutes long, including credit, so I guess. That is a good thing, unlike on TV shows, characters are not worthwhile to come here on the list. You want Inspector Gadget to save the day, but who is really interested? That's just my opinion for me. The last case of the gadget is a disappointing 3/10.
