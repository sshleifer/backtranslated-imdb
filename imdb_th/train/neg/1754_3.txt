Why is Mary's history and Rhoda so boring? A woman who is divorced with an indifferent daughter And why there is very little reference to the original program and characters? Character, daughter, stupid and not interested Why doesn't a daughter like their mother on TV? It's reasonable that Mary will leave Minneapolis and Rhoda will return to New York, but why Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens can't be a guest star? It seems like a pathetic way to remember such great characters. It's good to see Mary and Rhoda together. But it should be a lot better. Well, there are Mary Tyler Moore, Reunion shows, Dick Van Dyk, Reunion shows, hopefully Mary will do better next time if you return Visited the old Mary Richards
