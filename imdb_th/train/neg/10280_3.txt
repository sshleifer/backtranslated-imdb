Is he really looking at this movie? A wonderful Christmas movie? Not close. Boring, gentle and lacking in imagination and heart I continue to watch this movie, wondering if anyone who thinks Carly Pope can be a leader in this movie! The woman does not have a personality that can be detected and gives a completely lackluster performance. Baransky is as good as usual and gives only one interesting thing to everything. Her participation may be the only reason that this project begins with green. Maybe I expect too much for a lifetime movie played 15 days from Christmas. But I sat and watched this thing, thinking that there were other directors and new actors JJ and the actors.
