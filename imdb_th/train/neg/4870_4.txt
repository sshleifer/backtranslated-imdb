This movie is not good. Nothing special - just the movie "Baby" that has no serious things in it. Although there is one reason to be aware of this: animals say some people joke about what they say, you can't stop laughing. So if you want to hear a dog in a pound, the dog says "I'm Keyser Soze" or another animal says "You are a dead cat" because there is no good movie to watch again. Vote: 4 out of 10
