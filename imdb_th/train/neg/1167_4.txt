I try to really like this movie. But eventually it didn't work for me I have seen most of the results of Kitamura and found it very variable. There is life like every movie of him, with interesting scenes, good continuity scenes, and creativity at a fair level. However, these qualities lack the pain in Alive. The story looks cool, if not all genuine, and can be made into a beautiful ACE film. Unfortunately, the slow walking is painful and the film takes a long time before Will reach the predictable location The action is fair, with the final battle being very cool. Previous models of cameras were destroyed by excessive camera operation, resulting in less interconnection. There are visual effects, exquisite effects, and some interesting ideas floating in the dialogue. The characters are not well designed and perform well and the settings and general color tones are boring and boring. This film is not completely scary and there are some interesting points. Perhaps using the fast forward button may improve. With about 20 minutes of running, it may be an exciting sci-fi movie. But the full-length movies are boring Only recommended to many patients and fans of Kitumura.
