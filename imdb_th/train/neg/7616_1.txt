The good news is that the movie was created by drawing according to the anticipated Aztec legend and starring the actor. The unusual Aztec-American. The bad news is that it's been dead since birth. <br /> <br /> If Ed Wood retires and coach George Romano through his classic Night of the Living Dead, this is what We may come up with 'The Legend of Diablo' clearly as an animal food for the future resurrection of the 'Mystery Science Theater 3000!' <br /> <br /> I don't think anyone can call the movie. This is 'B'. The production cost was so profound that I felt that I was watching. Long skit from variety shows or 8 mm movies filmed by students. <br /> <br /> Partial spoilers. <br /> <br /> Basic plot line. Looks interesting enough to entice me to rent The rural sheriff of California found a box containing an Aztec demon and accidentally released it in an unsuspecting community. One of his warm and welcoming daughters teamed up with a FBI man and a clergyman to try to catch the devil again. <br /> <br /> At the same time, every zombie scene that was seen in the previous Undead movie was The effect is not good. These zombies can walk like Nutty's army more than zombies! The infrared scene that should be from the perspective of the devil has nothing special, right? And he / she / it is sure that it seems to be a huge reserve. (Opposite to the forward rotation) and the scene in which the priest quickly lures the demon out of the cave, laughing! Actually, it seems to be done for a cartoon effect even though I don't know it! I expect Benny Hill's theme song to start playing and for all the zombies gangs to chase pastors around the beach. <br /> <br /> Of course, Darth Vader's voice / Field of Dreams calls the FBI. Agents will become seriously funny. If so again, this is the majority of this cheese ball! Robert Napton, director and screenwriter, should be rewarded for this effort! (Then the life-long ball hit like 'Hollywood 10?') I now see the top 1.5 in the 10th level. I'm afraid this might be kind! <br /> <br /> Is this movie good? D Lindsey Lofaso looks hot like the youngest daughter of a dead sheriff. This may be the reason why the warm sister (Calvi Pabon) really fled the house! Fred Estrado is qualified as an FBI agent. I suspect that Mario Soto, the player of Father Rodriguez, is the same Mario Soto who threw Cincinnati red? If so, he should stick to baseball. In fact, they can't do worse if they have a baseball theme and call it 'Devil in the field!' <br /> <br /> If I knew this was a project for a community college I'm going to apologize. It may be good enough for B or B + as long as the gang has a college video camera back to the campus in one piece! 'The Blair Witch Project' proved to be a cool movie that can be created on shoelaces. However, 'The Legend of Diablo' doesn't seem to have a shoelace or shoe to work! It's a low budget, low talent, everything is low, the last scene - and I mean about the last 10 seconds of the movie - a little creative or interesting time. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 3.45 to rent this thing. I should use money with hamburgers better!
