Is a very scary movie I can't believe that I spent 90 minutes of my life watching this again. Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer star in this movie? Mehki Pfifer was very good in E.R and Ving Rhames didn't know what he was doing. I feel terrible for them. The background of the song that I must say is not suitable for AT ALLLLL with the story and it's great that you can find these directors who have absolutely no life in making good movies I hope that in the future there isn't any director who is so scary. This movie should not be built from the beginning. Suggestions for anyone who has seen, please tell me that I am right because I cannot be the only audience who does not enjoy <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!!
