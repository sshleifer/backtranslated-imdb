The fact that there is a positive opinion about Dan in Real Life on IMDb makes me realize that their junk staff are working hard to try to make people watch the most horror movies. <br /> <br /> I have no words. There is no idea of ​​starting to describe a truly scary movie. I sat through the night - real life. Steve's character in the previous movie made me believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the conversation. But like any other poster that I feel uncomfortable and embarrassed with the actors, <br /> <br /> It's the Walton family's cookie cutter and this movie many times before that. I was shocked to think that It's a traditional idea. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favorite and do terrible things. Don't believe everything you read in IMDb since the first comment was written by people in different theaters. Users see film GOOD
