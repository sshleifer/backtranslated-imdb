When I received this film for free from my work with three similar movies .. I watched with very low expectations. Now this movie is not bad. You will get what you pay. It's a story of love, betrayal, lies, sex scandals. Everything you want in a movie is not a Hollywood blockbuster. But for the cheap excitement, it's not that bad. I might not watch this movie again. Shortly, this is a type of movie that you will see late at night on a local TV station that just takes a while or you will see it on Sunday afternoon at a local TV station Take a moment Despite poor performances, lamentations and sub-camera work I have no desire to close the movie and pretend that it never appears in my DVD player. This story has been done many times in many movies. This is not different, not bad, not bad. <br /> <br /> Just your average movie.
