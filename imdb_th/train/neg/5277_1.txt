I caught this in Showtime last night and was intrigued by the fact that movies with such interesting places would end up incredibly. who's your Daddy? Brandon Davis plays as Chris Hughes, a high school that sponsors heirs for the pornographic kingdom that gave birth to parents. Although the evidence seems like a movie, it is very fun. But it was destroyed by director Andy Fikman, the first director, a screenplay with a clich√© and guesswork Even Charlie Tallbert, who is a regular joke, has also changed to be the best friend. Ali Landry is just a good part of this game. 1/10
