Great Western, I heard you say all! Great first attempt! I'm not sure which movie you watch. But it must be a movie that is different from the movie I see Great Westerners or all good movies have characters that you can believe and this movie doesn't have to be! The performance is not good enough to say the least, and I don't care about the character of any character. The story is too big for the creator, and maybe they should try to make a low-budget junk list like you see in the list. "Truth or fiction" on sci-fi. <br /> <br /> Please, if you are looking for a great Western movie or even a fun and half hour, please look elsewhere.
