Boring dialogue, boring and plotting (The same thing we have seen in the 80s fantasy movies) hokey songs and characters that draw numbers by knocking the running mistakes for fans The beautiful armpit of Bakshi's work, the rotation and the fact that Frank Frazetta teaches animators to draw like him. This is Frazetta ... moving. The violence is exciting and the direction of art and animation is different from the movies of swords and other magic. At that time, <br /> <br /> I like watching this movie by turning off the sound.
