As usual in IMDb, most votes instead "Weighted average" is more indicative of the entertainment value of a movie. In this case, most will give "one" right! To begin my investigation, first of all, I would admit that I was completely irrational why the film was called "Alien Intruder". It was related to the space and even the "aliens" (I think) but without touching or The reason (at all) for anything in the long run, at least there is no basis for the plot or the true resolution that I can do anywhere. <br /> <br /> There is a rather brutal scene. Am (Both in the timeline and how to speak) that it exceeds the strange feelings you get when watching a really bad movie I have no idea about that part. Near the beginning, Bugs Bunny Electronics seems to be bragging about something. <br /> <br /> "Plot" is related to the area called G-Spot. One person apologizes for causing the G-Sector ... and some virtual programs that are infected with the alien virus (?). I think it's an alien because Ariel's image is something else that appears to be a negative image. /> <br /> For pictures Most of the time, we see people being shot in space weapons, falling out of the tower and seemingly endless. Close-ups of "Where's Ariel?", "Can't find Ariel" (pointless because most other images include interaction with Ariel, whatever the matter) on the computer screen. Commander Skyler (Billy Dee ) Sit and watch each fantasy of the prisoner's VR program that hopes to find this alien virus and become one with it ... ??? Or maybe I might miss something ... <br /> <br /> Billy D Williams uses a few courses about "Performing in despair" before filming this story We know this because he takes a lot of time to move his finger on his face and look sorrowful. <br /> <br /> The scene that connects the nose of a boat goes to the back of another boat. At least, and arrange for laughs, in addition to the first scene in which we saw many ships, since it had just turned in a circle, it seems that Lego's experiments would be wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems like everyone. Dead in this movie, why bother? Even VR women were killed as if they were meant to be meaningful. (Especially when others die) ... aggressively. <br /> <br /> Because the money I save from the grocery store, I won't brag. About wanting my money the night I paid for this DVD The dollar that I saved in the bag of vanilla wafers paid by the time of the reviewer. <br /> <br /> I will add that story, at least as a novel and may have more details. Quite interesting with the right author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
