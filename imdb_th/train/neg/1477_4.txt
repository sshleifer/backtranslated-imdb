I've seen Dolemite and (Avenging) Disco Godfather, which are two other great works of canons. blaxploitation From our friend Rudy Ray Moore, but this movie Human Human Tornado (aka Dolemite 2) will be a special place in my heart For stupidity without skill in film production and true enthusiasm (Slightly straightforward) The Human Tornado can't be refilled. <br /> <br /> The opening scene makes the sound of Dolemite. Our old friend is bound to a white woman when some local cynical police raid the house without Reasonable and you don't know! The woman in the bed with old Dole is none other than the wife of the sheriff. She cried when she saw him: "He made me do it!" Dolemite's cries: "& $ * @ $ is real or" The delicateness is never his strength. <br /> <br /> Highlights? A cameo picture by Ernie Hudson (From the Ghostbusters reputation), continuous mistakes (The character looked one way in one match and another scene in the next scene. Dolemite's suit changed color every match in his nightclub.) Her first scene, <br /> <br /> But the happiness that Indeed, here is Rudy Ray Moore himself. Does that man think he looks cool in this movie? Of course I don't know why. But you must appreciate his true enthusiasm Whether jumping from all the cliffs or barking orders to his gang in touch (eg: Quick into the cave! I have a plan to let the mother $ * @ (% & dig his own grave!). Of course, he is no more water than every time he does kung fu. High speed But sometimes slow down so that Rudy pretends and grits his teeth. I'm not sure if they want It seems like they speed up the movie as an effect or if they want us to believe that he is so fast in every case. "The Matrix" can't. <br /> <br /> Tornado man like The original Dolemite is an incompetent movie in an enormous proportion. But at least it's fun and of course you have to give credit to these people for not too much effort. Enjoy my many suggestions.
