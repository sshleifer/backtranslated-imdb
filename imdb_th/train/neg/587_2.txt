This film makes a difference from the documentary film "The miracle of the human body" with courage, if it is strange, choose to pull out the disgust of the audience. In one scene, the camera shuts down on a giant zit that is 50 feet in size while the teen squeezes the pus and the liquid out of it. In another camera, half were soaked in half-digested food and stomach acid, which is part of the pasta salad falling from the esophagus and bulging into the thick substance. On the final tour, the camera de force will take viewers in the harrowing ride through the forest ... teen armpit hair. Unfortunately I didn't do this. Watch this movie if you want, but: bring your vomit bag and don't make pasta salad before.
