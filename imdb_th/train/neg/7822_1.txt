This film is a poor attempt to raise money using classic themes. I used to love the movie Superman, but this made me want to shoot myself. Very poor performances, evil special effects and zero plot. To summarize: Superman left the world because scientists discovered parts of the planet in his home. Some people in space (duh) didn't tell fans. His girl before leaving (duh again) went out into the spaceship (?!?) Come back. I think 5 years later and hope to talk to his girlfriend again. (Which is now resurrecting his son, which son, in my humble opinion, at least 7 years). What is Lex Luthor about? Trying to grow a new continent to sell land? Please !! <br /> <br /> I vote 1 out of 10 for this movie just because I am not allowed to vote. 0 If you have anything to do with your time, don't watch this movie. And even if you have nothing to do at home and watch TV!
