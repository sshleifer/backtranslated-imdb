I found myself very attracted to this movie, at least at the beginning, and any credit I gave to this movie was Lacey Chabert. But that is the end I seem to be very good at finding out who the murderer is and I like it when the movie can completely mess me up. But I feel that lying and lying to them all the time that they take you in one direction and then they suddenly Deciding to go in a completely different direction at the end, they didn't hit it at all, not misunderstanding that writing and planning are terrible, people don't think at all. This movie It would be much better if they stick to the plot that led you. They don't seem to answer anything. Why is Jane (Maria) burning the Professor's house? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately As I felt it began with a fairly good movie.
