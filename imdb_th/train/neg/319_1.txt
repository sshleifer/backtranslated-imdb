One of my friends bought this movie for Â£ 1 and even then that price was not too high. Despite having big names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and Bert, who are incredibly talented, this movie is a joke like shooting a chisel and hammering it through the hole. Your ears It uses funny tricks. The barrel below - constantly breaking the fourth wall while Sandler talks to the audience and the pointless editing of the 'hot girl' <br /> <br /> Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship. Those who want to make it a successful comedian in order to succeed with women When a comedian who lives in a boat named 'Dickie' due to his unseen success with the opposite sex - presumably lost in the sea, the character of Sandler Shaker, the main character His wife, Dickie, was not dead. He was quite trapped in the bathroom, presumably suffering from sea sickness. <br /> <br /> Maybe coming out of his mouth where he showed the worst movie ever
