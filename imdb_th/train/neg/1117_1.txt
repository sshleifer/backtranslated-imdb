I don't know what this movie really is about. It's like a student art school project. They never say why the world is dark. But it is always dark except seconds per day There are images that are long and disturbing all kinds of insects without reason. The little dialogue in this movie is ridiculous and ridiculous like images Black women enter the main character's apartment. Anyway, she will be pregnant overnight, then shot in the head. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after the white nude woman emerges. I never even blown away that this movie is so bad and pointless. Honestly, I want someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think about it. But I do not want this level of hell with others
