Possible spoilers I must say "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst movies ever created. First, this movie was created during the sequel of the Disney rampage, the highest. It was created at the same time as "The Little Mermaid II," "The Jungle Book II" and "Peter Pan II". But causing damage to their original classic movies (Disney has created "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II", but I will leave that topic because their original movies have never been classic. ") Let me go ahead and say that I I am an avid supporter of good Disney movies and I like the original Disney like Cinderella, but the sequel of "Cinderella" is a very long time. The character of Cinderella in the sequel is different from the first woman. I grew up watching it in the traditional way. Cinderella is kind and loving. The new Cinderella has a time that doesn't fit in with the characters in modern times. "I will organize a party like this! You say the new Cinderella (As I named you with love) said "Ew!" That is Anti Cinderella. Why am I trying to find the best in the people? They make it like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just horrible family members for the poor little Anasta SIA. My question about the world: People that Disney has watched. "Cinderella" Original when creating this sequel? It seems that it is not so. If I remember correctly, Anastasia is like a stubborn Cinderella, like Dorisella and Lady Trenten. I'm all for redemption and forgiveness. But there is no redemption point for Anastasia in this movie At first, Anastasia was evil. In the second second she is good Either can not leave this kind of thing I hope Disney recognizes that this film in other films is embarrassing for Walt Disney's name. Maybe now Michael Eisner is gone. Things will start to form around the House of Mouse.
