I have to admit that I like the first half of Sleepers. It looks good. The performance is better. The story of childhood, pain and revenge are interesting and moving. The Hollywood movie is superior, but ... no one talks about this. (At least in the last 20 comments) When it comes to the scene in the courtroom and Brad Pitt's character, follow his plan to help his two friends accused of killing correctly Felt cheated This movie insulted my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Remind the spoiler !! <br /> <br /> Why do everyone accept their false excuses? If both of them are with him, why shouldn't they tell this story during the investigation? Amnesia? If you are a judge or jury member, would you believe it? Should the killer's motif disappear? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but the story is finally weak and this makes me angry. This movie has great potential. 4/10
