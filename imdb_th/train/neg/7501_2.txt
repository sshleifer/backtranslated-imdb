I went to watch this movie, expecting a movie, a short story related to the impact that Sam's son has on society. I did not expect Spike Lee to force me to waste more on racial tension, justice, or the inability of the general public to choose alternatives under pressure from fellow Lee. <br /> <br /> All movies may be more effective if they are in a 90-minute format with greater focus and less tangent sub-conversions. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about Rent a video until you enjoy Spike Lee; In such cases, the theater is worth it. This is not a gangster movie.
