This movie is not a waste, except in some boring scenes during that time. But the actress gave a better performance than the man who laughed. <br /> <br /> But Krista Allen really vibrates in the movie. Her voice is attractive and sexy. The bed scene associated with Krista should be Shortened, but she made it look and sexy than anyone could actually be one of the best in that role. She also had a quiet law and baddie in the last 5 minutes, which is an interesting part of the picture. /> <br /> press the the Burt the Reynolds bad <br much and here. Not his best actor. He can choose a better chapter. I think he did it for money.
