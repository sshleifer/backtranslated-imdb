This movie is strange. Put better is "Strange" I can give you a summary of the plot with you or an analysis of ownership. But I think it makes you waste time Everyone needs to know about this movie: two sisters, an unreasonable sexual relationship, murder, murder, post-mortem, and one really disturbing passion. At the end of the movie, you feel like you have to take a shower to wash off the dirt yourself. But not in a good way, such as after "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club". It's like you are a teenager (Or a high school student that I am still a teenager) and just do what you are A: hope you won't do it and B: hope to be the Lord of Heaven and Earth to your parents Never knew about And no one likes that My advice is instead to spoil your thoughts and by watching dirt in the cinema, just waste time with less scary things and watch "Kazaam" (yes, I want to see "Kazaam" more than "Murderous Maids "Read it what you want)
