Man Winker, I'm very angry that I can't write the right comments about this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous. Lightly tied. Nicolas Cage ... Embarrassing you! I think when you are in there, at least it should not be appropriate. <br /> <br /> I feel like most of the movies are left on the cutting floor, and even if it's complete - this movie is just Will be strange and stupid. <br /> <br /> Finally, you open your mouth, dazed and unhappy. I have never heard that many people have left the theater on the opening day with a lot of hate. People complain about this in a small group in a four-story department store down from the theater near the entrance. It was so bad. <br /> <br /> I heard it compared to: Glitter, American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My girlfriend is very angry. He won't talk about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
