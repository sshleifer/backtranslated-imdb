I am a descendent of Puerto Rico. There is a mix of this "documentary". At first I was offended by Perez. Comparing Senor Campos and Che Guevarra was also just the fact that Mr John Leguzaimo was not a descendant of Puertorican. His parents came from Colombia. Anyone who does this research is not very accurate. I feel that the future of our competition depends on education. This message should have reflected back throughout this film. Education is the way to freedom and our power. I think that the future efforts of this production team should pay attention to them.
