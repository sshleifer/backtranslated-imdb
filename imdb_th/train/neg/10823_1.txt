I do not like the use of the word "scary" to describe the work of the theater that takes a lot of effort, talent and money to create. But Zefferelli's attempt to adjust Charlotte Bronte's novel was Completely wasted time. <br /> <br /> The script lacks expertise and power. Everything is explained to the audience without any uncertain conditions. The lead actors had a terrible smear, clearly employed for their star names and drifting and boring musical scores. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt had no chemicals at all. She was like a worse wet noodles than Joan Fontaine. Which at least has the ability to contribute emotionally to what should be the story of a disappointing love And William Hert shows the whole movie with a single tone and the tone is flat and without energy Of course, the script that is limp and unreasonable does not help one of these great actors in their efforts to bring a terrifying life. <br /> <br /> Joan Plowright's Mr Fairfax is like a person. Create a Disney To make the sweet scene that you will get out of the best <br /> <br /> There is no mystery around the story of Rochester's first wife. The role of the second wife, who plays the role of Barbie by Elle MacPhearson, is an empty figure. Fiona Shaw, the best actress, completely lost as Mrs. Jane Rye's aunt. She should be better than Mrs. Fairfax. Only Amanda Root as Jane's beloved school teacher encourages true sympathy or confidence. <br /> <br /> I saw this version of 'Jane Eyre' after watching Robert Young for the television program of England in 1997, starring Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. No comparison. The important, romantic and deep version of Young is like an explosive nova compared to Zefferelli's wet squib. <br /> <br /> Now I'm interested in watching the 1970 model with Timothy Dalton, which I have read. Very good things on this website I'm surprised that there are many people who like Zefferelli's Yorkshire picture book. <br /> <br /> About what I can say well about this movie is that the house is beautiful and colorful movie filming. Brighter than it would be a complete fool
