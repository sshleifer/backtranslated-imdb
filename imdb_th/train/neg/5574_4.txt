"Godzilla vs King Ghidorah" is a perfect example of how great ideas can be destroyed by pathetic topics such as pseudo-patriotism Here, travelers from the future try to destroy Japan, replacing the local hero Godzilla with a puppy monster who is the three golden dragon king King Ghidorah. However, in the end, Godzilla fights Ghidorah. But the plot of the movie is full of holes and everything about "Great Japan" is really stupid. The creator of this film is not threatening with respect to the enemies of Japan, making them very stupid. Big blonde hair that is smarter than Japanese people who are smarter. The good thing is that in the end Godzilla and King Kadidah almost destroyed the whole of Japan and it was a ridiculous enemy in an incredible battle. But until this fight, this movie is really boring and pathetic.
