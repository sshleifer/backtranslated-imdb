Yes. I will accept it. I believe that all the ads around this work are about the trials and tribulations of the 6 people living in Mexico City about their sexual life. And I expect to finally see Mexican movies (in the era) that are both popular and interesting to watch Unfortunately, this film is very disappointing. The story presents us with two pairs, both of which have very clear marriage problems. When the third person comes into the life of each pair, their problems reach a critical point. Or absolutely ridiculous The plot changes into a sexual struggle. Gestures taken by each group (Yes, they are truly groups. Women and girls and boys and boys) are stupid and children. (I guess there should be humor) and it starts from bad to worse. The show has since been good. (Massa Valeta) to medium (Mr Bichir) by Serrano works well on his pre-opera However, the flat situation that constitutes a one-dimensional character plot, a terrible perception (if not a fool) in what sex shows in an adult relationship miserably. SPyL has a good reception. (Impressive) at the box office Believe ads at your own risk.
