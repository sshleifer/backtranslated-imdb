As a fan of Manga and anime of Konakai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE JACK and others) I look forward to being a part. I do not see manga and anime, so I have no idea before thinking good things as well. What we have here is a collection of stupid softcore movies of the genre used to open up with a terrible mess in late night cable channels. While it is tame when compared to the things that hit the neck of the general cable audience (The mischievous parts of our heroes are tastefully hidden behind the scarf, glued strategically or adorned with ridiculous sunburst effects). Not suitable for the small ones While I have nothing to do with female heroes, I don't like making movies like amateurs. (There are at least four in this series.) On the plus side, there are at least one beautiful actress in each episode that I see. No wonder that BOAI TESTICLE TESTIC has never done ...
