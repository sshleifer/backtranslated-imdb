SciFi has a lot of bad luck in creating a quality movie recently (like Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel should follow the great Beowulf epic. However, it deviates a lot. (And there is very little comparison) that television commercials may be called "Christopher Lambert movies". I didn't expect it to be as accurate as full Hollywood production. But I expect 'Art perfection' will not interfere with the real story. (Although slightly changed At the specified time) <br /> <br /> The directors and the producers have ideas about what they are doing. Obviously, no one can tell from a large, horny helmet that Beowulf and his team wear. One of the main problems that I think is when looking at Grendel or not, if Wolfe has to fight with him, shouldn't he be sixteen feet tall and weigh two tons? ? In my opinion, in fact, the epic is better than the garbage generated on the script. For example: Grendel should have his arms torn from the socket by Beowulf ?? Not cut off at the forearm after he was burned by an arrow blasting from a face that looks like 300 pounds! And Grendel's mother. They combined her with the dragon at the end of the epic, which he eventually died when he gave up on his wounds? And honestly, what the hell is with this cylinder? <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie because it's connected to the epic or not because it doesn't exist. (In addition to character names) The only way I would recommend this movie is if you like the Druids movie (directed by Jacques Dorfmann) ?? Although I do not recommend watching as well.
