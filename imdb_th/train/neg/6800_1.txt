I signed in to comment on how much the film was stupid. In addition to cutting off the executive decision or Air Force One or other terrorist stories, this is one type of movie that lets you admire watching movies that can bring the same basic ideas. It is difficult to blame the actors when they get stupid and funny scripts to work with. It's not good enough if you groan in a movie when you insult the intelligence. But when you find yourself lamenting over and over again, you must conclude that the director is not the smartest person in the movie business or Is a producer who decided to bring this story up first Most low-cost actors, you can find an excuse to do this task because they often appear to receive money and reveal, not that being part of this comedy will receive a prize or has been accepted It may end up causing them to be embarrassed because there is a bad decision to be involved in the loser. I do not see the plot summary or even giving any examples to prove my case for doing so would be a cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this destruction. As with education, well-crafted movies can inspire you in how to create good art and skills together with skills. The only thing you can learn from watching this strange thing is Things that should not be done are warned.
