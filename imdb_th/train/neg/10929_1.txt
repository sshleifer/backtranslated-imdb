This movie is a fast-moving Mormon movie. It makes RM & Sons of Provo look like a movie that is doing well! It should be funny from what I say. The best part is the best actor in the movie - Travis Eberhard - if he isn't in this movie, it won't be created! He ruled! <br /> <br /> 10 It's not a joke. 9. It wins. 8. It has a Thurl Big T Bailey, a character that doesn't make sense. 7 It was created in Provo 6. It's not fun with Brokeback 5. It has Larry H. . Miller in it 4. It's the 1st movie. Clint Howard is not funny. In the 3rd, Gary Coleman chose the perfect movie 4 stories back. 2. They should perform in the Surreal Life audition. 1. It's done by Halestorm Entertainment.
