*** Spoiler *** Starts from the "good" of this movie - a show that benefits Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The remaining performances are terrible. (This is not a bad help from the script) The worst villain is the villain Buntao, the head of the Asian criminal organization (played by Frans Tumbuan). Went to waste a lot of money; The awesome performance Patrick Muldoon is not that good and the script "It was his unfriendly revolution" (that is, the rest of the film's title) was delivered as badly as possible. There are no other main characters, but there are other actors / actors who stand out. He / she in this movie Next we came to the plot. This thing should tell you all you need to know: in the original "Rage and Honor", Cynthia Rothrock, Chris Fairchild player is a teacher in the inner city. Now she is a CIA representative (or other government agency - sorry, but this movie is so bad I can't remember) Um ... I imagine that the CIA application process is like an interviewer: Have you What is your job experience? Chris: I am a teacher. Interviewer: Okay; You are hired! I just gave "2" because of good performances and good plot at the end. (Although we know that Tommy (Muldoon), the secret villain will be arrested)
