First of all, I must admit that Batman: The animated series is the best Batman series. We watched it when it used to be on TV. I didn't realize that there were four seasons. Actually, there is no BTAS ending in the 3rd season and should stop there. <br /> <br /> Why are they busy with the good things? Catwoman and Poison ivy now have a terrible gray face. The clown looks scary. It seems that every time they fix his appearance, he will look more creepy. He seems to have no pupils anymore and now he doesn't look at humans from a distance. (Although he is that person) <br /> <br /> Bruce Wayne is voiced by Kevin Conroy, the best Batman. Although he now looks like Superman There is nothing that makes him different because both of them seem the same. Now Bruce Wayne has blue eyes. <br /> <br /> Night Wing really needs a haircut! Alfred just had a student from the eyes, like a character from the 80s. <br /> <br /> I watched three episodes from the first sheet in the series and I found out that this version has violence and graphics. More (with blood in every episode) <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Batman: Animation series, there is no Batman Season 4. They include this series as C. Sun 4 for marketing capabilities If they just released it in the form of Batman's adventures, I don't think many people will buy it. <br /> <br /> Help you to be disappointed and be in season 1-3.
