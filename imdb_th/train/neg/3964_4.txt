For every story about this movie, I still open my heart to what I ultimately thought. And even though it is sometimes slow, sometimes 90% of the first movie is quite good with "Old" fear more than a few times I think shooting movies is great in many scenes. However, the Dark Remains failed at the highest point. The end of this movie and the storyline is what looks like a MILES APART from its body. The story falls on its face completely with irrational conclusions and the answers I need most - what happened to Emma really? - Not clearly explained! The reason for the negative energy is so ridiculous, and finally I feel very cheated. What seems to be a terrific horror movie is finally being dominated by a horrible ending.
