I'm watching this movie now on WTN because that's the TV channel that opens when I open it. It is a tedious and somewhat tedious story about the minister's wife. (Alexandra Paul) who falls in sexual desire with a core / young drift, may or may not have a plot Corey hit his shirt a lot. I feel that he should act poorly and that's why he is busy with Alexandra Paul. It's not really important because, as I said, he took off a lot of his shirts and I saw the twists and turns.
