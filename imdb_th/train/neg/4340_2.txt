The original Carlito Way is a great story about a former drug dealer who hopes to leave his past criminals, and so he invests in the club and handles the problems that come with it. <br /> <br /> Is .... <br /> <br /> I saw the example and immediately realized that it would not be good .. but after canceling the movie in the past and found that they were excellent (Lucky Number Slevin, Tokyo Drift). I took this picture and it failed within five minutes. First ... <br /> <br /> The script is something that teens will think of if getting five minutes to prepare ... It's also weak. Weak conversation It seems that there is a desire for romance in a gang movie right away, so Brigante decides to beat the man for that woman .... and she says, 'Yes!' ... as we learn from 'Italian gangster' ... <br /> <br /> The performance is terrible to say the least ... I found 'Hollywood Nicky' hilarious. <br /> <br /> I hate every musician that Turned to watch movies Let's face it for the same reason that P Diddy made this movie so he could play as a gangster ... The actors playing Leticia were weak but beautiful. The sex scenes were weak. But we have seen you .. which is ok ... <br /> <br /> But overall I expect it to be understood that Carito ended up in prison and the love of his life. .. and the killer at the end added a horror movie ... <br /> <br /> Carlito's way: Rise to Power ..
