I used to promise not to walk out of any movies. (It is a personal policy that caused me to suffer the most different shipwrecks, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage is a truly scary experience. Everyone who sees this movie thinks that the Austrians are miserable and poor. It shows the world without love and humanity, the world that people are humiliated for just one reason - to divert attention from their miserable existence. By choosing a documentary style with non-professional actors (Most seemingly straight from Deix's Austrian cartoonist's imagination) Director Seidl wants us to believe that this is a real life in the suburbs of Austria (Europe? The audience must face sex, violence, women and people with disabilities, madness and decadence. But this is not a social criticism This is just a pure shot without any aesthetic fees, but you will get bad performances, bad movies, bad movie creation. If anyone wants a movie like this to know that there is something wrong in our society, that person must walk through life with closed eyes. This is a pseudo-social criticism with a sledgehammer. And it insulted the people in a nasty way It shows that ugly people - that's not the reason I hate it. But it shows that the average person in an ugly and hateful way And this is the reason that this movie looks truly disgusting
