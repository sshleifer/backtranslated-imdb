In the United States, there are very few movies about Rome that were not produced in the Julius Caesar era or shortly thereafter. Most of Hollywood's sword and slippers contain Christian content, which makes it difficult to understand Roman history earlier. (Spartacus may be the first exception to this rule and meet resistance in Hollywood.> <br /> It's interesting to see at least one picture that is not only But happened before the time of Caesar and Christ but was set when Rome was only one city among many people on the Italian peninsula and only the king hated Tarquin and founded the Republic Is the peplum and while the production value is not the lowest point, the display and the cardboard style I can imagine how the conversation was in Italian. But with the English dubbed dubbing, it is very interesting At first I got a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I didn't see many movies in this genre by thinking of Hercules in the 1960s. But when the next movie is boring, <br /> <br /> One thing for sure: If I watched this movie when I was ten years old, I would love it. Roman and sword fighting in it At least this flick brings back childhood memories.
