I have an interest in this film as a junk eating man. I was thoroughly disappointed. It was the same disappointment that I felt was watching. 'Friday the 13th: Jason took Manhattan.' A lot of wasted potential! <br /> <br /> The opening scene attracts the right attention. Then it will stop Many breasts and great 80's fashion can't help this movie. The only thing to eat near this island is Piranha! I didn't ask for a level 'The devastation of the cannibalism' but I am looking for blood that is more useful. I didn't get it at all. <br /> <br /> I found some of the interesting fighting scenes, so 2 stars. I don't think it's worth the time it takes to watch it. I can see performances at parties that nobody cares about what happens and you just want something in the background. But I won't tell anyone "Oh, your friend, GOTTA, watch this movie." It's not good enough or not good enough to guarantee interest.
