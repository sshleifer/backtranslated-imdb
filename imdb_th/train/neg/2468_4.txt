This is not all wonderful. Not terrifying or hateful or anything, just forget. <br /> <br /> There is something. Hmm, hesitant, hesitant, dilute the air like never knew it would be laughing or sweet or satirical. So we were left with the weakness of the three people. It seems that the actors are gone. <br /> <br /> In addition, the idea is tired and reused. How many times have we had to say that 50 people in the United States were infected with tantalizing feelings? And this is a melee with aggressive consumer protection? And emotional oppression in men is good? Old hat <br /> <br /> It's the biggest crime in my eyes, even though it is separate from reality. I know it's funny and all but - especially in the full movie that you have to maintain the attention of the audience for a long time - you still have to have an emotionally bonded, relevant advice through some stories to make it. Interesting. For 'hero' children to watch old women, school students, two friends, and eventually his father dies painfully with the hands of zombies or whatever and Help for him to greet it with a cheerful smile and a shrug, then I just. Fight to deal with that in a positive manner. Mother, too. If you create two main characters that are inhumane at that level, you risk losing me and that's what happened. <br /> <br / > The biggest plus I can offer is that I like the look of the suburbs, apple pie and This thing caught it well, it was a handsome movie, especially those wide-angle images of the streets and in the Robinsons' house. In addition, the debut film was cute in the way that had been done before. But still funny. <br /> <br /> And I think Billy Connolly is ok and that comes from someone who is not a big fan of Billy Connolly: The movie star. I just had this fear. Will destroy it and try to steal every scene But he played it quite low, important for him, and probably came out as the most sympathetic character in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Not all thought well.
