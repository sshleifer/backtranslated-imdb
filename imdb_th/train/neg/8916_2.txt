I rented this DVD when I saw it while looking for something else. When I saw the name on the jacket, I couldn't believe my eyes. I read Yalom's book about a year ago and loved it. In fact, I admired Yalom's work. In general (I was a clinical psychologist) I watched this movie for about 30 minutes and had to shut down. I'm not sure I can spend more time. At the superficial level, the accent, manners, while others comment that it is just the best and annoying distraction. The performance is boring when it should be enthusiastic and funny when it should be serious. Lou Salome's image is simple and the excellent Freud is less than the student. I saw the spirit of this book very little. I hope to be able to recommend this movie to my students. I will reference them to the book instead. Imagine
