Unfortunately, this movie is related to social criticism that is crippled in real events. But there is no ball to record what happened legally The rhetorical constant that violent video games will not blame. (I get the impression Ben Coccio is an avid gamer) or the media and music are not completely influenced, ie clear text. Burn all their CDs, talk about the subtlety!) But the movie fled because it was a 'novel'. Tried well. But how do we get to know children who plan and execute school shooting with influence from the media? Or video game We can't and we are used to this movie because these kids are smart enough to relinquish the media completely. But is it stupid enough to burn Nazi symbols on the floor? Haha, I don't think so. <br /> <br /> This movie makes you stunned when you see the normal picture of the family. Children who go out and shoot schoolmates Why is everyone involved in making a killer look "normal" when they don't notice? False and completely fake images
