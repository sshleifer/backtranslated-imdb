Watch this movie, which is happy with Gregory's Girl many years ago. This is floating The plot is incredibly disgusting, with his teachers and friends secretly going to girls aged 14-15 years in a short skirt. Previous reviewers seem to think that this is not important But I think it is quite nasty If you have children at school, the last thing you want is to think that every little teacher is ambitious after his disciples. We were surprised that the sensor let pass. In addition, this movie was a waste of time. The script is not good and John Gordon Sinclair tries too hard to create a picture of his new schoolboy and a little strange outside the wall. Why everyone wants to wish after him in this show is incredible. This movie failed for me all. Scary. Please don't waste time watching. Life is too short
