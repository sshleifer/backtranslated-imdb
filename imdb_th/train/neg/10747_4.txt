Camp Blood III is a great improvement in the Camp Blood II because it has a lot of sounds in the right places and the basic storyline. This time, they left the parking lot a little more, two things were filming, which is a good position because you won't hear the car driving through what is supposed to be a wilderness. <br /> <br /> This time around Reality TV shows and fake jokes that will make the contestants afraid This is a new idea. Hardly. I've seen three horror films that have the same place where the real killer appeared. But at least this story has a plot instead of being stabbed with a random knife.> <br /> Unlike the other two in this series, at least it's good for a few laughs. I like having a gunshot effect when someone is stabbed early and the way the boom boom hovers behind people like demons. <br /> <br /> I don't know why everyone wants to create. Third Camp I think it would be better to start from the center. But at least try this one A woman with half the irregular shape is quite a thing for me. It seems that they are trying to maintain continuity by hiring a strange person to remove the clothes for $ 5 just as they did in the second movie. They still didn't work that the machete used for cutting, not stabbing. But oh well, it's the movie of the blood camp. What do you expect? If you like shit movies, you will get fun from this story.
