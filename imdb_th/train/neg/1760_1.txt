This film caused many errors. A few American actors in Spain and Spanish actors who speak English, English 'Spanish' is OK, but the acting method makes it very annoying The conversation through the whole script is very weak. It may be a Spanish script. But incorrectly translated, who knows and cares I can only guess that the famous Spanish actor who is forced to use English, they may be good. But not in this failure You will figure out the movie within the first 5 minutes. That's a pathetic way. The rest is not good. Waste a lot of time and many UN unnecessary plans Oh, I'm talking about one of Baldwins' in here.
