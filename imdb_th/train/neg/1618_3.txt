I went to watch this movie with the most positive expectations. I've seen Jacquet's previous movie (March of the Penguin) and have heard many good reviews of this story on the radio. However, I was severely disappointed. The most important thing is that this movie is very boring. Nothing truly happened I tried to explain the content of this movie to my friends and we both laughed because I could only stutter. "Then the winter came, spring and then there were eagles and rivers and once It was dark and the girl entered the cave and again the fox had children. "And so, after about half an hour, I began to sigh. Screaming, watching the critics of the radio station and hoping it would end in Coming soon But this film continues Finally, when it ended, I sank deep into my chair until I had to look like Stephen Hawking. The most annoying part of the movie was (a) the girl who was so obvious that the children were wearing the same clothes all the time. Both movies (one year) and showing two facial expressions: Joy and Seriousness. She's cute. There's no question about that. However, movies about natural beauty like this should be better if there is not too much of her presence to humans. I constantly found myself hoping that she might eat bears, drown in the river or something similarly bad. (B) Comments from the voice of an adult girl who didn't say anything but overlooked. Not clear, clear, boring and repetitive (c) music that is not sensitive When the girl jumps happily, the music jumps around as well. When the fox is threatened by an eagle, the song becomes a threat as well. It reminds me of the first days of filmmaking and is too easy to guess. It is acceptable. Many children who see this movie with me do clearly. At least they are involved. Therefore, my warning only involves adults: If you are over ten years old, avoid this film. You can sleep better (and cheaper) in most other areas.
