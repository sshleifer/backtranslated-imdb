This is the ranking in the list of the worst movies I've ever seen in Starz on Demand. They seem to get all the DVDs that they can find and put here. <br /> Why? Who knows! Obviously everyone with a digital camera and a shoestring budget can come with a horror movie and put on a TV. Speaking here, it looks terrible from the moment I saw the example - but I gave it a chance. <br /> <br /> I tried to open my mind about budget movies. Some of the best movies I've ever seen are movies that use a small budget or in other cases only need a low budget. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those movies. <br /> Now you know the story. This then i'm sure if you read this Whether you hear about this in Starz on Demand or for whatever reason you end up on this page because of boredom It's about 3 minutes of pathetic and frightening young women that we know in an incredibly bad music video "heavy metal". Anyone who combines it must think that it looks really interesting. But actually not However, she killed herself. Then she has someone. Then some killing began. It's not really memorable and average and as boring as possible. When the first bullet fired into her apartment, it seemed to sound like a popcorn pop. Is that the best sound effect they can create? I can find better sound effects for free. (Without copyright) on the internet ... right now. <br /> <br /> Don't let another review claim that this is a 10-star movie. Trick you. Obviously they are both movie distributors or even The director who tries to make you think that this junk is worth buying. <br /> <br /> Laughing.
