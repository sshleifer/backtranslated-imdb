It's hard that I feel the need to write reviews on this website. But this movie deserves a lot because it has been created, how bad it is, and how it is prejudiced against my product. <br /> <br /> I feel clearly trying. Part of the filmmakers to show the Palestinian family that they are detained and untrustworthy We heard them talking about the sadness they felt from oppression. But this film was shot and arranged in the way that we felt that the people who were politically enslaved were Israeli Jewish populations We do not see any evidence that is consistent with the position of Palestinian teenagers. We only hear from other Palestinians who are in prison. I understand that there are limitations, but the political nature of the restrictions is designed to prevent peace. <br /> <br /> I came out of this movie, feeling that the victim's mother was selfish. In mourning Because of the side of the fence, she said She is still reluctant to see the pain from the bomber parents and her angry and narrow-minded words make the last meeting keep the thread out of control. In my opinion, there is more reason to see the idea of ​​Israel as the cause of the problem. Refrain from pleading for understanding and freedom. Ignore requests to acknowledge the process by which the Jewish population has come to the land. <br /> <br /> I gave this to two people because of the mother's selfish weakness which normally Will Admirable in the documentary But in terms of lack of fairness, it seems to take advantage of In addition, for the poor correction, lack of background in the event that actually happened and eventually lacked the proper representation of the Palestinian side. Finally, it's a bad documentary and a bad movie. I acknowledge that this is part of the outcome of the political situation. But has the duty to observe the defects in the right direction, regardless of the topic that makes the heart beating hard and sad
