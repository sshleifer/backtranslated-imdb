This is not the worst movie I've ever seen. But I can't really remember when I saw the movie that was worse. I think it's probably about investigating an airplane accident. The real thing is soap operas and one thing that is not good. They overplayed the cards 'conflict' to the extreme. The first hour or more seems to be a competition that shouts with unbelievable scenes. <br /> <br /> * Possible spoilers * <br /> <br /> The 'memorial' scene is about 40 minutes ((with black umbrellas and rain necessary) for victims of mistakes, being lame and me. Think that it will never end. <br /> <br /> Avoid This is not only cost unless you enjoy. 'Conflict' <br /> <br />
