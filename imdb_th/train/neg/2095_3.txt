Battlestar Gallactica is great because it has a strong writing, good looks, excellent actors and interesting stories ... and yes, there are hot men and women running in and out of the uniform. <br /> <br / > Caprica is lazy, lazy, writing Actors smoke in the storm so they have an "outdoor" sequence that destroys the feeling of being somewhere else. (Yes, that is Ford Focus sitting in the back). Many teenagers and suffering. Many naked women are fervently (But in the background which I'm sure will be cut from the series) and the token view of some men in the towel There are no actors except Polly Walker who are interested in the other half an hour. I still wonder when it will end. <br /> <br /> So what should bring me back? Science fiction is very light. Actors? In addition to the good turns of Polly Walker, there are also many interesting things. There is not even a "gangster" in the show, except maybe Esai. Although in the younger series, he is quite old because he is 25 years old. <br /> <br /> I love BSG. I wonder when I hear about Caprica. And unfortunately I thought I was right I predicted to run as a short set unless they sharpened their pencil at SciFi and worked to create this thing more than The OC on another planet.
