Will they create movies without nudity and sex? This happened at 3:00 am on Sunday afternoon and I didn't want to believe what they were doing. Thank God that my son is outside or I will be strangled if he sees soft / medium porn! People who do movies don't care about people who break the law or not. Children can watch behind the church and that's what they show ??? !!! The performance was good and I enjoyed waiting. But GEE! With violence and bad people But expecting to get in the western movie, Randy Travis is very good in his role. If writers, directors and producers just stop wearing the sex scene What will happen for them to stop in that direction? Where can I complain?
