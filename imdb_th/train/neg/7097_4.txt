This movie has a low price, an unstoppable level B in every scene, effects, etc. to make you think that they spend 80% budget on Connery. It's like watching the Wing Commander things after Star. Wars (other than content) <br /> <br /> Can explain the story in one word: FLAT and Oh my God, I can't remember that the villain wasn't so interesting for a long time. We didn't reason that he was evil. (Being a flaw in us will lead to thinking :) or his true wickedness or conviction. <br /> <br /> If you go out for rent, rent `Hunting Forrester '
