It's rare that I find this movie scary, annoying and annoying. No doubt it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Plot when it's not blurred in the confusion and absurdity of flashy editing. Why does Domino become a terrible bitch? Because her goldfish died when she was a child and this "wound" event caused her to dwarf her heart and hate everyone When the conversation is not a clich√© or repetition, it is strewn with ridiculous lines such as: "There are three types of people in this world: rich people ... poor people ... and others." At one point, bounty hunters have men. Some people are tied to the back of their bus with numbers, tattooing together on his arm. Because the mobile phone is confusing, instead of turning his arms up and reading the numbers, they explode with a shotgun. At another point, the bounty hunter brings a bomb to a meeting with the mafia and threatens to drop a bomb unless the mafia Will let them go!? Obviously, not being able to attend the meeting may be too easy. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley is unbelievable and gruesome. Mickey Rourke manages to save the trust of this mess. <br /> <br /> I am happy with Tony Scott's previous movie, True Romance. Made by a complete idiot
