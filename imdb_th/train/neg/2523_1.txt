R O B O T J O X <br /> <br /> Burn the boss <br /> <br /> Awesome. <br /> <br /> Endless. No closing. <br /> <br /> The worst movie ever created and the most. <br /> <br /> Instead of "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" is the worst movie ever. > <br /> I hate things that are not resolved, not modified, not directed, not directed, something called "Robot Jox" - and I just discovered - they made one of two! ! I apologize to Adma Sandler (Zohar the Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) who hated their movies. The chaos of this thing makes those movies very bad - not scary and scary like this. This is the only movie I ever said about this - take it out of NETFLIX - now !!! 10,000 out of 10 people think this comment is useful.
