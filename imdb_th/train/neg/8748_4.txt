It's interesting to see that the correctness of the writing is just a flashy statement. But still naive in the business world The Ministry of Justice will capture more giant corps if they do innocent things to win. The real business world is becoming more and more interesting. I really doubt that any corp will kill someone directly. Although the modifier is more indirect than today In the real world, they kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, toxins, etc. This movie must be developed by the garage garage. I think They want something to take advantage of Microsoft's antitrust case in the news.
