The words "Swedish" and "action movies" do not mix together more clearly every time a game is made. This is another failed attempt. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works at an air base with a top-secret computer system. One day, foreign criminals threatened to hurt his family if he didn't do what they said. They need a secret device and will do everything to get it. <br /> <br /> This movie has both ups and downs. And in general, in Swedish action movies, there is no "ups" just "down", so I think some things in this movie are of quality In order to start with positive words, I can mention that movies are made technically good. Pictures of planes and helicopters are flying well and look very good. The performances are of a very different quality. Shanti Roney did a good job while Maria Bonnevie was stiff and strange as usual. (I wonder how long the Swedish committee will use her, even if she has the skills of acting on wood. Stefan Sauk laughs as a special "cool" force that comes to the base to investigate. <br /> <br /> What about the action scenes? As I said above, the plane and helicopter scenes are flying well. But other than that there is no mention of And that is a common problem with Swedish action movies There is not enough action. May be a budget issue But it may be a movie-making culture. I don't know, but it has a negative effect on the experience. Because it is quite straightforward, the story and performance are not good enough for this movie that has to rely on that story. <br /> <br /> I gave this score 4/10 for the effort.
