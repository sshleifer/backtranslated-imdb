No one reads the script. This must be the worst writing and directing throughout the year. Three great actors Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson couldn't pull this out. About two-thirds, it seems that Giamatti's eyes are saying that I can't believe I signed a contract. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen. But it is on the list of terrible Christmas movies with insufficient lines But can say anything Ok, this movie doesn't move along with Vaughan's dialogue. His character is just a creepy guy that you can't get past. It is just a walk through the lack of clarity, which seems like no one can enter.
