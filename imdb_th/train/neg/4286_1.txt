This is Jason Scott Lee's first movie I've seen. I can speak quite well because I've seen the soldiers he plays as villains ... but from what I heard it was not considered a movie Jason Scott Lee. And if this is an indication of the quality of those movies, I will not see anyone else. Basically, Lee is a martial arts artist ... As a leader, he is scary. He struggled with random characters without names every few minutes of the movie, probably because the playwright couldn't figure out how to extend the movie to as little as possible for the movie The villain is the only character that indicates the personality and apart from the fact that he is crazy like crazy, he almost seems like a villain. The majority of this film is Lee chasing the villains all the time ... or maybe another way. I can not say for sure ... and I will not look again for sure. The effect is not terrible ... but it's close. This name comes from the popular concept of using the Time Machine to kill Hitler. Anyway, the movie also creates interesting ideas as well. The story is too complicated for your own goodness. Walking badly I can't think of a good thing to say about this movie ... I can't really do it. It's too easy to be formulated and pointless. If only I had a time machine, I could go back and prevent this film from being created ... No matter, I just hope that only a few fragile minds will get this. can do Listen to negative reviewers Avoid this turkey. I recommend this to Lee's fans and no one else. If you are looking for a quality movie that is definitely 1/10
