Wow, this is the worst movie ever. The only reason I subscribed to IMDb is that I can complain about this movie. I never walked out of the cinema or stopped the DVD, but I almost stopped this one. (And I should have) but I watched it to the end just to get down again with a terrifying ending Wow, if all of this is what we want his time to be longer I have never seen the first one and will never look after this. It acts very badly with a terrible plot. Hey, it looks like someone is looking at the mirror. Let us try. And the sad part is that when this movie comes to the DVD, it is completely examined at Blockbuster Forever. So I feel bad for everyone who sees this garbage.
