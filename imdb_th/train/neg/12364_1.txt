God, I'm bored with shit that comes out of America called "cartoons"! <br /> <br /> Since the anime became popular, animation in the US produced 5-year-old lazy cartoon, drawing style (kappa) or Japanese animation at Pull out (Usually confusing classic characters) is not surprising that anime is dancing American comics! <br /> <br /> They don't try anymore! <br /> <br /> Oh, I just heard about it last night. I live in the UK and when I found out that this show came out for the first time in 2005, well, I never knew that the UK was modern with the current show
