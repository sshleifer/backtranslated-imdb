One of the movies "Coming to Age" that should have nostalgia for adults and promises to children. It's a bad excuse to let Sylvia Kristel's body be fun with Eric Brown. To make matters worse, this movie may look silly or stupid when trying to be funny, sexy or amazing. Laughing awkwardly as we should believe that a teenager would go alone by burying a woman who died in his front yard Seriously pondering why famous women for Emmanuel need a double body. When the movie continued, I began to imagine the hybrid of private lessons and the Little Miss Millions that Sylvia Kristel persuaded Jennifer Love Hewitt because Howard Hessman made We miss WKRP. Look at this to laugh at other people 's stupidity or for Ed Beckley Jr.' s strenuous acting or wondering what Sylvia Christel will do with Jennifer Love Hewitt I can give ideas About your lesson, stay away from the movie staring Sylvia Kristel, not Emmanuelle
