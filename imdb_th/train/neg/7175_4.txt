This may come from historical events, and we know that the creators of this TV documentary use more freedom of acting - I can live with it - but it is so bad! I was amazed in the event of a mid-air crisis that seemed like everyone was calm. Sure, someone would panic and a smooth flight without passengers feeling uncomfortable - come in! Not sure about current regulations. Some airline safety seems ridiculous. OTT But why take your shoes off before landing emergency? Common sense tells me that this is not a good idea! The image of this large plane came down on this remote airport, unbelievable and fake. In fact, it will be a wonderful image that looks from the nearby ground in this film. It's not proportional and it looks like it's a model. The escape slide appears at the front and middle emergency doors. But no one left the front, even though there was much less water droplets The captain returned to the plane after landing - why? This thing never explained We know that emergency landing is caused by refueling. Still, it must be fueled around the bottom of the tank and the risk of explosion will be very real danger. But evacuation seems inconvenient And everyone standing around the slide, instead of fleeing as far as possible, because I'm sure I had to do There are inconsistencies, errors and too many deceptive actions in this matter. I want to see the representation of the drama in real time and with the realistic movement of the plane. It has the potential to be exciting. But without a doubt that due to budget constraints, failing and causing the feeling that the aircraft lost all engines is not a big deal, and you will land into the pit The real danger! - The reality is definitely different!
