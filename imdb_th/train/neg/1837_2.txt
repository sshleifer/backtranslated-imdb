I agree that I like a lot of "frat-pack" movies. No matter how bad they are, I can find something I like about Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn or Will Ferrell or Jack Black. But "jealous" left me. As cold as the white horse that Ben left This time it was Ben and Jack Black as two neighbors, one of which (Black) discovered the aerosol spray to make the animal poop disappear. But it changed in a different direction that was not really reasonable. <br /> <br /> I guess that 'Vapoorize' is funny at first. The problem is that they try to silence the whole image. (Black has a license plate that reads 'Caca King') and it's boring. But even Ben and Jack still can't use it Energy levels for both of them appear to be significantly reduced. Two of the best performances are Rachel Weisz and Chris Walken. Walken's neo-Hippie guy is unusual and has adapted the show so well that it never introduces other familiar characters from Walken. Unique identity But found that Walken was not distorted and Weisz was a great actress in a business that no one knew She still dominates every scene that she enters. <br /> <br /> The scene is called Ben in the drunken, drunken, drunk and accidentally shot Jack's white horse. Went to a ridiculous length to conceal it, fearing his best friend would search and cut him to death But the plot is unbelievable because there is nothing about Jack's character to indicate that he will do that. He plays a cute person who makes the horse chase both void and void. You completely discount the price for it. It is all fillers. And what is the point of joy outside of control, except that Barry Levinson wants us to know that he sees "Stranger on the train"? The screenplay was badly painful and the performances of both men led to bad governance. People with Levinson's history should know better. Maybe someone will invent something to make the film disappear. Oh wait, they already have
