Funny that I found myself forced to watch this movie, but here I <br /> <br /> I'm criticizing because recently I had the opportunity to see the revival of the drama RC. Sheriff's "Journey's End" on stage in New York at Belasco Theater, starring Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, including the directing by David Grindley. <br /> <br /> I'm leaving the theater. I'm not exaggerating. I feel baffled. After nearly two and a half hours of military military life lectures in the trenches of the Somme (I predicted) during the First World War, life was enlivened by everyone involved. I came out of the theater with trembling. <br /> <br /> Be careful of you. I'm not shocked. Easy or I'm too sensitive. I am an actor on stage and a director myself so I know that the button is pressed to get some emotional and psychological effects. <br /> <br /> But what I just saw Came to live a lot That I had chills in my spine while I was away. <br /> <br /> These emotions do not come to life while watching "Aces High", a movie created from this drama and adapted to the face. Screen with cooperation with RC. Shortly before he died, the sheriff himself <br /> <br /> Screen adjustments took place in the sky above France. So what is missing is an awkward atmosphere that begins with <br /> <br /> The only positive thing about the movie is the air fight scene that looks old in a special way compared to today's standards. The flight strategy used on the screen <br /> <br /> Received a screen adjustment of "All Quiet on the Western Front" by Erich Maria Remarque, which occurred in the trenches and not in the sky. But that is the "German" vision of things. If anyone wants to be choosy with things, <br /> <br /> "The journey of the end" is just the other side of the coin and will turn it into Great movie if they leave it alone and unharmed. <br /> <br /> DVD transfer is not good, even though in Widescreen and adapted to fit the 16: 9 TV screen. The quality of the movie is of the factory. Movies. Nothing more, no less than this. It has various flaws, such as minor scratches and spots, even if the rest are clean. <br /> <br /> If you want another WWI movie in your collection, especially for those who love And enjoy watching Air combat among the timer, then this is the picture for you. But I would like to recommend "Von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, even if it is a movie that is full of inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> For others who love acting and good drama, I will Going out, buy, play, watch, play if you have a chance to get a good revival near you. But do not let this be a matter of adaptation. <br /> <br /> It's a war film that has been received. But the weakest point I have never seen before in my life. <br /> <br /> The presence of actors such as Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud is just a bluff because they see in a very weak and a lot of roles. In a short movie, <br /> <br /> McDowell, the talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth all performed very weak performances, not because of lack of skills. But because of lack of truth <br /> <br /> There are too many spaces and as mentioned earlier, it dragged itself to the utmost suspicion. Suspicious, because in the original play, no man we know and sympathize with is alive. They were killed in a dangerous and useless mission. In the movie, everyone must die, except Malcolm McDowell, who manages to survive the other day, is the unfortunate wing commander of the group, just to get three other pilots to fly and die for the missing reason. <br /> <br /> The end of playing out of the empty stage in total darkness You've just heard the roar of the cannon, the machine gun sound, and the explosions sounding throughout the theater. Then, suddenly, peace and tranquility, including a curtain of fire, and here all of them Stand together straight and hard The obedient corpse ... <br /> <br /> More interesting and shocking than the ending "Aces High", which was dragged by. <br /> <br /> It's up to you to judge. <br /> <br /> For me, if I have money and contacts, I will try and develop it as intended. Add action scenes here and there to see the horror and murder "outside" that occurred in "The vast, nasty field of France" around the men involved But after that, paying attention to what happened strictly. <br /> <br /> Want this movie? <br /> <br /> Then ask it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This can't be
