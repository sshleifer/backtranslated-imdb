The original is a relaxing clock with a truly memorable animation sequence. Unfortunately, the sequels, while the sequels of DTV are not the most sparkling. <br /> <br /> The biggest decline is the lack of stories like Bell's Magical World. The characters are told. Through the Magical World flak while slightly better But still makes the story messy During that short article, we saw mice working and, personally, I think that the jokes of Jaq and Gus are the advantages of this movie. <br /> <br /> The first article is the best about Cinderella being a princess This is the best thing because I am the most fun. Here are the worst vignettes when Jaq becomes a cute human sometimes. But lack imagination The last article when Anastasia falls in love is also cute. The problem is that I can't imagine Anastasia being friendly to Cinderella while I consider her to be a villain. This thing was also destroyed by a ridiculous subplot about Lucifer who fell in love with PomPom. <br /> <br /> Miscellaneous songs are very pleasant to listen to. But I hate music. They don't really care. The beautiful Tchaikovsky inspires the original melody. <br /> <br /> The character is the strongest development here. Cinderella, while still caring for her, lost many of her sincerity and charm from the original, although she wore a beautiful dress. Duke had a really funny time, but they weren't enough to record a movie. Like Prudence and Raja, as I said, I am the advantage of exchanging movies because they contribute to the cuteness of movies. I must say that the animation is colorful and above average, and the voice acting is surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> Overall, cute. If it was a sequel that didn't have before. 4/10 stories for the mouse, voice-overs, animation and beautiful dresses. Bethany Cox
