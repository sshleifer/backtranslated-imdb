A group of women who cannot sit and talk to smoke They have another woman in a wheelchair hidden because of her disability and sometimes they kill one person to feed this human flesh, which looks like a real ham bought from a store. We do not see them killing anyone immediately. There is a body on the floor covered with blood. I can't eat spam sheets anymore because of this. Just the idea of ​​concealing spam by a worksheet is enough to stimulate the sharp style as it happened by trying to pass all of this movie. Sometimes there is a random insertion scene of men who "hunt" them by torturing some men he bound to a chair, his basement. Why did he capture this man and the way he connected with Sit-Sister Sister? There are also scenes of men "human". Some people are crazy about. He drilled blood and penetrated the wall. But who he is or what is wrong with him will not be explained or tied to the story. <br /> <br /> No action, no matter if you want to see boring people, talk deeply about the story. Nonsense while sitting and eating ham and smoking this for 90 minutes because that except for the scene where a chicks are on the corner of the street. Random scenes do not happen. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot. You will see them moving some things, including the disabled sister when they move to their new apartment. One of the few times that they didn't sit on the couch or lie in bed.
