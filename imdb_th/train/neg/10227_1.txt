This is a tedious story about a man who is married to escape the executioner's snare and then set up a "tame" of his reluctant bride. It will be a sexist and racist at the same time. For example, we never know why women who are respected by Indian warriors cannot completely fight against their past husbands. Or why her team members are so eager to get "real people" in the saddles when she seems to be caring for things by herself. This is just a feeling in the fifties only at Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There is a very stupid scene where she cares about him and he whips a real whip. Never mind that the first time he might make him lose his eyes, which makes it hard to grab that whip! He then won the fight with her Indian bodyguard, which he spent the first two-thirds of the attack on the pulp. That is the second wind Later, he succeeded in negotiating with the bloodthirsty Indians. Never mind that he has no diplomatic skills at all, and she is negotiating with them for many years. And the way he refused, she tried to persuade him just to keep her enthusiasm and keep her from being caught - yes, right, like a woman throwing him at him all the way. <br /> <br /> Finally Then the two leaders didn't believe in their role. Madison is just a jerk that gets unrealistic luck. Fleming flipped her hair and scowled a lot. But unbelievable like a flaming tomboy The only reason you take root is because she wants to see Madison tied to a horse running away and dragging on a cliff before the movie ends. The way that Madison makes Fleming tame is predictable and there are very few obstacles that will make you impulsive if you see a woman in addition to a doll that explodes. Even if you see them as dolls But the lack of all doubt will make you bored. <br /> <br /> Wasting all time Even the boring scenery To miss this great
