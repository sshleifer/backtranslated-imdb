What we have here is a movie about the pursuit of money and vengeance can destroy your mind ... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, a director known as reworking of his gangster type, bites more than that. He can chew with this story. <br /> <br /> Noir use of modern movies. Swallowing his pride, being good for his enemies and giving all his money to the face When Jason Statham's character is not afraid of Ray Liotta anymore, it looks like it will drive Liotta crazy enough to shake his head in the final scene. Why? Essentially, you can't set up mafia, such as the character Liotta, which has come into his life by showing brutal behavior that is evident in this movie. Only then will he drive a suicide without much further. Than a grateful smile The face of the character of Statham. <br /> <br /> Before anyone starts saying that I don't have a point ... I can't. I understand, right? Choose not to seek riches and you will find true happiness and inner peace. Be good to your enemies and this will confuse him in self-destruction. This seems to be an important part of the film and in itself, this is not a bad evidence for the story, even if it is almost original. The problem is that Ritchie doesn't have the skills to become a filmmaker. While Guy Ritchie was aware of this, he seemed to be bored with the story and began to insert stray birds: the scene in which Statham was hit by a car - why? The filming of various scenes is another animated anime ... Why <br /> <br /> There are many loose topics and unanswered questions left at the end of movie Try to find answers or accept that there are no answers and each audience will interpret things in their own way. I was bored with the tone of the movie that caused me not to care. Frankly, the ending could not come too soon so I wouldn't have to listen to the terrifying Psychobabble anymore. <br /> <br /> Spend two hours in my life.
