Actually, this is a terrible movie. The ideology is not as distorted as the movie Collins created later. However, my main concern about this film is that it's been unbelievable and boring for a long time. The whole concept of a former SAS man who joined the terrorists without reason is very unbelievable and you can't help wondering why a highly organized terrorist group. This movie begins with a powerful scene. But after that, I was crooked for a long time to create a great final scene. Overall, I think who dares to win may be an interesting episode of the expert 45 minutes, but the story doesn't have a documentary. Although reasonably successful at the time of the film's start, Collins's death career, which was in the eighty years of age, mostly made movies, soldiers or fortune or army movies, cheap and suspicious. Then he is a talented actor But at the end of the day, Martin Shaw chooses his role more carefully and has a successful career.
