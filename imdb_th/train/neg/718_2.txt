The main reason people still care about "Carlton-Browne Of The F.O." is that it has Peter Sellers qualification in the second billing role. But watching this movie to see Peter Sellers is a mistake. <br /> <br /> Sellers play Amphibulos, the premier, vague reptile of the poor island nation of Gaillardia, who had been a British colony. Excavator during the Cold War Amphibians want to play in both the US and the Soviet Union, providing mutual benefits for easy profits. "Everything is friendly and all our cards under the table" Terry-Thomas is a character named the lazy British diplomat who is worried about showing Gaillardia that Great Britain did not forget they appeared on the other hand. <br /> <br /> Positive reviews here say: "The reason for this movie Considered to be normal because it is an understated comedy. "I will confirm that the reason" Carlton-Brown "is lower than the average because the comedy doesn't exist. <br /> <br /> After opening The good character that created only two strengths of the movie Terry Thomas And John Addison's full score is full of fun, causing things to slow down quickly to become a slow burning story and gags. Carlton-Brown's low opinion by his chief and ambiguity Of Gaillardia (Which no one can find on the map) is milked to death When we arrived at the island (After the comedy broadcast) Low expectations. <br /> <br /> They are still too high. The island itself, which seems to have existed in Latin America or the Mediterranean Sea, is so pathetic that the honorable forces at the airport and the checkpoints are separated into the middle of the parade. Obviously, the army is still a drag horse, making another announcer say "In the war, the army used a lot of horses." <br /> <br /> Sellers never used the center stage even when we were 'on the island of his character. The plot was taken over by Ian Bannen as King Loris, who inherited the throne of Gaillardia after his father's assassination. Bannan is boring and plays a role that is written. Usually this will make him more likely to be the target for image theft by the seller. But stuck behind a thick and greasy mustache, the seller is only a threat to us who remembered him happily in two other films made in the same year "The Mouse That Roared" and "I ' m All Right, Jack. "<br /> <br /> Strange that this movie, like" Jack ", is the production of the Boulting Brothers, with Roy Boulting acting as co-director with Jeffrey Dell. Boulting will incorporate a social satire The joke, but here are just extremism in either direction only works Amphibulos English flair to his value. ("How is this man, you say the cow in the Chinese boat") While Carlton-Brown often feels bad about him than he deserves. <br /> <br /> Elements The weakest and most protracted of the film is the love of the young Loris and Ilyena, scoring one point for her performance by Luciana Paluzzi, which is an interesting berth because they are relatives that have never been mentioned. <br /> <br /> Movie This ended with a revolutionary scene that was surprisingly detailed. And the last action of Carlton-Brown, who seemed to be truly hammering his coffin Obviously he lives to see another day. But movies with the same name are strictly Department of Agriculture.
