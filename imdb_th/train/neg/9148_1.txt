I'm watching Imdbs bottom 100 because I think id never saw anything bad as planned 9 from outerspace or Roller Ball remake. I'm wrong. Ben and Artur both win. <br /> <br /> From the movie The countless numbers I've seen are my number one worst movie. Bad governance, bad characters, horrible performances, scary stories. There is no reason why Sam never said anything positive about this movie. Sam is an annoying actor. But his governance is terrible. He may overthrow Ed Ed. <br /> <br /> The director should be ashamed of his work. Unfortunately, I have to give at least 1 star, but it's reasonable - it's a continuous star.
