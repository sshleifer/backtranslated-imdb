As a filmmaker himself and with a somewhat gloomy and subversive humor, I thought I was in treatment when I went home. "My mistake ..." (not what DVDs give, instead of being ambiguous Quote from director Chris Morris "Short films, including scenes") I should really know better and avoid twoddle parts (and often nasty) <br /> <br /> Scenes in Chris The church is disgusting to watch. (Especially since we are all familiar Indecent from his famous television series, Brass Eye) and does not have any other purpose except to be shocked This film is labeled as a joke that I won't understand. <br /> <br /> The runners' explanation seems like a new idea in principle. (Being a runner yourself, it is often an interesting perspective. However, this is not a sad case here. But we are treated to some public school students who rant in the movie before concluding that there are no great movies starring dogs. All of this is very interesting, but not worth it with a single frame celluloid. <br /> <br /> If you say that this movie goes somewhere, don't have to say anything. It relies on a style that has too much originality, hard, with the cost of planning, characters and conversations, causing the audience to be surprised and unnatural. The message that exceeds the simplicity of it - the man should be responsible for his actions - both clear, clear, and ill-mannered. <br /> <br /> This film has a period of deceptive surrealism - Kafasa. For entertainment to clarify and end with annoyance If you want to see a great short film creation, I recommend "Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life" by Peter Capaldi.
