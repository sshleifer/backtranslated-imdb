I will make it short and sweet .... This movie is suck !!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched episode 1 earlier today and thought it was one of those movies. The greatest ever that has been 9 out of 10 stars. So I think episodes 2 and 3 may be a good sequel. I was wrong. This movie makes me die and is different from the first episode. It has a plot. Continue and that is. It's like a bad scene from one part or something. <br /> <br /> I love Walken, but I feel sorry for him here. I am very happy about Glenn Dan Zig in this movie. But don't blink, you will miss him. There are actors full of crappy actors and people I don't like, such as Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it's a pure air that sees Ethan Embry. He is one of the most fun people in the world. <br /> <br / > This movie will make you like the first person less, so don't watch Because you feel like you owe yourself to being a big fan of Episode 1, I'll wait a few days before I watch episode 3 and I pray for it better than this shit. <br /> <br /> Scene The last of The movie with lightning is one of the most beautiful things that ever appeared in the movie. Fast forward or skip if you can't close the first part. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars - this is terrible!
