Warning for promising audiences: If you are looking for a classic story adaptation "The Most Dangerous Game", see elsewhere "Seven Women for Satan" <br /> <br /> Just speak superficially with the original work using Zaroff's name and say that someone killed the character br /> Some of the following may be considered by some people. <br /> <br /> Boris Zaroff is played by writer / director Michel Lemoine while his ancestors chase men because they are the only victims who truly challenge the victims. Boris is often in a position where they cannot protect themselves. This film shook every scene without almost all clarity. It seems that the director has completely spaced out and left the audience with boring movies. Each scene is a little interesting. (Such as the torture scene sequence) but as a film unit failed to entertain interested audiences <br /> <br /> More than a charming and semi-charming actress in different stages of Undress may find that this movie can be viewed. Most will find that their time is better than watching Mentos ads. <br /> <br /> In one note, the DVD has a lot of information about the history of the movie. Obviously it had been banned for many years in the native France, which was quite frustrating for any opportunity that was widely distributed.
