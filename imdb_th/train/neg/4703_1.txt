"Show your breasts!" Is not a joke and certainly not in the box that shows cartoons if you understand where I come from. I don't want a daughter aged 6 and 7 years to think like that or hear that. I think it's sad that Nick is hypnotized by this monster. That's what we get. A small, stupid boy who acts like a fool. But imagine that we have a cute, sweet little girl at K and grade 1, which can't wait to see this. I have to comment how much I was disappointed when I saw it. My daughter won't watch it. I like to block Nick, but I don't have a heart at this point. But if Nick still has this kind of shit, I have to do it.
