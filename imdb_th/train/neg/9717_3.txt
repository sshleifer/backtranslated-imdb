The thriller is clearly seen by numbers, which is possible only the possible twist is to hide anything. I watched primarily for the English performance by Isabelle Huppert. It wasn't good, but then it was a strange role. I was not surprised if half of her support became left on the floor, along with many of the last minute rewrites. <br /> <br /> The performance is the least interesting thing about. With this movie. Steve Guttenburg looks like he's trying to pull out his role with the charm that everyone tells him he has There is a reasonably stupid sequence that suggests that his sexual prowess will be able to maintain PTSD. It is an unbelievable performance. Elizabeth McGovern is a drawing that attracts genuine charm and personality more than 3/10
