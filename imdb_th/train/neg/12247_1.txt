This movie is really scary. It's terrible because it wastes 84 minutes of your life. Special effects are very scary. Unbelievable performances <br /> <br /> It's about crocodiles that attack tourists who watch because they're filming a documentary about "Blood surfing". Blood surfing is when they surf around sharks, but it turns out to be a mistake when a 31-foot crocodile interrupts a holiday Sharks don't look real. The crocodile is even worse, and it is more pathetic when they run away from living things. But the crocodile was stuck and two women jumped into it Death is a fake, and the pirates must fill up in time. <br /> <br /> Movies that are pointless and scary are not worth watching !!
