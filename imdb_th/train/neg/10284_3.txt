After seeing the man behind the sun, I think I hope to evolve in style and technique to match this movie. I am also interested in seeing someone create a fictional account based on the difficult facts about what happened during the most famous period of Japanese cruelty. But this is not the case This plays like a European movie, the lower-to-middle Nazi exploitation of the 70s - such as the SS Experiment Camp, etc. (probably like a woman who was deported in a really special category). Running around, but it turned out to be a cheap and unmanned device, as well as many unlucky actors who fell into disguised gunfire The horrifying documentary that has been accepted has been roughly edited between scenes, so even these real images are still robbed by their power. See 'The Holocaust' (recently broadcasted) (Still running), as of day 1, issue 2006) for a document that is truly annoying about the wickedness of the war (Great story, using the actual context of the real movie) This is the type of horrible treatment of Nanjing. Don't deserve this kind of garbage. (Movies that perform better exploitation, negative by using impolite stock images But it is not like that again. Score: 3 (5 is the pursuit of benefits 1 is the treatment of the story)
