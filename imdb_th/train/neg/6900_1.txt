I'm just sitting in a boring theater like hell. I want to go halfway through the movie. Synopsis is easy. 4 Samoan wedding So they have to bring dating in order to get into the wedding. Yawning <br /> <br /> The thing that annoyed me the most is the raw joke called ... They are UNfunny, clich√©d and thrown Come into your face to get you into a boring movie. The performances are below average and I feel that this movie has just been released. Nothing but unexpected jokes and predictable plot <br /> <br /> All of this is one. In the worst movie I have ever seen in 2006, bad actions are not ugly, ugly. <br /> <br /> Thank God that my friend shouted. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
