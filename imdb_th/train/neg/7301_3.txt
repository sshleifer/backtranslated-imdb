There is a significant difference between traditional release, violence, modernity of seats, cold-blooded horror and doing, like filmmaker Eli Roth and his team, working with "Cabin Fever" and acting like it. This film graduated with five college degrees in a cabin in the forest which began to prove life threatening after another had suffered with a mysterious, fast-acting disease and eating meat. Shortly before the friends opened and could hardly see each other, very little wanted to be in the same area with them. As everyone sounds, there is some sparkle behind the basic evidence of this movie that will work in the hands of a little cocky filmmaker. Unfortunately, what we ultimately end up with is a poorly drawn character whose sole purpose seems to look beautiful at the beginning to make the inevitable disintegration more controversial. A sub-plan that inspires more than one director Roth. This is a movie that is sloppy in many ways! Avoid swallowing this time.
