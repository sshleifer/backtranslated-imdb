The plot doesn't have exciting new things. But it started like a cube I. At this time, there are no other improvements for cube machines, except for having a special solution that is not very protected and ingenious. The characters are not as detailed as they were at first. They become "flat" like in the drama. <br /> <br /> If someone makes it normal, that person will be asked questions like "Do you believe in God?" Is not creative or original, especially in my opinion. With the mystery of the cube with traps Really nothing much to say about it
