This is a classic case of something that shouldn't happen. Gloria is now the only mother. Her husband left her because she wasn't with him. (He was angry that Reagan was chosen and wanted to turn his back on the society.) At that time, and there I had a problem with the series - come and go. The right of Archie Bunker or The series continues But it doesn't have a pizazz. Regardless, Sally Struthers' motivation received from the whole family will be long gone. Maybe if the series received another name and offered that it was free from All In The Family, it might work. Um, that's a show business.
