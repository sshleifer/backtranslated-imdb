I began to see patterns in movies that I gave 1 to them, as almost all movies my wife made me watch. Maybe I should stop believing in her taste in the movie. However, this is a general drift aimed at pre-teens. But can do worse than usual Again, the writers break the important rules of any movie. He / she makes the main character dislike. She started out as a b * tch for her friends from the beginning and then discovered that when she was 30 years old, she was a stubborn person. Why do we feel this person? Okay, let's say we can get through. Jennifer Garner is far from being as attractive as you can without any irregularities. I do not know whether it is her fault or that of the writer. But her character goes well beyond my limits for annoyance Here are some tips for future filmmakers: 13 year olds don't have fun. They are annoying. Far and away, the most embarrassing moment in the movie came when they danced with "Thriller", a painful holy shit. It shows that she practiced dance at the beginning. That explains why she knows But the whole club is full of people! Oh !!! Macarena is more reliable! Suddenly she was completely incompetent and no clue in the work and no one noticed? At least Tom Hank's character in "Big" has a job suitable for children. Changing the body / kids into an overnight movie for adults is really free from the hand, and this is the worst thing.
