In making movies about the end of the world, there should be facts and realism. 1. We have never been told why these people believe this. 2. The place is New Year's Eve in Toronto, Canada. So please tell someone why they still show up at MIDNIGHT & WHY (depending on the costume). They seem to be the same. <br /> <br /> 3 performances in Neo-U style - Natural that needs a director who knows how to do <br /> <br /> 4 stories, each subject But boring and without purpose, I can, but I do not want to make this story boring like a movie. <br /> <br /> Rate * 1/2 (from 4) 2 at the IMDB level. <br /> <br /> Thank you so. <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSSMAN
