I just watched "El Otro". I often took off my hat from Julio Ochavez's performance because he was a great actor. But this movie is depressing and very slow I guess it would be worse if not for Julio. However, this is a movie that you will not understand if you are not from Argentina and even if you are I suggest you do not rent this movie in order to have a good time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends .. It is incredibly depressing and slow and the plot is not reasonable. The director may want to show the vulnerability of human life. But what he does is bored and impresses the audience with a scene that makes you a bit shocked. It gives you an idea But not in a good way Overall, I don't really like this movie.
