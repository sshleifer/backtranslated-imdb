I've used Wesley Snipes's name as a clue to go ahead and watch a new movie that has not yet been tried, which he has appeared So now, for the first time, the movie advice of Snipes-Method So I failed fully. I should come here first to see these reviews. <br /> <br /> Snipes should be ashamed to allow his serious effort to be wasted on "contractors". <Br /> <br /> One of my worst fears has arrived. I am afraid that the form of governance and correction "Shaky, blurry," not seen "(no one has ever been interested in by Paul Greengrass, directed by" Bloody Sunday "). The abominable form of Greengass brought in new heights incessantly in Bond's final trilogy. My fear has arrived. In my opinion, these movies are not really good by the method of motion-inducing these movements, which are blurry, swipes for "action enhancement" but "Bourne Franchise" as a beloved Greengrass. His cash cow seemed to convince other people in Hollywood that he was not a professional in seeking quick money. <br /> <br /> Read my lips. Action must be taken and presented clearly not only But indicative of poor and lazy cinematography techniques <br /> <br /> and "contractors" to imitate "The Bourne Ultimatum" in a repetitive sound With the hope that their audience (Which has been clearly evaluated) will not feel them For example, if I hear the police radio crackling "Yankee-Romeo" again, I'll scream. Good opportunity. I will not hear again: Of course, I will never see "contractor" again. <br /> <br /> I suggest you that have not seen. "Contractor": Just be satisfied with the quietness that this lack of your life. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10; I was tempted to downgrade to 1
