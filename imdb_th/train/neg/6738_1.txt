There are many movies that use the same theme. The only cute girl wants a handsome boy to impress the past and pay him (guess what?) She falls in love. He has a mess, followed by a line before everyone gets makeup before finishing happy .... .. This has been done many times. <br /> <br /> I knew this before I started watching. However, I still look forward to In the right hand there are good actors and bright scripts. It is still a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> This is not these things. <br /> <br /> This thing < br /> <br /> A female lead lacks charm or intelligence that can't shine, even a little spark in me. I am not really interested in whether she "gets her people" or still single and unhappy. <br /> <br /> Men who are leaders who, after endless words of wisdom, I want to kill. Just to remove the pleasing appearance I have no idea that the life of a prostitute is the way to enlightenment that everyone knows. <br /> <br /> Unrealistic movies are full of unrealistic characters. It seems that there is no job at all. They all have more income than the groom's feelings that continue with his wedding after knowing that his bride is lying with his best friend .... plus "I Will miss you even if we have never met "!!!!! I can go on But I just realized that I wasted more time on this garbage ..... I can rant about introducing the character to get a very cheap laugh in the name of "Woody" but in truth it is Funny things from a distance that happened in the movie
