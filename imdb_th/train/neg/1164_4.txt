I do not know where to start, so I will start with an example from the back of the cover of this movie. "Alive combines the tension of Vincenzo Natali's Cube with Versus of Kitamura." I didn't see Versus so I couldn't give up. Seeing about that, but I think Cube is a great movie that I recommend to everyone. However, in this case someone is confused. "Tension" clearly with "boredom" <br /> <br /> I'll go ahead and destroy all the plans because besides being the sacred Swiss cheese of the plot. Cheese and this film is not worth spending time, even if you have never known this before, so it's not important. If I misunderstand the plot, don't hit me - probably because I have struggled to keep the eyelids open. <br /> <br /> So the American soldiers in Nevada lost the UFO in the Nabi desert. Obviously it was reasonable because they were of course different from each other, of course, whether they were in the same continent or not. The monkeys broke into the UFO and became aliens that were sent to Japanese researchers who had to eat monkeys. Survival in the desert, what ever now, what aliens were forwarded to everyone. "Bloodthirsty" enough to kill the current host Japanese soldiers wanted to use them for military supplies, so they decided to pass from the current host. (Researcher's daughter) to other friends, but instead of picking someone out of the army full of bloodthirsty people and by the soldiers, they decided that it would be a good idea to choose criminals. From the row of death instead Oh, and the reason they chose this crime, especially from death, is because he was the first person in history to die from an electric shock that is not dead, which is a standard method of conduct. I don't know if they do this or not, so they can giggle in the staff room how everyone dies, even if it's not serious or if they have to. The reduction in electricity bills <br /> <br /> movie is. It turns out that the Matrix would be if it was really weak and the extravagant battles made us bored with things that felt like hours. And oh wait, now they remember that they already have friends who are infected with aliens, so all the movies until now are actually a waste of time and human life Then everyone dies. <br /> <br /> Only one moment in the movie that I don't want to go out and sleep or eat a sandwich instead is when the friend is pinned to the wall by a pipe through the chest. his And he hung there and had another friend passing by Friends hanging on the wall say "I hurt, shoot me" and a friend who has a life, looks at him and it doesn't look like he's a heartless person or anything. So he looks sad and doesn't want the people on the wall to suffer. So he shot him <br /> <br /> (Paused in a rhetorical way) <br /> <br /> On the stomach "Thank you very much"
