CARRY ON MATRON was launched in 1972 and it is clear that this series has reached a natural end, with the best results, CLEO, THE KYBER and SCREAMING from mid to late 60s. <br /> <br / > Has never been just bad But we saw it earlier with a small plot (a group of needles that tried to penetrate the hospital to steal the contraceptive pills that they plan to sell to third world countries). Even a little I think that's the problem - the gags don't enjoy the uncomplicated nature that begins to show its age. Do we need another movie that uses a man dressed as a woman to drive the storyline? Perhaps the worst criticism I can do is I see Carrie on Matton this afternoon, less than twelve hours before, and I have trouble trying to remember a very funny line. That's a serious problem for comedians.
