I saw this movie when driving in 1959 until "Howard the Duck". I think this is the worst movie I've ever seen. This film tries to include all in one place. Comedy, horror, teenage concerns and hot rod that requires "my parents, my car". Perhaps it deserves to be viewed a second time to See if it is the right time or not.
