Jane Russell proved to be a musical comedian in the title "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", but sadly, this film collapses those skills. Have a good budget and Paris photography. But this movie didn't work Miss Russell seems to be playing Marilyn Monroe. That makes no one to play Jane Russell adequately Some other players are not familiar with the elements. <br /> <br /> There are many embarrassing scenes. Most have been warned: there is a musical number that African men, bones, "cook" brunettes in the pot after Alan Young sings in a gorilla suit. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting story, lose resources br /> <br /> *** Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (10/29/55) Richard Sale ~ Jane Russell, Jeanne Crain, Alan Young, Scott Brady
