I was fascinated by the badness of this movie. Should the audience learn something or reflect on here? What happened to the pumpkin? Should I be impressed with the shooting in the motel? How important is it to have a garbage bag on the roof across the hotel street? Why did the speaker mock the person he was not interviewing successfully? (Obviously he has edited the real information section of his interview for parody). The best part of this film is an interview with a film professor who tells us how bad this movie is Before the movie is finished <br /> <br /> I believe that the creators are struggling to be intellectuals or try to impress the intellectual community.
