I have to admit that Over Her Dead Body is not as bad as I expected. My mother wanted to see it, so I rented it. I just thought to go ahead and watch the horror movie in front of me. But actually it's not too bad I'm just expecting this horror movie. But it seems that the writer is not dangerous But the selection of Eva Toria's casting (Parker apologizes) She seems to be a little bit about this movie. I think I should find it better. Without you, you just annoy me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell have good chemical properties, making this film quite satisfactory. But you have to admit that there is no point in this movie, it is one of the fastest wages for the type of actor. This movie would be more fun if someone really cares about it and has a better actor. <br /> <br /> Henry just lost his bride to Kate, who was an ice figure. On their wedding day. But when his sister took him to Ashley's heart, Henry fell in love with her. But Kate haunts her from above the grave Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to move forward quickly and she will make sure that Ashley does not receive him by torturing her day and night with her millet. Believe me with Kate's voice. <br /> <br /> Over Her Dead Body is a movie. It's okay. Not sure if it's worth it? But I will give you a rent if you want to see it or be curious. Eva Longoria has not enough power to make the film work without any fault. For those who love her, she's just in the small screen above the screen. Not talking about Ashley's character, she seems to be unhappy with everything she pulls, or Dan's "gay" friends. Dan again is not a favorite. Just having a new writing and paying attention appropriately, this movie is probably better. But we get the average romantic comedy role that will leave the feeling empty. <br /> <br /> 4/10
