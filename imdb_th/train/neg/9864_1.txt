As a gamer, I can't say that I like this movie. The truth is that I hate it. I try to watch it as wide as possible. But when it comes down, it feels quite insulting to my social group. <br /> <br /> For me there are many reasons. <br /> 1 The character seems unnatural. I met many players from different walks of life. I don't know who acted like the characters in the movie. It's as if the filmmakers have taken the worst aspects of the worst-of-a-kind map, including 5 people. Most gamers are quite social people. Some have a relatively active life. <br /> < br /> 2 style does not work. The mockumentary style is not suitable for movie content. The real documentary about gamers will be more effective, even though it looks good (like wearing it all together) but it's not good. <br /> <br /> 3 The conversation is unnatural. It seems that there is no real world context. Gamers swear I will accept But we have no symptoms of Tourette. <br /> <br /> 4 Humor is lacking. While the humor that does not appreciate itself is the mainstay of my group and other groups that I have met before, this is a matter of less self-objection and more humor in the bathroom. The humor of most gamers is filled with jokes and little things. It's not a joke in the bathroom. Most gamers will stop and avoid anyone who creates jokes. <br /> <br /> 5 The biggest problem for me is: Accuracy. I'm not referring to the rules, but changing invariably this movie. Will be compared to the movie budget lower than even The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, both of which show that players are real people playing real games The difference is that Gamers: The Movie presents the situation you want to beat the unconscious player against The Gamers, which you can say something like: "Well, I know people like this ... Um. It's Gary. Of course "
