It was fun. I have seen many films of Fassbinder and I found that there is something creative and interesting while some things are disgusting and obsessed with myself - like this movie. For me, it ranges from large to shit - without having to be in the middle. I know he has a lot of fans among "Those who are complex" but I can't help but think that many of his appeals are exaggerated. from my point of view (And I know that I will get a lot of negative points for this.) He created too many movies too quickly and acted like myself. His gay or sex movies (like this one) tend to be terrible - doing flowing, sometimes quite boring (such as QUERELLE and THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT) and sometimes it looks bad His message about accepting that person's sexual confusion couldn't be better than acting to slap him around or watch the horrible bulls be killed. Show some feelings for the topic and make your character more human and sympathetic. Then maybe I am interested in movies. <br /> <br /> I'm straightforward after watching this movie, which I May not be interested in the Fassbinder movie anymore - the bad thing seems to be a good weighing
