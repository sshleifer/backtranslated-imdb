It's a painful experience. The whole story is really there. So I won't go. But the performance was terrible at the beginning when the scientist's brother actually worked. He wore a white robe at home before leaving. At work, I think working with Biohazard materials means that you should wear sterile clothing in a controlled environment and the lab itself looks like a school lab with this monitor above the filing cabinet. Not affiliated with all scenes Making the place look technical and scientists are eating breakfast in the lab, and next to him is a bottle with a biological sign and his boss approached him and didn't even tell him about it. With this story ... very bad, no worse than my suggestions do not look and I think there is nothing worse than the house of the dead. Obviously, the movie of Uwi Boll looks like Shakes. Pier Compared to classic!
