Adrian should have a life without Mr. Brady. She annoyed me and was one of the main reasons that made me know the show in the show. It was a stupid performance and a little controversy or conflict. Everything seemed to be under the scope and analysis until death. This makes them see / hear what they are. But ready for marriage and I know that these conflicts are all part of life I guess some people say this is entertainment. If this happens in the next season, I will feel sorry for everyone who has nothing better than their lives. But watch this trash Although I am not very surprised. Can't stand advertising for this show anymore! I hope that they will receive enough money to shame themselves in front of the camera throughout the week. However, the girl "A" has one big butt!
