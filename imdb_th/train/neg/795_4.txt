When you see Boris Karlov and Belalukosi as co-actors, you expect to find a horror movie that works well. But actually it was quite different because it did what I would describe in the beginning. Karloff and Lugosi both played scientists (Rukh and Benet, respectively) - competitors until the extent until Rukh won Benet North with a demonstration at Prove his great theory The science here is - to say the very least - quite rough around the edges. (Like science fiction with a focus on fiction) Rukh takes advantage of one type of radiation from Andromeda that helped him see the world "billions of years ago". In the prehistoric period, large meteorites Crashed into Africa by leaving stains that scientists call "Radium X" which can heal and destroy Most of the film is quite boring in Africa in search of meteorites, which Rukh eventually discovered and controlled to create a great weapon. Unfortunately, it infected himself with some kind of disease that made him a good weapon. <br /> <br /> Karloff and Lugosi are both good. Here Lugosi draws a good role. Although I find that he is quite unbelievable, especially in the scenes that happened in Africa. The story is still a little stubborn, and while it gives me attention, it doesn't make me fall in love. Considering that this is really sci-fi rather than a horror and sci-fi flick in the early stages of it, I think this movie will have to be slightly reduced. It's okay - no more than that. But not less than 4/10
