This movie reminds me of The Sopranos and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> David Chase's seminal opera has only made two mistakes, which is the worst and worst incident in the fourth season when Ju. Bernier Soprano attended the trial for his life. Instead of following a gripping plan (And pivotal) the writer, instead of choosing to completely ignore it instead of focusing on Bobby Baccalieri, constantly wailing over the frozen pasta of his recently deceased wife. <br /> <br / > When something interesting happens in Notorious - for example, the first attempt to assassinate Tupac Shakur sparked a feud on both the east / west coast in the first place and ended. The deaths of both Tupac and Christopher Wallace - this film is a story that needs to be planned. Why are you confident that he is sold out by his own people? Did he raise the following Suge Knight? And the change of Lil Kim from the murmur in the office becomes sexually obsessed or not. The disgusting vampire singer as shown here <br /> <br /> These questions do not answer any questions even With screenwriter Interested to portray Wallace's love life in these turbulent order (Including lamenting lamentations in the hotel rooms) is toothless and severely distorted until the true comparison that has occurred with the television network movies. <br /> <br /> Both storytelling stories The structure and content are easy and boring. But the basis is biography; Is designed to celebrate subjects and educate those who are not trained about the complexity of their lives and work. This movie is almost worthless. Confidence in the planning of meat and potatoes along with live music performances (The area in which this movie should definitely be soaring) has resulted in movies that seem to be designed to meet the needs and needs of those people. Involving allowing the suspicious status of Wallace to be a giant in his field while keeping easily seduced and converted earlier. <br /> <br /> and the last twenty minutes at Wallace's deadly cultural identity is as wide as that of a saint the following day, making me feel like flying. <br /> <br /> In that score, like everyone else, fame The widespread bemusement, calculation and reconciliation.
