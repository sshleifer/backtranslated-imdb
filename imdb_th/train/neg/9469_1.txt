Audrey, I know that you truly cherish Ted's memories of your husband. But please do what is his legacy and pay attention to his wishes. Dr. Seuss refuses to allow his character during his life for a very good reason. We ask you to stop cashing in his stories, imagery and characters. They have been deposed by the power of Hollywood and Broadway. Tomorrow's children will be stuck with historical and bizarre interpretations that will cause the book's warmth and innocence forever br /> <br /> It is truly your property. I just hope you listen to the advice of others for a moment. Save the remaining things of Dr. Thank You.
