After the successful MASTI, which is better than Inder Kumar, comes back again with the funny movie PYAARE MOHAN from Hollywood movie SEE NO EVIL. This movie reminds you of HUM HAI KAMAAL KE (1994) at Kader and Anupam plays blind and deaf. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring. <br /> <br /> This movie has ridiculous jokes that you don't feel like laughing like Snehal Dabi's head stuck. At the back of the horse and all types of comedians Mara did not laugh now, but ridicule <br /> <br /> The film begins in a clich√© scene is funny and some sad moments such. As long as the story never moves in this half of the year, even though it is a tedious joke, twists are handled well and in the second half it becomes an action movie that the blind and deaf. Helping the heroines <br /> <br /> The direction by Inder Kumar is not good. The song is ok. One of the songs that stand out. I love you. MY MY ANGEL <br /> <br /> Vivek is scary in the cartoon scene. His time is bad. So much and it's okay in a serious scene for some reason As he continues to joke and destroy his career, Fardeen Khan is better, but is made of wood amid the rest. Esha and Amrita are the protagonists. Boman Irani Snehal Dabbi is fine.
