"Nacho Libre" (2006) <br /> <br /> Directed by: Jared Hess <br /> <br /> Starring: Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, HéctorJiménez, & Darius Rose <br /> <br /> MPAA score: "PG-13" (for vulgar actions and rude humor, including conversations) <br /> <br /> Say what you want about it. (I know there are people who do not end up insulting) but I always think "Napoleon Dynamite" is the brightest non-brick comedy on the wall. But a funny movie However Jack Black is also a very funny person - sometimes annoying, yes, and very angry by the adolescent audience who really worships him. But funny. There is a lot of Jack Black's comedy that is not fun. So I am very happy to hear that writer and director Jared Hess and "Napoleon Dynamite" and Jack Black will collaborate with a film about a Spanish priest who became a wrestler to maintain an orphanage. My only booking is that the plot looks a bit thin. Unfortunately, booking one of my rooms became a disaster for the whole movie. This plot, if it had been mourned in some programs, such as "Saturday Night Live" or maybe "Mad TV" would probably work flawlessly. Unfortunately, the story was longer than about an hour and a half, and this comedy was depressed. <br /> <br /> Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a religious man of God. Feeling disgusted by both the Nacho Temple (black). Now, the monastery's cooking decided to follow his dream of becoming a professional wrestler. When the money of the monastery fell all the time, Nacho decided to join the wrestling tournament so he could receive the prize money and a good meal for the temple's orphanage. This plot sounds very cute and attentive. It seems like the perfect movie for Jack Black. See what he did with "School of Rock" after all. For my dissatisfaction, this plot was almost completely destroyed with an aggressive and nasty humor that had just taken away from the heart of the movie. Is another way of Hollywood that shows that they feel that teen audiences will understand fart jokes and silly humor. Of course, for what I know, maybe that's a general idea of ​​a teenager. Many people who seem to enjoy this movie Watching women who are very obese, like a mouse all over the floor, will definitely make people laugh. But don't expect to be rewarded for putting it into your movie The seven year olds are funny too. <br /> <br /> The performance in "Nacho Libre" is really good. Jack Black once again proved that he is a hilarious person and he can do the most ridiculous things and The most worthless ever put on funny paper Unfortunately, this movie is not enough for him. It didn't give him anything, and the only reason for his jokes was because of him. I have never seen or heard about Ana de la Reguera before, but now I can say that not only But she has only ability But she is still one of the most beautiful women She clicks on the role and it works amazingly well. Héctor Jiménez, who plays Esqueleto, Nacho's failed partner, makes me laugh constantly. He works very well and is very effective when working with Jack Black. Darius Rose, an orphan player named Chancho, has many lines. But what can I say? I just enjoy him. He's cute. The rest of the actors do their job. It is a pity that they lost to a sub-movie like <br /> <br /> "Nacho Libre" doesn't work. The story is stretched out too thin. Its heart is all dirty, with humor and humor. Scary that doesn't work. I don't laugh and if I do it because Jack Black or other actors And that led me to the bright side of "Nacho Libre": yes, the actors, the actors are just good because they lack words better than they are They all clicked with excellent chemistry together and pumped life as much as possible into the smooth script after Jared Hess's "Napoleon Dynamite" made me thoroughly entertained in the movie. This story, I was surprised to find myself bored with "Nacho Libre". Something is missing here and I still don't understand what it is. What I know is "Nacho Beber" is not a good movie and because of its performance, it is completely worthless. There is little reason to watch if just to see Jack Black's work, but if you're not a Jack Black fan, avoid this movie like plague. I like black but I do with this movie and this review < br /> <br /> Final thoughts: Yikes! This is an astounding disappointment of Jared Hess's "Napoleon Dynamite". <br /> <br /> Overall score: 4/10 (C +)
