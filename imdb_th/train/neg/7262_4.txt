There are some great ideas in this violent movie, which, if implemented clearly, may raise the level of politeness, spaghetti-western, to become something special. Unfortunately, HELL CALLED HELL is one of the worst edited movies ever imagined! The scene begins and ends abruptly, the characters come out long, the actors (and accents) of the actors are quite inconsistent, etc. <br /> <br /> Robert Shaw is a Mexican revolutionary. ! Wipe the village away to become a priest (!) ... Ten years later, this village is operated by "Mayor" Telly Salavas Stella Stevens came to seek revenge on the man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Lando looking for Shaw They shouted at each other and they shot a lot. Fernando Ray is in there too. (Like the blind) The performance is not bad. Savalas have some accents like the carriages. Shaw and Ray prove that they have the ability to truly embarrass themselves and Steven looks very cunning. (If leaving the place amidst the dirt that is full of sweat)
