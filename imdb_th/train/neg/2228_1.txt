This film is weak. The cover box tells East LA's toughest gang and is actually Santa Ana. James Cahill acts like a wardrobe queen who manages the tough people in the tough Chlo gang. It's boring, boring. And nonsense, I tried to take a refund from this video store. This movie is terrible. It was in the end of the homo toot erotic, far from what the video box announced James Cahill should show in Gay Porno James in every scene. He could not save his life. This movie has hot Eva Longoria, but James can't score with you !!!!!!!!! Sometimes I feel like I'm watching gay porn movies and being closed by the whole movie. James wants to be with men clearly. But then surrendered to his gay desire, he would beat the gang members over and over again His martial arts skills are the best. The best, some real gang members will take him and his weak skills and tear him.
