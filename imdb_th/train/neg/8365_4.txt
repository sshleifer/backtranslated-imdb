This is easy. But felt very provocative It lacks pathos because it doesn't leave the room for personal imagination or thoughts or time to reflect. <br /> <br /> Animation can do very well. But I feel that it is too much presentation I want more pictures from the back, more space in the background, and maybe this may make me feel as bad as I am. <br /> <br /> But for Hollywood-style movies, it's good. But it is a derivative of Aardman. The movie and this disturbs me. Maybe the movie anymore will test that this person can do it without using voice overs. <br /> <br /> I think the sound is too loud, too hard to say.
