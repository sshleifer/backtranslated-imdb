When considering how much budget for this film, you can expect more from the whole story. This is probably the most worthless movie I've ever watched. Nothing truly progressed. Minimal character development Progress of the plot may be No enjoyment I'm not sure if there is any point to try.

In summary, this is a terrible attempt in the movie 'Ocean's 11', which is a plot about people thinking, because not only But you don't know what happened. No one made this movie. Home Alone 3 is a better movie.
