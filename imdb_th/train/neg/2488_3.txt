It's a movie that can't be understood. Something about the police that separated the ammunition from himself after he was shot and kept in a glass jar in his bathroom. (And from the size of the bottle he was shot about fifty times) and the top secret tank that heals five or six Incompetent soldiers for some reason drove to Mexico No matter whether they were intentionally sent or just lost, it was not clear. And you won't hear the word "butthorn". Another screenplay, Gary Busey, try the role of Mel Gibson from "Lethal Weapon" and while Busey is a useful actor, the screenplay makes the whole movie a normal person. Served as a Russian soldier again, the same character he played in "Red Dawn" a couple of years ago After playing heavy riders for 70, it's great to see him expand the scope of heavy communist play. Sadly, he may remember the best while the people in Clint Eastwood say "every way you can"
