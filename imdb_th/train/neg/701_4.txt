During the Christmas holiday, a group of college friends kept behind to help prepare the dormitory to be destroyed and replaced with an apartment building. To make the work a little more difficult, the psychiatrist wore a Chucks suit, walking into the hall of the dormitory by hunting prey in groups with various violent methods. <br /> <br /> Register as one of the video nasties 74 ' 'Registered by the United Kingdom in 1980, The Dorm That Dripped Blood has a good reputation created before the first viewing. The word' offensive video 'strikes some images with clear, crusted blood. Force sex, etc: all things horror fan's dream. So after hearing all the information, I decided to be the Pranks (alt title), hoping to experience the unbelievable slasher .. and that's what it tried. But completely failed This movie's eyes are not very good. Shooting movies (Except for two scenes) and the overall direction failed It's not fun to watch. Scripts that were not originally born were absent and often throw in random things without a real reason. (Such as killing open) has a cool death scene, including a cute face melting (Which can be seen on the poster) but that's a positive story about it The performance is quite poor. The seemingly insignificant killer is not cool or scary and it is one of the major mistakes that any flicks should avoid: it's a bit boring. Overall, for a film made by a few UCLA film students for $ 90,000 (which will double up today) The Dorm That Dripped Blood is not all messy. It has two good things and can be viewed fairly .. But as a patience, look at the level of movies like The House on Sorority Row and Pieces. Don't expect much, and at least you may be entertained. I hate to say But this is one of the few things that I have seen that will actually be improved by the remake .. But still they do great work, such as Black Christmas. Oh D.. <br /> <br /> Horror elements that must be responsible: <br /> <br /> - Subcategory: Slasher <br /> <br /> - Violence / Blood: There is a brutal killing and blood is okay. . But nothing special In addition, they also screen the best murders. <br /> <br /> - Sex / nudity: There are nudity (for me) that is not very attractive but <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer: There is no monologue. The ending of the killer makes him / her not cute. <br /> <br /> - Fear / Suspense: Jump, panic or twice. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: I think yes, but I don't care enough and clearly see the nose on the killer's face. <br /> <br /> - - - - <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 3.75 / 10 Bah! nonsense! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
