I am a big fan of 1930's and will see everything I see in my new Turner Classic Movies for me. So I took this picture. After that, it was the great Harold Lloyd who joined Chaplin as a great comedian. I watched Lloyd's silent movie less than from the Chaplins, but I have to say that I am a much bigger Chaplin fan. However, this movie was flat until I didn't finish it. I can understand why his voice career is limited, so he does not have very good material to work with. After you have seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy. Making a boxer trick I am also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou while I enjoy him in Paths Of Glory, but his role here does not do anything special for me. Maybe they should join the boxing faster because at least half of the movie (At least it seems like that) before he entered the band I can tell that there are many Lloyd fans here and this is not a popular review. But I have to give this score compared to other things that came out at that time. 4 out of 10 Do not watch this thing with the person you tried. Go back to watch old movies because they might not be able to watch this movie with you again. Very flat for an alternative for anyone who really likes this or is looking for a more commonly known comedy. Introducing "Kelly The Second" a few years ago, no one became a comedian with Patsy Kelly and in the role of Charles Chase, these were shown in the Turner Classic Movies.
