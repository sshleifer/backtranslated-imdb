I swear for a long time that I never watched movies with people who used to be regular performers of "Saturday Night Live". I didn't rent "Corky Romano" but I was forced by my endlessly good manners to watch it. For half an hour From then, my good manners also failed, stupid, not funny, boring, not hilarious, bad, bad. Short was all I can say for this video.
