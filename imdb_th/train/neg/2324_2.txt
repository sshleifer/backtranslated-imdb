I agree with the opinions of other users that the two main roles are well done: being a man who plays the role of Gary Gillmore and Giovanni. Never heard of a story I didn't know about Gary Gillmore before the movie, so I don't know what to expect. I think it will be like the Dead Man Walking or The Chamber, but I think wrong. The movie is talking, talking and talking about their mother and father. The only wonderful scene is a flashback that Father will make him upset. That's the only interest I received from this borefest.
