The film that was released earlier this year In 2000, along with MELA, both so sad and sad that started the millennium with nonsense. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be suitable for the 70s, but it looks like a comedy without intention for 2000. <br /> <br /> However, the classic jewel from the movie: Paresh Rawal I do not understand to laugh in the role or cry. Reason: He goes to search for his mother in the village. The worst part is when he realizes the secret of Anil. Then secretly in his stomach Which became big and made him look pregnant. I remember my childhood. My teacher told the same joke. Urrf !!!! When I was a child, I laughed at that time, but here <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke that cannot be explained. We have Anil in two roles (one that is older and younger) and Rekha plays wife. And old people Raveena the youngers. We have also rejected Harish, while Shakti plays Aruna Irani's son, both of whom fight with the worst wigs. <br /> <br /> Directions are outdated. Bad music. <Br /> <br /> Anil tried hard Looks too old in a younger and younger role in the old role But Rekha's good effort is enough. Raveena is ok as well. Harish is not good. Shakti Kapoor is terrible. Aruna Irani is normal. Rajnikant is okay in the pendant.
