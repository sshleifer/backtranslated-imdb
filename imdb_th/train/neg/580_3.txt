The movie is really bad. This story is simple and predictable. And acting badly. <br /> <br /> The worst vampire hunter story I've ever seen. Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi) travels to Mexico looking. Find a vampire! He uses interesting weapons. (But nothing compared to blade) and is part of Van Helsig's vampire hunter? OK, but he works alone He was assigned to hunt down a powerful queen vampire who is searching for a black cross to perform a ritual which will allow her to be invincible with sunlight. (Almost as a sequel to Vampires (1998) directed by John Carpenter and played by James Woods) Derek began his mission of finding a queen with some new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, a really bad performance). Inexperienced adolescents, Father Rodrigo (Cristian De la Fuente), Catholic priest Zoey (Natasha Wagner), vampire and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary), another expert vampire hunter. Obviously, in this adventure he was not alone. <br /> <br /> You can begin to feel that this movie will only look at his leading actor. (Jon Bon Jovi); There is a big difference in the quality of the show compared to James Woods and if you watch this movie (I do not recommend this section) You will participate in one of the easiest and most predictable things. Really bad effects and incoherent events! <br /> <br /> I recommend not to watch this movie! Rent another movie, watch other channels, hang out with your friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 3/10
