This show is foul. For parents, they often want their children to see good things for them. Usually it is a funny and bright study. <br /> <br /> Is it educational or not? Doodlebops sing and that's it. They often sing about themselves. They don't try to teach. <br /> <br /> Is it funny? No, the Doodlebops say something that's not funny and laugh, laugh instead <br /> <br /> Is it bright? It's very bright. It's painful. As far as color, everything is very bright. But there is nothing wrong with Doodlebop's world, so they are always happy. Children with problems will feel depressed because they never feel sad. <br /> <br /> This drama is wonderful. Every syllable is spoken of the highest level of exaggeration and repetition. <br /> <br /> For children, it's fun. But when you are over 2 years old, you will not want your child to see They will never know how to grow.
