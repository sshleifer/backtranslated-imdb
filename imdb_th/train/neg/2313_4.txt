Shintaro Katsu is famous for playing great characters. Satoichi The movie Zatoichi has a strange and unbelievable concept. The blind man is the greatest swordsman in Japan and spends time in the wrong film and takes revenge on the evil doer. He is attractive and a thrilling and engaging movie. (I've seen everything really). Because of this, I saw the final episode of the Hanzo the Razor series because I thought it would be very similar .... and my boy was wrong! It turns out that Hanzo movies have sexual relations with nature and they also promote rape. Do you see that Hanzo is a Meiji period policeman and he leads the evil women to take care and investigate them violently by raping them violently? "Steel genitals" The way he makes his members strong is something you must see to believe. But of course not for nausea. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't recommend anyone to see violent movies. However, by watching other reviews, I can see that they are still very popular ... and that is quite scary. Despite the dramatic and dramatic scenes But movies are just like brain pollution - and I hate to imagine how this movie might contribute to violence against women.
