I watched the pilot and noticed the similarities between 3 pounds and more than a few houses. The M.Dc character of Tucci's character is excellent. But not suitable for society, similar to Laurie's house character Can be of direct people The character of Inthira Varma Adrian Holland is similar to Jennifer Morrison's Cameron too much to be involved. <br /> <br /> The people at CBS noticed that The success of House, MD and told his staff Similar performances hope that the parody will prove successful. However, copying items such as House requires a high level of intelligence and suspense and Tucci and the company are not up to the challenge. <br /> <br /> I do not know that the item was canceled until I read it. Comments on IMDb, but it's not a surprise for me.
