Hmm, big pancakes don't look good, right? Maple syrup and fruit preserved on top, bite mmmmmmm, bite again, else else eat. Eat it you !!! Scoop it on the neck until your face turns green with nausea. You just got the experience. Ally McBeal <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon this program in the winter of '98 and immediately got addicted. Like stack pancakes, I became slimmer. But the fun soon disappeared due to Ally McBeal's character (whom we saw as cute and cute at first sight) soon became the most annoying person. (Call me feminist But I like the woman who is the backbone). The jokes and the tricks of the show become a damn. The music of Vonda Shepherd (which is really pushed on your face) becomes boring. Changes & rewriting made the show into soap operas. <br /> <br /> My advice is to use this item in small quantities and quit as soon as it becomes annoying. I made it through season 2.5 before my enjoyment would have been totally sour. It's a good thing while it lasts. But like an ex-boyfriend who has a nervous breakdown Good for health, such as fruit cups It will sit with you much better.
