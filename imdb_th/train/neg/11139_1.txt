There is nothing to say about this movie. Scary. <br /> <br /> The performances and conversations are far from appropriate, even the story of a werewolf that is a hybrid that has not been well described There are loopholes here and there. <br /> <br /> CGI is something you don't want to see. It was so skillful that I vomited. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was good on the DVD was in the extra part, hoist, gag, everything else, just wasting time and money. I hope that no one will buy. This is not worth it. Even renting <br /> <br /> Just stay away from this.
