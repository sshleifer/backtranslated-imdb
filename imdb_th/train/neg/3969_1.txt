I wrote this because I felt that it was led to the belief that Dark Remains was a good movie. Although it's not the worst thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The weak script, weak actors and weak directors Even if they can't buy a big name actor, will it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actor? It's painful to watch ordinary actors throughout the story with her boring performances. The story is a clich√© and a bad script. Special techniques are rare. The "suspense" technique used repeatedly here is hard to swallow. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the Dark Remains is no worse than the Masters of Horrors, but not as good as the quality movies. Suggesting to use Dark Remains for hardcore horror fans who do not want to miss all types of movies, even if they are bad movies. For others, should spend more time with valuable things - which should be very easy.
