Yes, this is one of the most scary movies. You can't stop laughing. I watched good comedy and laughed less than my wife and I laughed at this movie. Other comments give you a good idea. The character is not satisfied that you encourage me. The effect is so bad that you suspect that the elementary school art is responsible for acting. - Oh. Performances - Talk about tired conversations and embarrassing stops. <br /> br >> But I'm not a big rat Why don't we see the mouse until the end? I was surprised. Often, the 'big' will not appear until the end because the budget is limited and good effects will chew a lot of money. However, I think in this case, the big rat will be hidden until the end because the filmmakers are ashamed that the best thing they have is the guy who runs around, dressed like a wooden set with world class dentistry. /> <br /> The most noble part of all movies is the scene of the elevator. After knowing that I could not make a loud noise (Migraine from poor performance?) The main friend will send a fire alarm to send mice to be mad. If you ever want to see a pair of dancing mice while the blood flows from the head like a hot spring, this movie is really for you. You have to rent and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> But not for more than 99 Â¢O. K
