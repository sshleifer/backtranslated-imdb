I still do not believe that Wes Craven is responsible for this shit. This movie is worse than "Deadly Friend". The plot is stupid. The show is quite mediocre and this movie is really boring. "Last House on the Left" - is a masterpiece of the genre and likes (probably) this turkey. Don't understand me wrong. I like some of his movies. But it is a torture, sitting and watching this truly.
