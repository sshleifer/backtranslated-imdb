** Spoiler ** KHAMOSH is totally unrealistic. There is no plot and was created to see only the stars that saw the image itself. The most suspicious scene in the movie was when Shabana Azmi was in the shower, and then we saw her TV playing the bathing scene from PSYCHO. Remember that it's good enough to remember which pictures were fired and how much! <br /> <br /> *** The spoiler begins *** <br /> <br /> At the end, the killer spills over at Shabana Ash, long enough to make the character. Naseeruddin Shah's run up and shoot him! <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler ends *** <br /> <br /> It's a little funny. (Only a little) At first when the director and the members who threw and insulted each other and heard Shabana Asim exclaimed, "Oh sh-t!" > <br /> Points: ** from ********** (2 out of 10)
