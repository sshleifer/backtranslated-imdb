Not important and low consciousness (ha ha!) 80s horror like there are thirteen in a dozen. But it is considered fun if you watch it in the right state of mind Tasteful special effects, brutal performances and screenplays seem to miss two important paragraphs! "The Brain" was born in a typical quiet town of America where every teenager works in the same restaurant and the coolest boy in high school fluttering cherry into the bathroom. Here is the TV master named Dr. Blake and his cute pet brain begin their search for mind control throughout the country. Under the label of "Free thinker", a magical brain, sends waves through the television and forces the audience to be innocent. Kill! How cool is it? Now it is up to the Meadowvale teenage rebels to save the world! The most fun thing about the story is that it never explained that Dr. Blake and his enormous brain come from There are clear references to extraterrestrial life. But it's about it. Meh. Who really wants the background in this movie? Unfortunately, there is not much bloodshed and the "demon" brain looks like a big stocking puppet. The only interesting element that is interesting for horror movies is watching the actors and the team that created the movie. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same people who do "Bloody Birthday" (wrong offense) and "Plague". Both are much better movies and they decide to quit. From the film industry wisely The most familiar face of the actors like David Gale, whose horror fans will worship forever for his role in Re-Animator. A girl named Christine Cossacks gives a nude picture and she sees that talent is Excellent She has 3 movies that she plays. This is "Her masterpiece" in her debut, she is regarded as 'Escape model' and in "3 men and a baby boy", her character was called 'one of Jack's girls'. I really wondered how she felt about her career as an actor ??
