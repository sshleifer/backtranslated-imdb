Feeding the Masses is just one of many ordinary zombie movies that are hard to find behind the dollar. Suggestions? Collect the hard earned money and assume that the old Theatre that has been involved with this team Guess what about conversions? Zombies take over But this time for the initiative (?) This film takes place in Rhode Island and, to be honest, I'm not sure if I've seen a zombie flick in the Rhode Island television station controlled by the government. For the remaining people to not think that there is any problem in the world, that is, those who have never watched or went out I would say that the commercials that are broadcast by this station may be the most amusing part of this movie. Actually, it has some stories about this. But I'm not busy with that because after a while you won't care or fall asleep. In any way, it is a great show that shows what "See earlier" that was cut before the camera Trust me, you can find more things to do with your time than see this 3 out of 10
