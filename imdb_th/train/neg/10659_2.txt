Movie work: excellent and good camera angle (I do not remember watching a movie with a close-up shot until now) able to avoid horrible scenes with a soft camera. The image in NY is good. I like the angle that is especially upside down. (Different touch) <br /> <br /> Song: Not impressive The music is not stuck in the mind even after watching the movie. Probably, I expect the same quality as "Anniyan". Disappointment. <br /> <br /> Actors: Kamal must slowly pull out the hard-core action sequence slowly. His age and his belly really appeared. In addition, he should avoid further romantic scenes. It is very awkward to see adult / age celebrities still trying to play like more than 20+ hero scenes. Love can be expressed at any age. You can still show love from a distance. (Without touching too many women, for example, the love that Rajinikanth expressed in "chandrmukhi") <br /> <br /> Jyotika appears for people with names in the movie. That's not my problem "He disappointed me. It took a long time to publish the movie due to various problems. He slipped in a few scenes. Even the obvious story was dropped from the famous director. <br /> <br /> Overall: Just too much okay graphics. Not suitable for children (And adults expected to have "Entertainment") <br /> <br /> Thank you.
