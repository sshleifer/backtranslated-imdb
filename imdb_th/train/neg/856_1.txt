These writings write about the end of the plot, so don't read if you don't see this garbage. <br /> <br /> I found a junk movie in the horror section, which makes me think it's scary. As the owner of the video store, I will put it in the bored part. This movie has garbage. It will make you feel like your socks are lost. <br /> <br /> The movie has endless pictures of drivers as if it were scary. I drove to work and came back. (And sometimes go to the store or visit my cat) almost every day and believe me it's not scary It starts with some people driving 20 minutes, even the little ones do as well. Go round and round him go and he never stops Is there something terrifying about watching a little kid riding a bike for an hour? I think there is nothing and if you watch, you will not think too. <br /> <br /> Families in the car arrive at a large castle and they get a tour just by walking around. Look at the kitchen. Then the man walked about an hour and tried to kill his family for no reason. That's all that happens and as you see it is garbage.
