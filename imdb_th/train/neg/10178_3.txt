How have I appreciated the sequel of this story? All it is to throw the ball! The worst is not comparing even the first episode of the series! Humor is not a joke. Where did all the unintended laughter go? Slapstick action on the field for too long Eh, maybe! Let this be on the shelf and plan a trip to the All-Star. This one has three shots too.
