Virgin was chosen to marry a rich, wealthy, pee-pee, woman on board, like a sailor, a Virgin sailor, to attend a collective dinner. Men urinate on the dinner table. Boatwoman will undress for a little boy. Men pretend to be baby urine. There is a basic theme here. Makavejev tries to say that he is a pi $$ ed off that the world to say that this is a strange movie is exaggeration. In order to demonstrate the title, there was a scene in Laure, which was barely able to speak. All ten films were bathed in chocolate. It's a really cute scene. But the rest of the movie left a bad taste in the mouth
