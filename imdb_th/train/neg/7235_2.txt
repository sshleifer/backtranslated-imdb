The plot involves a Hollywood movie star named Don Bolton (Hope) and his efforts to evade military service at the beginning of World War II, followed by military service. In his unintentional attempt to confuse Colonel (Dorothy Lamour), Bolton's agent, played by Lynne Overman and his assistant, played by Eddie Fern, enlisting with him and all three Participated in the training Various things about the exercise of escape, filmed in Malibu, California Great budget budget, well for this effort, hire some leading experts, but the direction by reliable David Butler is often weak and this must be attributed to the funny elements that are missing in the situation. The transition to the end of this film to create the opportunity for Bolton's courage is still born with a show of bad talent and camera movements in evidence. Strangely, Lynne Overman received the best call and who had the experience of ridicule from them. Dorothy Lamour looked cute and served well and it was a pleasure to see and hear Clarence Kolb as her father. Which sounds like no other on the screen or radio But there is little that they can do to save this curse movie Like having a scripting error
