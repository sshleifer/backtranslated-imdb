Actually, the movie is too slow, has beautiful pictures, but it may not be beyond the fact that this movie is really boring. You see a lot of sex. It may sound interesting for some people. But believe that I will watch 2 hours is not fun at all Even if you laugh many times But it is not enough and it may be desperate and unbelievable than fun To annoy the weary director trying to put the video clip into the movie They are colorful clips of ridiculous music, perhaps from the 50s, but it is hard to say for sure, and they try to be funny so hard that it's sad Many times you have the feeling that the plot can be developed into something like a powerful scene is being created. But in the end it evaporated and that was Beside the clip, there are no conversations that release the song alone. The director tried to be original and art at a price. Personally, I can't recommend movies. I believe that art is something that is not boring. During the show, there was yawning throughout the cinema which confirmed my short review.
