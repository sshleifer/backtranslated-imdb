(To be honest, Barbra, I know you are the one who kicks everyone "no" in my review. 22 times. Do you have any suggestions for you to help you out here? See yourself in the mirror all day long?) <br /> <br /> Steven Spielberg tells Barbara that this is "The best movie I have ever seen since 'Citizen Kane'" Very beautiful. Tell everything - and act as a terrible warning. <br /> <br /> What is the mixture of disasters in the exact cinema and One thing that will haunt you, do not let you forget the tears of both laughter. And pain? Ingredients: Barbra Streisand's face, music, feminism, the voice of Barbra Streisand, director Barbra Streisand and the stupid / silly location <br /> <br /> Hollywood is full of egomaniacs that we Know in reality almost everyone ?? By definition ?? Must be an egomaniac in Hollywood. Why do everyone want to act? For "art"?!? If you are stupid enough to believe what they tell you in a well prepared interview ?? And Streisand has all their greatest ego! This is a very successful success. Will be surrounded by narcissistic cretins and still manage for them all? <br /> <br /> All the movies, as well as all of her "solo" efforts, are traveling ego straight from hell. Every scene in Streisand will be destroyed automatically. Which died But when it wasn't enough, she sang many Streisandy songs ?? Did you know that the type that enabled Mariah Careys, Celine Dions and Whitney Hustons of this world to poison our precious air waves for decades? Just because she doesn't deserve to be anyone But there are 100 South Park episodes, mocking her. <br /> <br /> This street street sits as a man to study to play as a rabbi. It sounds like Zany ZAZ funny. Ancient ideas, then the obvious problem is that Streisand doesn't look like a woman or she looks like a man? In fact, I'm not sure that she is a human. How are you watching in this movie? Can not explain with words. E.T. Looks like Jock High School by comparison. She looks more alien than Michael Jackson. In 2015, she looks scary. <br /> <br /> The songs they make me tremble. especially "Can you hear me like a girl who is passionate about heat?" And "Tomorrow I will prepare the sequel, YENTL 2: BITCH's Return" <br /> <br /> Do you know Streisand Considering that there was a nose job before her career But changed her mind When they told her that her voice might change? Do you believe that She should do it! To kill the flies twice with a single brush, that's what it's going to be. <br /> <br /> If you're interested in reading my biography about Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals, please contact me via Email <br /> <br /> Barbados should go to rest in the end?
