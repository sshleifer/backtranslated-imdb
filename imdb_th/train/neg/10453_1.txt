This film deserves more than 1, but I give one because many crazy fans have given 10 to be ranked to lead the top 100 seriously. It's not a big deal. It's not bad. It's a stupid classic cult with many crazy fans. It's ridiculous. These are the types that may still laugh at Chuck Norris and still say "I rick james b! Tch" no matter how old or annoying. I'm afraid to hear "I'm bored of the MFn snake on this MFn plane" from now on from the fool who tries to be funny. It is absurd that the plot of the show, etc. It's okay to love a bad movie. But you still have to admit that it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Wait for the sea, starring John Cena.
