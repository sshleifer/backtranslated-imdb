I saw this movie in the middle of the night when I flipped the box and nothing to see again. It's one of the movies you stopped to see what it was - just a moment! - But realize that after twenty minutes or so, you can't close it, no matter how bad it is. One of those movies that is between them is terrible. It's good and terrible. It's just a normal BAD. It's worth it to experience the confusion of realizing that it's both! The ultimate fare in the middle of the night if you are an excellent tennis player. Do not even ask yourself why no one can say that Chad Lowe is a man who is obviously not using reason.
