First of all, this movie can be divided into three parts. A good opening with the ambush of some cavalry at Cheyenne Followed by things that can be described as just a boring part in the middle, with Kazakhstan and "blue soldiers" traveling together for the safety of the military army Miss Bergen speaks four inappropriate words every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just came out of the 1970s movie Jack Nicholson. confident The third and final part involves the killing of an Indian village without charge. Obviously, it's too much to put on past anti-war propaganda, just a long, cynical and unplanned plan. ............ Jacobe (comments above) This is an idea Why don't you watch movies that you comment on instead of chirping your nonsense? This is not a political website. It is for checking movies - MERK.
