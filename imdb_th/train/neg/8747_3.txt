AntiTrust may be a great vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director cut off her best scenes. In the scene where she is, she is just a zombie. She participates in a sub plot that is similar to the sub plot in "Get Carter", but she manages the plot better in "Get Carter" (I blame the director), the director of Hitchcock. That is repetitive (It was the scene where Ryan Philippe's characters knew he might not be able to trust Tim Robbin's character. At least I thought it was a homage to Hitchcock. The DVD shows the cut scene. I think the director is Trust instinct Do not listen to the audience test
