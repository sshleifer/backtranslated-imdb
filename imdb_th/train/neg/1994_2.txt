The film was first released on Christmas Day 1940. Thinking for a long time, very bad copies were reproduced and made into CDs for sale. This movie is so bad. That chapter is terrible and the script is scary. <br /> <br /> Picture Roland Young, singing and dancing. And that is highlighted. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie may have been lost intentionally.
