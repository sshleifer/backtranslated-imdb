Oh, this guy is a bad movie. It flows horribly. This story is about race car drivers who love themselves and must promote a fast food chain of chickens and while doing this, don't love yourself. He tried to leave the contract and was horrified. Unwanted jokes occurred. Jim Nabors seemed to be sleepwalking. You will miss Burt's best friends, such as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed. While watching this puzzle solver, Loni Anderson's hair is really scary. Prove that many hair sprays do not go out during the sixties. Or maybe a wig Vickbert's speech was not bad in this movie. "One Wick" his worst was "Smokey and the Bandit 2". However, this movie is Reynolds' worst car movie ever there. "Cannonball Run 2", the original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper", which, unfortunately, does not have a sequel) is a great comedy. Still smelly You will wait a long time for the Jackie Gleason villain who enjoys hate. And your heart, this is not one of the fun movies that should be put on It's pure and simple. Even the last scene at the end looks boring and boring. And at least I forgot that "Stroker Ace" was one of the first heavy nails to seal Burt's coffin before he had a revival in later years in "Boogie Nights". Another movie Quite good when he has the right platform to do that
