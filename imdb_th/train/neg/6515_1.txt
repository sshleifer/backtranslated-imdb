This is not a boring movie. The audience may be on the chair of the character Miles Berkowitz, who is both a filmmaker and actor here. The story is simple: after divorce and not a Hollywood career, ten years, the author of the drama is seeking love in front of the camera. The first question about all truth: What was written by accident? Both answered "yes" or "no" portrays M.Berkowitz as a low average bee man If you're looking for a love story like this, I suggest you read independent comic books: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... <br /> <br /> Apart from this, I was very disappointed to hear. So much with my country, France I know that Americans often say that French is arrogant. (Which may be true) etc. and of course the French people (And the whole world) has many grief to America But why hate so much Don't think I don't like this movie just because of this.
