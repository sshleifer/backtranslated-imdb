I just finished watching this movie and wow. Actually, the only thing that made me look at it was that it was really bad. It was fun. The character's actions were hilarious, ranging from the dramatic performances to the shooting, to the incredibly bad performances of them. he (Every bad guy has just been driven out of the road. For their unexplainable actions (If you're trying to shoot someone through the door when they get in, obviously, what you have to do is shoot directly at the door knob !!) This movie will have to break the record for poor writing and delivery. <br /> <br /> The camera work is terrible - you can hardly see what happens in the fighting scene due to changing camera angles and trembling. <br /> <br /> I will score "1" except That I like Chiba and Sue close friends Shihomi and I have been entertained from two scenes: 1) broken the villain's arm so that the bones emerge from the skin (it must be very painful) 2) the important thing of the animals that eat brown fur (monkey ??) by Hacked to the corpse with a meat knife. 3) Sonny Chiba made a sudden eye surgery with a man with a finger.> <br /> I'm a big fan of Sonny Chiba, but this isn't worth anyone's time. I have seen his movie about 7 or 8 stories and concluded that the only thing that should be worth watching. (And they are great!) Is the Street Fighter series and The Killing Machine. I've heard the Executioner and Golgo 13 come along well. I recommend sticking with them.
