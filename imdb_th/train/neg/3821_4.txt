What is the most harrowing movie ever created? Gynecological nightmares of 'Cries and Whispers'? Acidic Psychodramas of Fassbinder? The dishonest black comedy of 'Last House' on the left? I'm sure that a part of the public who loves the movie that is masted with a good ship, Buster Keaton has only one answer - one of his films. <br /> <br /> I don't know what makes my soul hurt. This movie is much more - the foundation of Keaton's extensive and complex physical art work to hurt. The pain and hesitation of this filmmaker with the dialogue is not that he is not cute, cartoon voice, or that he cannot make the conversation funny. It was just a studio that didn't seem to give him enough time and so he tried to remember the script before he sent it, which made him - Keaton, not his character, stupid or it was the humiliation of Saw Keaton drowned in the disgusting sex story when he gave us the richest story about the frustration of romance for us? <br /> <br /> No, I know that the most annoying thing is to watch Buster Keaton, the theater's greatest comedian. Sit down to see Jimmy Durante doing his schtick. This makes Yant Dantes dress up yer Infernos. <br /> <br /> MGM seems to have an idea that wants to see that the best way to adjust Keaton to sound is to make him become a brother of Mark. Az The use of verbal words, neatness, dullness, 'clowns', shambolic stunts, dramatic scenes, triumphs through chaos and Telma, Todd Keaton, not just those types of cartoons and where Groucho's dangerous language and snatch A delightful opportunity may be able to accomplish this task. Buster's inappropriate professor is unable to study and predict. <br /> <br /> The thing Buster wants is to allow the experiment. Lang in 'M' or Rene Clair; He will not try to hold the stream like Chaplin. When the movie like 'General' was alluded to by the train, the loss would be even more obvious. <br /> <br /> And what was in the patch amid the flat direction, the film wasn't all bad - There is a great impact when the camera on the bus leaves Keaton alone at the train station. And the storyline, if it is original, is hardly less than it had been before There is something that is almost intriguing about the way Keaton slows the plot that requires all postal codes that can be received. <br /> <br /> There is a movie about loneliness, emotional paralysis. Percussion effects from education, etc. are struggling to go out The best way to appreciate this movie is to watch, not the lecture of Professor TZ Post, but as a genius Buster Keaton who was trapped in the prison of ordinary people confused by the new technology that mocked with a cruel fate. (In this case, the studio) Maintain patience. When looking at it, it becomes a masterpiece.
