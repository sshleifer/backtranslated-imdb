The 1960s were a time of change and awakening to most people. Social turmoil and unrest are common because people talk about their views. Racial tensions, politics, Vietnam war, sexual promiscuity and drug use are all part of the daily structure and daily news This film tries to summarize these historical aspects as a very entertaining and successful movie. <br /> <br /> There are two families in this movie: one white, one black In the first half of this film, follow each family on an equal basis through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the film was almost devoted to the white family. It is accepted that there are more characters in this family and the story is mixed together. But equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century The video is mixed with the original color and black and white images to make the movie feel. This film is a work of fiction. But the clips of well-known historical people are used to determine the timeline. <br /> <br /> I enjoy this movie. But the situation is predictable
