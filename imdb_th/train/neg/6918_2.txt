I went to watch this movie because I believe it has a good rating. First, it's ridiculous that they are releasing a movie created in 2001, seven years later in 2008 here in India. Everything in the movie looks old. Even in the year 2001, the movie seems to have been created from the shoe string budget. There is a scene in which a taxi hit a man to explain the details of how low your budget will be. Anthony Hopkins doesn't seem to know what he's doing in this movie. He ended up giving a single person to the end. If this movie had a bright sparkle in that scene, I missed it because I was sleeping on the seat. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt. Similar to Devil, she wears monotonous clothes and a scowl at random children. For Alex Baldwin, the scene where he meets Webster for the first time should not be missed. It's a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins was right "Go home and write better!"
