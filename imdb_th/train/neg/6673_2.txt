My first clue about this bad will happen when the video case says it comes from someone who brought us the Blair Witch Project, which is a masterpiece compared to this garbage. The performance depends on the ability of Oklahoma's 6th class production and that plot is predictable, boring and incompetent. 85% of the script is four-letter characters and has a format Countless, it seems that Mother F is a "writer" favorite because it is used continuously. It takes 10 minutes to write this script to dive into the last call. Thank God that I rent and can cross over most of the fast forward. Don't waste time or money on this.
