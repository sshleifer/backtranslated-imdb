May be a dub or may be an endless scene of people wailing or continuing, but I find that Europa '51 is one of the most boring and annoying movies I have ever seen This movie started out well if familiar with Ingrid Burke's mother. It was too busy to spend time with a spoiled son. (San Francisco Français) while mother and father (Politically, Alexander Knox) ​​entertained guests at a dinner party, trying to commit suicide by setting scenes that changed the life of the events. The newspaper from the Communist Party did not take long, so she spent much more time taking advantage of it than she did with her husband. A major point of debate reflects her role as Joan of Arc in 1948 and Rossellini worked excellent lighting and filming she gave the best results. Unfortunately, the script returned with cleverness while Andrea and Mom took turns calling for Marx and Christian. From the last drenched scene that ripped, I had more than these boring characters. Truly stepping down for Rossellini as he stepped out of the new realism and brought the legendary and mysterious theme of the Flower of St. Francis in 1950.
