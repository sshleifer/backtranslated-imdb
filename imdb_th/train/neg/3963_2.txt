How many times have we seen a ghost walking through the background and looking through the reflection of the mirror? It was created in two movies in memory recently and forty times in the recently released film. There are only two strange moments that admire .... when the ghosts invade the personal spaces of the characters. both Speaking of the characters, the performance is as flat as the Coke Diet in 64 ounces. The cup I draw it from That character may be drawn from a wide variety of Scooby Doo cartoons. There is a very old friendly sheriff with strange bisexual people living in the rainforest. Lots'o'characters Without development The most annoying image is the first image of a child killed. But instead of exploring the murder of a child, which is interesting, they just let us know that she is dead and that her parents have a difficult time in returning to the community. When they came to the cabin, the scene that didn't flow together ... with a glimpse of the deceased daughter. Oh ... and the creepy sound too. You know what I mean .... The creaking door that opens by itself. Crickets in the forest, Yada Yada Yada Ooooohhhh never seen before. Again, you will see the door opening itself amazing in the movie over and over again. Note to the director: The scary scenes are scary if not repeated every 5 minutes in the same movie. Think of these things before calling out "It's wrapped!"
