First of all, you must first understand that I'm not a neo-nazi. I just try to understand correctly. Hitler ensures that nobody like him has power again. <br /> <br /> I've seen this. The series and found it scary I mean, ok, it's interesting. But is it really? I searched for answers and found one: certainly not First, Hitler wasn't angry all his life. This series showed Hitler anger even when he was a child. Secondly, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter. In fact, it is highly likely that Hitler, in fact, was gay and fought his entire life to choke this secret. Third, people will hate me. But it's true: Hitler is charming. How do you think he will have power if he shows hate and hate? Because he is charming That is a common issue that I found in interviews with people near or far from him. (Of course, not Jews) <br /> <br /> This drama is terrible because if you think Hitler is just an angry Ugly and of course no charm at all. You're wrong. If you think you will give people like him to have power in the country and you don't want that If you really understand how Hitler handles power and stop thinking that he is scary, you can find dangerous politicians like him. (Of course, remember that he was chosen) and stop the thread before it is too late. <br /> <br /> Life is important to protecting this series. It's very scary to show us the truth if we continue. Seeing that Hitler was like that, another one would happen like it had been.
