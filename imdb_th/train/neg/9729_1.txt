What is this serious thing? Hooper has created classic movies such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Then he created a great movie. What happened? Did he dip into too many cracks? This film is about some friends named Sam who has the ability to fire (Firestarter anyone?). The show is godawful. The plot is garbage and special effects are very garbage. They look like something from the 70s Van. Damme seems to be satisfied that Derailed is not the worst movie anymore and ends up with something? He began to glow in blue, becoming a glowing blue blob, sucking his girlfriend's light and the movie ended. What is it now? Ha? When the movie ends, I hope the DVD will be a Combust to help me out of the pain. <br /> <br /> The stay from this movie <br /> <br /> Don't think you will be OBEY. Thank you. later.
