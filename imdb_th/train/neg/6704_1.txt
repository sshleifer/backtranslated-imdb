This is just a scary 'joke' - it's a really bad movie. No funny elements No funny jokes I do not know that some people can claim this depressing short film as' smartest 'or' quality '. Maybe if it's the only movie that one person can see, you can claim your brothers' rights. But I have seen thousands of better movies: Leonard, Episode Six (Now very funny)! I do not know how these siblings are eligible to be ranked in the internet movie database: it is more like a home video than a real movie. <br /> <br /> Funny ahead. Root canal is more fun than this ridiculously boring material.
