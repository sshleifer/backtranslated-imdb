I gave this movie only 2 stars because Dominic Monaghan used his best effort to perform. Everything else about this movie is very amateur. Everything related to the direction of the film is not good. The director should not rethink what she is doing for her career. But you should watch a movie As Dominic Monaghan is a very reliable actor, putting him in a movie with this ability makes him look scary. Anyone who is an "actor" is playing as Jack's best friend. Shouldn't step forward in the camera. I didn't expect much from this small movie like this. But may take more time and effort in their characters and environments Don't waste your time or money on this movie. (As I do) you will be very disappointed
