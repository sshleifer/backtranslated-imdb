In 1454, in France, magician Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) was executed and his mistress Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) was tortured to death, accused of spells, vampires and lycanthropy before. They will die. They will curse the next executions. In modern times (in the 70s), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Victor Vic) and beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani), their beloved soul Of Alaric de Marnac, they decided to travel to the Villas de Sade, which is the estate of Hugo's family in the countryside, to find a monastery with hidden treasures They found Alaric's head and the demon possessed. They brought Bill back to life and killed the townspeople with blood sacrifice. After the death of her father, Elvira (Emma Cohen) remembers that he had Thor's hammer hidden in the well; Along with Maurice, they tried to defeat Demoniac Alaric de Marnac and Mabille. <br /> <br /> Last weekend I bought a type of horror box with a DVD. Paul Naschy five sheets per US $ 9.98; Even without reference, I decided to take the opportunity. The first DVD with the version "Horror rises from the graveyard" that has not been uncut and has been restored to the movie B (or C) that made me remember Ed Wood. Laughing stories are revealed through screenplays, directions, performances, movies, decorations, special effects and editions, and many naked women. The results are very fun and I guarantee that Ed Wood's style will come back again. My rating is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): Not available.
