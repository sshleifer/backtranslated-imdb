They have this potential for this film and they are completely depressed. In the first cruel intentions, we were left to wonder what inspired the lead character in being like that. There is hardly any character development in this prequel. Actually it is very sad. But this movie didn't do anything for me It's like they write well instead of unnecessary f words. Finally, there's no reason and doesn't explain anything. The writing is terrible. Another thing that bothered me is that they use the EXACT 3 line contract. SAME is the same, like "little boy" or kissing scene and a few others that I can't remember I'm not impressed with Robin's performance. But Amy did very well That is the only thing that makes this movie reconciled.
