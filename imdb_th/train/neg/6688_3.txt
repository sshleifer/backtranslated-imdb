This movie is quite scary. But I have interesting information about it: <br /> <br /> It was filmed in 1976 at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ, and at Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ. This film is a drama student from NAU. I am a one year student there in the theater. But for some reason I am not involved in production However, I know many people who can and can give this strange truth: <br /> <br /> There is a scene in this film in which two executives who are part of their rehearsal ritual must run. Naked into the forest. They saw from the back in the movie doing that That thing is that it's not an actor. But there are two men I know from the drama department. The identity of "stunt poster makers" will remain anonymous, at least on this website, unless they decide to "reveal" themselves!
