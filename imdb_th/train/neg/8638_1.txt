Action, violence, sex and rough language are what the characters do in all movies. And everything they do without reason. Mark L. Lester is known for the violence of the movie. (Without reason) (Commando, The Base) Strange but stupid stories. Actors play very stupid characters ... I'm not saying they are stupid. But I mean they are very bad actors. It is an action movie series B Series, one name with a low budget. If you see something like Operation Delta Force, Drive, The Patriot, Sanctuary or something like this from the same movie, more than Misbegotten ... Don't rent it ... The movies I talk about .... I give 1 and a half from 5
