This movie is the most common thing. Angie Harmon jokes like a hammer of a bag. Her bad behavior from "laws and regulations" proceeds in an attempt to fail in comedy. Charlie Sheen is the only person injured in this horrible comedy movie. The only thing that is useful in coming out of this mess is Charlie and Denise's marriage. Hope that trying to produce better results
