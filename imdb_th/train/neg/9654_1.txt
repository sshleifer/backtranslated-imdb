This film is not plain good. Just scary The string of bad movies from Bollywood is endless! They will have to make excuses for making a scary movie (or not). <br /> <br /> The problem seems to happen to most directors. The film has two great actors who have proven in the past that they have the ability to deliver great performances ... but they are not good. The poor script doesn't help. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of ridiculous moments and terrible fixes in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After his first major concert, Ajay Devgan meets Om Puri (which he fled 30 years ago and talked again) and Om Puri, everyone found to be careful. Of his friendship with Salman !!! Seriously loading shit. No need to talk about the baaad song. Whatever happens to Shankar Ehsaan Loy A good performance in the second half Ajay shines as his character shows his dark side. So Salman is a drug addict. <br /> <br /> Look, it may be just the last half hour.
