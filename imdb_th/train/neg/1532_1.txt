Even though the warning was correct, I sat down to watch this movie. Partly because I tend to stop everything and because I think that a single movie is not that bad. I am already standing Not even George Kennedy, Barry Boswick or Ben Stein can help this turkey from sinking like a brick. At this time, there was only one humor that I was mocked with. Is between Simon saying the scene Other jokes are either bad or just simple. And some of you actually saw that one mile away This movie is not related to good parody such as Airplane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III) or horror movies. They all have fun jokes. A. Good and most important conversation of C. All memorable words Men In White received D. From all of the above. Calling this movie is not good, it is a bad speech at all. Avoid this film that you can do! Consider yourself being warned!
