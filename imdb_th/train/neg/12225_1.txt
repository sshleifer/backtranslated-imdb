My personal vision of hell is locked in the room without being able to close my eyes or block my ears and let this movie play forever on every surface that is in that room. The whole idea that Streisand plays as a man / man begins to scratch the surface of ridiculous ways in this film. The single most important thing about watching movies is the concept of "The suspension of unbelieving reluctance". It is impossible to do that in this movie.
