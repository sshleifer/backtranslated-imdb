Is this movie stupid? Is this movie deep? Nope. Character development? Nope twisted plot? Nope This is just a movie about a Springer program that has a high character. It shows the length that some people are going to buy glass on TV. Molly Hagan works well as Jaime Pressly's mother. Jaime is .... Um ... very beautiful! This flick was not created as a movie. "Penetrating" but it is intended to live in a trailer park (I live in a trailer park and we are not like this movie) Otherwise, every woman is pregnant by many men and everyone drives a Ford 66 pick-up truck (of course too. But that is the image that everyone sees when you talk about "Trail Park"). Some people analyze movies too (in the case of the point: Star Trek freaks). I watched pure movies for entertainment. In order not to point out that the girl wears a different shirt in different scenes (read the bit "Goofs" about Connie's shirt, it would definitely be better. But it's funny like hell
