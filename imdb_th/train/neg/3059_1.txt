Okay, I just got a chance to rent and watch Santa Claus beat the devil, even if the children were abusive when SCCTM happened, but I must say that Santa Claus is a much worse movie As a Spanish job in Spanish 5 we all have to see I will tell you that when we normally watch movies, we all just talk and eat. But not for this movie Everyone just opened the jaw, wondering what Mr. Pitch will do next. Merlin will help Santa Claus! Or his robot reindeer will come and help all day? I recommend renting because it is the biggest piece of waste I've ever seen and I like it very much: D
