Does this mean a serious joke or drama? The film begins with a soft-spoken dialogue between three women. It moves into a conflict between women when one of them finds a fine man. There are a few funny performances between them. But when the plot Thicker and eventually became black, I began to wonder if I misinterpreted the first part of the movie. It remained in this vein for a while, until it finally tried to return to the original bright parody. But now it's too late It's hard to see why these women are still talking and the ending is not reliable. Is a real lesson (For British filmmakers) how not to make a movie? It's hard to see how the producers used to believe in themselves that this movie will work. And the box office proved that it was truly a failure because I had never heard of it before this weekend. (Four years after launch)
