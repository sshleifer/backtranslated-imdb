This movie may be the cheapest and most wonderful sequel that has ever existed. <br /> <br /> But it's Disney's most fun and silly movie, and is guaranteed to have a boring story. <br /> <br /> It's a group of short stories that seem to be a bad fan. <br /> <br /> * The first notification spoiler about Beast and Belle is a person. Daring Then, a new, lost character decides to fix things by disguising the forgiveness letter to give to Bell. Bell had eyes on the wall, which made my brothers walk through the small steps that made my brothers and I laugh hard. Then she and the beast fight with the letter ... and learn the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they ??? Old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> After that, the next person about Lumiere will be the greatest drug in the world when talking about love. This is from a man who can flirt with any woman. And they make FiFi a psychopath that tries to kill Bell and stop the Scots free at the end Send a message to the children. <br /> <br /> After that, the next person who is concerned with Potts is terrible. And the next thing after that is all about the beast becoming too many birds to the point that he looks so stupid There are at least 100 mistakes that you can see clearly ... and coloring is terrible. <br /> <br /> Bell is a smile. In addition, she is still flattering and different from general Belle. <br /> <br /> And the side characters are annoying ... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere fight almost all of the time. He did that in the movie. But it's too much in this regard) <br /> <br /> But the worst character is Mrs. Pott. She was destroyed in this story. I can not explain Just buy and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I give 1/10 for property, but I give 10/10 for funny.
