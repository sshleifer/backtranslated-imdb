When I watched this movie, I couldn't believe my eyes. At these hilarious creatures, the trash muppets with big pointed teeth mean that it is really scary? Or that they designed to have a good laugh (I look forward to it) If you look carefully, you can see a working string. (Better than dragging on the screen) All are a bit more funny than scary, and I have a good time to watch movies because I am fascinated by its overall ability to have only one good part. It's a great joke from start to finish and I believe this movie is in a new category: so incredibly crappy people that you will laugh from beginning to end. (I won't even try to comment on the show or all other things)
