Since the universe loves movies, being familiar with men named George A. Romero, the word "zombie" is automatically linked to horror images, blood, and non-stop acting sequences. It is safe to say that his "Night of the Living Dead" has formed a zombie movie, as we know it now. Still, during the early years of watching movies, the location of the excruciating bodies was used only in the psychological thriller that almost had nothing to do. So perfect "White Zombie" starring Bela Lugosi "Revolt of the Zombies" may be another example. Unfortunately, it is the failure of the whole line and is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Scary performances, poorly written screenplays and lack of atmosphere and complete tension! The film takes only 65 minutes, and the first half hour is broken with stupid love stories and an exciting collection. Setting up in Cambodia's legendary Khmer city may result in more interesting stories. But what we see is the image inside the lead actor (Dorothy Stone, a blonde book with curly hair and an ugly nose) that makes me very annoyed, and I still hope that the hungry man Appeared immediately Unfortunately again ?? If you try to overcome yourself for 60 minutes, you will be rewarded with a fairly good final scene. Even so, this is too little to give positive points to this film. Avoid! This is the type of movie you should see in case you see everything.
