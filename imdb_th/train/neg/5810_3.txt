Spoiler throughout: <br /> <br /> Most Gettaway is action movies. And that action is !! Shootouts, chumps, dumpsters and more. It is Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as Mc Coy. <br /> <br /> This is a remake and I haven't seen the original. But really don't care for this. Although Bassenger and Baldwin have a good screen, chemistry. But the movie itself doesn't do it for me. <br /> <br /> Gettaway becomes really boring. The plot was overshadowed by the fight, chase again, and when violence continued to intensify, Bassenger and Baldwin still maintained their good image, no matter what they might be dangerous in reality. At the end of the beginning, I don't think Bassenger's eye makeup will move once during the whole picture. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I have ever seen. But it wasn't very good Meticulous action movie, I do not see how to enjoy this movie because there are not many. Gettaway is not a scary original and goes all the way from unnecessary cruelty to bluntness. I think it would be better. <br /> <br /> Bassenger and Baldwin gave the performance OK. But they do not do much, except to be chased and run for their lives Sometimes, even less, after seeing the same thing over and over again, it will stale. Not much fun with this.
