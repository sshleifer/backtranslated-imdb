I read comments about this story as being the best Chinese movie ever. Maybe if the only Chinese movie you ever watched, no dialogue, staring far and quietly, and hacking, do you think you came to <br /> <br /> a complex story or not hardly trying young and skilled Beautiful mood and haunting memories? Hardly try to be boring and flattened. <br /> <br /> This is terrible. I can't wait for it to end. Especially when the best line in the movie consists of "How are you? I'm fine. Are you sure?" Wow! What depth of character I guess smoking is not always a good thing to say to them. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean movies, I am extremely disappointed in this story. Even Zhang felt happy. "The road to the house" was better.
