To begin with, I have to point out the fact that you will feel completely lost for over half an hour. Yes, something happened. But you don't know why or for what Finally, when you understand things, you just know that it's nothing but Saddam's opera involving adult prostitutes, dead mother, illegal son ... The character is quite poor and the actor (Especially children) did not help much to make me look reliable. Marisa Paredes only outstanding But she is a great actor, regardless of whether this movie is pure garbage. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is positive to say about Good intentions and he filmed two scenes that were quite intense ... Well, maybe next time ... <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
