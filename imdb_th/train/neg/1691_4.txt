This film is nothing but a scene with a well-accepted tension sequence that is separated by the "gotcha!" At the end of each In fact, there is no character development and no real speech. There is only one skeleton motivation for the character to do while they walk forward to the inevitable punishment. It's just an excuse to show the creepy ghost boy. (Which seems to have received some family cats mixed in his ectoplasm) and his demon mother There is a two-dimensional excuse for the human character down to a two-dimensional cardboard. <br /> <br /> "The Grudge" This English version is equivalent to junk food in the cinema. Satisfied for a moment, but not what you should live. <br /> <br /> Not recommended
