This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Robin Williams stuck in the part that looked like a rhinoceros would fit into Tutu, so his acting was still pathetic. Kirk Russell is more reliable. But still scary The plot is interesting and the rest of the show is also very bad. The only thing that this movie did is an example which made me spend 90 minutes in my life which might take a lot of time to try to lick the back of the head. <br /> <br /> I like and burn this movie if you Have it If not, just be happy that you can't.
