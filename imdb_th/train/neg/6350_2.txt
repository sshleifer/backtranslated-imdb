I've seen my share in the movies of Woody Allen, and even if they're not always good, you can always be sure that you will be entertained. Probably the best person, the last one is Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - since then, people I've seen will look patchy, but can see so when I get invited to watch The new movie Woody Allen, Melinda and Melinda, which I didn't even know had been released, I walked happily together. I have never heard of this before, so I hope I am pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The thing that I have received is the worst Woody Allen movie I've ever seen. The evidence is too much to explain. The actors are terrible. The script is slow and lifeless. There are many scenes that do not say anything and still stretch out. I think that will fill the things that will become a 15 minute short film. <br /> <br /> I don't care about the concept behind this film - the two directors explain. that A simple situation can be interpreted as a joke or a tragedy, and it is obvious that the movie is going to show us that by playing both situations, the problem is not 'these two movies'. Funny movies are not funny and tragedy is not very sad. It seems that Allen will have a good idea. But after that it was exhausted or the time to complete the movie. <br /> <br /> The level of general performance was terrible as well - Will Ferrell was the only one. Who brought what brought to the table, and basically it was the impression of Woody Allen. Previously, a good actor like Chloe Sevigny was annoying and the worst of the bunch was Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which was embarrassing because her characters were in almost every scene!) <br /> <br /> Will Is fair to the script actors that they are working with are lacking if they don't exist Of course, it's a long way from Allen that we know and love from classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.
