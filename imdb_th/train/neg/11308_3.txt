<br /> <br /> Bring your beer out and enjoy the action movie that has a lot of kempo skills. Speakman's (good rotation, good with wood - bad sofa!) Is the only feature for redemption of movies that just sing bad performances The story is not half bad. Just not doing well But if you watch this movie for anything other than martial arts And for movies that should happen in Koreatown, there are too few Korean actors. (Even special)
