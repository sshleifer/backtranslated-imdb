I received this as a turkey movie and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Performances - overall, though there are many people in other films, it's clear that they have to work hard for Will do bad things all the time The movie was accidentally letting the show level one unintentionally. <br /> <br /> Plot - Be generous. I can say that the screenwriter begins with the plot. The plot collapsed faster. Then, the Chinese computer broke up. <br /> <br /> Flyers are now a nasty thing of nature. It fails to flow with touch or any reason. Most of the lines by the best characters are pathetic. Imbecilic script works hard to make sure that no character is considered as memorable. I have watched other movies that are more special and interesting. <br /> <br /> Special effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! They are a special short bus. <br /> <br /> Director - until you get your own directing ability to copy the style of your favorite director or you will fail like <br /> <br /> It is good to know that your friends / family give 10 stars for this movie.
