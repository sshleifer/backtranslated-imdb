This movie has one of the most bizarre themes in history - right there with Ed Wood's indefatigable cross dressing in "Glen or Glenda?" <br /> <br /> Subject: Bridge, play set Park Avenue plays it; The Bohemian people play Russian - who speak "Russian" very suspicious and have the most unreliable accent when speaking English - playing at the restaurant they work. <br /> <br /> If nobody Interested in the bridge - even though there are great actors - it's not very interesting in this strange movie. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are good (Um-Frank McHugh is a ghost writer That is not feasible - because Lukas is a Russian Users unlikely possibility), but they all sank in scripting superstition.
