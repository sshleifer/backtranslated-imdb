OMG This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I see a lot. I am a movie student. I do not understand why Angelina Jolie is in this movie? Do you want bad money? I love AJ and see almost everything you've been in, so I watched this 2 tick again. It's terrible! Not bad, even a little bad, bad It has a small time, funny 1 or 2, but overall it's terrible. 101 minutes. I can't say that AJ looks good because she can't. The plot can be predicted unless you expect Romeo and Juliet's storytelling again. Disappointing all around, maybe if your 12 stories might be a good movie, otherwise I don't really recommend
