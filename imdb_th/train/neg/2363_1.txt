This movie is terrible. The first movie wasn't that good. I mean, it's ridiculously stupid. If they don't have enough, the first 5 stories you have to add, another story, why not make this a continuous series, like my James Bond. Will tell you exactly why the movie is really good and these movies are foul. I do not understand. This is something that should be a genre between horror and comedy. Rotate good for 1 year old niece are not afraid of such horror vain attempt to spit in front of people at least need to be afraid at some point in the horror film called. Please don't these movies anymore.
