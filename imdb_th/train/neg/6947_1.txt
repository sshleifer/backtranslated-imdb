No doubt it was one of the worst movies I've seen in the last few years. This story focuses on four women who were robbed of banks, which we should sympathize. It is difficult to sympathize with the character who makes a foolish decision. Oh, not the police are with us. They know who we are. What!?! Every character is a fixed rule and is easy to tell who will die.
