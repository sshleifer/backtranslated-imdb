This narrative is unacceptable. The only reason that this movie is above 5 stars from 10 lines is because it has George Lucas in the back and has the word "Star" and "Wars" in the title. Abusing the aspiring filmmakers and many others who made the movie clearer, with a story that is superior to writing and acting. But did not receive credit This is an imitation. <br /> <br /> The first thing to do before the story. Anakin's evolution doesn't have anything other than makeup around the eyes and little shouting. He became a stupid Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader with a single attack. The only consistent thing about Darth Vader in the original series is his ingenuity. How good he is in everything he does. Plan, fight. You name it. The only consistent thing about Anakin that is recognized in the prequel trilogy is his consistent folly. He lost his body because of the stupid competition. <br /> <br /> What part of the Palatine Emperor told the myth of Sith not to indicate that the emperor was Sith? Unacceptable. <br /> <br /> Double digital battle scenes are double. Everyone flies all over the place, such as teddy bears in doll houses that believe Count Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, almost every fighter has a digital double jump that is rubber. <br /> <br /> One battle scene, one scene, Obi-Wan and Anakin, in a mountain top fight, stop in the middle of the parries and ripostes to rotate their saber a few times while the fingers are apart. I know that fighting is designed. But that caused me to shake my head with disbelief and disgust. <br /> <br /> Writing is terrible. All conversations are extremely low quality. Good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman do the best they can with their chapters. But that's not enough I can't say enough bad things about this movie. Too many special effects, the plot is bigger than the center of the universe and doesn't have any insights about any characters. This is the biggest mistake of this movie: nothing new. We know the rough picture of everything Lucas does, which makes it color. <br /> <br /> We know that Anakin loses his limbs. We know that Luke and Leia are brothers and sisters. We know that Luke is the son of Anakin. We know that Obavan and Yoda are exiled. We know everything. There is nothing new in this movie. If that's what all the fans want, then it's okay. Lucas is not mistaken. <br /> <br /> But when Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader and he asks Padme And heard that she was dead His arms were clumsy and shouted. "Nooooooooooooooooooooooo" that scene screams the movie B-along the way and I expect Darth Vader to go "Dangerous to Robinson, Dangerous" at all times. That's what this movie. B is hidden with a huge budget and a loyal fan base that will have to deal with everything. At the moment, the first two films have pulled their standards into the world.
