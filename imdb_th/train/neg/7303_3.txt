Cabin Fever is the first documentary film directed by Eli Roth.Roth and Randy Pearlstein co-wrote the story of Roth.this story. This is a zombie movie that is stuck with George Romero and his previous movie, Original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot talks about Sam Ramie's "Evil Dead". Nothing is original here and the story is not interesting. Actions about this genre are a failure. We have seen this movie before. He said that after the commercial success, without the artistic success of this film, Roth decided that he was the director and came out with viciousness, meaningless, brave, pointless. Should stop while he is behind Cabin Fever is not a good movie But when compared to the hostel, it is a work of art. I hope to have someone. (Especially psychiatrists) convince this man that filmmaking is a false occupation. Cabin fever 3/10 is weak because it is not so. Smal is a hostel.
