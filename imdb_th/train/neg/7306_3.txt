Indeed, one of the most horrible movies I've ever watched I never spent time writing one thing. But felt forced after seeing this movie in the making of the film and felt quite painful that wasted time with an unfaithful idea There are many parts that make me angry with perfection and lack of feelings. (For example, when the police will shoot people with infectious diseases, when the hospital will pass these people because of lack of treatment, why people who see He spied on his wife, walked outside in a robe while holding a gun while she rolled over the bed?) Character - as we almost expected in this movie - very bad (such as a blonde hair - I can't remember his frickin name and didn't throw it away - turning his back on his girlfriend and Running out of you) and I want all of them to see each other deeply! The production was horribly separated and the film had nothing to write to the house.
