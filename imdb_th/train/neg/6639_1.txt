It's very sad that Lucian Pintilie didn't stop making movies. They worsen every time. Niki and Flo (2003) is a stab at the camera. It is unfortunate that from many movies made in Romania every year, the worst thing is that they are sent abroad. (Such as the Chicago International Film Festival). This film that doesn't have a plot, performance or script is a waste of time and money. Score: 0.02 out of 10
