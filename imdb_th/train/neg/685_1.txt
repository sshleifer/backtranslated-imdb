My wife and I think that with the actors and directors of this film, it must be at least worth it. We are wrong. In fact, we give up after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young and Tone is in English. But speaking with an American accent for me is impossible to come through - hard to believe that this is English when no one speaks with an English accent. There is nothing chemistry between Crawford and everyone and to reflect on previous ideas, the idea that Cooper and Crawford declare their love for each other without reason. There is no reason to pay attention to any character, which is why we throw the towel half way. I find it hard to believe that Hawks is directing this because no actor speaks of Hawksian's trademark rats. So save your time and skip this one.
