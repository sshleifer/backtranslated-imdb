I just stumbled on this movie channel. My first reaction was 'Oh, God, no more!' It's very modern to play. Slow down today, it has become pretentious and straightforward. But for some reason I stayed and watched it until the end Maybe it's my belief in the actors, hoping that they will give me something to cheer. <br /> <br /> And of course, Ken and Helena can be shown. In addition, the movie continues in something better at the end and makes it a real point. Helena Bonham Carter also surprised me with her character. Jane has the average side that she uses to keep distance and drive out pity. Then she had a soft side looking for love. The only thing that surprised me more than that is the character of branagh ... This is a victory in acting for my own movie. Nothing special. <br /> <br /> See if you are a student, an actor or not. are Looking for pure entertainment, you can skip this thing. It's Sean Penn downright! Oh, it's a very serious story. It's a few jokes ...
