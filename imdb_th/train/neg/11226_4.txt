I would rather tear with DARK ANGEL. This movie appears to be a "love" tribute to the greatest pin-up that has ever existed - but there is very little "actual" content that the movie itself is pointless. real I can't see the motivation or the "point" of this movie - because there is very little biographical information provided in the lecture, so those who don't know much about Betty won't know much after watching DARK. ... <br /> <br /> This movie recorded the story of Betty's career in the last few years to create a slave model. Almost all movies include "New legislation" of Bettie's famous and repetitive photography. These redundant legislation took up 75% of the movie screened at that time. This film has a brief touch about her short legitimate performances and her next decision to leave "business" and become religious - but all this is quite a story. Shining ... <br /> <br /> DARK ANGEL is not a scary movie - it's nothing. The other problem is that the actress who plays Betty is similar to her in the distance This is a short segment of the zoo in the end credits. Obviously, this film has a very low budget. But do things that can be set and dressed wisely under limits - so there is no handful from me there. The show is beautiful and not impressive from everyone involved. In fact - the most memorable thing about this film for me has been observed at the end of the credit that the real-name actor of Irving Kao is Dukey Flyswatter. No jokes - check the list. actor Can't say that I recommend this one too high unless you are a true Bettiefile accomplice and must own anything related to you. And if you are a bad person, you must continue to treat ... 4/10
