Jenny Neumann (from the American sexual abuse of MISTRESS of the APES, Slasher HELL NIGHT and others) is Helen Selleck, an American actress who has been the lead in the production of the Australian stage. She is a virgin, because as a little girl she sees her mother having sex and accidentally causes a car accident that kills her. At the same time, the killer wearing black gloves prowling around the theater, causing people to break with broken glass. <br /> <br /> *** MAJOR SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> The killer is clearly seen as Helen (she speaks with the voice of the dead mother and washes the blood from her hand after the murder and sees that killing a fragile child with a bottle is broken like a little girl!) But this There is a POV camera breathing heavily for free and concealing the identity of The murderer ends up as supposed to be a surprise. <br /> <br /> All the actors seem to be obsessed with talking, having or trying to have sex and in one case, even blackmailing. Released and had quite a few naked and bloody images But without continuity, the photograph was gloomy and edited (by Colin Eggleston, the author and writer) was terrible. The setting of the theater for slasher movies was born. Soavi's movie of the same name and OPERA of Argento (both Couple better than this movie) within five years, though, and Neumann is quite hot.
