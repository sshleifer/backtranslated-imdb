This little show clearly has a boring little prequel / separation from the original series. <br /> <br /> Compare with the live action series. Live performances have funny stories and intelligent stories. While the animated series is a bittersweet version that is compact to allow young viewers to sub But I think children may feel bad about it. <br /> <br /> Every story is just Sabrina. Use magic to fix That is the basis of every concept. The most bizarre episode is when Sabrina uses magic to turn into jewels and jewels that will become Sabrina. So the jewel became a witch and hypnotized into her slave. This leads to an interesting strange scene. But quite interesting is that the Gem says "Just love me now" and Harvey hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like a god. (Which is quite correct because he controls her mind) but this stupid separation is not worth the time or effort
