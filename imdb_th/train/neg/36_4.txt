This movie looks too long, although it takes only 75 minutes. The problem with horror movies in the forest is that there are too many people walking pictures. (Through a dense forest, rocky cliffs near rivers or lakes) to give time to show This movie is worth seeing the ridiculous and boring native zombies that are often bloody eyes, often accompanied by a soundtrack that has a lot of breath and resonance. A lot of bad English dubbing, priceless female meats and stupid makeup on monsters and other extras for zombies / human flickers Is pretty light on AX But then I may not see the uncut version.
