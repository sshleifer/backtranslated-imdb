Good movie, which matter is bad. When the movie changes from "watchable" to "that switch & ^ @ _ + #! * OFF!" Where is it? Thank God for this DVD that can be borrowed from the library - for free! Similarly, thank God for the switch. "Fast forward" on the DVD player I feel sorry for those who have trapped the box office. <br /> <br /> At one point (I forgot that because now it's just blurry) "Our hero" Luke Wilson starts to work through traffic. I think he's looking for a taxi. At that point, when I surrendered, realizing that I didn't care whether he would find his car or be a garbage truck. <br /> <br /> The last time this movie was interesting was when Luke Wilson. Climb up Coming out of the trash, hair dryer in the hand and before finding "the heroine" Uma Manman, that scene ended with a purse that was hijacked and dangling without a way from the fire escape far beyond Luke and Uma. Separate When was the last time that the comedy and the scene? Flick ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Every time the movie tries to become "funny", it can't be done. Every time the movie approaches "Excited", this movie will go in the opposite direction. When musical scores may save lives from this chaos, the music remains empty and silent. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes are unnecessary and beyond death. Damage to scenes and unnecessary scenes and nonsense When Umar became a former fanatic fanatic, I felt like watching "The Virgin Meets Pulp Fiction"; That's when I realized that there was no return because I didn't like "The Virgin Year 40 years" and "Pulp Fiction" thoroughly. <br /> <br /> Luke Wilson's best friend, Rainn Wilson (see In the "Last" melancholy "Mimzy") does not add anything other than insulting the injury in this terrifying movie. Rainn Wilson, the king of television, weary should be with the media that is equally scary. Hey Renn Wilson! Leave a single full-length animation! Every time that Umar's rival, Anna Faris, appears on television, I expect Jason or Freddie or a terrifying monster to jump out of the scenery when you see Anna Faris in "Scary. Movie "That's all you've seen, no matter what the movie is. The character played by Wanda Sykes is just scary and out of place in this flick.
