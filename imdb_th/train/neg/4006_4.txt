For people who have never heard of this story (or seen in A&E), Cracker is an excellent British TV program about overweight and chain psychologists who smoke. A preacher named Fitz, a Manchester Police Department criminal assistant, is considered Is one of the best items that ever came out of England (And being saying something) and was very successful in England and around the world in 1993. <br /> <br /> Now, the traditional stars are Working with the original writer again to make it now available for another 2 hours. I love this program since I first saw it in the last decade. DVD box sets are honored in my collection and I can talk about Fitz's questioning scene was actually a statement of Robbie Coltrane's idea of ​​creating a new name for Jimmy McGovern for a new TV movie about Fitz. <br /> <br /> I'll start with one of the many things that impressed me about the original cracker series: Fitz's speed as a character. Five minutes at first? With his lecture (Throwing the book into the air) His drinking and insulting the guy after him in the gambling queue? And you know who is this character You may feel that he "clicks" in your mind. That kind of click happens when a great actor gets a great role written by an excellent writer. <br /> <br /> Coltrane still Excellent throughout the show But I always felt some later episodes? That is not written by McGovern? <br /> <br /> So the good news is: Fitz is back as soon as you see him on this show ?? Unbelievably inappropriate comments on the wedding of his daughter? You will feel "click" again. It is him: puzzled for a moment and apologized to the true, deep, always sincere, to the point of lack of flair. But funny, good in the process If you love this character as much as I can, you'll be happy with the way he expressed in the movie. And this includes Judith and Mark: Actually everything related to Fitz is completely handled. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with this movie revolves around crime. Fitz is trying to fix it as usual. Then Cracker fashion, we know exactly who is the first five minutes of the crime. The suspicion that saw Fitz figure out. In this case, we have a serial killer at American blood. And the cause of this, unfortunately, is not caused by mental injury Rather, it seems that the murder is only here for the writer to show his personal political beliefs. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to write this thing because I truly believe Jimmy McGovern is one of those. Write the greatest in the world. I have no problem with movies related to current issues or movies that have a political standpoint. But in the Nutcracker universe, we expect to see characters behaving like humans, unlike parody images. But Americans in this movie are all But appeared in all finished forms They do not know anything about the loud noise that complains about everything. Treat local people like shit and fool their wives? One of them can do the above things in less than 5 minutes. I honestly think that I will change the channel or something wrong. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't stop there. We are constantly reminded of how the war in Iraq is going. Reminder that does not involve the story and actually appears The killer is busy with Bush worse than Hitler, until almost forgot to kill. But until now, he was the mouthpiece for the political views of writers that he had forgotten to act like a convincing human being, and therefore we? As an audience, do not buy his sudden change from a family member who is blessed to the spirit of continuous torture. <br /> <br /> I can't say that this is the destruction of the show. Me or not? It's still a good TV, better than almost anything in the genre. (Mostly due to Coltrane again) But being politically continuous makes it impossible to be as good as a real classic cracker, such as "To Be A Somebody". Deal with more depth and psychological depth. <br /> <br /> Two other little issues: Beggars are not nearby. It's a disappointment. All police departments? Which is full of great characters for a long time - now filled with vanilla The police who completely changed their minds, which lacked any personality (how would you drain Richard Coyle's personality over me? But it really disappeared from here) <br /> <br /> There are also a few moments when the performance is gone. Confidence for me One instance revolves around Fitz, without limiting the entire population of Manchester from 1 million to hundreds according to very strange criteria. (French window, the computer will know how I have a French window.) He is not only successful in doing this. But he succeeded in less than an hour I don't think so. <br /> <br /> So all I feel is a little disappointed. I recommend watching it, but don't forget to expect at least. Even so, if there is a new series that will follow, it will be for the benefit: I believe that McGovern can still write great things, and perhaps now he can pull politics out of his system. Can write back About people
