I am a big Charlton Heston fan. He had no doubt that he was one of the greatest actors of all time. But what he thought when he made this movie Normally, if he does a bad movie, I can blame the screenwriter or director. But in this case it is all he The stupidity of this movie is all his fault. It proved that even Heston couldn't make Shakespeare's story interesting. I died 2 and a half hours in this snooze festival, and I wouldn't have time to come back This is THE WORST Heston movie that I have never seen before. If you are a fan of Shakespeare, maybe you find this movie fun. But if you do not waste time, you will have to regret in the long run.
