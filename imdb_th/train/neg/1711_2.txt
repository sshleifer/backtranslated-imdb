I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy. I thought it would be fun, not boring. That's what it is without having fun. This movie is absolutely unreasonable. It has no plot or character development or any story. The basic problem of this movie is killing and gore. Essentially killing every time is the same in all respects. ZOmbies tear people apart. Yes it's okay But you want to kill the original too I mean, it's really weak. Every kill seems the same in all respects. That's what I kill. I love the blood and blood in this movie, not doing anything for me. It's boring. There's no story. Just the same lame over and over again with others I want to like this movie as well. I like the video shot with blood ... like Redneck Zombies, but I can't tease myself. This film has a good point. But without the movie, I understand that many "zombies" help with flooding and there are over 100 zombies, which are quite cool as they participate and help the world But overall, this is a terrible movie.
