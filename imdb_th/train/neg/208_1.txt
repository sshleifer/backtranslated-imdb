A horror movie with a piece of Ramones scattered over a funny style that is worse than the average of 1970/80 for children who attend school with a strange plan. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who enjoys Ramones and bent school in the fight against their oppressive administration. Forget about this movie and watch anything like Wild Zero, starring Guitar Wolf. If you want an entertaining B movie Great performances, terrible writing, bad plot with stamps of Ramones approval that may require quick money. That's the only thing I can think of because this movie explodes.
