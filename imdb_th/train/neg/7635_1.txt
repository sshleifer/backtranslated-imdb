I agree with the review by Variety Examiners that this film has never been funny, lively or deep about the creative process as it should be. Said that it was too busy and the light was really a problem If this film should be a light-driven character that will not increase performance, and sometimes difficult to observe the facial expression of the actor Many non-South African expatriates will have trouble tracking English speaking in movies and local humor. Some will disappear in the process. I watched the movie at Cape Town Film Festival last year. The comments and reactions to the movie are in an unseen and sloppy range, until the departure from the movie about our painful past. Unfortunately, Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the brightest lights of South Africa's new wave. But some amazing films about our apartheid history will be ranked the best in 110-year-old movie history. It is not surprising that this film disappeared from theaters in Cape Town just two weeks after the Launched and from most theaters in Durban and Gauteng It has a clearly limited appeal among South African viewers.
