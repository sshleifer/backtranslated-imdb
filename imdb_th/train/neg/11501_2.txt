A thoroughly romantic and false vision of unemployment from the "artists", the middle class with comfortable parenting ... It is clear that the director, the author, has never experienced direct unemployment and of course, no personal experience its If you have to believe this nonsense, unemployed people of all ages behave like teenagers, without anger, no fear, no frustration, etc. All the characters live today with prank. They never look for work, things that are almost never rejected or anguish, etc. Living on Dole is like a summer holiday from school ... Special nonsense if you compare it to contemporary masterpieces. From the likes of Ken Loach and others
