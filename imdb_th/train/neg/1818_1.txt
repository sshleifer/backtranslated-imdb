Connie Hoffman is very beautiful and doesn't have an attractive part at all. <br /> <br /> Just that, the only reason to consider whether or not to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> During the 70s, this piece of sex was enjoyed by their old age. This is not possible. <br /> <br /> The script is not good, the acting is not correct, the direction is not good, and the idea of ​​having a senior man, the top romance of the guy is terrible. The title that hints about sex is a hoax. <br /> <br /> I would suggest avoiding this as an epidemic.
