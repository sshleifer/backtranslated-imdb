Somewhere I read that this movie should be a comedy. After seeing it, I would call it anything. The purpose of this movie has struck me. The conversation is superficial and nonsense. Many scenes seem to be thought later and even with nudity and sexual content implicit. There is nothing erotic about this movie ... making me wonder what this heck is about! The title may be the basis of fun. (If not politically correct) Jokes, but we are treated as cheap figures, skillful, incomplete and vicious and strange for their own sake. If I want that, I will go to buy the CD Jones free of debt.
