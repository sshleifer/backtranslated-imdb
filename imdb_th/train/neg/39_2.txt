The actress who created the movie in Africa was kidnapped and brought into the forest where she was detained for ransom. The manufacturer hired someone to bring her back. Everything complicated is that humans in the forest worship "god" that looks really ugly like eating naked women. <br /> <br /> This is a movie full of blood. There are a lot of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against nude people. It is a film that is designed to attract the darkest part of us and if this film is not boring, this movie will be classic. Let's face it, despite the blood, nasty sex and abuse, and this ugly monster movie is a nap. Walking will make you more enchanting. There are many plot lines that seem to occur separately, although in the end it all has one story. Worst of all, almost no one said anything. The slightest dialogue is mainly associated with a brutal protest or a character that "I will do what I want." It is a silent and boring movie. If it didn't happen because of the screams of the victims, I would suggest this as a sleep assistant. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that must be avoided unless you have to sleep or Unless you have to watch all Euro-human movies. <br /> <br /> (In addition, VideoAsia has just released this part of their Terror Tales series. Their type is a strange letter box. Which seems to be the result of Their prints from Japanese sources (with haze) that were cropped to delete the subtitles, their prints still do not have an open name)
