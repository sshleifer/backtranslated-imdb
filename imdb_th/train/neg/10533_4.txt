This model moved a little bit slowly for my taste and I thought I had a problem with this play to begin with. But the first film is a typical television movie of the play, which means that it doesn't have the original movie style with William Holden. What they can't afford to hire more than twelve people is special? Why should the movie be screened until 1966, then can you tell the sister about the Vietnam War protests? Why not try 1963 and tell the story of the civil rights movement for her? <br /> <br /> For the selection, some actors miss Jay O. Sanders hit the right note for his character, especially the scenes of He and Josh Brolin, on the other hand, Brolin missed a lot of records. He believed that he was a former BMOC jock, but he didn't have the sensation of William Holden. I always thought that Brolin looked a bit like a gorilla that would allow all women in the city to find him (Pun, pun). lovely But she looks too smart for the character she plays She didn't show the innocence or ignorance that the characters wanted. Maybe because she and Brolin are older than the characters for about 5 years, but Holden is over ten years old again. Bonnie Bedelia is quite memorable, while his mother Mary and Mary Bergen cannot decide whether to play Blanche Du Bois or Katharine from "The Taming of The Shrew" < br /> <br /> For Mr. Inge I have always felt that such stories of young women who choose the passion for actual use need to have an epilogue "Twilight Zone". I believe there is an epilogue that should be the "Spur of the Moment" episode at Diana Hyland, a minor Was chased by the elderly Diana Hyland because the younger Diana Hyland chose to run away with a guy similar to Hal Carter.
