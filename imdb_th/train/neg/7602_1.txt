One reviewer said that they almost walked away. If I am not with my wife who wants to live, I will leave. It's also a shame because I think it's probably a good movie. But this is one of the worst adaptation movies I've ever seen. It started nowhere and it went nowhere. (I want to say that it's going to get around fast. But actually it goes slowly ... pain slowly.) Sometimes there are hints that interesting things may happen or have depth under one character. But that's all we get - advice. There is no single pay or disclosure in all movies. Not that I want a plot that is slippery for entertainment ... I love studying the characters that are very crooked as the next indie movie But these characters cannot be combined Throughout the movie, you don't care what happens to a single movie. In fact, you almost start to hope that they will die because at least death may be more interesting than watching their unexplainable behavior which is strange and unpredictable that you think is interesting but not instead of Quirky characters, noir characters, knights, acting in a casually fashionable style, you immediately remember what it is: talented actors But with the opposite ability, contemplating and raising the eyebrows while reading strange conversations All this for two hours of perseverance, slow, painful, terrible.
