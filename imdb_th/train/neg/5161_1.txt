My life is about helping animals. I volunteered with the cat rescue organization. I am a vegetarian because I can't kill animals even to sustain my life. I can't kill spiders. I put it outside the house. The scene where a child throws a stone at the bird to death with the Sooner's involvement in trying to be accepted by other children makes me sick and haunt me since then. It makes me believe that the pathetic human being that they want to accept the ending - Foster parents soon adopted - not redeeming the image of the cruelty of animals. Why do everyone want children to watch this movie?
