I am an 11th grade student at my high school. In my current world affairs class, a child in class has this video and recommends us to watch. So we do I strongly believe that we went to the moon because my father worked for NASA. Although I think this movie is the worst thing I have ever seen But the person who created it has a serious ball First of all, he must show that JFK is right? And how dare he use the words in the Bible? The only good thing about this movie is that it sparked debate, which is good. B / c in my class. We have weekly discussions. This movie does nothing to change your mind. I think he and Michael Moore should work together and create another movie. Michael Moore's next film may be called "The funny thing that happened on September 11" or "The joke happened on the way to the White House."
