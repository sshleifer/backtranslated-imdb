Resnais Wow! The genius that brought Hiroshima Amar to the challenge of creating French musicals in the 1930s with bright colors. The opening of the sound with the name between the old embellishments is a good touch. Then the aperture of the camera will open. (Like an old hand) on a black and white sign, the camera turns back (Or more) suddenly showed us the surprisingly beautiful color of an elegant table set for a tea party. This is all in the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the song will start. Fierce, boring and memorable that there are 3 singers who talk about nonsense which is not related to this movie. (And yes, I speak French, so I can't blame it in the narration.) Those characters jumped out of the door and were replaced by a lot of people breaking into more memorable songs. Then they went out and finally Audrey Tautou appeared and we heard our first admirable dialogue in the 15-minute movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Resnais intended to do, starting with The waste of time and music, the hubbub, but the effect on the audience is to make you want to fling the screen and go out. <br /> <br /> It doesn't get much better. I'll tell you why There is no familiarity with any characters. We didn't see their faces half the time (because Resnais seems to intend to show scenes that are too expensive to pay attention to those in front of the camera). Close like a butterfly around the lamp and the audience can't focus on any person or plot, as if you were going to use every episode of Brady Bunch and compress it into a 2 hour movie with unrelated songs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps me watching all the time I do (1 hour) is that I watch the camera techniques, lighting and scenery that I can accept. But that is enough to pay attention to you for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe tomorrow I will try to see the end. Oops, I'm joking. I have important things to do. I'm sure you do as well across.
