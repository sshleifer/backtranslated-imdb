yuck! And again I say ... YUCK! The original version of this film is a well-directed story of a dead man and driving through hell. Many original movies have to say and don't speak. And it had a naked chicken on the motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This version made me feel that it was something that the manufacturer bought right and abandoned it from ignoring It seems that a group of people who have consciousness decide to adapt to the era and change their race and sex just to be cute. The film is not about the burnout of suicide in the final scene of the fight. It is about a man trying to go to the hospital to meet his wife. <br /> <br /> There is no reason for this movie to be created apart from making me angry ...
