This film, after-school specials, is not bad and that is a problem. Nothing happened. You feel as though you are still in class. A man taught a small group of underdogs how to be a good paintball player. We have never seen inferior people do bad things because good players are training them. They all became good players immediately by meditating. There are too many characters and no character development. Too much time to spend time with the main characters and his sexy sisters and not enough for other children. This may have the feeling of 'Bad News Bears' (original) because there is one woman in the men's team But without any feelings about this movie There is no feeling and leaving boring pain on your bones after watching it. It's not fun to wear a bag. It's not fun to watch and it's just ... plain. Boring. Something you have to watch out after school Before sleeping in the evening nap It's boring like a long day and it's been a long time before watching this movie.
