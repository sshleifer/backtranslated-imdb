Alas! This is one of the movies that you think you have checked before. But you don't do I mean, you don't give nonsense. In any way, it comes in your heart. <br /> <br /> Speak straight and short. This is one of the worst, boring and silly slashers ever made. I can't say anything good about this shit because there is an unbelievable sequence that can tell that it's done by a professional filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The death scene is horrible. No blood. This plot takes into account the fact that it copied "Popcorn" from 1991. <br /> <br /> To make things worse, this is not that bad movie. It's a bad story. <br /> <br /> Molly Ringwald tries to do his best. But not enough
