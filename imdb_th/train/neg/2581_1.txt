First of all, pulling out my own personal feelings, let me start by saying that I hate the comedies called all the characters, written and played so stupid that you are hurt if it's caused by breeding. <br /> Now I will say this, I saw the first three American Pie movies, and while they weren't the most amazing movies I've seen, they were all correct. (And instant masterpieces compared to the three "American" Pie Presents "movies) I still feel compelled to ask what they are thinking when they make this movie. <br /> <br /> I still There are other questions. <br /> <br /> Does anyone think that this is the use of studio and production sources that are acceptable? <br /> <br /> Who is the author of the final script? (And that person smokes when they approve) <br /> <br /> And finally, why everyone thinks it should be released in theaters where the average admission fee is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on the location Where you are when it goes straight to the discount tank at Blockbuster or Wal Mart? <br /> <br /> There's nothing wrong with this movie that I can't really write a comprehensive review because it will exceed the words that Allow maximum in the form So I tap <br /> <br /> The story is not boring and stupid, and the characters are as interesting as watching the dry colors for eighty minutes. But the greatest thing I saw wrong with this movie is the show <br /> <br /> While most actors don't have the ability to be forgotten in the next few years, <br /> <br /> The greatest name in this film is Eugene Levy, who spent almost all of his time on the screen with a smile that knew this on his face that told the audience. "I know this is not Not funny and I'm losing my ability. But wait, I get compensation for anyone interested. "He didn't try to make his jokes funny. (He deserves better than this garbage) <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the rest of the actors are scary, although some people are on a really great TV show. Tyrone Savage (from The classic Canadian series at At My Back) plays characters that are unbearable, different and annoying. (There are many things that he can teach to skin diseases in the tropics) that you almost want him to die slowly and painfully on the screen. Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) scrutinizes what he is capable of. In this movie <br /> <br /> Maybe the next movie in this series may be a soft core porno with a story so that they will get through the MPAA and get R ratings. This issue Along with pointless nudity and pointless sexual content that should be ranked X (the rating committee must be drunk or drug when they watch this movie for ranking) <br /> <br /> It's interesting that twenty-five years ago, when Wes Craven sent A Nightmare On Elm Street to the MPAA to check the ratings, they forced him to cut the picture twenty-five seconds. (I believe it is part of The death scene with the silicone cast of the breast inside) to avoid scoring X and he has no other choice but to do or the movie will not be released. <br /> <br /> But like this Of unnecessary trash, can get R rating today because it's done in the name of comedy. If this movie is a drama or horror movie with this type of content, it has a very bad smell in the content and it will get The fear of rating X <br /> <br /> The last thing that bothered me is writing this movie written to play like a dream of a twelve-year-old boy with a sexually exaggerated fantasy. The youth is particularly crass in almost every situation that should move the body in this movie. Call the plot to follow the telegram so that the discerning audience can see it far and and the character is called Only the pattern of the pattern of stereotypes has never shunned the often nasty sexual references and unnecessary scenes. Feeling like this movie was written by the first-year hacking that is incompetent in the low-rent movie writing class. <br /> <br /> Long and short of the time to kill this series before. It will be more confusing, stupid and disgruntled. This pie is full of apples.
