This may be a gay couple of Gone With The Wind that has been long. But it made himself satisfied by being a large empty episode that nothing happened The characters have one dimension and there is no other development in the story (no real story as well) than looking for each other and kissing each other. It is a shame that the aesthetic appeal that is so interesting that almost no dialogue is completely lost in the film, rather than trying to examine the psychology of the character in honor and receiving true emotional reflection. Moreover, it pretends to be a movie "art" using the innocent clich√©s that are the worst of the movie's head. However, if someone is able to identify with a heavy banal, I guess that's okay.
