After hearing this for many years, I decided to rent and watch. Let me start by saying that I'm glad that the rental is free from the local library. This move is slow, boring, unrealistic, and the plot is not reasonable. After 2 hours, I was ready to intercept the quiet Texas city and allow those characters to escape from their misery. I know that the taste is personal. But believe me, I don't understand all the ads I've heard about this movie. Dallas gives a great detail of life in Texas like this movie. Rent only if you want to understand that a movie studio can pay the inspector to convince people that bad movies are good.
