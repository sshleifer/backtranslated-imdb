Movies: There are interesting comments about this film. It's truly scary. Not spending enough money on movies and the way Spike Lee created it seems to be a combination of indie movies and action scenes. Characters / Actors: Denzel has done "straight" in what he did in All movies are therefore not surprising there. This is a little mind game for readers. Think about 10 films of Denzel quickly. Now let's count how much they play as police / detective / bodyguards. Clive Owen, hmmm. This guy needs a better role in his plate soon. His best performance is I think in "Beyond Borders". In addition, he did the same thing he did in every movie. His voice and his way of speaking are similar to what he did in "Sin City". Of course, this man knows about acting. What he doesn't know is how to choose a better role. He desperately wants a better agent. Jodie Foster is great in the movie if you are watching her for the first time in your life. She can do better She has a better role. It happened in Hollywood, even the greatest stars were kneeling down and taking a low level role like Jodie Foster in this movie. Synopsis: The story is not true. I think about the plot. The story is actually the whole movie while leaving the Chinese dinner. I mean, come, **** Spoiler on the way ----> I'm bored with unnecessary Haulocast and Racism token. This film about bank robbers why choose to use Haulocast and Racism. There, playing with the emotions of the people, not me. The police let the bank robbers think they were hostages, Riiiiiiight. Please, we are talking about the police and US security here. No one knows where Clive is. I mean, they don't find anything different from that room. Who are we joking? Conclusion: Of course, go watch this movie. If nothing else, you'll have time to talk to friends about how bad this movie is. At least people won't think you're stupid to go to watch this movie because they think you watch it because it has a big star "MISTAKE"
