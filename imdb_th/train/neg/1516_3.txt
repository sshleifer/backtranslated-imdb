Although THE FLOCK has a great performance by Richard Gere, who has some experience and pictures that may make someone come back to the silence of The LAMBS, but this film creates credibility for the breaking and breaking point. Br> <br /> This movie is about Erroll Babbage (Gere) working for the safety department and is preparing to retire. His office extended him to Allison Lowry. (Claire Dennis) who found that Basque was obsessed with his work quickly. And the work is not fun at all He examined hundreds of sex offenders who were parole in his jurisdiction. Allison went with Erroll to check the "swarm" of the perpetrator and knew he was looking to retire, but Erroll was good at his job, although his methods were not good. He mocked the sex hunters and still had a physical conflict with them. Erroll demonstrated his actions by bringing up the past deviants'. This is "good reasoning" that challenges the audience at some level to make us Saw that Erroll was cruel and how he became an outsider (By approaching his job too much) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When a teenage girl disappeared in the "space" of Errol, he jumped to the conclusion that she was right. Kidnapped by one of his sheep But how can he know? Erroll is good at his job? Allison challenged him and Errol pushed back. Their fights are more intense as Erroll needs to find missing women. <br /> <br /> Although the settings for this matter are okay, but there is no umpf! I will give credit to Richard Gere, who plays Erroll's character very well. Fighting for retirement Worried about everyone near his flock Tired of the people he is responsible for Tired of yourself because you have to do something he does There is quite a change in the character's depiction for Gere, but above all he has more. Some scenes are ok. (Dark and dangerous) But there are many other issues that are laughing. <br /> <br /> I will be the first to admit that suspending unbelief is necessary every time I watch a movie. But the bottom is limited. The greatest driving force against those limits is the destruction of the critically important crime scene. Someone who is just like Erroll will know that moving the body will not be large. Or trampling through the crime scene Or moving evidence It passed and made this film endless. <br /> <br /> Another part of the film's damage is that we have never received Allison's character in Clair Danes. She almost Will be left on the side at the end of this movie and we never give up on her intention: will she stay or go? Will she end up with Erroll? If she's still? This is not a scary movie because it touches some moral ground that is uncomfortable. But the overall story needs to be tightened up
