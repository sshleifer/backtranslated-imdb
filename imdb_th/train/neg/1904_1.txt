=== A little spoiler === <br /> <br /> I'm a Jerry Bruckheimer fan. So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging in front and the trailer before MI: 2, the expectations were increased. Jerry Bruckheimer's production, the great Nic Cage car, and fresh from Oscar-Angelina Jolie. some? A lot. <br /> <br /> The script is not funny. (Which is hard to be) and exciting You put black people who often say jokes about racism about yourself and Wooh-haa !! Are you funny? I don't think so. That excitement is gone from the picture first (and this may be said many times). There are no sympathetic characters. Who cares who is killed? If you can assume that the psychosis will kill Nick's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, the next thing you know is Kip (brother) is walking with Nick in the street. Excited? Thinking that not from then the best bit is the love between Nic and Angelina. Actually, she looks tired of talking about these stupid things for Nick. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' 'Do you see anyone?' 'What happened?' Etc. <br /> <br /> Then there was only one spark of hope, that was a chase car. They were disappointed to say little because the sample made it look like it was full of them and only one. The camera is very long, attached to the exciting camera movement. I'm really having trouble tracking action. <br /> <br /> Is it an action movie? Scary movie? Romantic comedy - no need to decide, just avoid this mess. I will give 3 out of 10 stars and I feel that I am generous.
