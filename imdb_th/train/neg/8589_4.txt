First, let me take this post by saying that I'm a fan of the original Star Wars movie ... I didn't read books, play games, wear underwear or eat cereals (if any). I'm just a big fan of Movies <br /> <br /> When I say that, I try to see how people watch this movie. Shoot this movie by yourself and don't compare it to a terrible previous version (EP 1, 2). I don't understand how you can say that it's an amazing movie. For all the terrible shortcomings in the dialogue, the magic dialogue, the scenes that were fabricated (such as suddenly R2 being a bad guy and the long CGI chase scenes with a little human touch). What is this story? There is no real internal problem within Anakin. It seems that the switch is flipped and he is evil immediately. I didn't care about the movie until 20 minutes ago (which at that time was destroyed by the "NOOOOOO!" Frankenstein scene). When you BOMBARD, the screen has a very impressive CGI effect and fill the space too. Torpedoes are extremely cruel when there is much more to be had and should be said that this is not a great movie. For movies with a "dark" tone that is too light in every character's speech. <br /> <br /> I'm closed. Question: From the beginning to the end of the movie, there really is a sense of urgency and importance to things. Is that going to happen?
