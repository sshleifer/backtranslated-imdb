Guy Richie's third suitable movie (not counting the terrifying "Swept Away" God is a complex action movie about gambling, gangster and chess. Richie's fans have tried to hate the Revolver as much as I do. Rich Stalwart Jason Statham plays Jake, a newly-released former jailer, to revenge the ridiculous Dorothy Macha (OTT Ray Liotta is excellent) but is back with other couples (one of which is Andre 3000 The suite Rap Outkast) who gives him and us, the audience, the number of herring red throughout the whole thing becomes boring very important issues of the clutter of the film is a little restaurant. Down in favor of a superb shot, slowly shoot Mo to set Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. All in all, Revolver is a flawed job. Not really scary, but far from Richie. It's best to still lock the stock if the movie. This story is Homework at the school assigned to score 'must try more!'
