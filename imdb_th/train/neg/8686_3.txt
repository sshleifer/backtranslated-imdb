I'm marking this as a "spoiler" just because of my opinion about the content of the program, not the content itself. <br /> <br /> When I read the comment, it's clear that the Republican Party Resistant to any show But insulted while the Democrats seemed to enjoy the truth called One reader (It seems) actually indicates that he believes that these events occur or may occur when Bush is in primary school. <br /> <br /> But for the content I see it tries to be neutral. The group that created this series must really hate Bush. When I saw the latest s02e03, it shows that the program must stay together long before McCain becomes a front runner for the nomination; Because other former front-runners are featured. <br /> <br /> Another thing that catches my attention is the use of cabinets. I think the series must be done in Europe, certainly not in the United States because I know that there are no homes in the United States that are not built in the closet and are most likely in the artist's house. <br /> <br> in As I watched the program, yes, I was caught up with it. I was surprised to see that what the writer wanted to do was what they could do to make our president embarrassed. Of course there are problems that most Americans agree. But that there is no reason to show hate in public performances around the world Perhaps the current has been determined by this program and network, so if Obama or Hillary comes in, will they continue to produce and broadcast the same "humor" with them? <br /> <br / > Another comment on the criticism If there are some changes in the election back in 2000, according to the writer, he was confident that there would be a completely different president. Wow, wishing for his part As far as the event reached 911, I believe it was re-used when Clinton was the president and I couldn't see if Gore was the president.
