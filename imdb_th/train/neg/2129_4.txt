In my humble opinion, BDWY, this great musical drama, has only two things to happen - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a version that was shot with the original script. (OK, Vanessa Williams is a remarkable thing) But for me, that's all there is. Most actors seem to walk through the show - Chynna Phillips doesn't know who Kim really is, and it's no surprise that people walk across Harry McAfee when played by George Wendt, who seems to be sitting back in a bar stool in Boston. Jason Alexander can pass But the wig had to go and I saw a better dance in Bugsy Malone. As I said, it's good to have a version of this script. But I hope the kids there who have never seen a musical before, don't judge them all in this story.
