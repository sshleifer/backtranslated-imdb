I mean, I think I heard this conversation in the movie. But it was terrible and out of place which I couldn't believe it I laughed so hard about what had to be written and the worst performance in human history. I was very worried that I might have a heart attack and died there in the cinema. <br /> <br /> So here Is The scene that I'm talking about "Hero" just watched. His brother broke and his brother's car exploded there, just a few feet away from him (the hero). Something to be troubled and people trying to keep him from running into a burning car. <br /> <br /> Right in the middle. Mood swings, he said "I'm very sorry" - he said, right? I'm crazy?
