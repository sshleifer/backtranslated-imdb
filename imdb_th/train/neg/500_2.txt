The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance - It's a laughing name. It's the most misunderstood. It is not surprising that filmmakers try and make us misunderstand that because of this terrible film > Very little happens in this movie. And when something makes the audience awake from his stupor, it is probably an unintended joke in the form of a brutal dialogue sent by a group of desperate artists These guys are so bad that they created actors who sounded like a group of mentally retarded people. It's hard to determine how bad the performance is when you polish this deep voice. But the sound artist can't be blamed for the script. It is an imitation Funny without intention, the best, the most pitiful. The general story is to say at least unevenly. The female character is especially idiot; Men are disgusting or boring. <br /> <br /> All organizations lack the advantage from the audience. It didn't give the promise from a distance, and even when the murder (eventually) began to happen, they all happened outside the screen. All we get is a few headless shots. <br /> <br /> Some people say that this movie is Jilli's. I can't agree with this comment less Everyone who enjoys the Italian thriller should have this movie as wide because there is nothing exciting from this movie. In general, it's a softcore porn movie with a horror angle. But it's not very erotic. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this to anyone.
