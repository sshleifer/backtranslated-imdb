"Stella Dallas" in 1937 with Barbara Stanwyck, not yet underage, as everyone thinks that the story in the semi-updated version will work now as a real puzzle. Sometimes they may think of themselves cheerful and cheerful. Betty Middler may make some things escape. But the script, this poem, can overcome her Plan for a bartender with an illegitimate child, and many years later let the girl go to find a wealthy father of the child so that she can shoot a better life. Midler works best with the movie director. Able to control her excesses But that didn't happen here. Stephen Collins was stumped when the man who changed her life But Trini Alvaro is a good actor as the daughter of Midler. This is what was once called "Picture of a woman" is a hollow, but it does not pass the rally because it remains faithful to the origins of the 1930s * 1/2 from ****
