Don't let the name of this movie fool you. In fact, the character Jake Speed ​​is probably the most lazy hero action ever known. When Jake Speed ​​did not help the virgin from the evil madman, which he often did not do, he was seriously relaxed. Maybe this adds to his charm. But in my opinion, action heroes should not "Chill out" whenever he has a chance In addition, unlike others who have the courage to have impressive abilities, this guy doesn't have it unless you call that special ability. However, this movie is worthless. In general, writing is not important and action when there is something that is very lame. (The machine gun on the Jeep is not bad. But it's about it) So if you're in the mood to watch this insomniac movie that is right for you - there's a hero who not only makes himself sleep But also makes his audience
