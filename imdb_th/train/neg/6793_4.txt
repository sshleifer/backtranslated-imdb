The dusty western skin from Richard Brooks, the director who is obsessed with the genre while still retaining the original idea Horse racing in the early 1900s attracted low cowboy (Gene Hackman), gentle gambler (James Coburn), cocky boy (Jan Michael Vincent) and even FEMALE (Candice Bergen game of surprise). (With the predictable conflict that women should participate in or not), this thing becomes a fair watch, even if no one is involved Looks good if the parts are too long, bustling and handsome. But the mechanism of the plot is boring quickly ** from ****
