A wonderful book that has excellent qualities and a deep understanding of human nature, especially the nature of addiction. Nothing special. The photographer had an unfortunate addiction in the loop and swirling and looping everything, causing the audience to feel nauseous. Why did the director not stop this story over me - but maybe he was too busy and tried to fail to draw a good performance from a great actor as usual? But not suitable Summary of weak adaptation Your three hours should be spent reading. (Or repeat reading) better
