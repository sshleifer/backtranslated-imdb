This film has no plot and no focus. Yes, it should be a funny movie. But screen writers don't know what this movie is about. Even the title is not consistent with the movie. It should be called "Ethan Cool" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something like that. The characters didn't develop and no one was interested in what happened to them! Female roommate character (From the 70's show) is the only one worth watching. She is hilarious and steals every scene that she enters. Others must make sure that their college diplomas are in the works because they want a career other than acting
