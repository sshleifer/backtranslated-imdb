Before watching this movie, I had very low expectations and went to see the car. Eventually I regret it for that reason. The plot is almost non-existent. That character development doesn't exist. There is a clich√© and jaw mania in the movie that I can only stare and wonder how it was released. If it is not a joke, I would not have rated this movie as 1. The effort in the story that is linked is destroyed by the true absurdity of the high-class race. In fact, the plot of the movie is predictable and has a simple mind that ordinary children can tell most stories. Bad performances, bad plot, bad jokes, bad movies <br /> <br /> Can't see Gran Turismo HD instead. It will make you crave in a fast, sexy car without leaving a taste. Bad
