The movie Blair Witch - War, which is a dwindling story like Bwitch! The name says it all, save your money and time and use it in such great movies. "Once upon a time in America", "The Shawshank Redemption" or "Enemy at the Gates" (If you want to see the ultimate movie "War") etc. <br /> <br /> This movie if it's Baseball and Major Leagues are the pinnacle and Single A is the new face. This movie is a high school ball. It was filmed as if it were a high school drama club filmed with the old camera of the father. Sure that they enter the hostile area (To make a movie) but I don't call this brave man, we call it a normal fool! This is a pass! Now go see it and you tell me what you think.
