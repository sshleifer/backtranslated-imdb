The story of a woman (Ann) on her deathbed, her two daughters. (Nina and Constance) and her thoughts about her past An event involving the weekend that Ann Young was in her friend Lila's wedding. At the wedding, she met Harris, which would affect her for the rest of her life. Throughout her life and career and family life, she recognized him as her true love. Her daughter, Constance, is older than "responsible" for the mother of two people and has many things together. Nina hops from her boyfriend to find a boyfriend and find work and is not sure that she has a life direction. br /> First of all, the details of the moments in the movie are great. Dresses, hair, cars, houses, etc. give you real time and place. And have very high quality performances in movies Vanessa Redgrave is quite good at showing the main character and the fragile mind when her life ends. Claire Danes is beautiful and works well as the main character when she was young. (And she is an outstanding singer) Hugh Dancy brings life to the character of Lila's brother. <br /> <br /> Now, the bad thing, unfortunately, is everything else. The impact on the story continues because it is unfolding to us. The chemistry between Ann and Buddy is still very small. They enjoy and dance. If so, you should believe that she doesn't like him more than friends and doing so makes her annoyed. And i think all "He may be gay." There is a blue color and is not used for purposes. <br /> <br /> Then we have Harris. The characters act as wood and creepy. If this is another type, you know that Harris is a serial killer from the beginning. It is an unbelievable idea to think that every woman loves him very much. (But they showed other men as crippling people who should try and help him out) <br /> <br /> and the greatest problem of all Why does Ann and Harris come together? They fell in love They have a great sex tonight in the garden's old dirty cottage. Go home to find out about Buddy's tragic end ... <br /> <br /> Nothing. <Br / > <br /> They met a few years later and received all the eyes with fog about me and I couldn't help. But wonder why? This film does not let you know why they are forced to marry another person, so I feel very sorry for them. <br /> <br /> Part of the current story is boring enough. Ancient good daughters and bad daughters, ancient ideas Nina has changed over the duration of the movie. But I'm not sure why I'm not sure what caused her to change her life. There was a "touching" scene where the daughter was connecting with the old Ann, who dreamed that she was chasing butterflies. It's really lame and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "No mistakes." Ann suggested us. Such statements are not true for the story. And it is not true after watching the movie and hoping that they will not lose the ability of such a good actor
