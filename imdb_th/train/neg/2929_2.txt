No joke - how can anyone connect this to Monty Python? That's absolutely ridiculous - no laughter. This is not a joke. Above all But ugly, strange, just for the sake of, and it seems to me, these people have something all the time Unfortunately, something that doesn't make them funny One rock, hmm .... Because of the laughter, it is hardly a problem. <br /> <br /> Maybe I will do this unfairly. Some art - in this case nothing happens. <br /> <br /> But these guys play the voice of a woman who has a sharp voice !!! Not funny. <br /> <br /> There is only one heir who sees wisdom, Monty Pythons and that is Stephen Colbert and perhaps Jon Stewart.
