It is important not to be despised without reason or common sense and those who have "Gray matter" will accept that this movie is not working. <br /> <br /> The problem arises in the direction. Selection and lack of depth in character creation Funny words are very difficult things to say when I expect to laugh when using these words. Let's look at the problem in the direction / script. <br /> <br /> Both brothers and sisters in their mid-30s seem to be able to adapt well. They met a complete stranger in the park and the characters of Heather Graham came to her and asked the most intimate question that even half of the senses still ran the other way. Then he walked slowly and made a stupid statement and she fell in love with him. After one day they all went out together, he fell in love with her and decided to get married in Vegas for a week. Hello, everyone feels silly? He went out with thousands of women and he found this person who spoke about 10 words that we saw on the screen and he wanted to marry her. But it is not reasonable Of course, it's a romantic comedy and I want to believe that I can. But the direction makes it completely flat. <br /> <br /> Heather now falls in love with her, and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan Kiss or more, to the point that it is the most terrifying kiss ever. I find that it's not exciting and unobtrusive, and while many people say that Heather can't be shown, I think the truth is Heather is clearly wrong for this chapter. <br /> <br /> This is the debut of Sue Kramer as director and for me it's too much for you to chew. It requires a lot of skill to make this film work, and IMHO can do it with better writers, including casting and direction.
