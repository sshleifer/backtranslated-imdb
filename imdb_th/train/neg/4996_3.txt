I enjoyed the first half hour of this movie. But wow, is it changing? Should I say that "Just an idiot." This is another example of an outdated humor. It may be a joke in the 1940s, but not now .... Not closed. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interesting to watch. I like him very much, especially when he starts to change from a boyish image and the high voice of the musical Busby Berkeley to the place where he grows and listens to it. <br /> <br /> He is fine as "Jimmy MacDonald "But the other actors of the actor have just played the most stupid character, Raymond Walburn of Maxford House Coffee Company, who can't do anything but yell all the time. He is cruel to hear and is a huge damage to the movie.
