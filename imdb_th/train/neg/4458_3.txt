Most French movies I've seen and enjoyed talking better than action. But it's okay I find that they are interesting, well photographed and have interesting actors. (However, at one point I wondered if Gerald De Paradigy was in all French films that had been done!) <br /> <br /> This movie has interesting images and slots Good turn But then it became more talk, talk and talk .... which is good for the drama But not for the murder mystery After a moment I almost fell asleep to see this thing. <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie is like a play with almost all scenes played in one room. So if you love drama, you should like this ... but I want more stories.
