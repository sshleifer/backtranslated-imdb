I just watched the movie for the first time. I want to see it as I like Drew Barrymore and want to watch her first movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a woman (played by Drew Barrymore, who is young and beautiful) who moved from NYC went to LA in order to overcome the losses that had happened recently. Shortly after moving with a man who fell in love with her, it became apparent that she had a twin = doppelganger that haunted her. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite bad and lousy. Both conversations and performances make this film not worth seeing. In conclusion, it's just something for Drew Barrymore fans.
