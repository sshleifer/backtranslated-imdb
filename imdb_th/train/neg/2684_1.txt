I found a film that offended the American people who lost someone in the tower to the American people in general. Pretending to be a respect for the horrific facts that occurred in the past year, each director used the opportunity to argue with the old facts (which are not involved in terrorist attacks) or criticize the political behavior America or comparing various political situations Countries that do not have this thing to do or share with the cruelty of the 11th September make them shameful.
