I am a special person in the big explosion. I just had a safety in the workplace for the race scene at A.I.R. As you know, thanks to my scene in the first few minutes of the movie and I don't have to sit and watch all. It's a bigger party than the movie set. But hey, the wages are good, attention to detail is not the strength for this job. But who knows the joke, sees the car in the track The speed is really slow. In this movie, it accelerates to normal speed. Many scenes change because they are filming. I think that will save cost and time. But everyone has a good time to take care of!
