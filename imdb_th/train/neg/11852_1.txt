This movie should be a picture of a young man who is ready and willing to settle all. However, I don't care about his mission to settle down because I don't care about his role. I do not understand what these beautiful women see in him. He has no class or is certainly charming. At least he should have a way about himself that makes a woman weak in the knee, in addition to playing his saxophone. But not useful Just because he is a musician doesn't make him sexy. Not to mention what he did to get the attention of married women. He fell in love for five minutes knowing that she was evil and absurd. Is this man ashamed of this? If he organizes and stops doing and speaks of stupid things, he will look more interesting as a character. But alas, his character is polite and boring. <br /> <br /> Gina Gershon's character is British. She is probably a frustrated person with her normal voice, rather than a poor English accent, which may sometimes disappear from the movie. <br /> <br /> The two characters I am interested in are fish and frogs. Now both have chemistry! Academy nominations for both? the chart! The plot hole lacks character development, scary performances, unnecessary drama, clich√© moments ... This movie is a messy story.
