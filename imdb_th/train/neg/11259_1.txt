I gave 1 story to this movie. I do not understand how Ettore Scola, one of the best Italian film directors, can do this kind of silly and ridiculous movie! The whole story of the people involved in this film is ridiculous, boring and uninteresting. Too long, too boring The only thing I recorded in this movie is Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. Hopefully Scola will change the style and style strongly in his next movie.
