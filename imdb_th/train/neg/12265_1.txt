The special effect of this movie is that, especially during that time, it is ridiculous and is used in a way that emphasizes that you cannot deny their existence. <br /> <br / > The show defines the words in Meg Foster's hands and Richard Joseph Paul, where Julie Newman and Andrew Divoff recently redefined "bad". <br /> <br /> Spoiler *** *** < br /> <br /> The charm in this story The movie can be found in two things: first is the selection of the best performers of Carel "Lurch" Struycken as a mysterious psychic who can experience where and when people will die and stay there always. <Br / > <br /> The second is the first discovery. The combination of SF-Western is original, if scary. But other searches are more original, such as the Zack Stone gunman who can feel the pain of the person he shot. (Even though his performance is reduced here)> <br /> Overal ... didn't watch this movie unless you love Carel Struycken, a big old man who is cruel as the Dutch should respect.
