Imagine changing the American national song into a cartoon. Throw a few cute animals, play with a pair of roller skates, and you'll find yourself a realistic replica of this movie. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing when I was still. child I made my mother rent from the video store about 5 times. The character was not too bad. It's just what Marx looks like. Something to complain. <br /> <br /> If you don't like America, you Will not like this movie
