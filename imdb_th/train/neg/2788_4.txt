There are many people who write about Purple Rain. The biography of the musician "Quin Nee" but I came here to tell you that this movie is not deserving of high praise. <br /> <br /> First of all, we come. See each other One thing that Prince is a great musician and music is one area that Purple Rain is good at. Even the score is mesmerizing and if this is the only filming in the concert movie, it will be a great experience. Unfortunately, it's not like that and the movie has some problems. <br /> <br /> First of all, the acting is horrible. The writing of the Prince's character "The Kid" should come out because of a few lonely mysteries. Unfortunately, this thing just came out of repetition. The lonely character should at least have a talkative time. Unfortunately, the character of the prince rarely had a few conversations in this movie and it was hard to believe that he wanted a girl like this. It seems that everything will go a little, which is a shame, because you can tell that this is a fiercely conflicting character and a very complicated life. But we are not allowed to go in. <br /> <br /> The surprising aspect of this movie is what happened in the concert. It seems that the life of the prince and Morris will sit in the back seat at the show here, which I think is reasonable from a business perspective. But it was boring to have 2 hours of movies, which seemed to be halfway on the stage. <br /> <br /> So to conclude: This is not a very good movie.
