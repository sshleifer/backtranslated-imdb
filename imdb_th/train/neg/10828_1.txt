That's not just my decision in this movie. But also what is written about it Now, don't understand me wrong here. I'm not a Philistine. I don't hate movies because it's not enough like 'Police academy 9' or whatever. I'm more fun than having high eyebrows. Or something that has art. I swear <br /> <br /> 'Magnolia' is not good and I am sincerely surprised why it has been praised. Long flowing, passionate about themselves, nonsense, traveling from beginning to end. There is only a little credibility that is something people love about movies. There are actors that are reasonably high and no one changes the average performance or worse. In addition, my wife (Tom Cruise's self-confessed hatred) told me that it was the best performance of his career. But the plot does not have a complete tangible zigzag between the stories of many characters that are loosely connected in the snail's rhythm, even when important events. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help that no character can be easily identified or sympathetic. (I do not think so But I don't like most people who accept). They play a life story that is not quite long-handled, showing the character's shortcomings and emotions in the intricate details and showing a deep and profound relationship. Their meaning goes to the level that n Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack of the soundtrack is also bad, with the annoying quality of the bone marrow that I had previously thought of as the identity of the song. <br /> <br /> The Morisette It Morisette was fun enough now 'friends' repeated several times while being urged periodically in the ribs by a nanny goat is not satisfied. Although frogs and frogs are quite good
