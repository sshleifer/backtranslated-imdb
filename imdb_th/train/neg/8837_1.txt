This movie is terrible. I really look forward because I think "Lantana" is great. <br /> <br /> The following review may contain * Spoilers * <br /> <br /> ***** < br /> <br /> First, good things: it looks good. Some performances are ok. The bad thing is everything about it. <br /> <br /> The story that you might know about some blokes that go fishing and discover the body with a twist that they found on Friday. But still fishing and reported on Sunday when they returned Is a mobile phone range However, the movie takes time. (The boy spends time) to enter this central activity. <br /> <br /> From all the characters. (About a dozen) It seems that nobody likes another person (that is, I think it is consistent because they all don't like it). I was very frustrated with the failure to explain how the characters are related and how. It's not near the end of the movie that I can create a tree. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of an incredibly scary movie that is a fall. The structure of the story in the lives of the characters seem to be bad before you leave to go fishing. When you set it too high, it will be difficult to kill others. <br /> <br /> There are stupid logic, murderers leaving bodies in the lake, and then drifting down the mountain for a distance. Many miles Fishermen walked out on Sunday morning. But for some reason Bern returned home late after his wife went to bed. Then the first thing the next morning, the police hit the door to let him come down to the station. Hmm, didn't they ever hear about the phone? Down at the media station, knowing the whole story less than 24 hours after they reported the body? <br /> <br /> The complete disappearance of this story is a debate about whether Blokes is certain after they find the body. This is a mystery - everyone asks them. And the audience asked the same question (Discussion about what to do with the body is an important scene in "Liberation") I know what I do in their situation. Some people want to walk out to cars, drive to mobile phones, call police, wait and they will bring them back to the location. If others wait at the camp and fish, who will be interested? <br /> <br /> All this seems to be wrong. The only thing that really dawned was that while the young woman was black, the native people in the area seized the actions of fishermen as a class - "I wouldn't have done if a white girl." <br /> <br /> There is no interest, curious to see who will kill the girl. (I think the story once mentioned) and there is no mystery while the audience sees the killer in the opening scene. <br /> <br /> I sat there with boredom and confusion when the rotation - didn't exist. In the plot, but as a theme, suddenly it became a story about the quiet dignity of the lost indigenous tribe which led to the ludicrousness that ended with the inconsistency of healing. Black color, white. <br /> <br /> This is an Australian movie "at the best" according to The Age.
