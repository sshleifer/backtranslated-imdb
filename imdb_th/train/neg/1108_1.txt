Puffy, boring and pointless (fluffy, bloody, but fluffy). The script is not good with a lack of consciousness and wood. You don't care about the characters. (Of course, even if the actor himself) will live or die. Grace or charm, little action, pointing to all things Perhaps some settings and settings may be interesting - the space between the boards of all buildings may be true to the way of life. The confrontation with that frame is unnecessary and distracting, and the character of Hoppalong Cassidy is boring and ineffective.
