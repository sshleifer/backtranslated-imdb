As one of the few reviewers who had never seen the first movie, I found that the movie was very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Yes, it has an awkward sense of humor. If you can (high ) Suspicious evidence. However, it failed in depth in important areas. <br /> <br /> There is a plot of thin and ridiculous lines related to Gordon's Sinclair's kind friend who may or may not. Not being surrounded by Together On the computer for free ... or it may not be ambiguous, long-lasting and ineffective The lack of an important end is very irate and all that is present is all pompous and irrational. This film ends in half. <br /> <br /> The disbelief is very difficult when seeing a very attractive young teacher (Maria Doyle Kennedy) can attract Gordon Sinclair's attention, especially. When he cut her progress, laughable, it worsened in this film when he achieved his romantic ambition, then threw it away for some ideals from the evidence. /> <br /> A very few films about <br makes me feel cheated, stolen.
