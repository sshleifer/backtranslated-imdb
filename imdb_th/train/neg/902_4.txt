I think today this movie is relevant because it was the first Sofia Loren movie. She was 19 years old when this movie was created in 1953. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because I wanted to. Saw the first work of Sophia Loren I was surprised when she entered the camera with her dark skin in brown makeup to resemble an Ethiopian princess. Of course, today, this thing will be seen as inevitable in making movies. Actually, it looks annoying that Lauren tinted the skin throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie would be better if the real opera singer created this movie. Then the singing and the true gestures of the real artist will appear clearly. I lowered other people's opinions about whether the real opera singer was older and heavier. <br /> <br /> Beautiful as Mrs. Loren was 19 and still is today. Even though it was shown on stage In the end, we didn't see beautiful young people on stage with "Old opera singer" behind the stage singing from behind the curtain! Do not reduce the success of using heavy weight opera singers. Just referring to the television commercials that produce the most art for the company J. G. Wentworth, with opera singers on stage singing to praise the company's products professionally. This is one of the best TV commercials and entertainment to date. <br /> <br /> The quality of the movie prints also makes the production quite a bit of quality. The ink is faded and cannot help. <br /> <br /> To improve the film on DVD, the manufacturer should add English subtitles so that we who do not speak Italian can know what the lyrics are saying. It will help the story and teach more than the narrator who gave the introduction of the 30-second scene. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, not because of Aida's story or the fact that this is an opera other than Ms. Sofia L oren, no co-actors, she is known or not recognized by this writer Watch this movie if you are a fan of Lauren and want to see her at the age of 19 - no matter what the movie is produced. <br /> <br /> Larry from Illinois
