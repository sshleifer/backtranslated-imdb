I have read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is more accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version in the series and its locations reflect the images taken by the gang. Very well done, especially the death of Buck Barrow and the arrest of his wife Blanche. This actress looks like Blanche's picture taken that day, sorry for her dying husband. However, this movie is still Hollywood and our anti-hero group continues to end even after being shot in the hole. (Bonnie's life was burned badly in a car accident last year before the famous ambush An energetic cheerleader at the time of her death) Boring scripts and poor performances, especially the leading actors Very disappointing next to Beatty and Dunaway. They may not be "true stories" but it's a great movie.
