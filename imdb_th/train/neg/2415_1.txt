... you know the rest If you want a good zombie movie, don't rent this movie. If you want to watch the documentary "Life Hood", you are also wrong. If you are looking for a laughing movie, this is a true winner! The show is flat like paper. The best example of this is the driving investigation officer. I can tell that he made a voice for the 911 operator with his flat voice. If I heard the cardboard box saying it would sound like this guy. Oh yes, and "Zombies" make the best impression on the snake, which is no different from their great performances. (Sarcastic note ... This method does not win the Oscars for the best makeup). I feel like watching an interesting moment. (That time is similar to LA 1990) That direction is the worst chapter I think makes movies look better. I have never heard a cute sentence, like an epic that begins in the movie "F ** k!" Because of the Ice Grill, which is another thriller "City". Of course, it's compatible with the hip hop soundtrack! All 3 songs of it! In summary, what do you expect from the movie "Hood of the Living Dead"? I rented this movie with the utmost intention to laugh in every scene and send it to the children and more! I will recommend this to anyone who wants to meet a group of people and laugh in horror movies with limited budgets (yes ...) for tonight. A memorable experience for sure!
