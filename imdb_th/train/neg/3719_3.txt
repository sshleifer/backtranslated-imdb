Imagine pulling a dead killer mask back and meet Barbara Carland. That's what happened to this movie. <br /> <br /> The launch shows promise. But soon it dropped all hypocrisy And the only reason they made this story very clear: to fill the gap in the female viewing market by creating a hash again of 'Misunderstood, miserable, bad boy' (Andrei) met with 'innocent, strange beauty (Paula). <br /> <br /> Instead of wasting time creating a traditional place, filmmakers went straight to making money. : Bad boy who is tamed by such strange beauty Then there was a scene of a heartfelt and hard-hearted love, sprinkled with a philosophy / poem. Foolishly, Andrei's admission of being (eponymously) 'poets' was elevated to round the recognition of the qualities that Byronic heroes should Yes - but even when we say that heavy, underlined, who and what he is still hard to believe - or care <br /> <br /> For the hero / Antino in the Byronic story Want to be sensitive Mail and innovation - are all but missing entirely. This is not a new era of Phantom of the Opera, but it's just what happens when a woman is weak and somewhat silly. (With a loose, tight elasticity) meeting with a bad man who, after meeting her, seemed to be dangerous, like a rabbit slippers. <br /> <br /> The performance may help make this movie better: the lead actor Girls are obsessed with sexy looks and 'other worlds', whether forced or ridiculous. And the poor Dougray Scott seemed to be poisoned as he debated his part. This is not his best work. JÃ¼rgen Prochnow has received an overwhelming interest as 'Vashon' and Andrew Lee Potts is a young photographer / brother. A better movie should make the sister offend and keep the older brother instead.
