While certainly not disgusting, the 1967 version of "The Perils of Pauline" is a disrespectful word. The name may make you expect to pay tribute to Pearl White (the original Pauline in 1914, silent 20 episodes), but so you will get better service in 1947, starring Betty Hutton. This 1967 model is like The combination of "Casino Royale" and the weakness of the Elvis movie. The worst thing is that it is not a combination of these things. But like those who have glue tape together to make things go between two styles. <br /> <br /> The unity of production comes from Pamela Austin (Pauline) and Pat's match. Boone (George Steadman), which is a good match because both lack the most basic acting skills (imagine Mandy Moore) playing opposite Dan Quay) <br /> <br /> Austin will play opposite John. Aston in "Evil Roy Slade" with the difference between the ability between them that hurt To watch In the mid-60s, she was a young girl "Dodge Rebellion". She therefore focused on situations that were filled with similar situations. - Imagine Sandra Dee in a dark blue jumpsuit.

Growing up in Baskerville Foundling Home, performed by actresses who played Mrs. Chatsworth Osborne Sr., "Dobie Gillis". George fell in love with her. (Pauline isn't Mrs. Osborne) and sabotage the opportunities she has adopted. George set out to seek his wealth and Pauline, 19, received a teaching job for a young Middle Eastern Prince. When he tried to add an attractive blonde to his harem, she ran away and from danger to danger. These include African pygmies, a 99-year-old millionaire who wants to freeze her until his one-year-old grandson is old enough for marriage, the film industry and the Russian space program. <br /> <br /> All This is Intended to be stupid and charming But only the stupid part There is an attempt to combine silent film with action scenes by simulating the rotation of the camera. (Which accelerates action) Unfortunately, everything (Movie stock, design, production, editing) is a sad story. In the 1960s, nothing here even approached the image of Pearl White tied to a log that moved toward the sound or tied to The train that is waiting for the train is approaching. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I am only a child
