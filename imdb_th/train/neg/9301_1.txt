Spoiler forward if you want to call them ... <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie for people to see 1/10. We will start from the top ... <br /> <br /> Story: Don't believe the evidence - this movie is not related to abandoned cars and people understand the mysterious occurrences as it is basic to the cabin movie without Violence "Effort" <br /> <br /> Screen: I always give credit to indie screenwriters. It's a difficult task when you start ... It's a crap, flat story - it doesn't make you feel. Both movies The conversation is weak and highly predictable in terms of "Wow, you make me crazy" and "I wonder if you uh ... if you want to .. Um, you will come to the cottage with me?" It makes me want to tear all my hair one line. At the same time and give food to yourself. <br /> <br /> Character: Holy CRAP! Some people explain that the character is flat. I want to take the next step and say that they have a real reverse character ... They started working in a parallel universe and almost started to show back ... < br /> <br Actress: More than the character is the actor They portray the characters that are written poor and increase the performance in the high school. "Wow, you made me mad." Be spoken only and slowly - like it is dumb. I can complain to the actors for hours. <br /> <br /> Technical: Light: Eight years will be disappointed with the light in this movie. There are too many shadows in the areas that are too bleached. The director should not use light as emotion until he learns how to make the general scene fit properly. Step the baby! SOUND: How many sounds do you need to create a movie that has a real shock? 9. With those sounds, it should sound good. But the opposite thing has already happened There is one scene that is really outstanding. They are driving and the sound of the car changes according to the angle of the camera every corner .... Weak! Camera: Learn how to use <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm out of space, complaining ..... for rent - I dare you ... Rent and learn from it ... give it 1 point .. It deserves <br /> <br /> sign out ...
