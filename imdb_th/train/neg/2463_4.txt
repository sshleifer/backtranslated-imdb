I don't know how to describe this movie. It's one of the strangest movies I've seen for a long time. Sometimes it is not very stable. But it is boring in other places. The torture scene is very complicated and may attract people with bleeding. I found myself holding my teeth in some of the scenes mentioned above. The smartest thing about movies is that it plays with our fears and the dentist is quite unstable. <br /> <br /> The humor of this film is hidden and may not be accepted by everyone. But if you are a fan of strange and strange entertainment and teeth that have been drilled into dust, this is just the movie you're looking for. <br /> <br /> If you read the comments and feel attracted to entertainment Look at this. <br /> <br /> My score: 4/10 (maybe a bit strange for my taste)
