This is one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. I rent it as a joke by expecting to giggle from the first few scenes and let me say I never laughed so hard in my life. The first scene in which the ninjas randomly surfaced in the air and started fighting with great fire and ridiculousness was one of the most incredible comedy action movies of my life. This is not a dinosaur movie. But is a movie that makes the action genre fun (And doesn't mean at all) I don't see the first two But judging by the complexity of the plot, I don't think there is anything that I miss a lot. If you want to watch a wonderful movie with a six pack or any herbal medicine than I insist that you rent this movie and sit down and watch 100 years of advancement in the cinema that has been thrown into the trash and Get hit
