I saw this movie in my own time when having an illegitimate child. But destroy your life But still seal your child as a bad bastard in the days of 'single mother' that seems to be profound But it's true And I am not crazy about laughing at someone stuttering During these two problems, I have trouble finding funny movies. At that time, I didn't know who was the director or had a great reputation. I know who Betty Hutton is and she makes me worried because she is a fanatic. I like "Bringing Up Baby" but I find this movie embarrassing. I'm sure that punching in some church functions might be stabbed. But I was the one who needed a drink after watching this thing again. The idea that a woman must be drunk in order to 'marry' and conceive, just add to the misery. The whole city may open you under these circumstances, so the effect of this movie is really funny. Of course, shoot me, I do not like. "It's a wonderful life" as well
