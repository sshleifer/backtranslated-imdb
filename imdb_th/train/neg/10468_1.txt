I don't know what to expect from this movie. Now i know This is a really scary movie. The screenplay, director and performance are not as good. Stupid and silly story The director should create a movie that is smart and thought provoking. But he didn't I sat in the seat in the second half of the movie because it was terrible. Where is the movie focused? What's in this movie? Christians should boycott this movie instead of promoting It was ragged and wasted my money. Don't watch this movie.
