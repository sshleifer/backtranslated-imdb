The idea of ​​creating a mini-series about Berlin's air transport seems to me to be one of the more interesting German war films (after). It is a theme that has not been explored much. However, the producers of this series are packed with ancient ideas. It started with the DVD cover of the movie, which is a direct copy of the 'Pearl Harbor' cover. <br /> <br /> Luise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) heard that her husband, a doctor (Ulrich Noethen), died in Russia and after the war, she struggled to survive. She found work at the American base, working for the highest level officer (Heino Ferch) in the city, fell in love with 'm pregnant, and suddenly her husband appeared again! We have seen this too often. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen have a good role. However, Bettina Zimmermann never seems to be persuasive. For some reason, it seems that she is too late in the emotional response appropriate to the scene. It doesn't work for me. <br /> <br /> Action scenes with airplanes and air elevators. Sometimes we get excited. The nasty things usually happen to the same pilot. <br /> <br /> If you're not a big fan of World War II movies, I suggest you spend your money on something else: lead chocolate ice cream. More satisfaction <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10!
