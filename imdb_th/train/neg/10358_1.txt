I have read the book All the "wrinkles of time" and watch movies The movie has all the elements in this book. But since this book has 190 pages and this film takes 2 hours, it feels packed with bad effects and performances. <br /> <br /> The wrinkling at that time is about Meg girl, Charles Wallace and Calvin must cooperate to find Meg's father and leave the island of Camazotz. <br /> <br /> The beginning of this movie has a foul odor. The performance is horrible, the direction is ridiculous and in unnecessary situations. I was disappointed to see the same person, Madeleine Engel, who wrote and created movies, made great books and was a terrible movie. Performances are worse than direct video shows. Yes, I have to admit that it has cool effects. But seriously, they all do terribly and not serialized in any way possible. If you read the book, you will be crushed by the movie. I hope to make it 0, but sadly, I can give it only 1 half. It's useful.
