I went to see D-War with intention and had very low expectations. The movie failed to meet them. <br /> <br /> Can I not care about the matter of stretching - remember Reign of Fire - but I expect them to be consistent within This film is screened from Howler to Howler, without breathing, so everyone switches to the special effects behind the likes of LOTR or Godzilla. <br /> <br / > A mysterious warrior from Korea The dealers of the old Caucasian and appeared like Deus ex machina to get rid of the unfortunate protagonist from their latest clutter. Special agent from the FBI, which seems to be very unusual in Korean folk tales due to "Paranormal faction" of the excellent Fed - which was not signed until this point Lovers kiss each other on a deserted beach where one exclaims. "I never intended for this to happen." The reincarnation partner of Korea at "Death like a lover crossing the stars", a mysterious pendant, a group of legions of robots (Which is Peter Jackson's evil ghost) and a snake that has wasted a lot of time roaring that every time the chosen victim is close at hand. <br /> <br /> A terrifying dialogue. Made of wood and the overall effect is honest, boring However, for me, the moment of liveliness at the end is the ending after the song for the credit is closed - Arirang! This is like Akira Kurozawa that closes "Running" while singing karaoke. My Way song - and let me tell you clearly that I do not have a way to compare the director to taste with Kurosawa. The lackluster collection of clich√©s and narrative narratives that may attract feelings of popularity in popular culture in the Qur'an. But should not be worth the price of tickets for serious movie viewers I would like to suggest that this thing is to avoid the cinema and go straight to the video. But I'm not even sure that it's worth it.
