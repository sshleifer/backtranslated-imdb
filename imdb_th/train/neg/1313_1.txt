Don't try to watch this awesome mini-series. It was six hours bored of the unbelievable love triangle between three people who had no chemical relationship. There is no heat in this story, no true love, no true love. It was dry, boring, pulled out and didn't get inspired when it came. And not yet reached the level of expected technical ability Spend six hours in your life and use it for something more worthwhile.
