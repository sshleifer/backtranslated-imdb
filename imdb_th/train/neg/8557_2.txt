I admire 'Kissing on the Mouth' because of frankness? Haircut and masturbation, especially from the head / director Joe Swanberg. They are not afraid to show the truth to "personal" events every day. Unfortunately, the film falls under the scope of 'The Brown Bunny. 'Although there is a little more jealous of development, yes, it reflects' Bunny', with nothing going on or filming many films that focus on Feet, hands or genitals Unfortunately again, I can see why this movie was released and why people rented: real-life sex scenes and full nude pictures. (Both men and women) naked. In addition, it was a waste of time. We quickly learned about a male or female couple who had a clear feeling for a woman who saw that he was just a friend while having sex with her ex boyfriend continuously. In addition, we have to face boring events every day. Every day, she works for her parents. He works on a sexual awareness project that is not very interesting on his computer. For all this work, the conversation must be interesting and real show. Not working and it's boring, like watching someone drive for an hour, that is the 'The Brown Bunny'. The only actor featured is Kate Winterich, and even though she still plays suspiciously. (A special DVD with her in front of the mic is worth watching / listening to). In fact, I admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, for removing all and not being afraid to reveal myself or bathing habits. But overall, the movie falls flat. It has a narrative that doesn't fit the scene, boring events in everyday life, and the incredible performances that you suspect, besides soft porn factors. Why did you rent it?
