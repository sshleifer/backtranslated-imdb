Not good, not good, not good. All three lines sum up a cheerful small movie that can attract stupid children and their parents to watch movies and ... # 1 movie in America! What is this country thinking? Mike Myers looks like Micheal Jackson. Some Chinese women who fall asleep in 3 minutes, the plot is weak with dirty gags. It's weird and scary when Green-Eggs and Ham came out in 2005. I will be very happy! (No) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan may play two hipsters trying to search for the lost Green-Eggs and Ham. They will try to hunt Sam-I-Am and that means the man who is running (I hope they don't destroy classic books) Don't waste your time and money by watching this.
