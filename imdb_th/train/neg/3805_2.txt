Uh ... this movie was very sucked. <br /> <br /> I read some reviews. Obviously there are a lot of people who think that what Woody Allen writes or stars in is good ... Automatically <br /> <br /> I watched many of his films in the hope that I will disappear Something But not they just suck Trash written badly All characters are very stereotypical. (Not to mention quite stupid) The story is ... I think it's probably a mystery. Not sure about that Mr. Allen's character is ... Woody Allen in other films that you have seen him. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Woody Allen, go to the movies. this story If you are under 50 years old, don't pay attention (if you are a fan of Woody Allen and you are under 50 years old ... Okay, you're wrong. I don't know what to say.)
