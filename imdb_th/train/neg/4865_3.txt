I didn't enjoy this movie. But then I love Babe, a pig in the city and destroyed by talking about a very good animal movie in every area. Animals are not pleasing. They are annoying, especially the Chris Rock guinea pig, but what I can expect is Chris Rock. I believe I smile once or twice that the pair is cute, but that's it.
