I just saw "If" I can remember the commercials of the movie since May. Fri, 1968, so I am interested in finally viewing May be the view of Americans who have never been to British public schools and think of social references But I think this movie is terrible One of the things that other people point out is that it takes almost the whole movie for the protests of ballyhooed-at-the-time Another matter, whether the final scene is real or imagined, what happened is not a protest. But is a rampant shot There is a difference. <br /> <br /> I know it may be a bad form of judging movies about the events that followed. But no one can avoid it here One person wrote a message board posted. Let us not compare the end of the movie with the events at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. But if there is a difference between Celtic Harris and Cho in one hand And Travis (Malcom McDowell) On the other side, I can't see. The four of them are under the misunderstanding that their guns are about to wash the world ___-Ed, which they do not have any responsibility. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to: Why the hell is Travis And his close friend Even in schools, are they insulting like that? They are adults or close to it. They were not in a military prison like a prisoner in "The Hill". British movies are much better at the same time. No one forced them to go to college and be beaten by a whip, except the ambitious parents might want to wake up about their son's nature. I have a chance in college to join the club, except I can't get a brutal command by the perpetrator claiming to be "brothers" in the future. Operate the frats and I can't say I'm sorry. <br /> <br /> If Travis imagines himself, the second coming of Lenin He was free to go outside and establish Fitch's trade union or work for Michael Foote in the next election. If he wants to be Jack Kiruk, then go up the road and start writing. He will benefit from the whole world enjoying riding a motorcycle and being drunk in his room. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, the critic must be like someone who responds to the scene in "Last Tango in Paris" where Brando mopes about having to date cow dung on his shoes. In the real world, that person speaks. "Why don't you scrape it off? Change your shoes? "- Do not allow the character to take a role for your selfishness, because you do not dare to point out the practices that are common sense for them. So it's here
