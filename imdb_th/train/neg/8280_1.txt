Seeing this, I noticed the ad position as the main DHL, Aquawhite Strips, Rockstar and many more. It is quite clear how this film received funding. Jessica Simpson's performance was ridiculous. Dick, who shouldn't work because he plays a weak character. "The story" is just a backdrop for this very long ad. I can't believe that this movie was considered for drama. The longer you watch this movie, the more difficult it is for everyone involved. The only saving thing was Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook who didn't have time to become Jessica's cousin. I'm embarrassed. I watched everything. I suggest avoiding this one.
