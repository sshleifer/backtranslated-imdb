It doesn't matter if Superman's comic book is incredibly naive and their goal is ten years old. The important thing is "Superman Returns" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, the question for dear readers, how many of you believe that Superman must be bald like Kevin Spacey? who? As i think There are no spoilers here. So we came to the important point first. <br /> <br /> At first, this movie looks like an ad. (The scene in the bar with Superman / Clark Kent, Budweiser drinking is the only scene that should be). Imagine Superman's advertisement, which takes two and a half hours. Seriously, this is not "Amadeus" or "The Departed". You feel that this movie is too long. And that special effect is not as special as it should be. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the situation is stupid. Sometimes, even if something is acceptable in a movie theater, it looks stupid and it is like that in this case. Of course, the dialog box is shameful. I don't want to believe that someone has written money. How many times can we raise a criminal with speeches? How many times will the physics rules be raped? (Jesus, it's not just But it's about Superman's strength only But also including anti-material related to him) How many times will Kent be deceived by Lois Lane? How many times a Hollywood producer will find worthless comic book stories? Since it is difficult to create a good story, why have a weak story for beginners? It doesn't work. Or just staying with this attack forever. Who cares? I feel that the WGA stopped the strike permanently. No offense. I didn't ask about the money that those people pay. But the quality of the products they deliver In this case, there is no quality. (At this point, you might ask yourself: Is it bad, right?) Yes. <br /> <br /> Third, the performance is not good, which is surprisingly because Brian Si Hacker (The usual suspect) is the director. Kevin Spacey is fun, but he is the only one. The audience is not in a funny mood. What is a comic book hero can develop into a true personality with clear motivation. But there are still doubts, fearing some depth In this case, no one can work and the characters are not really interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, the creator's efforts made this movie a joke. The second unit is terrible that attracts attention because nothing interesting happens on the screen. They try more (if they try). How much fun? (But not laughing, you expect) <br /> <br /> Final conclusion? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This movie is especially for women and gentlemen. Don't waste time and don't waste money too. Stay at home, read books
