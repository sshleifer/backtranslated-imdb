Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who will do everything to make his wife look young and beautiful. For this reason he used the bride's medicine during their wedding ceremony to make them look like they were dead so that they could steal their bodies. I'm not sure what he does with the body. I do not remember being completely explained. All I know is that he pulls something from them and injects them into his wife. (I just guess it's a spinal cord. Spinal cord is the madness of a mad scientist in the 40s). You can guess the rest from here. <br /> <br /> There are a few people (as well as more than twice as true But I only write two stories) The problem I have with this movie One is how to use Bela. Of course, he works well enough in his own way (BTW, the rest of the actors are abysmal), but to let him hide behind the morgue or let him crawl into The bedroom of a female reporter to do nothing is nonsense. In addition, why did he hit and / or kill all the people he had? Will it make him look evil? Well, the person who has been kidnapped by the bride comatose doesn't have to be made to look worse than that. <br /> <br /> The second problem I have is the idea of ​​letting the bride take medicine. Will the year not be done? When seeing Bela through the rotation to get his victims, I was reminded of the idiot fishermen. I still know what you did last summer. In each case, there is an easier way to achieve your objectives than using the map seems impossible, depending on the situation in an uncontrollable situation (BTW, the reserve name for the film is The Case of the Missing. Brides I guess some parts describe the needs of 'brides')
