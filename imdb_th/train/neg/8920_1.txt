... but this will be the worst adaptation of A Christmas Carol at all times and that takes time to do with the likes of various life endeavors. Don't understand me wrong - I have nothing compared to Cicely Tyson. I like her a lot in other roles (see Sipsey in Fried Green Tomatoes, for example) but the script has no choice but to chew the scenery And she did it with the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim tied to a Christmas goose. <br /> <br /> Keep me classic: Alastair Sim, 1951 with the exception of Scrooge A superior effort to understand the spirit of the past, present or future of Christmas.
