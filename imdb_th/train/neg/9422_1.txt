This film describes the experiences of two men. (One of them was Burt Reynolds), a prostitute and two queens, dragging for a few hours in one night in Miami. The storylines converge, eventually bringing all the people together in one place and time. This film provides gentle entertainment. But the big problem is that everything happens at night and that many scenes do not reach the point where it is impossible to see what happens. In some scenes, you can see that they try to "stretch" the development process to save the image. Some people don't know how to use movie cameras. Amazing that this movie was even released!
