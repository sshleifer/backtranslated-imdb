They are showing this on some networks. It's a lot of shit. While it's not as bad as the B movies, they perform on a Sci-fi network on Saturday, but still a fairly large garbage dump. The show is moderately Plot and writing are quite below standard and the pacing is too slow. Every minute movie feels like being part of a movie that they're wrapped in before. Credit - not the highest point of the movie Avatar. Moreover, most of the actors will be old according to the age they are playing. The whole thing can be predictable, boring and not worth it to be watched. Save your time It's not worth the free time spent watching.
