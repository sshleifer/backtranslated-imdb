Jason Lee tries his best to bring fun to a foolish situation. But this movie can't be connected. <br /> <br /> Maybe because the character Julia Stiles looks awkward because of his conspiracy and sexy soon being a cousin. <br /> <br /> Probably because she and Selma Blair's characters are probably the opposite. (Selma Blair seems to be more conspiracy than Julia) <br /> <br /> In any way, this movie is another story that Hollywood made a little story about the situation in Real world Your cousin), while the contract failed to deliver So instead of having a successful festive season (such as Animal House or American Pie), we will be left in the middle of part humor and ignorance part (ala Meatballs 2 or something).
