I'm always a big fan of Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman. So when Sci-Fi Channel ran this movie, I had to watch it. Suitable attire [You have to reject or order a major change] and the plot runs like James Bond of the poor man. There is nothing that makes the comic book heroine successful, such as superhuman strength or determination. Nightmare. I don't think Cathy is so interesting. I won't waste time on this.
