Lorenzo Lamas is a representative of some types of CIA that collects the exotic beauty called Alexa to kidnap her daughter and force her to fight with her former employer. OJ Simpson is still on board to create Reliability in acting for a band that is not very talented. I must admit that I am not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas or his movie. He has a bad smell However, compared to OJ Simpson and Comasose's wife of Lamas, Lamas looks like Ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I see the CIA just because of the increased interest around the OJ Simpson trial. You see, because if your parents have cable And a special channel, you can't escape from this movie in 1994. You can go to the Amish community and some moron will play on their portable TV This movie is a collection of scenes, lame and interesting action figures, although the shocking value of OJ Simpson that jumps behind the fireballs and exchanges is one torpedo, unintentionally making some humor. In addition, Bobby Knight and Where is Kobe Bryant going to make this camp classic perfect? <br /> <br /> * from 4 (not good)
