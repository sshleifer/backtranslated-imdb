There may be possible spoilers. (Not that anything in this movie will be new or might surprise you a bit for that) <br /> <br /> Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they've done? Of course, cheaper for them. But shortly thereafter, you will not think that the overall quality and the way people think it will decrease. House of Villains is a nasty crossover cartoon show that is not reasonable. Some signs of ignoring the previous movie in this story are: the sound is not even the slightest, and Iago is evil again. (Since when!) I know that these movies are directly for children. But there is a time that everyone can do Enjoy Disney movies Even the musical number of the movie (Which is a special Disney story for many years) I will not recommend this movie to anyone, even the youngest children All I can do is if this equally talented movie has been released, it's just a matter of time before some small animation studios will surpass Disney in overall quality.
