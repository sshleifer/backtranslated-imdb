The burden of the Leftist Hollywood ship, this film praises the rebellion as a brave and noble person, if according to the principles of peace. The fairy tale ended with a calm character by Danzel Washington promoted for his betrayal. What is it with these Hollywood tools? Is this still a payback to McCarthyism? <br /> <br /> If I listened to it, it was because I was bored with the movie that had a political agenda. Brass soldiers in this movie, what is the role? Who did the war of Gung-ho sound like? Have you ever watched the movie that the CIA or the state agency is not evil? Think again. Crimson Tide emphasizes that point.

And repented by leaving the service A rebel man receives orders from your ship, causing the United States to be in great danger to be attacked with the first nuclear weapons and you promote him ???? What are Hogwarts!
