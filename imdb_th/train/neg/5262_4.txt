We had to make an appointment, so we opened the DVR to record the ending. After that I watched the husband and said "Do you have a clue?" He shook his head. I said, "You made me see the ending of this movie and I don't know what happened." /> <br /> The movie is quite good. There are many doubts. It makes you wonder Then came to an end, ending ... It was over. You didn't let anything happen or why. Until the credit, I still think that something will happen to explain But never did So I came here, expecting people to think out and I didn't care. Nope. Here, four years later, I was naive like Tom Sawyer. What happened I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for $$ because I'm sure it's crazy. <br /> <br /> OHHHHH! I understand! The end of the movie is what is missing! ROFL
