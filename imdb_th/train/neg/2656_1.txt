(Spoiler is very light) <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton's boyfriend normally tries to watch tonight. I had to close before the second hour because I found myself without sympathy for my daughter or mother. Both came to be obsessed with themselves, regardless of others, and the daughter added rudeness, disrespect and negligence to the mix. When the daughter died, the only thing I thought was "At least we don't have to watch her anymore." Keaton worked well to move into her shocking state and fall into pain. But now it's too far for me I don't enjoy it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to take care of the protagonist, you have to let me take care of the characters earlier - if it's almost an hour and I don't care, it's too late. <br /> <br /> The support for the actor is sincere and played. Well - I feel that * they! * - and gay best friend is great But still together, that's not enough to send movies for me
