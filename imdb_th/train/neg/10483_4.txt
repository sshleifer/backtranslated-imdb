I saw this movie on American Airlines West flights. It's really bad. It makes the flight look longer. The story has potential. (Who wouldn't love a movie about a woman who killed everyone who accidentally falsified Elvis's character), but it turned out a million times by writing very badly at the end. Elvis' disguise on the roof of the casino reshipping the sky, thinking that he was about to come back. Then the constellations moved together to form an "Elvis" group which immediately fired an arrow Lightning that mimics sending them bumps into the roof. Poor ... not really good, which is the theme for all movies. I will avoid this cost.
