"Freddy's Dead" made the smartest thing to do after disappointment from the fifth movie. It starts from zero. Of course, this movie "Last" in the fairy tale is stupid. But at least it is original Some images may look amazing. And the story of the children of Freddy (Lisa Zane), who travels back to the city to confront her evil father, who is unique. There are many good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Lezlie Deane) who generally look dumb and walk around like sheep that are ready to kill. It's one side. It's magic. And finally, there's nothing but innocent entertainment. <br /> <br />
