I do not believe all the praise for this film. Playing and the movie is the end of Sleuth. Michael Ken wants him to be Olivier and Reeves wants to be Ken. Ken has a nerve to remake the detective with Jude Law who plays his original script. Jude Law? Do you mean someone who created a new "Alfie"? <br /> <br /> This film was created during Ken's work period when he clearly wanted to pay gambling debts. He will do everything for money. He will perform in this award-winning movie and "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure". What appears to be encouraging to watch this movie is Reeves death. He deserves better to be remembered for a lousy movie. This is also Ken. The film can be found in the $ 5.97 tank at Walmart, along with gems such as "The Island" and "Blame it on Rio".
