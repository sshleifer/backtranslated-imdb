Everyone who wants to be an editor should watch this movie! It shows you all the errors that shouldn't be done in movie editing! My grandmother should have done better! But that's not the only reason this movie is really bad! (Actually, it's terrible that I can't write a sentence without an exclamation mark!) If the first episode of "Les Visiteurs" is a good family joke with funny jokes and debuts, this sequel is a bad copy. The first part, funny parts can be counted by one hand, and maybe half. Clavier shows his role more. At first, Robin tries to act like Lemercier (because she replaced her), but It is a strange Lemercier Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Although Muriel Robin will joke himself on stage. But she was not in this movie because she didn't act as he had shown I know it's hard to replace those who are good at roles (Lemercier won César for her role in the first movie) but she made a big mistake: instead of playing her role, she played ?? Lemercier playing with her role. '! For the story, it's too much! Of course, we know that he finished the first film that would have sequels, but Poiré and Clavier should try to write simple things like at first, repeating that, like children and Deja Vu. Not really. There are more than 3 funny pieces in this one. The only good thing may be a set and some special techniques. So you only have 2 reasons to watch: 1) if you want to learn how to edit a great movie 2) if you want to waste time or if you want a really silly moment! 2/10
