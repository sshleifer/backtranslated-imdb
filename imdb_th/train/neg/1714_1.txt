Again, classic movies have been rearranged aimlessly with devastating results. The name is false, like everything about this movie. That period was not persuasive and the leaders seemed too young and illogical to be criminals. Arthur Penn's films had a style, humor, perspective and created by talented people. Although there is no 1967 version, this is still an unnecessary movie. The 1967 version is strayed from the facts presented by Bonnie and Clyde, an attractive version. But it's exciting and creative for 1967 and has some outstanding performances that help you to be interested It seems that the 1992 remake will be drawn from the original movie more than the truth, as known and the actors in this model are called less interesting and less interesting. By all means skip this one and hope that the 2010 version will be better. Could it be worse?
