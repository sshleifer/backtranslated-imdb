As a history of World War II, the Navy and people who are not proud of the history of the racial relations of this country, I am looking forward to watching this film. What a disappointment. I made it about 3/4, but I should close it in the sub attack scene. The idea that U-boat would fire a torpedo at the DDE as if it were hoped that it would be able to "escape" from the DDE while submerged And that is just a small detail. This film is poorly written, poorly directed and does not perform well. I agree with other people on this board that this may be a good movie. As if they decided so, because of those World War II propaganda films that were created with all white performances, they needed to create this movie with blacks. And not as good as these old movies, it's really worse And almost there are false advertisements with headlines Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. I have to believe that the two great actors are embarrassed to be involved in this movie. I finished. I gave too much life in this movie.
