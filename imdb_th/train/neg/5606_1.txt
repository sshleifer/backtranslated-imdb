I believe that Shakespeare describes what I read beautifully. I think he (the woman) protested too much. All things listen to me as if the author tried to convince himself! He wrote rude articles. (Written from the same period But not related to the Bible) many times, but I can think of references at least three times from the top of my head Everyone can tilt the data and prove what they want. But it did not make it true Customs changes, terminology definitions change over time (Look at English and German, which is a very common foundation) There is nothing in common. It grows and changes always. The Bible has many different translations, but the King James edition is the version that I find best when talking about all types of research. In the King James edition, you will notice that there are some words written in italics. These words have been added by translators and can be reduced & average of all changes. Written from the time of Christ was written without spaces, no punctuation, no paragraphs, and no numerical verses. These writings look like one long word and the translator has added all of the above. For example, how can you read this: Have you read Jesus that God is nowhere or you read as God is here? The same character string, two completely different meanings This is why many Bible researchers use 'Lexicon' to help them in translation because there are words for translating words from the original Arabic, Greek or Hebrew, depending on the language in which the original scripture was written. It is interesting to know that when translated into symbolic logic, you can prove that God exists. But you can't prove that he doesn't exist! Finally, I love listening to those who think they are wise so that they have the qualities to judge the Almighty. Talk about ego! God Bless Maegi took the soap out of the box.
