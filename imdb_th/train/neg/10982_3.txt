Movies have good performances and good times. (But obviously the budget is relatively low) but the rating is not good due to the poorly developed basic location The main point of the conflict between the two leaderboards is not to play in a realistic manner. There are some scenes that they disagree with because there is no mention of the great depth that explains how they can live together while seeing the world, especially due to the work of Glenn wounds in this life (And Adam was enthusiastic enough to support him with time and money.) In addition, many times Glenn showed that he was the way he was. (Apologize to Adam for his past) while Adam shows that Which the film announces is a good way in the end I don't like preaching like that. I attended a conversation with the director after watching LTR and he said that he expressed this conflict between them because if he was in Glenn's shoes (and he said he did it in real life related to Glenn's view) that he Never dating anyone With Adam's view If so, I think he should have done a lot better to explain how Glenn can do this movie. In addition, the director said that he directed this first film after reading (Directing For Dummies). But far from the highest effort I've seen worse But I rarely leave the movie that was disappointed.
