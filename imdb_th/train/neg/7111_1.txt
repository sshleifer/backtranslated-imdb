- The newlyweds who moved into the house of the husband's dead ex-wife Shortly before the new wife begins to feel that someone doesn't want her to stay in the house. She saw skulls all over the house. But when the husband checked, he found nothing Has anyone tried to drive her car back to the hospital where she had just been laid off? Or the ghost of a dead wife trying to take a new wife out of her house? <br /> <br /> - This is the first time I have watched The Screaming Skull without the help of the MST3K crew and it's probably the last time I watched it like this. Can you speak? I'm not saying dull, plain - I'm talking about watching the grass grow boring. There is a great movie genre that doesn't happen. The screen may be empty and I will be more entertained. The characters continue to make a drone with the most boring conversations imaginable. Screaming Skull may be marketed as a sleep aid. <br /> <br /> - The actors didn't help much. Most of the lines are sent with confidence that is reserved for playing at the school level. I didn't look at it But I was shocked when I found out that there were people involved in this movie that had appeared in a movie that was worth I will not go into the role that the actor will work with. Suppose the character receives the most stupid line that has ever spoken in a movie. <br /> <br /> - You have been warned! Avoid this problem at all costs or at least find the MST3K model.
