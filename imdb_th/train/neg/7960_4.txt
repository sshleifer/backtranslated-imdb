I rent because the second part bruised me as a little boy. I really sneaked down downstairs. One morning I started watching HBO and The Raft (Part 2), which made me very scared. This time I still enjoy The Raft, although I can't tell if it is because of the short-lived nostalgia or the other two is the complete trash. I don't want to believe that manufacturers pay somewhere to create this garbage. All I can do by watching this thing is to destroy the childhood memories once again. Creepshow 2 will now join the Rad in the classic episode of 4/10.
