*** Possible spoiler *** <br /> <br /> When I see this, today I have the expectation that it will not be too high. But not low as well This is not what I expected. But it seems that I like the filmmakers who can't decide what kind of movie to create. <br /> <br /> In the beginning of the movie, it's quite mysterious. And exciting But soon it will turn into a ridiculous scene - a very clear scene ... When I look further, I almost sleep a few times. <br /> <br /> The ending is the most nonsense of all Although almost splashed / funny ... <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's not a good scene, it's just that the movie never becomes "all". <br /> <br /> 4 / 10 Movie-Man
