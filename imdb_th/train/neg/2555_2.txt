This movie is probably one of the most scary horror movies I've ever seen. The length is not long enough to include a good story. In addition, the way in which the foster parents died is a common nonsense. Suddenly, the mother died from falling from the shower after stumbling upon the action and the father was shot by the police. I can see that some initiatives may be what they are doing. But it might be better Moreover, the greatness of it makes me want to press stop before it ends. After hearing all the names of Lucy and thinking that it is 'Lucifer', I want to close the mouth. Yes, it's interesting that Lucifer is a woman, but looking at the name it is the name of a man. Should be given to male characters Overall, this movie is boring and should use a better plot.
