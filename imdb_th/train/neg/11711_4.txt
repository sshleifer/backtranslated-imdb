Movie ok with good women But a terrible leader Stefan Jenkins, who plays as a husband, is a truly bad actor. On the other hand, Joyce Hyser is an economical grace of the movie. She is the best actress in the group. <br /> <br /> Note * The first comment by a friend who praised the movie (and according to his IMDB.com account, wrote only one review - and guess which movie ) Is clearly a plant While the movie was beautifully filmed, it did not have any subtlety or greatness or other explanations used by the reviewer. <br /> <br /> "Art of Revenge" is a fair movie. It offers all kinds of sexual situations. But never passed it Just like watching Skin Flick on Cinemax, but with "naughty bits" editing. <br /> <br /> The overall movie is a bit that doesn't focus and the ending and the third part is Really big mess Of course, the ending was twisted because all of the current issues were found to have a closing ending. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 <br /> <br />
