I rented this one on DVD, without knowing it before. I suspect that Michael Madsen appeared in a movie that I had never heard before but it was a freebie so why not try it out. <br /> <br /> If I guess That Mr. Blonde would like to forget that he had been involved in the film's stigma. <br /> <br /> Obviously, if your script and conversation are terrible, good actors can't save the day. Not to mention the overwhelming amateur actors of this movie. There are many people who do not use English as English. Play some parts of the native speaker. But read the line from the script that should be thrown away and not created as a movie It is unbelievable that every sound in the movie is unbelievable. The music is scary and goes out of place, all looks and sounds like playing in a bad school. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch it so that you can appreciate other better movies. This is the reason I gave 3 and 1 instead.
