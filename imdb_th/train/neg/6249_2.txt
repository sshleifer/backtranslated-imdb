(r # 97) <br /> <br /> There is one good thing about this man's Pokémon. (Do as you want): The theme opens. It must be the coolest song among all the Japanese cartoons made for consumers. Oops - I - means - - - - - - - young - TV - anime, TV shows, fans Unfortunately, there is no need to add the type of show after opening the theme. And they can't come up with anything more interesting than people who argue loudly about cards that are better than other people's cards Freud would have a date on the field. Unfortunately, I can't imagine why children want to sit and watch performances that the dialogue written by a thousand monkeys in five minutes takes 98% of work time. <br /> < br /> "Ultimate Doom's Uber Doomday Doomsday Creature Brings Your Pyramid Diamond to Attack Once! Don't you see that you don't have a chance to win this fight? Do you fool ?! /> "Yes, look. I'm going to use my destructive Delta Times paddle card to rid everyone of your power chew and eliminate the most ferocious doomsday creatures in the world. Bet you don't see that person coming! "<br /> <br /> Seriously talking. That's all they've done in this program. While in the show of a crappy child, another item that I've watched is the Pokemon trade phenomenon. (The lazy pet of every football mom) At least the monster has manners to duke it out periodically. Just in the quiet words of Roger Ebert's "A Clockwork Orange", "easy and boring", not to mention the wind. (I know I am a hypocrite here. Consider the sentences I just wrote.) <br /> <br /> This list continues forever. I do not know if there is any plot or not, and the monster is still no Pokémon. Although not compared to the cartoons that I like when I was a kid, this item is interesting. It's unintentionally funny. But not funny enough to make it worth watching Goodbye, sleep, dream, tight, good night sleep
