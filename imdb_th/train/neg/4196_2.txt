This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not just about But the performance was not as shocking as well. The dialog box seems to have people reading the news. <br /> <br /> This is a funny / drama / romantic rank. It's not that of them! It's a little action. That's it. There are no jokes and drama. <br /> <br /> If you go to the cinema to see this I will not recommend it at all. Rather, whatever you choose to see will be better. This movie is an action / crime movie. The action scenes are sucked and the crime story is a predictable part. <br /> <br /> If you don't care about good things or good performances And you just want to watch the movie 'foreign' to attract foreigners Then may be for you
