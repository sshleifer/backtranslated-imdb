I have already seen an amazing story. But this place is unbelievable that it's close to nonsense. The rich and young man received a heart transplant after his wedding day and he saw his own surgery and his surgeon killed him. Although there are medical explanations about this phenomenon, what will happen next will be a combination of dialogue between ... say ... spirit? ... Maybe and the real life that a devoted mother will do everything to save her son's life. There is no shadow or fear, just a mix between the plot of the evil and the simple and the unintended coincidence of life. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that the film lacks quality. Completely - the first time that director Joby Harold performed well in directing an actor team with Hayden Christensen in his first major role after removing the Anakin Sky Walker outfit Jessica Al Crazy and Lena Olin the ultimate gift Everyone should get a better story.
