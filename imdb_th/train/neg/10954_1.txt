If there is a 0 star rating, I will be happy to give to this very awesome garbage dump. The fact that the actual conclusion is perfectly valid and if it makes a difference The basic mission of locking a group of people in a laboratory is to use it. But why the experience? All I see is a group of surfers and unwise blondes that talk about music and culture that I don't know or want to know about ... Challenges are pathos and ridiculous. The focus of all reality TV shows is reality. If you set up a 'challenge', don't make them play with food and exaggerate cultural elements in 'Friday night game' makes them a real challenge. And for the 'income' prize is okay if they really get it! These people are nuts. If only they would make the show better, the true idea would be glorious. But that won't happen!
