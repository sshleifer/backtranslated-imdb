Not sure I'm referring to people labeling this video as disgusting or director ... "Devil Hunter" is definitely a strange "horror" movie. <br /> <br /> The story is Loose goose combo Great movies like "Cannibal Ferox" and "Cut and Run" chick were kidnapped in the 'jungle' by the 'tribe' of the 'barbarians'. The forest looked like a park in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies that walk around in a Halloween costume in the form of party parties in the city. And barbarians range from white races to Asia to blacks to Spain I think Franco just grabbed anyone who looks like a small group of people to play this song. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this movie has very little blood, no fear and unnecessary sexual organs. It's not fun. I can find something I like in Italian or Euro movies - this trash can just fall short. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 kids
