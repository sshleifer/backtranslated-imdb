This movie is sometimes funny, sometimes hell is funny. <br /> <br /> The basic message I received from this film is that women are responsible for all human problems. Every time a woman appears in this film, she is a lazy person, a cool guy or a poor man for no apparent reason. I do not think the relevant message is good for women or gay. <br /> <br /> But it's a joke and a work of art, so it is someone's view Even if I disagree, they still have the right to receive it. <br /> <br /> Amusing movies But some comments that others make are simple. The best movie ever my feet
