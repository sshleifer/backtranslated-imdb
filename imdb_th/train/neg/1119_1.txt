Although this film is a joke that responds to critics. But still a scary movie If anyone would do something like that, at least make it a good joke ..... First of all, Jeroen Krabbé is I guess Gerard Depardieu of a poor man ..... by nature I hate Gerard Depardieu, although He will be very funny in the 'Iron Mask'. Otherwise, for me, he poisoned the box office and Jeroen Krabbé worse than that. Poison box office of a poor man .... Actually, it's not fair to those who have economic rights. If '4th man' should be some criticism of the middle class .... I'm talking. What it is not assuming that if it should be, it is not sharp enough. If it's not clear enough that the audience will become a joke instead ... I think that's what happened. The story ends with a group of disgusting characters that are unlikely to do anything that everyone is interested in and not interested in either ... (For more interesting and cost-effective applications See the movie Luis Bunuel .... very sharp, satirical) <br /> <br /> [Spoiler alert that may happen] <br /> Actually <br /> Blow job in the cemetery at Jeroen Krabbé's drama works hard to achieve .... Are you interested? Is it funny? Since Mr. Voerhoven should be a good filmmaker, I will let him benefit from the suspicion and think that it is a ridiculously insulting joke ..... even though I guess he doesn't. Has shown Jeroen Krabbé because he is the worst actor and every character he plays is a middle donkey that boasts ... except he is incompetent So it became like a caricature. Do you think Mr. Voerhoven did that with the aim? And Jeroen Krabbé is funny too? I just don't see it ...... so you understand the problems I face here, right? It's the worst movie because he should be a good director. So there is something to be concerned about. I know that 'Patch Adams' is very scary without seeing it. Do not be fooled by the temptations or temptations of 'The 4th Man', Voerhoven's reputation as a good director.
