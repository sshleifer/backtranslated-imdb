After the debut of Eurotrash 4, the great name REDEMPTION swept the bottom of the tank with THE BLOODSUCKER. I found NO Bloodsuckers, no matter where in this movie. <br /> <br /> A simple story. Mysterious counting invites many actresses to his castle for a little vacation. After some sexual impersonation, the young woman receives one death sentence. Who is the murderer? Who knows? There is more red herring in the market than on the Friday fish market. <br /> <br /> Exciting pace. The story is stupid and the skin scene is not as good as well. <br /> <br /> Let this thing be missed.
