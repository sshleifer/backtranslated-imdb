I was talking about watching this movie by a sobbing friend about this cute story. <br /> <br /> Yuck <br /> <br /> I want to have two hours back to do things. To be more useful according to my time ... such as thumbs up for my thumb I do not see anything about the redemption of this movie, so it saves my eyesight ... <br /> <br /> 3/10 (and that's kind)
