I just watched this program on TV and I can say anything. But this is the worst movie I've ever seen! I'm embarrassed to come from Melbourne, which is the filming location. Cruel performances, skillful makeup effects and a really bad soundtrack. For the plot, it's even more stupid! Some scenes make me confused how bad it is. There is a reason why they put this type of movie on TV late at night because they're garbage! Avoid all costs.
