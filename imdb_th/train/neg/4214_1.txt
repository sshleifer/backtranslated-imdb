After wasting just a few hours watching and 80% of that time in complete disbelief, I can let the turkey this year from the garbage without problems. To say that the plot is unbelievable is to say very little. Frankly, I lost for the words to describe this most ragged, not just a complete and complete character without the similarity of originality (things like this do much better 'The serial killer's flicks') But the performance was terrible. For those who pay to see this, I hope you get a refund for those who have received money to do this. I hope you give your money back. Believe me that a lot of new people are out there. It's much better to see.
