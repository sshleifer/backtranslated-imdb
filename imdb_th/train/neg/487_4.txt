What do the directors think? Everyone who read the biography of Artemisia was impressed with her courage to face rape in the Renaissance and even torture to show that Tassi was guilty of the truth. Of true freedom and liberation - at the worst of her time, she stood in her MAN. Why would movies that represent the Renaissance have to be beautiful and beautiful? Mon Tikrit clinical afraid we are going to see a side of life has been blessed by the joy in Hollywood? While I always protect the freedom of the director to create my own reality in the movie, I can't change the life of Artemisia. Very disappointing choice by the creator of this film.
