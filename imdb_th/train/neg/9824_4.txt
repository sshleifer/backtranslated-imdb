Not familiar with US television stations when I flick to the cable in my law. First of all, I think it's just a low-budget sci-fi movie. After a few minutes, I started to think it might be wise. Scoffed beyond the worst of fundamentalist Christians and then began me - great grief. These people are serious! Not long ago, since I saw something that was hilarious without intention. I was hesitant about writing this review because I was afraid that there would be wrong people. But then I saw criticism and other ideas. Hey, they can accept it. Difficult philosophical puzzles: How do you criticize a movie without showing what you are criticizing? Answer: Create it in the way that only one person will appreciate it. People who hate the genre you're criticizing. I think some libertarians (Oops! Spit when you say that!) May make the insulting filmmakers who are not obsessed with the legendary J **** C ***** But I'm not okay - it's so funny!
