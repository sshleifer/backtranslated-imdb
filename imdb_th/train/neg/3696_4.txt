Usually I will give this movie a story 6. It is very important and it is quite good - even though Katie Wright is successful both in and of himself. <br /> <br /> I don't know if you are. who Actually being ordered to play the characters like this or annoying. But she did a great job, causing me to lose interest. Lexi had no other dimension in her, besides the confusion, uselessness and mercilessness of her and her goodness that wailed. I can understand that the girl who blames herself for losing her friend and the disorder of eating that is in control will look confused, scared and painful. However, all of Wright's performances are based on crying incessantly and spin. I couldn't help but feel that the problem of this girl was not caused by a demon that was bulimia. But she has no spine I doubt very much that it was the point that the movie intended to be made.
