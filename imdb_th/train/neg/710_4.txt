I read Rice's novel with interest and became the charm of the characters and the heartbreaking story based on historical truth. <br /> <br /> However, I was shocked by this modification. The selection of actors is based on the appearance and not the talent show. (Except Peter Gallagher, who does not see blonde hair or is unable to show his way out of the wet paper bag) Joke But not in a fun way I found myself wiping out the boring rags and melodies and was surprised that I had done it until the end. <br /> <br /> Warning for fans of novels - stay away
