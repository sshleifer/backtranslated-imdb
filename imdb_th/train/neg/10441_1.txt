I stopped watching this POS as soon as the snake began to "take over" the plane. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that maybe it would be "one" for relief. But then I realized that I could watch all three arrows for free and laugh again! <br /> <br /> What I might have for Samuel Jackson, respecting what I was permanently destroyed. And Hollywood shows again how they really are When I was a kid, we used to catch snakes for fun. The only thing the snake can do is to make a huddle at the bottom of the luggage room. And the Hollywood cartoon snake can't change that. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't worth the trip to blockbuster. Be warned: If you pay for it, only "victim" is your fool. <br /> <br /> If you really want to be scared, I recommend Descent. If you want humor, go to your local comedy club. Their worst performers are millions of times better than this trash.
