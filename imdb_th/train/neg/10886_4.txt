I just watched The Convent for the second time. I had enjoyed it before and thought it would make the movie drunk on Friday night, with some bleed, style, humor and similar. I regret that I can't appreciate it anymore. It seems that someone intends to come back to visit the epic ball cheese, such as the Night of the Demons for the modern audience. But lost the original value For the record, I'm not a big fan of Night of the Demons, but there are some things I really dig. Cheese convent But not very good Besides the main girl (Admirable performances from Joanna Canton) German girls and cute pendants from Adrienne Barbeau. All characters are amazingly different. This film has been severely hampered by the lack of complete nudity, which means that when receiving a terrifying conversation, it is difficult to see the characters and difficult to appreciate the good points of the movie. The evil nuns were originally in the design and received many good scenes, although not scary. They would look cool and the movie had a clean blood. At the end, when Adrienne Barboy was at the scene, this movie would entertain all those nasty people who had died and the evil nuns were mad. Chic direction also gives good results from time to time, although sometimes the camera moves too fast. All this is a movie that sparked good for me, unable to compensate for what I hate. Those who like this type of movie may enjoy it more. But for me it is not a good time
