This film by Oscar Petersson is outstanding. Its identity is not in the story, because the production of Hollywood with a lot of consciousness has served us in a rather miserable plot. But in the most thorough and thorough way. <br /> <br /> The dialog box is worse than the embarrassing story. The rotten show and the deepest direction will be thrown into the mixture. Bosnian who speak English with a heavy Swedish accent, accidentally adding elements of humor. Lightning and non-decorated cameras are making ice on turkey cakes. It is a surprise for the audience to have a slow motion sequence with no complete movement that you can expect the least. In order to increase insult to injury, all things are cut by those who are not feeling the time Which is the time to drive out Ed Wood from the worst director of all time; Move to Ed Wood - this is Oscar Petersson!
