I don't have any basic knowledge about this movie before I buy it. But it sounds cool and I really want to watch the Viking movie for a while ... Alas, this movie isn't what I'm looking for. I hope to get the best But was handed over to the boring Nordic soap drama, which seems to be dragging too long, even if it takes 84 minutes. The evidence of this film is interesting enough: it is the story of a Viking warlord that challenges his God and Odin was so angry that he cursed the son of a warlord named Barre to death and was born as a male Berserker. This man was forced to live angrily mad and use it. Switching gears wildly after lifetime. This film was filmed adequately with a rich film and a semi-fine performance by the actors. But again, I found myself bored and questioning when this baby will end. The filmmakers have a chance to do something that is quite fun and unique. But they left the ball Maybe it has been improved with cheap exploitation strategies that have been thrown away, such as nudity and a lot of blood ... I mean, we're talking about "Berserkers" here, right? The Vikings should not be good enough, things that are raped and plundered, so Berberger should not be over-realistic? In conclusion, if you are a big fan of The Young and Restless (etc ...) or in fact you are a crazy Berserker who likes to torture yourself, I may avoid this boring celluloid.
