So I want to rent a DVD and see this movie called 'End Game'. It shows James Woods and Cuban Goodyear Junior and has a summary of the political thriller taught. Looks good, worth it Or I thought that <br /> <br /> The boy I was wrong. <br /> <br /> End the game with the most ridiculous plot I ever had. Now it's a matter of investigation. I can't tear it like I want without 'breaking' for those who have not yet experienced this wonder, but questions like 'Why do he / she / they do this? 'And' they get the resources to pull this thing out of anywhere in the world ', there are too many to follow the hilarious conclusion unintentionally <br /> <br /> for the show - you know the movie Those you almost Clients feel that the actors recognize that they have made a serious mistake. Movies and what will this show in their performances? This is one of them. Come with a laughing and flawed script that is serious and annoying and you have a recipe for poison in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not sent to the cinema and for the same reason. You should not do Allowed into your living room. It's scary.
