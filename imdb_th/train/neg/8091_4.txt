(This is a review of the English version of Disney later by featuring Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart and colleagues) <br /> <br /> I really want this movie. I am a big fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. And after seeing the criticism shining in the previous version of Miyazaki, I wanted to see it But I was shocked. I was shocked at the quality of this movie. Later movies have a well-built plot, three-dimensional characters and the best movie songs since ... well ... I've never approached this movie. <br /> <br /> May Start with positive Like all films of Miyazaki, this film is still very imaginative with a strange fantasy / sci-fi scene in the post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. Nausicaa can also show off the animations that Above all, going to other movies at this time (although not as beautiful and smooth as in Miyazaki's next film) and English voice acting is possible. <br /> <br /> But this movie ... just ... not ... well ... all the characters are cardboard - since Nausicaa is so sweet to the brutal Tolmekians. Pranee to everyone When you see each item for 30 seconds, you'll see everything there is. And the fact that the surrounding plot doesn't help. <br /> <br /> Then there is a song ... Now, Hizaii is a songwriter's favorite movie, but Nausicaa didn't make it. He is fair Half of the songs are keyboards of the 80's in the overload and often enter and exit unexpectedly to distract the vision instead of helping them. I highly doubt that Hizai was ordered to compose a lot of songs before he saw the picture. <br /> <br /> But wait! There is a great message for this movie, right ?! Help protect the environment! Unfortunately this movie hits you more than a head like a sledgehammer. There is no real scene where Nausicaa hugs a tree. I am not kidding. <br /> <br /> It makes me a little sad to mention how weak this movie is. But for some reason, all other reviews in IMDb seem to favor And when the character has to speak to himself in a long sentence to tell you what has happened, that is lame. <br /> <br /> If you are an anime idol, enjoy music 80 and plant trees. Every day, Arbor, you may like this movie. Otherwise, keep your money for his next movie because they are excited.
