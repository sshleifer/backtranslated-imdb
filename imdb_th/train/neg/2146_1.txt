I will take it out. This is the worst sequel of the classic Disney movie I've seen in 1950. Disney launched what I regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Now bringing great music to add to a poor plot that is similar to the missing TV program. "Gather it together, what will you get?" Crud, the biggest I've ever seen. After I saw this, I thought it was over for Disney. Cinderella should end up too. "And they live a happy life forever." Not this garbage. This movie does not deserve this sequel. I think it should be "Distorted time" which is medium but better. Also, what do we do with Anastasia? She changed sides like Iago but didn't help anyone.
