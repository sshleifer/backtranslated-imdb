This film started out brightly with the first scene in which Frank Morgan gave advice about Gary Cooper's marriage with his daughter Anita Louis. Frank Morgan plays the undaunted gold digger who complains to Cooper about the perception of his family's mistakes, including his daughter Anita Louis. I am a big fan of the three actors, Frank Morgan (in my heart), Hollywood Legends, Legends Cooper and Louis. It is a cute, versatile and rarely admired actress in the leading role. I still have nothing compared to Teresa Wright, and while not receiving a lot of blessings, she often shows a warm heart dance. <br /> <br /> From promising exposure, the story moves down to the end. I found nothing funny about burning Cooper's house to be legal. Butler in a non-smoking and insulting home will never walk brutally, allowing Cooper to continue smoking or else he will provide a way to get rid of his inappropriate cigarette. Moreover, no one has any common sense to allow himself to be left at the cigarette without asking how to get rid of it. And finally, no one in his right mind smashed a cigarette in a handkerchief and put it in his pocket! This whole sequence makes Cooper look stupid and ridiculous. It was a terrible plan - bad thought and filming in a way that made people laugh without laughing. <br /> <br /> Cooper's forced medical examination was invented equally. No one is willing to allow himself to receive a complete health check without receiving advice from the objective or consent! Cooper did so, was removed from reality until funny - it's ridiculous! Stealing infants from the hospital is a serious legal offense and there is nothing to laugh about. Eventually, Cooper's scenes that are too fussy to pay attention to neurosis on feeding and his baby's weight may affect the nervousness of a few people who have anxiety about their newborn. But for me they seem boring and slow The wardrobe department and the props went to the top in the scene. At the time of the conflict, the writer went to sleep. <br /> <br /> The line wasn't in the script to create humor. They just think of all the cylinders. The laughter didn't come for just a minute. But like laughter every year The only time that the movie had energy or humor was when Frank Morgan caught the camera. <br /> <br /> The totally wasteful scene was when both were interested in Cooper's love and father in the same sequence in the same hotel room. Together there may be a blood vessel full of humor somewhere in that mine <br /> <br /> In the end, one of the two cute girls is getting hurt. Guessing it is the character Anita Louise, who has been jilted on her wedding night! Although it is not in the camera, that is her fate, and it's not particularly funny - even if it's the end. She didn't do anything in this movie to make me sympathetic (like Gail Patrick, speaking in My Favorite Wife), so I expect (maybe "hope" is a better word in the context of movies!) For Ann Nita Louis, who will enjoy the happy ending as well The fact that such good characters are eliminated at the end of the movie is to destroy the effects of "Happy ending" for Cooper and Wright. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for something to happen. Features of that movie in that era ... and it never delivered. Frank Morgan's good work in a slightly different role is completely wasted.
