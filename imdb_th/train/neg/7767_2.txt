For anyone who is not familiar with Forrester's books c.S. This movie is interesting. It has colorful, good performances and high adventure shows. But for those of us who know the original story, it's scary. I could hardly sit down. <br /> <br /> For some reason, screen writers seem to be forced to write the stories they are doing. Of course, the words that are said are different from the written words and there are some episodes that are difficult to be filmed. But why do screen writers write stories instead of adjusting themselves? In this case, the authors do it themselves. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: no rebels in fame. The officer seized the ship after the half-mad captain was madly driven out when he fell into the hut because of implicit reasons. But never received no military court. The court of inquiry was conducted in an almost welcome atmosphere. Captain Pellew did not appear in this section of the Hornblower Fairy Tale and Col. The wife of Col. Hornblower never himself. In a junk boat on the boat or on the shore There are many alterations for Forrester's story. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical basis, I think using the flashback device of this movie makes it painful. <br /> <br /> Why, why? Write the screen to make good things busy.
