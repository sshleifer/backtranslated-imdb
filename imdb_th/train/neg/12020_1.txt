This is a waste of time. Hazard: If you watch, you will be tempted to tear your DVD out of the wall and lift it up in the window. <br /> <br /> Amateur production: conversations that are scary, repetitive and without Subject Some paper conversion lines, wooden performances, Lucy Lawless, being hacked poorly. <br /> <br /> Serious flawed stories, completely unbelievable characters. Two of the worst concepts in movies and t.v are: (1) The twin of evil (2) Amnesia. No twins. <br /> <br /> Story "Twisted"? Simple and very nasty - like watching a train that runs along the way during the daytime on the grassland. It is not corrected correctly. The evil is not punished for traditional crimes. <br /> <br /> Please, please do not watch this thing, even if it's free and your other choice is to go to the church.
