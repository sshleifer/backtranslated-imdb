TYSON <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound style: Stereo <br /> <br /> Show respect - even if fair, prudent - about life and range The time of the champion boxer Mike Tyson from his conviction for rape. This film is careful not to show that he is a hero or a villain. But drawing pictures like warts and all the images that he is famous for, reputation, pressure of success, and people who determine his or her destiny for good or bad. Importantly, with the failure of Tyson (temporarily) in 1995, trainees will gain knowledge from the event while boxing fans will receive direct entertainment. How to narrow the material He focused on the life of Tyson as a circus, which eventually led him astray from the situation he had achieved. In fact, this script is largely reserved for Robin Givens, the former wife of Tyson, stating that she is an ingenious gold digger who takes advantage of his innocence. The production value is consistent and the actor is great: Michael Jai White is a mimic of a fair character. George C. Scott plays the mentor of Cys D'Amato through the farm. molar And Paul Winfield was born to play Don King!
