I never heard of this, then found that he had a deadly lens, which I heard but didn't see Connery's appearance, causing me to buy it and it was not good. It wants to cross between Dr Strangelove and Mash, but it's not a joke, unless you find the name General Wombat (?) Funny. There are many scenes in the White House between the president and his assistant, which are ineffective. It's almost as though the first cut was too long and the first half was modified to go to the whole nuclear bombing story and the suicide bomber attack, which I thought should be played for a good laugh. Doing that is great But what the studio looks like is a cheap TV I can't believe that the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did this. Laughing only: Connery threw his wig before wearing a helmet and jumped on the plane. It makes it never say that it's not like a genius again.
