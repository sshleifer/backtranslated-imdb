This movie is just another action movie. But it should be much better When the gun came out, they really needed help with choreography. Some people, like Andy McNabb - the creator of the great action scenes on the Heat when they moved up the road from theft. Because the rest of this movie is predictable But look better than you expect from this type of movie From then on to the final scene, acting, what we were waiting for, but just like watching something from the A-Team in the 80s, they shot wildly, nothing hits and they ran around the house trying to Kill each other - old like old
