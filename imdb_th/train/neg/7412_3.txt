I love the magic horror flicks. I don't care whether the show will be broken or not. I like this movie except the feeling that is confused from beginning to end. See, I do not want a thesis, 10 pages or a mark with a large letter describing the plot for me, but Dark Floors plays the role of "this movie about anything", something that is on a new level (annoying). What about <br /> <br /> This is not scary or exciting. But if you have one and a half hours to kill and / or you want to feel frustrated and confused
