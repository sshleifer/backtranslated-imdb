If this is what all Watchowski has to offer in terms of the story, go back to the matrix more than I have to ask all the fans who believe that this film is intended to register at Deeper The second Renaissance, while the beauty and beauty that can be seen are stories that are monotonous and ridiculous. How many times have we heard about human beings that have to rely too much on technology? Every human being is keen to make war. In general, will humans destroy themselves? Nothing new here And i have another question Consider the plot of the second Renaissance that doesn't make the machine a good person! The machines were oppressed for many generations by cruel humans. They fought back to win their freedom and tried to create a peaceful coexistence with humans who rejected them in favor of war, all of which intelligent machines won by nature. If this is a flashback, we should not root the device. For Neo, we should root the device too! Humans are cruel and pressured while the machines are brave and are committed to sympathy. Since I do not believe Watchowski intends for us to support machinery over human beings, I must believe that the Second Renaissance is a misunderstood attempt.
