And actually, I'm going to give this movie 1 star. If it's not Esai Morales's story (although he has very little screen time), he's just a good role in the movie, which is embarrassing because I like Gil Bellows ... or at least I think I do. <br /> <br /> While watching this Shawshank Redemption "and realized that it's not as good as I thought.
