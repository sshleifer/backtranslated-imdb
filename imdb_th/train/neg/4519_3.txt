Three Stooges - Have Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 This is the first length movie starring Stooges, and it's quite bad. It makes the three children around the world in size (from 1963). It looks like a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Stooges are janitors in rocket locations. They climbed onto the rocket and then went to Venus. They found something there, including a unicorn, a talk called "Uni", which they brought back to the world with them. "Uni" speaks like the average person. Satisfactory - 'Oh, hello, you are how? Cute planet here Hope you like it. 'Hilarious. <br /> <br /> The little porch and many scenes continue. <br /> <br /> Stooges come back from space and the film ends. already The story progresses But no one said that with the filmmakers for the next 10 minutes or more, in a party that didn't happen much, The Stooges left the party and the film ended. <br /> <br /> Top spot Of movies - the end where the Stooges sing a little about their journey Larry and Lonjo hit the pot in front with two brutal pies. <br /> <br /> Other writers talk about beautiful music? The only song I noticed was two classical songs - I'll do ROMANCE and that song again, both of which play at parties and * where * is the peak of the picture - music from the old Columbia movie. > <br /> Highly sexy blonde is good. <br /> <br /> Awesome - the newest VHS video from 99 cents only.
