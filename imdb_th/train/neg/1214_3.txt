A friend once asked me to read his screenplay that was chosen by the movie studio. Saying that it is one of the most inappropriate and ridiculous scripts I have ever read will be a brave speech. But I never told him this story. Why? Because in the world where movies like "While she's not there" can shine in green and attract the Academy Award-winning stars like Kim Basinger. The screenplay that lacks characters, content and common sense does not guarantee not to sell. Many other critics point out that "While You Went Out" is a female-in-peril film under a terrifying writing under the name Basinger, a abused housewife. Every gripper is legitimate, from weak conversations and bad performances to liberation from logic. But Basinger is an interesting actor and the location is not without a contract. Here are two things that make me fall in love. <br /> <br /> 1) I don't care if we should think that her husband is a jerk. Since when it became a child abuse for the children to indulge themselves, <br /> <br /> 2) The racial diversity gang is hard to find anywhere except Hollywood. <Br / > 3) Sure that this film is stupid, but so is the countless "thrillers" that I have sat through where women are being shown that lamenting the helpless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not, I find it refreshing to see women get the best from her torture. <br /> <br /> 4) I love the ending! <br /> <br /> 5) Although the previous examiner was the author of this phrase But I think this movie should be named "The Red Toolbox of Doom"
