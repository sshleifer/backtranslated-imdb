The previous poster was clearly working with the movie. It's funny how bad it is and no one is criticizing this movie in the way he talks about the names of all actors and what they had done before. This is a sign that he is involved in it. <br /> <br /> It's now in Cinemax and I'm sure this is a movie that is a porn star. (The person who called Ava was beautiful and well accepted) was forced to do something else for tax reasons. <br /> <br> When I first saw, I was sure it was created in 1986 and I Born in the year 73, so I thought I knew what I was talking about but without ... It was created in 1993 !! unbelievable! <br /> <br /> Although I call it one of the worst things, it's a good movie, like watching the train wreck.
