I am not a big fan of horror movies and have only seen a few stories (and there is no "Halloween" or "Friday the Thirteenth") - but I can appreciate horror horror movies because of blood. And I'm pretty sure it's not scary. <br /> <br /> Is there anything terrible about the tiny plastic skull that pops up everywhere? In all the appearances there was a distant image, so it was not surprising that in this film (Not a skull in itself is scary, but ... ..) <br /> <br /> The point is related to the third cousin of Claus Von Bulow (John Hudson) who is married to Donna-reed ( Peggey Webber gave one of the worst performances) that began to see the skull and heard the mysterious screams of the peacocks on her husband's mansion. I did not mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? ooooh !!!! Wondering who is doing !!!! <br /> <br /> This is an old story about a boy trying to kill and / or drive his wife to lose consciousness. If you want to see this in the finished version, try "Reversal of Fortune" and BTW, Jeremy Irons is one hundred times more capable than John Hudson. <br /> <br /> MSTing is ok but nothing special to catch. Coupled with "Gumby" short, it makes it look good. <br /> <br /> Two stars for "The Screaming Skull"; Eight stars for the MST3K version <br /> <br /> And now you have to transcribe Mr. Von Bulow: "This movie is so bad." "You have no idea!"
