Rex Reed used to talk about a movie ("Julia and Julia" is unique) that looks like it was shot through pomegranate water. I realized that when I snore through the purple butterfly This image seems to be shot through a gauze. <br /> <br /> The story is boring and doesn't help anything. For the majority of the actors' faces, the scene doesn't really focus or comes into focus after an extended period of time <br /> <br /> Everyone has the same look, so it's hard to distinguish between characters. I call this the "Dead Poets Society". <br /> <br /> Nobody cares. No one is really interested in this drama, and the film doesn't shine in interesting moments and scenes. <br /> <br /> Overall disappointment
