The plot is quite interesting with the Russian Revolution scene. I am also happy to see Budapest because the movie has been filmed there. Sadly, there is no chemical between the two main characters, so it's hard to believe the love story between them. The love scene is forced and has a mechanism. Jordan Kirkland was very stiff, almost glacial. Rob Stewart was quite charming and young, so she looked like an older sister than his girlfriend At the end, when we finally realized who was the follower, they were quite weak and didn't feel anything. I think I would be more happy with this movie if the relationship between the two actors is a little more reliable.
