I'm glad that the people at IMDb can decode this type of movie. I wonder if it's trying to be a comedian. But since it seems to want to be a melodrama that is dark and solemn, I'm not sure. For comedians, it is surprising that even a small investment in humor - until the ridiculous "twist" ending, which confirms that the worst thing is all the movies It is difficult to explain how THE HAZING is skilled. Who is involved in this film has an idea of ​​what they should do? In fact, it is worth watching so that you can stare at the screen with sagging disbelief that it's bad.
