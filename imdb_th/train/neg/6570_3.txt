I never met Charley Chase. Very funny. Even though the character on his screen reminds me of John Cleese, sometimes I find it very funny. (Charlie Chase makes me think of Hen Broon, who is mad from Scotland's 'Sunday Post' cartoon) in Chase's best movie. I always admire his professionalism rather than laugh at him. I give credit to Chase that his best movies - such as 'Mighty Like a Moose' and 'His Wooden Wedding' - inspire fans who are loyal to him ... but I'm sure The die-hard Chase fan will accept that 'Married with orders' in the early days and very rough. <br /> <br /> The chase <br /> <br /> Chasing - Enthusiastic, embarrassing, naive - Young, hoping to go to court Fair Oliver Hardy gave the best performance in this film as her scary father who insulted Chase as 'mollycoddle' Leo White, who gained more outstanding results as a foil for Cher. Placed that Essanay is in the hands of competitors here. <br /> <br /> There are some actions related to the Ingersoll watch. I was fascinated by the brand name that was mentioned in the conversation: This is the first example of the arrangement. Place the product or No? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, important flaws in 'Married to order' is the selection of Rosemary Theby as Rose: She means being a standard place, but Theby-Hawk-Hawk-flat-chest is a physically unusual thing for Theby's role (Harry Myers wife ) Have a successful career as a screen actor But never a reliable place Film historian William K Everson dealt with her indiscriminately in his film books. <br /> <br /> I would rate 'Married to Order', only 3 out of 10 and I am a charity ... because I always wonder. That Charley Chase has something that everyone gets But I missed
