This is the second movie that I met with Horrorfest last weekend. The Gravedancers is the first movie. The better Gravedancers. I can guess from watching this that production must be quite limited. Then interesting But in fact I will eventually disappear We do not give time to sympathize or understand any character that makes each of their unusual characteristics even more annoying. I must mention that there was a slight mistake with the 12-year-old boy who served as a sheriff. The only reason I watched the whole movie is to find out what the greatest secret is, which is not an interesting thing. More basic about the family can help. But they don't seem to be family. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is an amateur that I can't even see on this DVD. Four ratings for the initial potential. Stories may have This is one to cross for horror.
