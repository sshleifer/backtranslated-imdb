Is this movie made of real reality? I sincerely hope that not! <br /> <br /> We will see what appears to be a lot of armed police, releasing the same number of guns for 2 men who only receive the body's weapons. that's a great idea; Aim for armor! ... Excuse me, but the big head that shouldn't be missed or their heads for loud noises. Or have an invisible tank protecting them? Did they come from Crypton? I miss something here. <br /> <br /> This movie started well enough, but after 20 minutes of filming it became really boring. <br /> < br /> and that is just something that is satisfying or not. <br /> <br /> The unbelievable thing that makes it difficult to see it through the end. <br /> 3/10 for detailed editing
