If you still don't understand what will happen in this movie for the first five minutes, then give it a few minutes. Lilia is a widow. She is left on the shelf for too long and she wants to blow out. She has a teenage daughter who emphasizes that she is not younger. While examining her daughter, she discovered a world that she had never dared ... Cabaret, where she could dance belly dances in a skimpy sequined dress while men threw money at her. This film belongs to a very poor spouse. It shows the fear of men. Which is quite strange as Lilia used to play with them, not for money But for the hell of it When she succeeded in arousing them, it made her feel like a woman again. She doesn't want to connect with them. But she caught attention Most other dancers are older women who seem to drag men and realize that their time in the spotlight is very short. Not short enough that I speak She found romance but short with you. Guess .... not surprised here, we didn't see it. Although the ending is good But you know that it may not end at all Maybe this movie doesn't target my population - 30 men
