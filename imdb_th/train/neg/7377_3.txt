Although the story is very detailed and the story is understandable, Steven Seagals voices have been dubbed with others through the most distressing movies because you are not sure who is talking. There are many parts that he will begin to speak with his deep, hoarse voice. Then the voice of others is talking to him. I don't know why But if he had a problem with his voice during the production of the film, I thought they were able to shoot an event that didn't contain his own voice when he recovered. I rate this movie 3 out of 10 from the quality of the movie. When paying for a movie, whether it is at a movie theater or on a DVD, this movie is not worth the price of the bill being charged. I have been a follower of Steven Seagal for a long time and all of his movies that he has done for many years to this day. I think this is one of the worst movies we've ever seen.
