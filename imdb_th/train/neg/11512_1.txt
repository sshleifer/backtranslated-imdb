warning ***! Spoilers are available here! *** <br /> <br /> This is a semi-autobiographical picture of what might happen to Madonna if she is trapped on a deserted island. There is no challenge. Madonna is certainly in this role and it shows. She's just Madonna who plays Madonna and she can't get it right. I know what you are saying, you're saying "How do you know that this is something that Madonna is very fond of? You never met her!" But we all remember that "Truth or Dare", right? I know what Kevin Costner does. <br /> <br /> Do you think that in 2002, Madonna might learn something in some way from women? "Crossover" that crossed over to the silver screen. For the sake of goodness, Madonna did not see "glitter". Mariah Carey showed the world how this movie was going !!! Donna goes to the edge of beauty, ability, appearance of the screen, special abilities, character creation, you name it! All we see from this eye to the world of Madonna is that she is the only one in it. <br /> <br /> If there is one thing to say to Madonna, she is invariably when she is MTV. Loving you, creating a world of women's fashion for 20 years. Now in the film, she has defined the role of women in movies and society dating back 20 years by making women look horrid, nasty, disgusting and scary Awesome famous women were trapped in their houses that they strive. Prove that they don't really exist. <br /> <br /> *** This is a spoiler !!! Don't read anything more if you don't want to know ... *** <br /> <br /> Here are some good things I can say about this movie and I'm really impressed. They do not go for "Hollywood Ending" - the character of Madonna is still alive. At the end of a happy Hollywood general, Madonna's character died on the island and her long-suffering, persecuted husband was free to settle down with women. Good and a good woman Of his deceased wife and both of them living happily forever But in this very depressing conclusion, she was rescued and again, the victim of this husband was saddened by the wife's demons again and his life would become a living hell again. <br /> <br /> *** Here ends with a spoiler ***
