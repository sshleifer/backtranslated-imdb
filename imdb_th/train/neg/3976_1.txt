The plot is boring. The girls are boring and the leading Italian actor has never heard the Italian accent clearly. Someone said that the kids are cute in this movie. But it seems to be full of ordinary people. There is no real redemption feature about this movie. <br /> <br /> I think this is a cemetery for actors who will not work again with the exception of bad luck. Of Olsen twins that seem to attract people for unseen reasons. <br /> <br /> I hope Olsen's twins will find something from the limelight to keep them away from the business. Entertainment They have no place in it.
