Back in my days as a teacher "Private lessons" that are played at the duplex that I am working on It was a sleeper hit on Friday and Saturday nights for several weeks. I never saw it But saw it on the cable last weekend, so I decided to shoot it What I have seen in the next 90 minutes is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and that makes me look very uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The basic story is that a teenager wishes after a sexy girl. His (Silvia Kristel) She seems to feel attracted to the boy. But for more scary reasons So we got the scene of a boy who looked at her strip and she invited him to see. And from there <br /> <br /> Eric Brown, as a teenager, must be one of the worst actors I have ever seen. His "fear" reaction to every time Sylvia takes off his clothes or When she touched him, it was horrible. I didn't laugh once between these junk. <br /> <br /> And don't start in the plans of housewives and drivers who plan to extort money from children. Assuming that it is related to pretending to be dead, burial .... I can continue to go, but it's even more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The sex scene is the worst I've ever seen. Although Eric Brown is older, he looks at the truth that he looks like a child. It seems that he doesn't have the idea of ​​kissing a woman. (If that is a show, so I might think of my criticism about Brown) again, and it came too close to sticking with child pornography. I have never been closed by the sex scene. Although Miss Kristel is beautiful and doesn't wear clothes. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler warning ** I have to talk about the last scene. For me, it's just a normal illness. But I remember the audience cheering as the movie was framed and melted into credit. Our hero returned to school and started courting with a female teacher. He asked her to go out for dinner and she gave him as if Tom Cruise had just asked her. She nodded and insisted he walked out and smiled at the camera with victory. Let me take a break! Yes, I am sure the teachers will just risk everything for a normal teenager. <br /> <br /> I will not understand the appeal that this movie had in 1982. Of course, it is more nudity because of the number Much Teen fuck with nude pictures that drop bombs at the box office. And when they think that these teenagers are the same who encouraged this movie 22 years ago, now are following the steps of the organization and may help this country That's a scary thought.
