I saw this film at the Rotterdam festival, as well as other voters. The director appeared and seemed to work very hard and committed to the project, which I thought would explain the average reception Above and marked as received It's similar to when the Aussie kids love the "Round the Twist" that is the longest. But it is too serious to have the reward redemption feature The movie in itself may be worth it if you're trying to make a movie world tour that visits every UN member country because I can't think of another Fiji movie. But overall it is normal And fall victim to sub ideas The moral of the story seems to be that the native islanders will try and screw together. But as long as there is a suitable white governor to step in, all problems can be solved. (By leaving the island)
