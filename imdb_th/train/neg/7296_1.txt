Columbo has been falling for many years this year, probably the lowest point. Peter Falk gave the same unsatisfactory performance and came in like a ghost. As usual in this series, the protocols of crime scenes have never been heard before, so reliability is not enough. Brenda Wakaro chewed the scenery and pulled the pantomime face and Andrew Stephens was an unbelievable female man. (Although he is a faint person!) The script comes from numbers and help in delivery. They shouldn't bring Columbo into the nineties. Leave us all in one or two happy memories. The wise transform the script better.
