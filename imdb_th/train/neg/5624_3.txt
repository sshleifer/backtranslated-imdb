During his short 40 years on the planet, author Jack London tried to cram as many adventures and events as possible. This film takes 90 minutes, referring to the biography of human life. But assuming that it is true that it does not scratch the surface and is still a very brilliant story for modern recollections here. Michael O'Shea, one of his first roles in London and his performance, both deteriorated and saw Sympathetic He's not a problem here. Or as Susan Hayward, who is very young and beautiful. He plays the role of Charmian, his biography in London, which is the "basis" for this film in London. The life in London here is broken down into various episodes, which the film screened gently across. Therefore, we had a brief incident with London as pirates, oysters, seals in the Bering Sea, gold ore explorers in Yukon and Journalists during the Russo-Japanese War ... Certainly colorful activities But didn't give anything like Depth treatment And the direction of Alfred San Tel. (He also directed Susan's first film, "Our Leading Citizen," in 1939) was not very good. Making things worse here is a very poor quality DVD with ridiculous print sources and buzz. For me, the best thing about renting this movie is one of the special features of the DVD, that is the catalog of all Alpha movies, with hundreds of color movie posters. We just hope that these movies will have a better shape than "Jack London"!
