This is the wrong image of the homeless. TV told many lies about fraud in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad and claimed that we made more than $ 100 per day when $ 20-40 per day was very close to reality. When someone drives me by holding a sign to work and offer a job, I actually go to work if I can be physical and if I will be offered $ 100,000 id, that is apt to invest at least 2 years And kept in the bank the most and the remaining money is $ 10,000,000 for NL $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 cash games at the casino I always win and can win well if I just have a bankroll. But I win about $ 1,000 per month, always playing in the minimum purchase because I don't want to risk losing it all. I am just a homeless person because I do not want to risk losing all my money and losing. Sometimes I have more than $ 1,000-2,000 socks while I sleep outside. Everyone who wants to talk to contact sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger.i agree that i'm different from most homeless people though because i never drink smoke or drugs I no longer live. I am now in government housing for $ 177 per month and receive SSI and spend most of my time winning at online poker. Mothers and sunflower variety work hard so I get SSI. Glad my day hiding under the stage in the casino's nighttime sleep center. Concerns about being caught by security in Finally ended Is this TV crew coming to pick me up faster? It's a shame that they don't choose the people they choose better.
