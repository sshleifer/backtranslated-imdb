Now I'm not a movie critic. But I really hate "September 11". This movie is generally terrible. Except for the Alejandro GonzálezIñárritu group, which is most effective and relevant, this short film is the most boring and most disgusting. The worst thing in my mind is the pretentious part of Youssef Chahine, which he compares the Palestinian suicide bombing machine with American soldiers. The segment was completely closed, and considering Chahine, which seems to lack any proper means, wasted my time and patience. The idea of ​​getting 11 directors from various countries to create a movie with a view of tragedy is well done on paper. But in practice it has no taste
