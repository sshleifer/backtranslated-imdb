I read comments about this and while not expecting to have a personal record, Ryan, I expect to have some films of matter Around in being, but as soon as it was 1944, and you're not sure where everyone is, other accents are terrible because this unit should be Hawaii / Asian American But everyone talks about the imitation of the English language of Japanese people at Harvard The characters are 1-dimensional in size, and although they are based on real people, I do not feel for them and this makes me ignore them. Terrible direction of the average television movie which will be shown at midnight of the cable channel. I will avoid and look for better efforts. <br /> <br /> This is good. But deserve better telling You have the feeling that the director has seen the brothers and sisters and think that it is enough to sell his movie. My advice, avoid and watch the band of brothers, Tuskegee pilots, Glory or other movies, such as when the trumpet fades ...
