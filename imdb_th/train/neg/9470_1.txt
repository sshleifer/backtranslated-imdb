World film critics. I'm sorry. It is your duty to advise movie viewers so that they can choose what to spend money wisely. But I don't care about your advice and I am deeply hurt. However, my decision to see "The cat in the hat" didn't haphazardly. You saw three years ago, all the critics said we should avoid the "disaster" known as "How the Grinch Stole Christmas". Then some of my friends Take me to watch it and it turns into a colorful, funny and almost hypnotic Christmas season. So when critics freed their anger with "The Cat in the Hat" Seuss, a large budget, newly updated with a big star name in the title role. I think it must be the same old song. /> <br /> For five minutes I think I'm clear. Open credits are wise. Children are charming and the value of production is excellent. Then the cat appeared. There are many problems from this point. But the biggest thing is Mike Meier's ridicule at "The Grinch", assisted by Jim Carrey's inspired selection "The Cat" destroyed by Myers. He is very funny when His energy is used where they are. Every movie he created was really funny, just a funny sketch from "Wayne's World" to "Austin Powers", so he tried to do the same thing here. It's just that these funny sketches are like things. That they stuck in the end of SNL is not funny and painful No matter which author will help him out any after the enchanting prologue, the movie becomes one hour of nasty physical jokes, badly timed pratfalls and cynical stunt attempts at hip humor. This movie is the most horrifying movie experience I've ever had, so much time, talent and work has become a terrible matter. I know that the adult stars of this film will not be harmed by this mess. I just hope that Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will get more opportunities to show their charm in a better movie. If you are a parent, please avoid this, such as the plague. With movies like "Elf" and "Brother Bear" in the cinema, you have a much better option.
