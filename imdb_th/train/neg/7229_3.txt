It seems that the film begins in the middle, introducing peripheral players as if they were important and presenting the main characters without having to use any substance and some paper and / or come back. Almost no one has a credible or visible motivation for their actions in this movie. Plot the story and finally can't go. The conversation is boring and boring, and the director has a little idea of ​​how to get the best from his actors. It almost felt that there was the first half of this movie. <br /> <br /> We said that there was a mysterious pyramid in New York City and Central Park became a mysterious Arctic land. It seems that there is nothing that creates excitement among the general population and is only the least government concern. <br /> <br /> We present the "evil organization" in Eugenics. But that's just A convenient idea to fill the universe with Minions, pairing the power partner "Eugenics-is-bad". All are tough and never really pan here. We should pay attention to the main character. But we never learned enough to know why Many about this world that has been developed or not fully developed, which was created for rationalization 1 hour 40 minutes for rape. <br /> <br /> In the world of digital animation I can say that at the same time that this film makes many directors do the same thing with more smooth and reliable results. <br /> <br /> After spending time watching this movie In my heart is "so?"
