This move was slow, poor, cold, dark and without plans or hopes. It follows the tried and true European formula that they really like to subsidize, which has never been seen before. But critics think it is "important point". <br /> <br /> The movie is worth it if there's nothing more than acting. A huge difference in thinking between Americans and Europeans about employment. In this film, men still retain their wounds from last year and feel that it is the duty of the government to let them work. We know that we have to go out there and create value for someone. <br /> <br /> Spain never looks back!
