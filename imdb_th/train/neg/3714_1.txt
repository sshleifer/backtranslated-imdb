This film is a new work of Warren Beatty's 1978 film "Heaven Can Wait" but was written for Mr Rock's insistent funny style. The evidence remains the same: Lance Barton (Rock) is taken Before his life time came up and worked with the King's agent, King, King returned to the world as someone else. In Beatty's movie, he chooses a murderer, Charles Wellington, a wealthy white man because he dreams of Sontee Jenkins (Regina King), born at Wellington's home during the murder. The role of Mrs. Wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea of ​​turning an old white millionaire into a black comedian standing up to try to find Sontee is not an interactive job. Rupp has shown Rock in Wellington while Wellington's true 'white' failed miserably. May be improved with the original Betty plot, which in itself does not show a special idea of ​​life after death But they cannot be found in "to the world"
