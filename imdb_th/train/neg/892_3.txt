(I will specify in this review, the point that the spoiler starts) My dissatisfaction was divided: 30% deaf voice, 70% lackluster writing. <br /> <br /> 30 %: I agree with the conclusion of the first reviewer. About the lack of diversity in the characters and the extent of the story I am amazed that this movie is the best. In short, the real NYC excerpts by narrowing the collection of people and relationships to find that it is inhabited only by Gossip actresses. From people who like Gossip girls). Few little characters are written in the story. But they were included in the bond while we can see the gear under the film clearly trying to "There is variety" but falling down. <br /> <br /> 70% is the reason that everything is shortened. All white characters, including minorities, tokens are one-dimensional concepts that cut from people's cardboard. Worse, their interactions were written in such a way that each article in the movie was treated by the audience. What I said was "Gag": We received basic ideas. Wise, twisted. But even though we suppressed cynicism for a moment to say "Okay, that's a surprise." ... The story is not interesting because they are superficial. When you create a story so that their existence just But unexpected. At the end, you're writing a joke. <br /> <br /> Bottom spoiler ... <br /> <br /> The movie tries to tell the story. Romantic stories are okay. But romance is amazing, sometimes complicated. These "romantic" stories each have a girl and a boy who share some of the same points and see each other. The exchange of ideas is due to the use of voice overs. But they can only communicate with the audience that one person is attracted to others. <br /> <br /> No meaning of temptation (in broad terms), no tension and no confrontation or involvement. Join between the wills of two different people who try to compromise their existence to help others. There is a single narrative relating to superficial "temptations" so that the audience is surprised that the man (Ethan Hawk) gets unexpectedly attacked by a woman who becomes an unexpected prostitute. Of course, his words when trying to catch her were interesting to hear, and we felt like we were if we were next to them. But there is nothing important in this matter outside "A and B", so it spread out if there is anything like a postcard can "unfold" with other tales as well: A and B - that's the only point that these things This happened "set" in Manhattan. However, the only Brooklyn we saw was the body of Coney Island. The only thing that makes Queens is the train ride by the characters traveling to West Village. <br /> <br /> It's easy to choose to watch movies that play in the general form of sex competition. Sexual tastes and so on, however, _ New York, I Love You_ deserves strict consideration because of its name. We expect to see real New York and real New Yorkers. But we did a march before we selected the parts of the population. Its characters flew from The OC plus a few other people that would make it look like For variety But when we look closely at those characters who are, all deception becomes a disrespect to the idea of ​​diversity and ethnicity and culture that the film cannot show shamefully. <br /> <br /> For example, the story of Latino people and small white girls in the park received mistakes from two women as men. (Her nanny) in fact when he was a father Although the final scene of this part is not necessary from a remarkably created perspective (It's more interesting to finish this story when the mother and girlfriend / stepfather are walking along the girl). It's a bit disgusting. The exact scene that we learned that the girl's father was Latino. ALSO must tell us that he is a sex dancer. What can a father not be a man from South America? Now, obviously, he is hot. The audience is ready to accept that he has a child with a middle-class white woman on top? Are we innocent that I want that? As if the Mexican construction workers were not too tasty. <br /> <br /> It's not my place to tell where this movie should go. But in every setting and possible twisting direction that leads to screaming, the status quo attracts safety All of these stories are even more interesting, even though we are forced to maintain the same dimension of the characters that reside in them, at least without choosing from clear standards and maps. An Asian girl living in Chinatown was an old white man popping up? How can a mountain bike race in Asia follow a white college boy? Again, I'm not saying that I have to change all the ideas. It's just that, every condemnation. It is something that shouldn't be told why anyone loves New York in addition to repetition. The real way to improve this movie is to write a worthwhile reading script. <br /> <br /> I will accept the satisfaction of the soundtrack of the movie, the good rhythm of the movie. (Although what is walking is good, digging) and the general feeling of many scenes, this movie is good to watch through and I will not prohibit anyone to do so. However, it is said that the most important reverence paid to those who are not superficial is when the old opera singer says (paraphrasing) "That's what I love about New York. Now, you probably don't know that it doesn't look like this.
