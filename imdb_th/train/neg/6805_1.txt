I watched the movie 10 minutes ago .. Wow, I still don't believe in what I watch. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie ever. If I write a list of all the shortcomings in the movie, this review will bring me a lot of sentences. (The bugs are very funny because doing that is terrible) <br /> <br /> You must be amazed at the ability of Commandos assigned to rescue planes They don't know how to move. <br /> <br /> Ice-t is a terrible actor ... and what I don't understand is that production requires him to be a hero, but he is a center .. <br /> <br /> Of course, the major drawback is that the landing of 747 requires only 3 or 4 tips from a man to send to a plane land ... amazing .. just like a dead body. Which almost had no blood at all. <br /> <br /> But I recommend Made it possible to watch this movie because it was very interesting to see that something bad could happen
