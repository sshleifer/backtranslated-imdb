'The value of the movie Ho hum, I found it extremely annoying - as if the audience will not remember the same thing! - No need to talk about boring stuff, have to watch it again. <br /> <br /> Agree that complaint. Separation for Ju-on 2 is that it should explain many unanswered questions from The first movie, which was straightforward in the 36-minute period, didn't go far enough to make the story of the highly complex story of the original. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some really good new horror stories.
