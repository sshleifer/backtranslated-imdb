Criminally Insane 2 is included in the new DVD of Black Wedding / Criminally Insane and it is also good because when I watch movies and know that there is a sequel Curious Now I have my curiosity and will not look again. Most CI2 is not anything but "backward" to CI and the image of Ethel fell asleep. Thanks to Proposition 13, she was released from Napa State (wondering if she could see cramping while she was there) and sent it to a half-way house run by a good old woman. All of this was filmed with a video camera, so the picture and sound were quite pathetic, and it was complete with a few "rolls". Who saw her assault and made her candy In addition, you have to wonder about the semi-detached house for the killer, with large drawers filled with sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink. Guess that it's about "Trust" that is misunderstood if you like or don't like Criminally Insane. In any way, there is no good reason to watch this thing except curiosity. One wonder why the creator of this story must pay attention 2 out of 10
