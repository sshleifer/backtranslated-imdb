Ron Howard directed this story? The 1966 manga has a charming, easy lesson to teach children. In this movie, Howard delivers the whoville that is full of greed. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault. I imagine a script called the most obnoxious person to imagine, so Carrey sent Tom Green and the result was movie magic. Like Danny Devito's penguins in Batman Returns Carrie, the Grinch is different from the comedies that can be excavated from his characters in the 1966 cartoons, presenting the Grinch that we can all identify. Carrey's Grinch is an angry old man that we all have seen at one time or else sitting in a car parked mumbling to herself or stumbling a toddler at a supermarket with his cane. Is famous for the level of humanity, humor or any introspection and his redemption at the end of the movie. All the famous films are false: there is a stupid Christmas match. The effort fails to explain why Grinch flings by digging into his childhood and the mystery that cannot be understood why some Whos. Can not extend their strange mouths In contrast to the 1966 cartoons, I imagine children will find that this movie is boring, annoying and full of conflicting messages. Do we need to see Slutty Smurf, also known as Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard is full of actors and relatives who are not patents. Throw the necessary jokes, funny fart, sex gags and low humor, low eyebrows, Carreyesque and you have a movie about cartoons in 1966 (or an inspired book) as far as George W. Bush comes from. Lift your finger to this fat turkey.
