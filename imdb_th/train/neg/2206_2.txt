Scientists on the island are deeply saddened about the loss of a son who died of kidney cancer. So he thought: Why didn't the dead son turn into a hammerhead shark? Who wouldn't do it? It is difficult to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that kills everyone is called "Paul" all the time. In addition, actor William Forsythe as a hero MacGyver-kick-ass-saving Today, lack of credibility On the other hand, there are little chicks that make you look at the screen while Paul sharks another dead. In fact, I found that b-bad movies were quite amusing. But for my taste, it should be a much better movie if done to say less than 1000000 coins. So it's fun.
