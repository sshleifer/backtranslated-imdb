I'm really looking forward to seeing this thing because I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a talented actor. Interesting starting point I like the relationship between the two stars. From there, he quickly jumped over to the main plot, which is that they were attacked by strangers and Dier was severely defeated while Anderson was raped. Then they decided to take revenge. Sounds good, it's okay. The story is boring and the track and some really strange things. I will not give any details but what happens that I have no desire to see. I like to make all the movies to benefit from doubts and I want to like this movie. It doesn't work. I give 3 out of 10, mostly for acting.
