This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Boring stories, brutal conversations and performances I'm not sure whether this movie is the result of the film school's homework or not. It was not particularly successful in trying to appear as a continuous one. Horizontal camera pan whooshing is an economical and non-hidden method.
