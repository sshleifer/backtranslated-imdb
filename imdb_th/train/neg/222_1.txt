As a single woman over the age of 40, I found that the film was insulting and insulting. Single women over the age of 40 do not talk about other women of all ages. It is a sad and pathetic effort to write and direct. "The chicks flick" and it failed miserably. Andy McDowell was not a great actor, but received a "plot" that does not exist. (I hate to talk about the plot) In this story, she has no chance at all. No character development, no reason to feel sympathetic / attentive to any character and no attempt to create a movie in a realistic or reliable manner. And then there was a straightforward male compulsive fantasy that decided to try to play lesbian - please. <br /> <br /> Not only do I hope I get a refund for Rent a DVD. I still want 112 minutes in my life to come back. What is it?
