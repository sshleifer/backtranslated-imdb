An American woman visited her Irish roots and fought with a druid witch who had taken possession. She sounded interesting, but after an interesting start I lost my way and spent most of my time wondering. Where are you going It looks like this movie has a different direction - are we watching the problem of an Irish-American girl who struggles with her alcohol problem? Or we are watching a horror movie about an evil witch. The director doesn't seem to be able to decide. The two do not seem to be gel and eventually you are nowhere. This thing can do a lot better and the story seems to drag to the end. This is the most boring and frustrating thing.
