This is just a scary story. The plot is ok. But the rest is not good I mean, come on a puppet, then they try to make a digital movie and make it worse! Usually I need a budget movie. But this is just a waste of time and almost makes me want to return the dress. I have about ten budget movies that have about 6-8 movies and I have to say that this is a movie that's worse than all of them. The words were closed and they used fake plastic machetes that didn't seem real. They can use one that looks even close to the real thing to save your time and money Horror movie
