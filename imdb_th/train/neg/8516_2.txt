Last week, I watched Nielsen's ratings every week and Veronica Mars estimated that "The best item you didn't see" <br /> <br /> Well, they were right. You didn't watch it. It aired twice and ranked 147 and 145 from 147 <br /> <br /> Translation: This is the list that has the lowest ranking in the nationwide broadcast network ... and deserves that. I tried to watch it a few times because of the coverage of all the media that made it a "great", "realistic" look in life and all nonsense. The truth is something else. Veronica Mars is boring. It's not as realistic as it has been, and it deserves to be canceled a lot. <br /> <br /> The only mystery is why CW felt forced to place a top-performing schedule Commercial and artistic failures
