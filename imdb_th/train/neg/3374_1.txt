This film is regarded as a classic - I don't know why. It's terrible to laugh. The only economical elegance of this movie is to deliver an embarrassing magical line until you have no choice but to laugh at them. <br /> <br /> There are good songs and good choreography. Movies, but what! There is no plot. It is located in a theater that does not have a change of scenery and Michael Douglas was feeling as depressed as ever. My brother used to force me to watch this movie because he said I wouldn't believe how bad this movie was! He was right. <br /> <br /> Usually with this scary movie, I would like to recommend that people should not watch. But in this case, I think people should do it because it will make a bad movie in perspective.
