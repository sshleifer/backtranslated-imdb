The best actor <br /> <br /> The script is not good and there is no good direction too. My main problem is that I don't care about these people. Not a killer, not a victim. The setting is quite boring. The character of Dennis Quaid wrote very badly. I didn't care even at the end. He brought the baby back to the big story! I need a refund
