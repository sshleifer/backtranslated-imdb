After watching this movie, you will know why it's not shown in theaters! The film does not deserve the "prequel" tag, but this is a common theme in Hollywood. Cut the movie well before this, with prequels, catastrophes, sequels, etc. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie is Bounce everywhere, like balls, ping pong and character development. That does not exist I felt seriously that I was watching a comedy on some issues in this movie because the performance was terrible. P Diddy had to stop watching nonsense movies with his scary performances. He made me laugh every time. <br /> < br /> The only thing that came out of this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis that looks good in this movie and actually brings entertainment from watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan Avid of Carlito I recommend Do you not see this If you decide to continue watching it, try to make this movie look as if it were stripped from the original because that's what it does.
