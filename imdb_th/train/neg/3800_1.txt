Naming the most pathetic things in film history is not easy. Applicants that are very rich, but Nemesis 2 is my personal favorite since I saw it. It was very funny that we had to rent again the next day and again I laughed so hard that I literally rolled onto the floor. (This usually happens when I see Monty Python's "Scott of the Antarctic") <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, both the feelings that overwhelm the audience I was most confused that this home video was clumsy that had been done in the production process. It should be a sequel. But there is no relation to the first movie The hero has the same name, but this time "Alex" is a woman, even though it takes us to the half-way movie to stop guessing what has muscle and wandering sets that are wild! <br /> <br /> There is no plot. Actually, it's just a lengthy chase scene. It's slow and unconscious, calling it the chase scene, making it look more interesting than it actually is. Almost without any dialogue, which is considering the quality of it, and then the movie came to a sudden end after the blatant action scene with a lot of gasoline explosions. Fortunately, it's never boring because it has something stupid and fake. <br /> <br /> Scary movies are often boring, but Nemesis 2 is the perfect combination between seriousness. That it truly provides entertainment Rent this movie or buy it, you won't be disappointed!
