This is a very bad movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> First of all, too long. The longest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story is there. Damn Over the Top !!!! <br /> <br /> Actually That line was destroyed. <br /> <br /> Humor is not funny !!!!! It's not funny ... <br /> <br /> The story is nasty and badly written. It doesn't matter whether the characters are alive or dead .......> <br /> I have Expect something from this movie ......... but my expectations have failed completely in the first few minutes ...... <br /> <br /> The only thing good. About this movie is MUSIC ...... and obviously Vidya Balan gave her the best performance and stand out among the senior actors ...... She's just a New face But she still shines and makes the rest of the actors look pitifully pathetic !!!!! Govinda and the blonde girl who is interested in his love also helps to cure this film from disaster. Gwinda is suitable for the role of a taxi driver. And the blonde girl gives a delicate and consistent performance .... <br /> <br /> A talented actress like Ayesha Takiya died in this movie !!!! priyanka like Well !!!!!!!!! Akshay did his job well. But it looks too cool !!!!! Wasted !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> All of this is a very impossible movie with Mishmashed and TOOO Masladar that the story is based on a stupid funny scene. Imagine how stupid this movie is !!!!!! <br /> <br /> 3/10 It's four hours long !!!! Think and think again before going to the cinema !!!!! Better avoid it !!!!!
