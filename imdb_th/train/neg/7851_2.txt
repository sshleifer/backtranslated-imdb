As has been said countless times, "Hill has 2 eyes", not of the mid-80s (without attention) remake remake of Wes Craven in 1977, the original but wanted to give the sequel to remin-to-a-remake This is the official Diminishing Returns, Craven himself (as a threat with Jonathan) has decided to screen the same quality movie - in the English language, horrible, former music video director.
