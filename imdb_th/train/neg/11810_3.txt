I noticed with fun at the end of the Detroit Credit PD. Thank you for joining. The police chief has a line that speaks one line of play itself. (And the boy, can you tell that he can't do it?) The reason for the fun is that in this movie, the police fired before and asked questions later Not publicity. I think the police forces want In addition, this is your standard police and robber movie that was dressed in the 70s with a racial angle. Alex Rocco received a role that did not appreciate the police who could not move forward and had to bear with a mentally ill wife. He did this by going out on a local prostitute. Hari Rhodes is his smart partner who has a groovy wardrobe and likes to chase suspects while wearing a raincoat. This movie moves continuously until it reaches the final unreasonable penalty. (Why do people who are guilty of robbery happen with all police force?) Not only do we see a shot once But because there are four villains, we have seen four people Then there is an end that should let anyone guess what will happen, but I think it's just how stupid. When seeing that director Arthur Mark is still behind the scenes of "Friday Foster" and "Bucktown", I shouldn't doubt.
