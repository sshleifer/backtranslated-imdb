There is no real plot to talk about, it's just an excuse to show some violent scenes and free sex. (Which can sometimes be fun as well But it's not in this case.) What can I say about this again ... The action that happens is creative and there are cool scenes where two characters fall from a skyscraper. (Scenes that have to be several miles high) But overall, there isn't much to suggest "Kite". Watch it if you want. But you won't go away much if you skip it ...
