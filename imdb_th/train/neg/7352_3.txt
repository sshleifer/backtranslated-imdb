This is not a joke in 1972. Now it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Unlike many others, I didn't beat this movie because it was incredibly feminine - I claimed. Enjoy it or Happy with the reactions that are annoying to the PC people - I beat it because I couldn't write and act well. <br /> <br /> The really memorable character is Blakey. Immediately since he Is a favorite with Impressionist for a long time. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br />
