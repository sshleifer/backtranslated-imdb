I disagree with other audiences in this film. The only reason I didn't give a score 1 because it was terrible is Carmen Miranda's great talent. The beginning and the end are the best parents because of singing and dancing with talent. <br /> <br /> The problem is The remaining pictures of Alice Faye come out quite hollow. Don Ameche has a great singing voice. But with a miserable writing material, he fell out of a terrible repetition. <br /> <br /> The story is true here, with Ameche assuming two parts as a singer and dancer and baron. Did not marry Faye happily. <br /> <br /> Looks like playing music and dancers. Ameche's marriage makes the second change become. A silly nonsense about a baron that must eliminate business and stay away. Help him to play both. <br /> <br /> SZ Sakal receives little things to do here and funny gifts of He will not be given the opportunity to shine Ditto for J. Carrol Naish, which actually feels uncomfortable in his role. <br /> <br /> This is a blast of the chica chica boom of the movie.
