In my knowledge, the Largo winch is a famous Belgian cartoon (never read) that tells the adventures of Playboy, a type of James Bond without a spy life! So when I had to choose a movie for a 5 year old boy, I picked it up because this boy was already a big fan of James Bond. <br /> <br /> But after opening my credit There is a lot of doubt: when the American movie has an amazing start, there are no action scenes and hot sex scenes? Then the story became more complicated with financial movements. I think I lost a child. <br /> <br /> But surprisingly he was arrested by Largo and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> Is it a wonderful interpretation of Tomer Sisley? Largo has a difficult relationship with his father? How many boxes are friends that are bad people, bad people are friends? Honk-Kong's exotic location, Yougoslavia? <br /> <br /> Dunno, but he's really interested in Largo ("Will he get up?) And we enjoy our time.
