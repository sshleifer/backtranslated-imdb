Is a very scary movie I like monster flicks. But I can't see even half of the horrific performances, the characters, the cardboard and the special effects deep. Nothing exchanged about this movie. The characters come from the stupidity of innocent cannons, otherwise, or they will have no idea. The story is a formula, cut and paste, floating science, rampant standards. Even CGI is scary. You know it's bad when you can't rely on this movie to provide good eye food. Not surprisingly, here is old, as old as This is one of the worst movies ever created. Director Roger Corman should be hung from a light pole so that children can use him as a pinata.
