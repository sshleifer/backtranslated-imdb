Fun concept But did not perform well Except for good enough makeup effects Have obvious problems For example, after receiving what appears to be weeks and weeks to get out of normal size fat, the main character seems to go from normal size to thinning in the day ... and when he is thinning, he is still thin as well Something that seems to be a long time. <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie has a worse problem - movies are lower than budget - most TV shows and shows are pretty. The great surrounding Robert John Burke seems to be trying to impersonate Charlton Heston's strange character and the very pain of watching ... the only scary thing is Lucinda, Jenny and Kariwuh are even worse. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie as high as I was when the movie came in 1/3 or more. And the character of Joe Mantegna replaced This movie develops fun feelings for the slaughterhouse, cheese cheese of the camp and The gangster's crazy plan for torturing the disgusting gypsies is quite fun to watch. The ending, if predictable, means very well. Avoid unless you are a King-o-Phile or awakened by the thoughts of Fat Tony's voice from the Simpsons that scare the Gypsy camp.
