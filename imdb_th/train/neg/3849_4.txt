Debbie Reynolds touches Tango's feet and yes touches through her dance through this ordinary thriller, which has a clear 30s atmosphere. Two women brought together when their son committed a murder. Try to start their lives again by conducting a dance school, tapping to dull in Hollywood. The problem is that one of them is disturbed by nerves. You imagine this thing 10 years ago with Robert Aldrich, director Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ...? Nahh, Bette won't let Joan make a screen for a long time to place her stuff and I can't imagine. Bette Davis in other roles This is a real disgusting piece, written by Henry Farrell (which thinks "good" shock is the massacre of rabbits!) It's not honest fun in warm packages * 1/2 from ** **
