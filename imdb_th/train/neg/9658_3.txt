My God, it's an amazing movie! Remind me of a similar scene in Mel Gibson's "We be Soldiers" when "The company is not lost. They have just been cut off" and another scene in Pearl Harbor when the British authorities speak to Ben Affleck. It is like you, so God helps countries that war with America. <br /> <br /> Collect all 3 movies together and you will have enough BULLSHIT to breed the entire Sahara. <br /> <br / > The troops of the regiment that had been cut could be true enough. But the film can be done without all the American preaching jingoistic propaganda attached to it. There is a wailing sound that can be heard in the theater during the scenes mentioned above). <br /> <br /> "The Americans think they have courage." Actually, I'm cringed and cursed near puked. All that is sprayed out all over the diocese. Lahore is) <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are done well (3-star), but if the script is. Fertilizer then wrapped in brightly colored ribbons. It is still a fertilizer. Writer James Carabatsos also wrote those other screamers? Hamburger Hill, No Mercy, Heartbreak Ridge. Please shoot him before he can write the garbage anymore br /> <br /> Director Russell Mulcahy is also an Australian, a shameful God !!!
