The first half of this film has a steady rhythm and introduces characters. However, everything that happened suddenly happened too quickly. The crippling reason for Akshey Kumar reached the third match. The very popular girl in the performance by Akshey and John Abraham Neha Dupia was the highlight of this movie. In Hera Pheri. Overall, this movie is the most frustrating. This movie is not fair with movie trailers. Save your money and don't watch this movie. See Hera Pheri and Hungama again. <br /> <br /> Summary: Cheap stage performances and appearances in this film do not have any stories or content. Listen to music. Good from Preetam. Men who buy Dhoom for us! Keep it! Movies filmed in the same room, newcomers (Actress) is ok because it's their first movie. But the actors created like Akshey and John were disappointed with the director who created them like Priyadarshan!
