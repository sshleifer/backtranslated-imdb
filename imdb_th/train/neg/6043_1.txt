You have to see my opinion about many movies under Evren Buyruk .. I went out to comment on another story that wasn't worth even one minute to mention .. This movie is Dafoe's character for two hours - To death, the only surprise in this movie is that you don't have enough clues or knowledge about the characters to surprise you. It's a scary story and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Willem Dofo is a great actor. Peter Stormare is a great actor. But this movie just sucked Slowly does not make the movie bad, but it is bad. The plot is mixed with ramblings. The art of anamorphic details is not drawn together in a meaningful way for the plot, except to emphasize some of the blood shown from many angles Finally looked at the end I appreciate the artistic vision. But as entertainment, it makes me sleep (Seriously, I fell asleep and had to watch this movie again, which is more frustrating). In general, I don't like to express negative opinions or criticism about other people's work, even if they suck. But this film is guaranteed. It's terrible that these great actors are embarrassed by this end result.
