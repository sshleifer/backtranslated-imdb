When teenagers travel in a van, there are many things you can guarantee to come. <br /> <br /> 1) Teens will be warned not to go where they go by the local people, Dan Van Husen. Deal with ridiculous things about deadly sirens. What, who, how and why are handled in an event that is almost impossible to understand. 2) The van will crash. 3) While looking for help, the group will be separated and selected individually by whatever monster they are warned of. About 4) They will find a house where the madman lives. They will catch them. 5) The house will have a phone. But it will not work, it will be disturbed, decorated with neon lights, flashing spiders and caterpillars 6) Mad people will catch them as they try to escape in vehicles that will not start (Here must be escaped with a high-speed tractor) 7) Mad people will be killed, seeming to come back from death in shock, fear, cheap, weak, and then be killed correctly 8) Only women Only one person who still lives from group 9) will have unnecessary twists at the end. <br /> <br /> Add these elements in vain. Sirens (those whose characters seem to respond in a different way Differ even though The truth is that anyone who sees them should fall in lust s) to seduce and kill a teenager. The neck is torn and the body is drawn halfway, and you have something similar to the dream movie. The twelve year old man <br /> <br /> I think it's fair to say that the director's comments. And his previous work As low as possible But I am happy to point out that there are certain elements that students are satisfied with and have excellent improvements in his previous films. Darkhunters, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Sometimes movies are very good, music and editing of his previous films and other low-cost horror movies. I was very impressed to hear that it was successful with one third of the money spent on the previous surprise. However, the worst thing about this movie could not be found in the film's content. It is ultimately to divert attention if the pointless movies that have been done over and over again. But in the special DVD. <br /> <br /> If you rent this movie, I urge you to listen to the opinion of the director. It's beyond belief. There is more to say about this than the movie itself. An interesting part of the criticism is the claim of the director that this movie has an ancient idea because it is a foster concept. He said that it was a deliberate attempt to use all clichés and revealed that he suspected that "People will get" <br /> <br /> I'm afraid to say that if this thing should be a nod to the past and the movie in the past and the genre of clichés within them, then it doesn't script smartly Do the right thing Tone or directed with a style that is sufficient to work If this film was created to lead me to ask a question; "What is the point?" This is an afilm that has recently been inserted into a bad horror movie. Any attempt to do something clever or different still doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Nuggets of The next brilliance is the conversation about the head of digital. Movie format They point out correctly that digital is often synonymous with being cheap and easy to use. However, the best moments of conversation occurred when they lamented the fact that when Michael Mann created a movie in the form that he was labeled as a vision. There is a simple difference to be made here; Mann is a director who has the ability to use patterns to suit his story and style. Roberts is a horror hacker who uses it to create a downstairs type of image. I think the difference is clear and the comparison is not only arrogant but repetitive. <br /> <br /> The best moments are reserved for Robert's opinion about people who spend time reviewing movies. Before him People who don't like it are 'geeks' and he still goes as far as singles who have nerves to comment on forums that support them to do so. I have to admit that I was a little disappointed that his last film review was not separated. That damn continues because of the jokes about Norwegian critics, with a 'hilarious' accent, to imply that people from Norway do not know good movies just because they were born. As with these comments, talking about what they say more than they target them just But causing the director and his friends to look ignorant. <br /> <br /> The package that blends with the features that have a taste about the siren is handsome. 'I don't want to make movies like Baywatch. The audition of the naked and naked girl twisting on the floor There is also a documentary about the creation of Darkhunters that acted similarly, self-centered while Robert said that the critics claimed that Forest was "The best British film in many years" I don't know if he's trying to convince anyone. At one point in the description of Robert joked that "I saw people sitting at home saying" This is not amazing. It's $ sh. "He's not wrong.
