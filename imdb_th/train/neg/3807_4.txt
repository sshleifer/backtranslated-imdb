Don't understand me wrong. I'm a big fan of Woody's many films, clearly his masterpiece in the late 1970s (Annie Hall, Manhattan interior) and drama. The 80s / early 90s, most of them (Hannah and his wife) I actually liked his latest effort. (Melinda, whatever, little things), but this is my best, even if it's not worse than last year, but I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> It's been planned lazily - by General will be the point of intersection between Match Point, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Small Time Crooks with all the jokes brought out - Woody looks the most astray. The lines and the submission of the 'hilarious' poem, I mean with respect, because ...' over and over again until its tenderness becomes naked. <br /> <br /> I know most actors. Waiting in queue To work with him But at least they should read the script first - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are much better - and Woody should have a greater role in the future of the camera if he has about 20 miles of feelings about it. <br /> <br /> Wouldn't be sad if we didn't have many good woody movies. Compare this with - but clearly, his best day is behind him and judging with this effort, Woody should call it the day before he becomes a joke in the industry. <br /> <br /> Embarrassingly bad
