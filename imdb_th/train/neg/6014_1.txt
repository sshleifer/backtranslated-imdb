Left behind is an incredible waste of over 17 million dollars. The show is weak and unimpressive. The story is even weaker. The audience was asked to believe that the plans were totally unbelievable and ridiculous at times and did not receive any reward for their good faith. This film is not only But only acting and writing badly But still lacking all technical content in making movies as well Production design does not help in creating credibility. The effect is not the same and flat. The overall light and continuity are incredibly terrifying. Even compared to movies with a budget of ten However, this story will not happen to millions of families who will no doubt embrace this film because it is useful and has a religious bias. And who can blame them However, unfortunately, they will be forced to accept the film for the third time.
