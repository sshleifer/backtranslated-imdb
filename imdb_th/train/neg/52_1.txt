I am excited to see the film of Catalan in the competition in Berlin. But after the presentation, I was disappointed and very angry. Too much blood, too much time, too many themes for anything. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, is very scary. Revenge of unreasonable human behavior is shown in countless movies and plays as well as the relationship between homosexuality and suspicion in Spain about the Roman Catholic Church. But what Mr. Villalonga did was a pseudo-tragedy that could be the worst history of the movie. It's a shame to see Angela Molina in this movie. I do not recommend anyone to watch this movie.
