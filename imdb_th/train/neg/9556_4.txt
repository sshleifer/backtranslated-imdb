Most of this movie will follow the scene and special effects. It's very weak in planning. Most computer conversations are just jumbo. I watched this because I was a big fan of the original War Games movies, most of which used computers and real computer terminology. This film has no such thing. Most computer scenes not only But is really impossible and unrealistic with computers and networks, but it is still a weakness It's like it was written by someone who doesn't understand the real computer. <br /> <br /> The Ripley game is weak and is an arcade game. There is no real hacking, so what's the point? Boring movie Weak sequel
