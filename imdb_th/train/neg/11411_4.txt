The story has been updated many times. "Breath of life in a nursing home", plays, movies, novels, short stories, poems and news articles. But it is also a great stage for character education. <br /> <br /> If 'Gideon' is created more enthusiastically, the conversation is boring and the story is full of ancient ideas (Even subtitles and summaries of Gideon's "simple wisdom" almost made me laugh in inefficiencies.) The most indifferent performance was the last straw for this weak movie. But the rest of it is gentle enough to make the actor lack concentration without involving this matter
