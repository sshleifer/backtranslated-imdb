There is no reason to disturb this flick rental. From the opening of the credit, I know I have a problem. <br /> <br /> It was filmed as if it were a soft porn movie but nothing about it. Looking into the world of sexual addiction is interesting. But only the issues <br /> <br /> boring sex scenes, bad plot and cameos by Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette are not enough to record this movie.
