We expect good things when we look at this bomb. It is basically a Broadway play, put in a movie. The music is terrible. There are no memorable songs in the movie - can you hear popular songs from this movie? You will not because there is no Some musical numbers continue until I get up to go to the bathroom and pick up the popcorn and it continues when I'm back! If they are good music - but they suck the slow pace, the development of scary characters. The lead singer received praise for her singing. But sounded like she screamed all the songs - almost impossible to stand This film has nothing to offer to anyone except those who like Broadway. There is no doubt that this movie is the most popular that I have seen in my whole life. Complete waist of time and money There is nothing memorable about this movie, except for Danny Glover - who isn't on the screen enough and his character hasn't developed enough. Rent a video and you will agree. - This movie is more expensive than dogs that are produced and polished.
