Cynthia Rock (China O'Brien), "Manhattan Chase" in 2000, makes this film fun and of course this cute little girl is pretty broken. Artistic ability and hot sexy body China O'Brien was upset as a police officer and decided to call it resigning and returning home to her hometown and return to her roots and her father, a local sheriff. Her father is older and the city has changed. The gangsters have taken over the city and started to give local women a trick and the people of the city become sick and tired of the hell. You can almost guess what happened, and you're right in China. O'Brien fights after the big tragedy in her life. Bad performances throughout the picture, but Cynthia Rothrock brought this film to a great conclusion.
