First of all, I was reminded that I watched this movie on TV and the English language was dubbed - which could cause the atmosphere to be totally lost. However, I will rate what I see and hope to bring people out of that model. I found this film to be boring The atmosphere of every movie disappeared from the dubbing of the movie, causing the film to be badly slow. I'm sorry, but the sin of the worst movie in my book is slow, except when the film about philosophy. I do not see deep philosophical meanings in this movie. Maybe I'll miss something. But I have to say, like I saw I rate "1" What can I say about the taste of the United States?
