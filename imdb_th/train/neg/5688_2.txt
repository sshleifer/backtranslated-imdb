Short version: Seeds are not worth it It's just a derivative and inferior and soulless. <br /> <br /> Long version: If you've never seen any movies that include genres The "horror psychology" that is unclear, this film may cause your face to melt, maybe not, but it will make you burn better. Editing, uncovering real animal cruelty is enough to open your eyes to the possibility of cruelty on videos and memorable scenes (only). Later in the movie, maybe more than you can handle. Climax will play with your emotions in a way that may not have other movies. <br /> <br /> But if you don't have much experience with this type If you see the real thing ... for example, "August Underground's Penance", you will find it extremely difficult to wake up until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Other auditors Compare this with old videos. I understand this comparison. Like the cruelty of the video, "Seed" is more violent than the mainstream and less subtle horror movies. But the reason our videos are not yet known is not only But for the reasons above - something that is popular also has something special Allow me to be vague. I think you will understand: those who are stuck around have "souls". <br /> <br /> Take this quote from Gabriele Crisanti, the director of "Burial Ground" in a new interview - DVD: "... We will not have this kind of movie anymore because today, technology has more than imagination and cool technology. Many things will disappear because small movies like this will no longer be produced. Today we have Excellent and excellent techniques that are very expensive. But they were cold this horrible horror movie that cost more than one million dollars. These movies are not expensive ... They are real effects. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's wrong. Will seriously compare the horror in the old school, but Crisanti hit the nail at the head, even in the most probable exploits. The most disgusting thing of the video still follows the traditional "truth" and This Boll fell short was that it was as if he was watching a movie and do not understand them. Everything in the checklist has ... BS about "making a statement about humanity", torture scenes, pornography, etc. But it is like Crisanti, making "cold" blood is CGI. All things are all feeling like the scenes that accompany them. Together from other types of movies and slow pacing Just already Weak movie
