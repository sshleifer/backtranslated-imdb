This film has a simple but terrible story. The film is about a girl who was sucked into the door to another dimension. Then, many years later, the witch opened again while a group of friends. Campers with her new partner ... other women ... Yes, they are lesbians and of course there are no nudity. Unfortunately, the devil follows a mature woman now. There is no explanation at all. Where are they? Where does the devil come from She survived as a child in a place full of evil demons. Who trained you and made you a fighter? I think the performance is terrible. But it's hard to tell because writing is terrible, maybe nothing they can do I give these three pieces because the wrestler is quite good and the effect is quite fun, even if it's very cheap. I wouldn't recommend it. It's not bad enough to be funny.
