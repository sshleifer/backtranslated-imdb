I live in the Middle East (in Israel). I am excited when I buy a ticket for Syriana. After seeing the sample and being a lover of excitement, I expect to see the first and fastest moving movie which makes the determination. Smarter global policy and the relationship between oil, power and corruption from a new perspective I almost left the movie in the middle. The pain slowed down, almost all the characters were typed wrong, the intertwined corrections made it very difficult to understand the logic, but as Steve Rhodes wrote in his critique, in the end you didn't care. Save your money, save your time, choose another movie. <br /> <br /> Robi Chernitsky
