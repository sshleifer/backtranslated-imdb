It's the same old "If I can't get funding for my project, I'll inject myself." Monster movie Nothing new here It's like the movie "Fly" by Jeff Goldblum. The man tries to maintain consciousness. But eventually suffer from the results of the experiment The performance is quite poor. There are people who are stupid people all the way, making their lives in danger without clear reasons. The guy returned to the lab where he was forbidden to enter. Then there was his relationship with the girl and her son. Accepted that he looked good But he seems to have many problems It's a waste of time. Even his Tyrannosaurus costume seems to be coming out of the rack in the Star Trek meeting.
