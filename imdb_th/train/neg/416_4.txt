(Some spoilers) - as if you didn't know it would end. <br /> <br /> How high is my expectation for HOLLOW MAN? Very good commercial commercials, director Paul Verhoeven and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, with a very interesting theme - invisible movie, all for great movies. Unfortunately, these things are not important. This movie is a very good week without any doubt and speculation. <br /> <br /> It's a story of many scientists discovering invisibility. After testing the animals successfully, Kevin Bacon decided to test himself. When he couldn't see him completely changed by realizing the advantages of not seeing From this point to the murder, there is a very thin line. <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is a bad movie. It is a disease that many new movies have: special techniques from challenging themes that can lead the producer to a wonderful mental thriller, Verve, ruins, everything that focuses on effects. extra I have to admit that fx is great. It's probably the best thing I've ever seen since Matrix, but it's not enough to make a good movie. Actually, that's the problem of the movie today, just like Verhoeven. Most directors are only interested in beautiful scenes and nothing more. The exceptions are very few and may be the matrix as the only film that combines special effects and great plot after the Starship Troopers Verhoeven again disappointed. Instead of a great movie, HM is cr * p. There are only 2 reasons why you watch this movie: 1. Special techniques 2. Jokes with Superman and Wonder Woman (I won't waste your time ...) < br /> <br /> Okay, what happened to the movie? Everything. See what I remember. <br /> <br /> --- It's not tense. It should be. But it's not. <br /> <br /> --- It's too predictable You know at first that who will die and who will live. <br /> <br /> --- Instead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven only cares about the consequences. <br /> <br /> - - Repetition <br /> <br /> --- Of course, the bad guys will wake up a few times before dying. <br /> <br /> --- Like in all low-quality horror movies, the first rule is to give The characters are separated as much as possible. Every time someone alone in the lab falls victim to the bacon. <br /> <br /> --- Some holes in the plot. Example: At first, Bacon must scan his finger to enter the laboratory. After he couldn't see him doing that, <br /> <br /> --- The end: really scary. <br /> <br /> --- After being bitten by the bacon at the head of the bacon. Then fell to the ground. Shue and Brolin went quietly and slowly without looking back. Is it normal? Then Bacon rose up and attacked them. They "killed" him again and then Shue screamed. "I heard the explosion" (happened a few minutes before) and they immediately ran into the side. Did you not hear the blast before? <br /> <br /> --- There is one scene where you can see the microphone hanging over the actor. Verhoeven, I expect more from you. <br /> <br /> So, that is Hollow Man. What should be a great movie becomes a trick. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10 (for special effects)
