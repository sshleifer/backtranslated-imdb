There may be spoilers. <br /> <br /> I say that. But anyone who understands enough to read this may be able to think that every turn from the beginning <br /> <br /> This is not the movie I like. Insult your intelligence But everyone felt it was too much to predict that it would end happily Have a funny bit along the way to make sure But there are few original ones At least it's not helping Which includes James Gandolfini, surprisingly having to do this to be a favorite of somebody. <br /> <br /> It's all dangerous. But not inspired 90 minutes
