Steven Greenstreet not only impressed Michael Moore, but also followed his footsteps by using Moore's many filmmaking strategies. Moore specializes in distracting viewers from the point of Interested in this while Green Street has less expertise here. <br /> <br /> After knowing all the problems around Moore's words at UVSC, I was disappointed. Community complaints - that Moore received $ 40,000 from the Utah State Education Fund to promote John Kerry's campaign and his own free film ads were pushed to the background by Green Women. While the problem is less. Br / <br /> The marketing methods for this video are equally biased and inappropriate ... Promote this movie by claiming that "Mormons try to kill Moore" not only is unusual But also destroying the main religion that Greenstreet clearly has some personal problems I closely followed Moore's visit, and all the big news agencies said that Moore's visit came and went without any reliable security issues or incidents in Utah. <br /> <br / > Green Street has left this film Film making career to the point that he stopped studying movies to help accelerate this story. This seems to be a false forecast. But since Moore visited more than 60 other colleges and universities throughout the country in 2004, the reduced interest for this rather frequent event Green Street's hypothesis that American audiences will be interested in this film because the religious and conservative corners that have been promoted seem to not be well proven. <br /> <br /> Even the name of the movie this story As a misnomer since Utah voted for Bush's new election and seems to have more political solidarity than any other state, the division in the film's name seems to indicate that the bay is in the cracks. Greenstreet's ideological differences with his religion and state If anything, I found that there was an amusing relationship between the religious views of this documentary and the hilarious controversy of Woody Allen in Sleeper (1973), "I'm defeated by Quakers."
