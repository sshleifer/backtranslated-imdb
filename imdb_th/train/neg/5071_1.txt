I can't believe that this program will last as long as it is. I think it is part of America's reduction. Personally, David Spade said that I like this show more when it uses the original name - "Seinfeld". The thing that bothered me the most about this show is in addition to the basic clarity of "humor" and general dissolves as a way. Arrogant in the episode titled A truly wonderful performance is still a joke after many people see it again, like "The person that Rob was hypnotized inadvertently" in "Dick Van Dyke Show" or "The person that Lucy and Ethel worked at the candy factory" In other words, it was an honor given to a great list of people. watch That the writer and producer "friend" will have a hubris that does not give up in naming the episodes themselves in this way before everyone has a chance to see it for the second time The original idea of ​​the writer mentioned But from the heart that looks nasty to their audience, <br /> <br /> You read some of these comments and can conclude that they live in the Hallmark-like Neverland brand. With confidence in greeting cards The true meaning of friendship? I want to be friends with anyone Do I want to stay in Manhattan? Wake up. These people should work in a coffee shop and look for work as an actor. But they live with $ 4,000 per month. Apartment? Get real, all I have to say to people among us who want to move to Manhattan and live a beautiful life in New York with your Rosses and Monicas. Good luck to everything. New York is not for anyone who earns less than six digits. But luckily with all of these things Now turn off the device and send it through Soma.
