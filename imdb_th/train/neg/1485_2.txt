For your own benefit, it is best to ignore the positive reviews about this movie. This flick is stuck. Now I like (at least theoretically) horror movies for low prices. But this movie caused the worst mistake that a low budget flick could do: to use myself too seriously And, unfortunately, that's not the only problem. <br /> <br /> It's the story of the Beane tribe that was killed by the British Ilses who were transformed into modern times. Interesting evidence But there are two things that are baffling about this movie as soon as you start watching it. <br /> <br /> # 1- Why is the biggest name in the CD Jenna Jameson? She is a woman who looks below average that cannot be shown and she has a minor role. Answer: Obviously she is a well-known porn star. (As you don't have any doubt in other reviews) So I guess this is a "hijack" image for you. She gives the desired film. "Name recognition" that looks like Her highest bill does not indicate her ability. But it is an indication that other actors are not interested. <br /> <br /> # 2- How do filmmakers act stupidly when they think Canada can Passed while in Ireland? It doesn't look like Ireland at all. And the house where guests / victims are in there is a large Nordic style wooden structure in North America They should skip the entire Beane theme and develop a story that takes place in NA. In addition, if you're going to make a movie that happens in Ireland, it's probably best to have more than one character with an Irish accent as a BAD accent. This really isn't bad if the director doesn't try to create "Night of the Living Dead" but he seems to be very bad. He should have fun with it. In fact, some scenes do not stay away from unintentional comedy as they are. <br /> <br /> Like the scandalous scene that the woman was chained to at the table naked from Then cut open Not every day. Funny. You ask in the version. The scene that has been removed, the mutant killer pulls the intestines out for many miles. In fact, it's funny after a moment. And what self-respecting humans eat intestines? Do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens? No, we eat ham and ribs and drum sticks. <br /> <br /> Another annoying actor: Sly Howard Rosenstein. I'm not sure, but I think he should be selected as an MP in the Is true, he is a loser and is a big fool like his name Which explains why the characters played by the equally annoying Gillian Leigh fell in love with him. <br /> <br /> I watched Gillian Leigh on her link on IMDb and clearly it was important that Must know that she finished high school with honors I couldn't decide whether it was amusing or pathetic rather than knowing that just a few years after graduation, an honorable student was doing a softcore porno scene in the shower with a man named Howard Rowan. Senstein Wondering if your ex-classmates have watched this movie yet? If they had hoped they would receive the message: Avoid this fate! Go to college !!! I can go indefinitely, but why if you like blood, you will find something in this flick but not so much.
