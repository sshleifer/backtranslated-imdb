This movie is terrible and is an insult to the audience. The stupid script, handsome, bad, bored, endless. <br /> <br /> Hollywood tradition The communists comforted the nitwits in Hollywood, most of whom were dumb like a stone, who loved to receive huge benefits. Eugene McCarthy, the lone one and imagined him as the leader of the vast movement The truth is that at that time he was considered to be a character who took advantage of the legitimate concerns of the Soviet Communist law for political gain. <br /> <br /> Oh yes and the United States. Bring all the evil Nazis As well as Werner Braun, with no space program He loves being an American and becoming a great asset of the country. <br /> <br /> And the interesting thing is that the stupid people in Hollywood who are not educated live in Imagination also believes that the government should take action. And give everything we need And this is the same government that they constantly show evil in this movie
