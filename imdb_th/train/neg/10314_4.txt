As a person who likes to chase scenes and is fascinated by this amazing real-life story, I am so optimistic about this film. But there are many obstacles coming into the good story that should be <br /> <br /> THE BAD - I'm a big fan of Robert Duvall and the many characters he plays. But his role here is boring as an insurance detective. <br /> <br /> The conversation is not as interesting as the real garbage from what I read. There are many directors who replaced in this movie and That was terrible. You can tell things wrong with the story. I can't "relate" to Cooper Cooper's image as well. He should be fascinating. But he is not in this movie It is also a sad comment that men who commit crimes are "Folk hero" but I agree that I have destroyed the roots of men as well. <br /> <br /> Everything is not disappointing. I can't complain about the scenery, from the lush forests of Oregon to the desert in Arizona. <br /> <br /> I want to watch this new movie and do better because it is. Unique story
