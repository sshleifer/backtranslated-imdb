The character's performance is quite stiff as if it were the first time a male actor appeared on the screen. Unfortunately, one of the better actresses is Jean Simmons (playing many roles on TV, such as in Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night). Death quickly and after that, her performance may miss the role. The lead, Mr Ballard, played by Cliff Robertson Cliff, was forced to carry this movie with his body language for the most part. He didn't work poorly. But it is too little to ask an actor to plug in the ocean of the screen, free time while the characters spend their time, not talking and not acting Robertson's most memorable role could be Ben Parker in the latest Spider Man 3 movie (starring Tobey Maguire). <br /> <br /> A predictable story. The husband killed his rich wife for her money. After that, the wife seemed to come back and haunt her husband, causing him to lose consciousness until he jumped out of the window. (Afraid that the demons of the dead wife came to him) on the day he predicted that he would die a little. <br /> <br /> The second driver Mr Ballard was hired to look like Hamill. English is really strange! The only thing that is most outstanding is not interested in conversation. For many minutes passed in quietness, no one spoke and had little acting. It's a shame that the MST3K never received from this movie. It may be much better if not just guessing, having more conversations or shorter scenes. 'nothingness' <br /> <br /> I expect G'Mork's red eyes to appear from the shadow and declare that he works for "nothing" in this movie.
