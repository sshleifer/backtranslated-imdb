There should be a rule that clearly states that movies like Resident Evil should be created in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of making everything possible. RE is a survival horror game and one of the most powerful games. But Paul WS Anderson can create it like other video game movies. Alone in the Dark is the same spirit as Resident Evil. Of course, there is little hope that the director There are enough brains to create horror movies and not action movies, but Alone in the Dark proves that there is no hope for a video game to become a movie. <br /> <br /> The plot, though. The fact that it is clearly not supposed to be a problem with movies, the movie begins with what can be described as only five minutes of scrolling messages that may or may not be important after one minute. The care and ride down to the nearest object. Then there was something about the orphanage, some artifacts, ancient tribes, bureaucracy and some demons, all of which were confusing together, causing the audience to not be able to follow what had happened. Characters move in and out of the plot, such as sweets. Some people have a large accumulation for meaningless death. Essentially, what I understand is that some demons are released and Edward Carnby (Slater) has links to them with surgery given to children in his orphanage that failed with him. He discovered the artifacts associated with the devil and brought it to the ex-anthropologist (Reid). Of course, he could have sex immediately without reason. Then there is no end. Every hell comes out and both end up with a military team led by a commander (Dorf) who seems to have a mutual hatred for Carnby. <br /> <br /> It's all ridiculous And the reason I don't understand it is not just because it's complicated and confusing But there is no room for anyone to really care about But I suggest that if you have to watch this movie, bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to confuse you. <br /> <br /> Action scenes in Movies with PTSD At least scary, at least should be taken, right? Unfortunately, this movie is like the other ruins that had been done with a quick cut to cut the chicken head. When considering that this is a horror game, not an action game, it is especially annoying. <br /> <br /> The first action scene involving a man pursuing Cranby from a taxi is one of the worst things. I've seen And the rest is not all that great. The demons look cool, but the fact that they turn into powder when killed will make everything go away. A scene involving a lot of guns that are interesting to watch instead of involving the muzzle fire as a single light source and a zoom camera and appear faster than the head of the addict It is the induction of shit that causes children to sleep in bed at night. <br /> <br /> The performance is what I like to call the actors and make them do nothing. Slater doesn't do anything except An important voice for the entire film, although he seems to have more talent than he has released, just like Dorff, who receives a role that is not appreciative, despite having really special abilities (what happened to him a lot). Brad was what she was supposed to be a lot of sex appeal when she tried to do it as a disaster. (Like an incredibly bad scientist that she first saw) <br /> <br /> This is the type of movie that makes me worried about future video game movies. If they continue to destroy the spirit like this, it is a matter of time before Samus Aran kills the Middle East with AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti is fighting with different alien troops from Resident Evil. Second chance because I don't think there is anything that will help me forget how scary this movie is. It's gentle, uninteresting and not exciting. This movie is equivalent to diarrhea. It was thrown together, nothing is right, and ultimately you are just glad that it ended. <br /> <br /> Total: 4%
