They made me see this thing in school and it was terrible. The movie is outdated. The episode is confusing because the truth is combined with a novel that makes the story more interesting. The teacher talks about this as a cure. But actually it's a painful, boring experience. I've read that there are very few people who appear in this story as actors, but most of them they do what they do in real life movies. Showing great magic often In addition, often the story becomes outrageously mild and profound. I don't like how to write some lines and hope that they will have more meaning to them. Although it was written for education, comedy, jealousy and hips, it ended up being boring, dry, farther and older. I hope that no one will take the time to watch this movie because you are fine not seeing it.
