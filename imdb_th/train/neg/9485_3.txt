Because others have reached the problem of story summary, I want to talk about some issues about this movie. There may be spoilers here; I don't care enough to filter them out. <br /> <br /> - With the low budget of this film, the design of life is quite good. Actually, it's a good thing to see horror movies straight to videos that are not from scary CGI. Unfortunately, the quality of digital movies is quite rough in places and is most noticeable in the white hall. <br /> - The design of ridiculous light caused a disaster in this film. Time. I understand that the director may try to remember. Try dementia But in order for this to be a consistently effective period which needs to be established As it is, it seems that it is not professional. <br /> <br /> - There are many plot twists. But can predict consistently I do not doubt the idea of ​​the self-esteem of the cloak or the fact that the well-sculpted good-looking development will appear at the end. <br /> <br /> - This may seem quirky. But the characters in this film are credible, failing to use any common sense. First, regulatory commissions will be at one mental health center announced and patients and employees die from Jawad cardiac arrest Why is the chief psychiatrist able to perform post-mortem examination? Why is the turning point not caused by these impressive qualities or the introduction of his strange religious choices? What is the background What interests us in this matter? And also important, who, in their correct minds, must go through the horrible guidance of the place to see everything that is wrong and conclude that it is still a good place to live? This film does not respect enough characters to make them benefit from doubts. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: See The Wicker Man instead.
