My friend's mother had worked at a video store and had to watch movie trailers before they came out. So when she brought the horror movie The Convent back home, I couldn't wait to watch it. Because it should be scary But really hilariously seriously, I can say that in a strange way, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the performance is not good and yes, it's the cheapest movie I've ever seen But it's so funny! "What are you pumping CA-RACK?" I don't know if this movie was even released ... I think it's too bad ... <br /> <br /> Yeah ... Overall, the movie This story is quite bad. (You have to accept that a lot at least) But I promise you, you will get good laughter. <br /> <br /> * This movie. But it's good for laughing ... especially the man who holds 'Dagger of despair' .. DAGGER of DESPAAAAAAIR!
