The movie is definitely not good. It is a ridiculous fantasy that has many extraordinary special effects, many hustling scenes. (For example, the airport) and the time that is not true (Charles Dance) is terrible as an evil person and he is better at (Last Action Hero) (Eddie Murphy) is playing a non-cartoon gags and I heard that This sink has succeeded. Great success ?? !! I won't understand why or how! In one TV interview I heard (Eddie Murphy) himself when he was nominated for an Academy Award 2007, regretted in a cartoon style !! <br /> <br /> One of the comments said (Hey .. . It was the 1980s!) Well, no, my friend. It was foolishness in the cinema that created many RAZZIE movies over the years, whether it was 1980s or 1950s! <br /> <br /> There are 2 reasons why I wrote about this movie. The first is that I will never forget Charlotte Lewis' long legs, especially when she is in bed before the villain attacks her house, wearing just a blue shirt. It should be. But it's very strange! As I watched her in the following movie, and isn't she so beautiful? !! However, the second reason is that I recently found the title of this movie in the list of the 100 worst movies. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: bad movie, Greeeeeat leg
