I can't believe that I'm sitting on the whole story. This movie has the worst performance since Killjoy. <br /> <br /> Here is a short outline: The movie begins with Jojo and the other chick is sitting on the beach. That he didn't go to the gym in his life someday Anyhow, everyone knows him and every chicks in the movie want him. Uh oh! The competition comes here! "Hot chick", stereotypical and her best friend who drives an ugly pink car Soon we will find that Jojo's mother has a lifetime job in Australia, which means that Jojo will have to move and leave her best friend behind. (Oh no, I think I will cry) There was a big storm and filled the pool with nasty water. Somehow without a clear reason, the little chick fell into the pool and confronted you. You guessed it, MERMAID! This is where "stories" are really shut down. Essentially, they want the mermaid to fall in love with "big cubes". <br /> <br /> This is a ten-minute flick with a terrible performance. This film has all possible ancient ideas ... best friend "hunk" that everyone wants a "hot" bitch and her bad friend, an old man who is scary ... you name it in that I get one for a lot of people by watching this thing. Consider my hour and 40 minutes to sacrifice you. Please do not watch this movie. Don't do that, I must suffer.
