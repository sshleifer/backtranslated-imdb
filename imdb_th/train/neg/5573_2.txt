I do not understand why Godzilla fans think this is a great movie, which is one of Godzilla's best movies. This movie is scary and is one of Gojira's movies that I can't stand to watch anymore. (In other words, G vs Meganon) <br /> <br /> The story is too much to be in the Heisei series, trying to turn the old Godzilla franchise into an action movie. Bonamide, which revolves around the idea that appeared in 1974, rather than 1991. It sounds ridiculous, especially with certain topics. For example, WW2 praised Godzillasaurus. Who is dying in a groaning voice and seriously taking the former commander full of capitalism and his death, he sees seriously in the movies that his fans have shown to play as a funny laugh easily. The most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. But I think it is likely to be only the ability that filmmakers lack and this is the case of action movies that have to face problems. It makes it worse, with the fact that special effects are worse than comparing from jet packs to Android to the hokey sound effects that are released from everything. Can be serious <br /> <br /> Like almost the movie Godzilla, there are love stories and no exceptions, although there are some things that can be said about the fact that this movie is pointless. Especially countless There is no reason to present it for a love affair. It happens and has a life that promises 360 degrees for it. In addition to this, another terrifying aspect of this movie is the conversation in both Japanese and English. It is scary, scary and may be an inspiration to Battlefield Earth. Blurred, dimmed, light and ugly The first time I saw the Japanese version, part 2, and the difference was day and night, with original colors and textures, scenes, scores, battles, especially scenes. See it. <br /> <br /> In my opinion I Heisei series is a disappointment except Godzilla 1984 (Japanese version). There is little to admire here and Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah is a case of this failure. It's not as close to deserving fame and fans will get <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
