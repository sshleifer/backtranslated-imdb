Our group watched this movie really disgusting. We are happy to forgive the fact that our favorite characters, Joe, are not there. (Not that the writer / producer can do anything about it.) Bad writing, not digestible scripts. What really annoyed us: 1. When both of them knew they were both dating Natalie, they were not only But left them to deal with the most stupid competition Want Natalie 2. Although it is not possible to choose between two people before meeting each other But suddenly Natalie decides that she loves a man and is now ready to marry him? (And without speculating that he is actually better When her husband said that he wanted to have children, he agreed with him happily.
