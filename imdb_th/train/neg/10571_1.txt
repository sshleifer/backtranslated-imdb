My wife is a fanatic of this program. That was the case that I bought her season from one to three and four seasons were in order. Personally, I think acting is a big one. The actors are not as good. Alyssa Milano should be stuck with other junk movies she created, such as Poison Ivy, hug from the Vampire to name a few, female members. Other people I've seen better special effects in the old publications of the Republic Pictures that I saw as a child. I can understand why the male lead is still performing for a short time, even though I don't know if it's their choice or not. Please do not renew enough seasons. Bob
