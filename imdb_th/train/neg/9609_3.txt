I started to watch this movie, expecting the horror Hammer movie that was almost impossible. I was not far away. There are a fair amount of blood that is glimpseed and they have many nudity. But in the second half of the film, it presents a ridiculous twist. Sacred cows. Actually, they used a little thought on the subject and did not fall into the predictions as expected from the beginning. And I dare to say that some "naked" nudity is not empty because it corresponds to the story and the environment. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me wrong. Bad movie But it is a bad movie. It is a smarter shade than a really horrible rag, such as Mesa of Lost Women and Robot Monster.
