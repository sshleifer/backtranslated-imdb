Director Bryan Goeres has no clue about the movie. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin appears again in the movie and goes straight. One of the wonders if he had a wonderful, stupid representative with a strange hairstyle that he played in most of his movies. The only good movie he appeared in was "The Squid and the Whale", in which he spoke only two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, his lead woman There is no chemistry between Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin. <br /> <br /> Movies that must be watched at their own risk.
