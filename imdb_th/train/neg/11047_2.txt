There are two reasons why I didn't give 1 to this movie. One reason is that some actors (such as Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) are trying to play at a good performance level. However, in many scenes, they are blocked by bad scripts. <br /> <br /> Other reasons are cool ideas and look at Cyborg, which is different from most other roles I've seen. br /> Everything in this movie is as bad as it should be. Boring scenes, useless conversations and boring, poor script work. And seems to be the first movie for many actors It may be an interesting story. But they were totally failed
