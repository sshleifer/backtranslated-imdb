The female lead is a horrible actor who makes the movie look normal. She smiled too much when she went to the front of the camera to talk about her daughter. This should cause the police to suspect that she I couldn't be comforted in the same situation. She looks quiet for a mother who can't find her daughter. As if she didn't want to even be in the movie Jennifer Aniston will play this role better. And it will make a lot more money for other important and controversial matters But I hope she will receive a acting lesson.
