I feel that the film is dry ... very disappointing. No plot ... Waiting for something to happen and nothing dry like a bone .. lose money .. One of Robins Williams' worst movies. If you don't believe me, wait a couple of months, it will come out on the DVD because it seems to be a picture. For movies that do not work well in cinemas that come out for rent because last year is gone ... This is something you don't want. See or say why I spent money on that! Plus being a new movie that only has 8 people to watch it ... this is on Friday night at 9:50. Show me feeling that it needs more excitement or something that will keep us awake When the characters they speak in the movie, the sound is very low, you can't hear what they're saying ..
