This is a tedious collection of societies that coexist in straight lines without the visible plot or proper display methods that I have seen for a long time. Canibalising scenes from Star Wars, Reign of Fire, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. It's going to war with all the intelligence. Is this movie good It's not a movie at all. <br /> <br /> Although it's not so low that it's really funny and gets cult status as a comedian. The trick is to put the copy scene in the context of their original movie. Gandalf is a Korean joke. The snake looks funny. Hilarious. If you compare it with kittens and evil minions can give fun. Switch between Sauron and Jaja-bing or his name. : Any enjoyment from this film depends on the obsession and imagination of the audience, not the director / writer. Shame on Shim!
