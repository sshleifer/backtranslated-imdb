If I would rate this movie with 0 I would have! I see ppl that IMDb said that this is the funniest movie of the year, etc. I'm sorry. Are you ppl pitching LSD or ........? There is absolutely nothing funny about this movie. I have no G! Actually, I want my life. 27 minutes I spent watching this shit. <br /> <br /> I read people sitting on the plane watching this movie. Stop watching after 30 minutes. I truly understand how I can watch. Snakes on the plane more than 2 times instead of watching this movie once! <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie, do something else that is useful to your life. Cook, walk, walk ... What better way to spend time in front of the TV watching the hot rod.
