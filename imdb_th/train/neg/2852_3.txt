This is a thoroughly unwanted movie if done smoothly. I tried it because it was the actor Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two great actors and because of the storyline - the leader of the group was about to be released from the mental institution. This film was billed as a comedian of the genre. What we have is infinite continuous photography - you should forgive the play of people who are dimly lit and elegant if they have realistic interiors, interiors and mutual firing - the head is avoided. The anatomy seems) while vague and vague dialogue, which some people should clearly see with humor in the form of a modern post. Goldblum's dialogue for the entire film can be put on a 3x5 card, and he shows one face that is a mischievous smile. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do the best they can. Bert Reynolds, credit list, Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but I miss them. The whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and nasty; The heir I wondered in the style of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Fargo' and 'Natural Born Killers'. If you like these things, you might like this.
