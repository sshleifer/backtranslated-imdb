This movie is very frustrating. Not only does Wenders show the limited spectrum of blues, it is his personal and personal interest in the music he brings to create movies that make watching and listening Absolutely boring The only feature of this movie is the interview with a Swedish couple who is friends with J.B. Lenoir and shows their personal video clips and tells the story. The introduction of the movies of Wender's story began to be interesting - even causing the culture of the world. (Or in fact, American culture) traveling in space But he has a limited style of theme The movie is just a sleep aid, gaping. I expect more from him.
