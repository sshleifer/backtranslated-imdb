2002 "I Love the 80", which has been overwhelmingly popular, is a mess, madness, discontent and disgusting, disgusting pop culture that shows that it is the first program on the most horrible television program Once there is only real music channels left on TV! I've lived on VH1 until spring or winter. I forgot which one in 2002 when this kind of garbage began to appear without any reason. From uncertain curiosity (I guess that's what you call it). I have decided that I will continue to move forward and give it a look - however, on the first night it arrived, though the ad seemed to be completely shit. At least I can honestly say that I'm not a bit disappointed because my expectations are at the bottom level for starting. The importance of the performances I found within the first 5 minutes was less than each year of the 1980s and what was and was not of cultural importance or popular. (Which is what I expect to see) but instead of an impromptu platform For comedians who do not have a name that is really scary to show what they think is their comedic skills. * Keep your eyes * ... look ridiculous if you ask me! Now it's easy to see why no one has heard of these stupid things before they appear on this program because they are very mad and pathetic in their efforts called "humor". I swear that Knot with one rancid mop, they shoot out one after another! Altogether, I have no problem saying "I love the 80s" as / is the trash of the lowest divisor and one of the main reasons why I almost never watch VH1 anymore.
