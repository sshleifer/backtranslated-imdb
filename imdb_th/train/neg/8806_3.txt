How "is there" this love so much? People say that it is proof that good and honest people can be successful even without lack of intelligence. They are wrong. This film is a proof that luck is everything: hope your friends will invest all the money in the app. Apple is not Atari; Hope that your shrimp boat will leave the sea only once when the storm occurs. Hope you won't die because you're shocked when you're lucky to shoot at the bottom and not behind. Hope you won't get AIDS from your wife. This film is also a political issue - anyone who opposes social meetings loses legs, makes drugs, defeats his girlfriend or dies. In addition, the product placement in this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is unscrupulous. Emotional manipulative movies are very empty.
