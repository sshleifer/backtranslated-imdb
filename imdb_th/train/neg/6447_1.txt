I bought this movie for $ 5 in a bargain trash at a video store in my area for just one reason. Chase Masterson but I should flay all five movies in the bathroom. The film has about twenty somethings that pitched in high school and gathered on the anniversary of the death of an idiot friend who was drunk and walked into the forest and died. There is a problem: monsters, reptiles are hunting them one by one. Acting as a nasty thing, these worthless people clearly don't like the program, such as 90210 and Dawsons Creek, who are always directed to the age of twelve, and the script may be made by the age of thirteen years. The whole set looks like someone's backyard in Malibu. People who watch this movie are friends of directors and / or actors. Avoid this junk at all costs.
