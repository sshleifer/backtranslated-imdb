I have heard (and read) many good things about Weed that I look forward to getting another great cable series (such as Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men), but it collapses slowly each time I Watched from Season One (not past the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> The writing was not original, was planned and showed the image of an embarrassing black person. The conversation feels like the writer who tries too hard to be smart and cool. It was a rare time when I actually laughed. <br /> <br /> The character never developed enough for me to pay attention to them. They were selfish and not attracted. I hate adding brother-in-law. (Which should be dragged to To Catch A Predator) and removing Hodes' daughter Quinn from the show by sending her to a boarding school in Mexico is strange and boring I have to conclude that the writer is testing audience loyalty. <br /> <br /> Episode after the episode when I liked the character less and couldn't pass many technical flaws in the story. <br /> <br / > Add to that, I heard that the second season is not so good, so I have no motivation to watch this drama. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of writer selection I wonder if this show will be a challenge for you to like, unless you are stoned and all bets are closed.
