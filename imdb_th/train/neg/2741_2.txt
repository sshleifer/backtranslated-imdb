Spoiler !! I love Branagh. Love Helena Bonham-Carter. Love them together in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" - But here - <br /> <br /> I understand the desire of the actor to be prolonged to avoid a romantic attitude. They do, but actually - roleplaying script. Clothes Bonham-Carter Chic and the occasional "madcap" sequence that may be influenced by the movies of Beatles or Rowan and Martin Laugh- in <br /> <br /> I never understood - other critics said Branagh's drama is a dreamer. I never felt like that He is a loser and not very bright and certainly not cute. Businesses with bank robbers disguised as just a pain to watch Of course, that's not funny. <br /> <br /> The real effort of Bonham-Carter While the realistic speech is hard to understand than the first 15 minutes of the Lancashire accent in "Full Monty" <br /> <br /> The poem ending with him high on the hill with her buried under The cruelty of his plane was too dictated. There is an angel choir or just a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Go back to classics or anything with a spine and bend with it. Donate to PBS. <br /> <br />
