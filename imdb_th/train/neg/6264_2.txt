Nightmare Weekend is a positive proof that some people are desperate to 'in the movie'. They are ready to do almost everything. <br /> <br /> I'm not talking about countless women who seem to have Very happy to appear completely starkers in this awesome trash. (After all, the naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of) No ... I'm talking about those who are willing to perform with a poorly made hand puppet named George. Now it's embarrassing !!! <br /> <br /> The electronic biological science created by the great scientist Edward Brake (Wellington Meffert), George (who looks like a clown, is crazy with green fur for I) is a genius that is artificially Interface for advanced computer systems that work on revolutionary devices (Silver sphere about the size of a golf ball) that, when ingested, can reverse the character's anomaly. <br /> <br /> Edwards's personality change experiment was successful in the animal lab, but scientists Be cautious, not willing to perform tests in humans, fearing that there may be side effects. Julie, his evil assistant (Debbie Lester) doesn't have that feeling and still uses three beautiful women as guinea pigs. All of them became ugly assassins. <br /> <br /> With special effects that bargain in the basement, a talented actor and an almost impossible plot. Will follow (I take notes when I watch movies. And even then I still do not believe that my conclusion is correct.), Nightmare Weekend is the most complete and complete disaster that doesn't even have many soft sex scenes and blood stabs. <br /> <br / > This movie There is also one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen in horror movies: Tony (Bruce Morton), a walkman that wears a pop-up from the 80s music in a way that makes me look like Justin. Timberlake in comparison
