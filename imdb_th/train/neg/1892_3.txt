I read the comments of Chris_m_grant From the United States <br /> <br /> He wrote: "The best documentary of the year 1924, the geography of the early 20th century of Iraq today is very powerful." <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Christ. And those who are interested in the Bakhtiari Nomads of Iran, the mountains of Zagros and the landscape and have watched the Grass movie, which is a battle for the life of the nation These traditions that you see in movies have been for centuries and will continue as long as life continues. I am from this Iranian territory. I am a Bakhtiari. <br /> <br /> Chris, I'm sorry to bother you, but the Bakhtiari region of Zardkuh is in Iran, not in Irak as you mentioned in your opinion. Iran and Iraq are two distinct and distinct countries. Being an Iranian to an Iranian is like taking an American to be a Mexican. Thank you. <br /> <br /> Ziba
