Judging by ads and other reviews on this website, I'm ready for an interesting horror movie, focusing on junk. What I got was a complete crap focused on garbage. I wonder if there will be another "Cookers" movie that these people check or not. There are only 3 main characters and there are no characters in me that can write well or act well. Essentially, all the movies that I just spent shaking my head and amazed by the stupidity of these addicts Don't rent this movie. Rent "Cabin Fever" or other famous horror movies. Hell for rent. "Mary Poppins"! Cartoon penguins are more lively and reliable than anything you will find in the "cooker".
