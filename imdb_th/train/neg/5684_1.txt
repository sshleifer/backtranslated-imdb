Garbage directed badly Is a man who destroys sadistic sadism. ... If you are a person who likes ... see depression Even if you are such a person, it doesn't make this movie so good. Actors are terrible. The story is full of holes. The director should give up and really find a job because he has no talent for this. I can see why people don't like uwe boll .. We have a few movies recently and this is their best, which is really sad! The lack of complete humanity seems to be suitable for some people. But here it is just satire Horror movies may be filled with loneliness. They can be small artworks. They can watch well when nothing ... SEED is really poor.
