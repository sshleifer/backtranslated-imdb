The film has beautiful brown hair named Danielle Petty. She has amazing green eyes and is in the first few scenes and the final scene. She is the only thing about this movie that is not offensive. She may not have a future as an actor because this type of film is a disgusting disaster that kills a career. <br /> <br /> The movie itself has nothing to suggest It is not a good horror movie or a good fake news report or can be done well in the distance. No production skills It's like a bad student movie. The scary element of the story doesn't make you sick. It's the fact that it's terrible to make you sick. I will give this star zero if I can.
