At first I wanted to point out that I knew about the acting just because my sister always looked. I find it the most annoying program on TV. There is no joke about 'jokes' and canned laughter is unbearable. Performances will work much better if taken in front of a live audience. This will make laughter show that However, I am credited with the acting ability of a young actor. It makes me drunk But think that they will look back to see the program in the future The show is well connected with the sound and the annoying style of the CBBC presenter That is all.
