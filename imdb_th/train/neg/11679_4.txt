First of all, this movie is not "Thriller" is not a "tight grip". It may follow the script. But the slow pace of the direction makes it difficult to enter. <br /> <br /> The plot is very interesting and creative. Unfortunately we have just received * intelligent * methods after the picture ends. That gives us a sequence of lengths that are longer than two hours by playing music over them, separated by some action scenes that do not attract viewers and scenes "Sly Fox" that injects a little clever intelligence. <br /> <br /> I hope this will be a quick thriller as promised. It will be an outstanding movie. But Spike Lee made it to the end
