I can summarize this film using no more than 20 words. The too hard predictable way of the story is the possibility of a joke. But fell on his face instead of watching 19 words, but I didn't flick this flick with only one star But decided to hit it up to two stars because Julie Bowen was smoking hot and feeding enough eyes to prevent ripping. The DVD came out of the device and blown with the M80. My advice is to use the $ 4.00 rental that you have to pay to watch this movie and just send it to me in advance. This or you may want to send I charge $ 50.00 that you will be charged from taking twelve insurance to use this waste to train the target.
