You receive a gift It was finely wrapped. The boxes in it are the best wooden crafts and show the skills in small details, then wrapped in beautiful paper, crafts and hand-drawn by the most talented artists. All things were wrapped with ribbons made of fine silk lace. It's an image that can be seen. <br /> <br /> Then you cut the ribbon, tear the paper, open the box and find ... Nothing. That is a toy. You may enjoy the packaging or forget it. <br /> <br /> This film doesn't have a purpose and purpose: the war is not good. Not genuine! Morality is so clear that it's almost embarrassing to point out. And even a weak understanding was cut down by stories that contain elements of war - especially war toys - that were not good until they wanted an exciting climax scene and a war simulation movie using innocent toys It's like someone preaching the stern that leads the sermon only to end by saying "Just kidding." <br /> <br /> But even if it's a blank box, the movie fails to check.

In order for this film to work or have a reason, it must exist in its own universe, which is a remote Oz from Kansas Every time the jokes bring us back to reality, the toys of this movie will become a hoax. <br /> <br /> It is said that this is the pet project of director Barry Levinson, which he tried. Very much to do For ten years. Obviously sad that why he had trouble getting support. As with most pet-related projects (RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER & BATTLEFIELD: EARTH is a good example), it seems to be a blind spot for filmmakers. Perhaps Levinson directed and redirected the toy often in his head that he had no new vision when he finally came to the sound stage. He made it perfect until he died. <br /> <br /> Many of the toys in this movie are clumsy, mechanical and have a gust of wind. So this movie
