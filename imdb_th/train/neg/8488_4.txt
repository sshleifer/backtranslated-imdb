Covering reality as the potential of computers, communicating with the past, continuing struggles to express your identity in a society that is limited and the fascinating Ada Byron Lovelace, shown by Tilda Swinton. This fascinating movie is probably very good. But it's scary if you consider the potential! Performances, apart from Tilda Swinton and the Karen Black, viewers can tolerate cruelty. Creating the plot is strange to say the least - modern programmers are boring characters. But in this film, it takes half the time to create her character. When Ada finally appears, it is to describe the events of her life. Not presenting interesting stories (Swinton almost pulls this thing away) You never really know her as a real person, just an icon from the student history document. <br /> <br /> Effects Digital, such as digital dogs and birds, are lousy and distracting because they are 1997 and not 1985 and eventually the script is not good. Bad conversations often pretend, especially the struggle between the programmer and her boyfriend, which makes me struggling - a cold and distant character and a zero effort to surprise. Programmers succeed in dealing with people in the past! Amazing! But doesn't seem surprised at anyone and her boyfriend says "Okay, be careful" (even though we didn't know the clue later or why it might be dangerous and it seems that it is not really dangerous) <br /> <br /> In addition, even about computers and Ada Lovelace and her love for mathematics Obviously, no one involved in the script had any knowledge of mathematics or computers - a reference to these subjects was found to be a complete mumbo jumbo that challenged the suspension of any unbelief. <br /> <br /> One scene trailing The film is quite good, with a single episode by Tilda Swinton that shows her sadness in the fragility of life. But her happiness in that life It seems to be violent, passionate and profound in other movies. <br /> <br /> So I was disappointed in this movie because it was an opportunity to miss out on the little cult movie. If you find an interesting topic, you may want to rent it. But received warning in advance See Orlando again to check out the better sexual roles in history with the great performances of Tilda Swinton. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler / Question: * * <br / > <br /> At the end of the movie, Ada asked about her memories that were not preserved. (In what I think is the best scene in the movie) but then the programmers of today seem to be doing it and transferring memories to her little girl (So ​​the name of the movie) Am I right that the programmer violated Ada's needs without struggling with this? Or is this another confusing issue that I misinterpreted?
