With a delightful surprise from Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality, I decided to shoot Murder By Numbers while having courageous, humble role. Bullock's acting in the "serious" role (see Hope Floats, Speed 2, 28 Days) do not need much Her character at the same time, all around, confused and maladjusted (Sandra's sub-plot of the past came to be a filler that was no less necessary to develop her superficial character). Two teenagers gave good performances, although forensic expertise and captured attitudes can be denied by stupid mistakes that scream that "We do that!" Chris Penn is all the obvious suspects that have been destroyed here, just like Token Chaplin's partner / interesting character. <br /> < br /> *** A spoiler ahead *** Moderately traced to the TV plot of the week that you never bought all in the motive for murder in the first place and as mentioned silly mistakes. (Vomiting up rare food at the murder scene, all too convenient and framed Of the school janitor, two boys traveling together in public places, interesting love, causing disagreements, etc.) caused a view from the interest to be bored and frustrated by the murderer The ending is strictly "by numbers" and may be the most frustrating aspect of the movie. By using the tactic that is now almost showing the scene at the beginning of the movie and filling the audience in the way we arrived at that time. This story To get a conclusion The concept is quite bright. But perform poorly and weakly in almost all aspects * from ****
