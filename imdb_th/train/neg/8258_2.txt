I was lucky to read the book before watching the movie. It is the epic of a teenager, the dream of a lost summer, an indie movie with great potential or a big drama. It came into the hands of a hacker who recorded a look at Boogie Nights and Rushmore without having to learn anything. The script loses the texture of this book due to forced emotional notes and low eyebrows. I feel sorry for the actors because the characters in the book are complete and have texture. But cut down to be an embarrassing character in the movie. Mason Gamble is great when given the same opportunity as Dylan Baker, but the skeleton that remains in the story plays badly after school. Worse, <br /> <br /> Although it's almost worth watching the Southern California beaches at Gary Sinise park his trailer, which is intended to pass to the bay in Delaware. <br /> < br /> It's a movie Good Guide But it's a shame for director Mills Goodloe for the first time. <br /> <br /> K.
