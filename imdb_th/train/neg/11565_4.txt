Until after the second week of "The Lone of Beauty" I was a little disappointed. <br /> <br /> Some performances are good as long as we except that it's only drama. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure How can people feel that this FICTIONAL drama is the "truth" of "Thatcher" coverage of the year - it's okay to be a drama. But I feel that the award-winning books are still better The truth that we are still waiting for! With promises from a government that is full of fear
