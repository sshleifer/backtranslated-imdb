I didn't expect much from this TV movie. You have to set the bar lower than you want for the dwarves in the TBS movie starring Antonio Sabato Jr. However, it still disappointed, disappointed, even if it was a bad movie. <br /> <br / > Every scene is by memorizing, as if someone cut scenes from ten movies and TV shows related to the big business conspiracy into the script. Lean back and say "My work is finished" is boring and predictable, and even worse, the actor is forced to look as if they are very serious about it. (Even when developing a laughable story) <br /> <br /> See "File X" if you're in a paranoid mood. They manage better. In addition, let everyone know that doing "Fatal error" is just that.
