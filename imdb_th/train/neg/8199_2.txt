I am very glad that I did not use the money to watch the movie :-) It is nothing more than a collection of elements of other classic games such as The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss and others. What is the purpose of creating this movie - it's nothing new to present in the story, which is still unreasonable. Moreover, nothing to see - FX'es seems to be taken from a second-hand store. You will often see them all in other movies. But it is definitely a good lullaby
