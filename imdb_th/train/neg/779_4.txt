Seriously, I mean seriously. When I first started watching the program, I thought it was good. But the plan is worse The story is too boring or predictable. George wasn't always funny, sometimes he was stupid. His jokes too. His mother is the character that shows the most. How can a mother treat her son like a daughter-in-law? But this is your own son I gave this show for 4/10 because the first show was a little funny. Actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha did very well. I didn't know how long these performances would play. Really bored with me and nothing to see, I suggest you look.
