I'm all for "bad" horror movies, but this is just a sh! T! How anyone can call this movie cool or better than me If you like urgent fixes to cover special effects, bad performances and bad scripts, try it! There is nothing suspicious and the blood factor is ridiculous because it is a fake. I will pick up Hostel or Wolf Creek every day My partner gave up after about 20 minutes. She knew that the foul when she saw While I was watching the whole movie baffling to see if it was better or not No luck like this! I haven't Zen another movie for him, Torched and I wonder if I will bother now or not.
