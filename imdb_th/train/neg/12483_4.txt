This movie is like Conan Baba. But have more sex, rape and murder There is a plot somewhere under all this intoxication. But the creators cannot perform well, which is a shame because it may be a good thing. Richard Hill has played a strong lead role as well as the villain - the sad person who doesn't appear in other records. The fight scene is not too bad - I like the way Deathstalker let the victim's blood drink the sword - And there are many nudity and sex that make the mood at the general level of Mascus. <br /> <br /> All is not good - but not necessarily bad ...
