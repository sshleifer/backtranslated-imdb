This movie is a very funny movie. The violence is not good. The show is ... Okay, Dani sing or scream, no matter what you do. Chicks randomly put in nothing, almost not just catching the frustrated Germans sexually. Personally, I think this movie really sucks. The story and characters can do very well. If speaking, the director, the actor and the little things can do better. But this movie is terrible. The only reason people like this shit is because it has Danni in it. This movie may be the worst B movie ever. And believe me it's hard to succeed, especially when you're competing with Def by Temptation and a terrible excuse for a horror movie that "seriously". I'm not a CoF fan, so I see this as another junk movie. The story ... is really bad. If this causes Dani to be a comedian, then he can do very well. Moreover, I rate it low because it is popular. See when you are in the happy mode of happiness, happiness, happiness so you can laugh with everything or if you take many drugs.
