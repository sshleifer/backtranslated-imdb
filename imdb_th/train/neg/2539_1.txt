Must be one of the worst of the 35mm movie films that are publicly revealed, the sequel to the original movie, the least deceptive documentary, "The Legend of Boggy Creek", bad script, worse performances, etc. etc. That Dawn Wells had to hope that Gilligan would come to save her and bring her back to the island to escape from this trap piece.
