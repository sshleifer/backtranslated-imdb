Good grief, I can't explain how bad this movie is. Don't understand me wrong, I don't expect much from the beginning. Let's face each other. The flick of the PG-13 is predetermined to miss ummm ... so slack, so no one is surprised if there is no blood. But it is the level of incompetence and the ancient idea that appears in every aspect of this movie is what makes me feel bad. <br /> <br /> We have a completely useless protagonist until you meet. That he is a bad person And this is a reversal for the book ... she never changed - so it violates the rules of basic screen writing - character development If you think that at the end of this movie, the poor little girl is going to turn back and finally kick the butt and think again. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, we may give a killer interested (And the least scary) for this type I am not kidding when I say Dora the Explorer has a terrible villain than this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, because of all the potential of tension or gratitude will be removed by those who do not qualify. (And seemed to be thirteen years old)) who directed what might be left to fill the screen for 2 hours? <br /> <br /> Wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Lots of wardrobes: large wardrobe, small wardrobe, wardrobe, mirrored wardrobe, go to Narnia, many closets you Do not want to dress yourself for another year In fact, this movie should be called "CLOSET" and has a picture of a big scary coordinator in the DVD box. Behind it, there may be a photograph of a sleeping audience and claimed by Roger and Ebert - something at the level: "What f * @! We don't just waste our time watching! "
