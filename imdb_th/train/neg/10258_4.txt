The world is destined to not have to thank Father Pergado and the nuns anymore. Christopher Lee (Which since then said that he was tricked into appearing in this story by his producer who told him that there are many involved actors), namely Father Padero Actors are not bad, even though most of them now stop showing. This movie has a frightening sound effect. (Most of it is made from pressing buttons on the old computer. Looks like) and it sometimes contemplates funny - showing the scenes of the sky like things that feel like hours. Despite this being a humorous story in a world-of-a-kind anymore, and production is sufficient. One interesting scene is Albert Band and Jackie's wife; Meda Band; Writer Frank Ray Perilli and the assistant of Charles Band Bennah Burton. Despite the nature that is full of it, I want to see how it works and it's quite like.
