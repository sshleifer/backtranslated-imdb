Although there are some amusing moments But I think this movie is quite lame The longer you run, the worse it will be. When the action enters Monument Valley, I find myself watching a spectacular scene, rather than interacting with stupid and unbelievable characters. <br /> <br /> The daughter's character is continuous. specially First of all, she was in agreement and then discovered the truth and she bailed. Then she came back again, then came back again. Then she came back again. There is no clear motivation for her decision. There are interesting characters, interesting scenes and missed possibilities. I must say that the image is less than the sum of many parts. Clearly, people who like Repo Man tend to like this. Searchers 2.0 do not match The Searchers.
