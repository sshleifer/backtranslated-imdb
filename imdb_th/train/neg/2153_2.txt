Three-dimensional movies in "The Man Who Was Not There" shortened from DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This comedy without features has 3D punch effects that make 3D effects in "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday the 13th Part 3" look better by comparison. Not to mention the film is very serious. This was one of the many 1983 movies that presented pop-off-screen effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor stuck in this mess. But at least not killing their careers And Cocoon, what they are in those projects instead of coming here in "People who are not there" If you do that, you will have to regret. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
