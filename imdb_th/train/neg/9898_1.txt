This version of "Moby Dick" insulted the audience, claiming that it was based on Melville's novel - even going so far as to show the first fake phrase rather than the famous "Call me Ishmael" famous. In addition to the brutal performances, even from John Barrymore, this is probably the greatest example of Hollywood. (Especially at the beginning of Hollywood) will review and change the famous novel only The beautiful and new poetic language of the novel is completely eradicated and Ahab has changed from blasphemy to insult and obsess to a misguided hero who wants to kill Moby Dick after his fiance (!) Turns his back on his legs. In this, will add a standard evil brother who wants a fianc√© for himself and a different ending!
