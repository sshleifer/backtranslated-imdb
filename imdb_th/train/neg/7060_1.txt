This movie is terrible. The characters are completely unbelievable and inconsistent. The story is terrible and some of the scenes in the classroom are worthy and uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> In fact, the quality of the script and characters will suggest that this film is written only by high school students. Lack of the most credibility of the school environment will suggest that, in fact, the author may never go to high school. Actions in most cases are also weak, although there are many issues that are worse in the script and the bad plays. I'm not sure which actor can make this movie. <br /> <br /> Have to say. That sound The track is ok and the movie is good in different places (although the editing is not good)
