This set is one of the worst items I've ever seen. Great performance, awesome effects, terrible writing, you make me obsessed. The story is far from the legend of Robin Hood. It's amazing. It seems that they want to use the Robin Hood name to attract viewers. It may be called the new adventure of Mr. Bland Acting. <br /> <br /> There was someone criticizing me earlier that if you have imagination That's a terrible way for TV series. Such visual media should spark your imagination. You should not force your imagination into something that makes it good. That would be like the Simpsons episode where they tried to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda movie, and he started talking about who killed anyone or whatever "If one movie is boring, I just create my own story." <br /> <br /> In summary: truly lose humanity.
