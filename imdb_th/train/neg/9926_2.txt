I just watched the Blazing Saddles, the 30th anniversary edition of my all-time favorite !! !! TV Pilot for Black Bart stunk. The story doesn't really exist and the performance isn't good. Obviously it was an attempt to profit from the success of Blazing Saddles and had a successful TV program in large-scale movie filming. But this thing never works Considering that many years ago, television would not play fart sounds when they broadcast the movie, it is impossible that they think they can put the program on TV with the word "N". On the other hand, I enjoy. That has seen many familiar faces !!! There are quite a few actors / actors that I can remember from other programs over the years. I have to write down all the names and do a few searches that are fun. I argue with my mother if Steve Landesberg comes from Barney Miller or Mash. I win! :)
