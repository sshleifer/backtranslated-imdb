The only reason I commented was because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox is bald Although we may know it at the same time this week, Dr. Cox was bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they were filmed. The last episode, when we were not satisfied that Robert, the nurse, loved Jesus' death. Cox shaved his head There must be a show for them to issue commands for some strange reasons and forget they constantly slip up. For shame, scrub They used to do this wrong before. I remember when Elliott tried dating Scott Foley and her hair was wet for 2 seconds before the water hit her. I try not to observe these things. But my favorites need to make it better
