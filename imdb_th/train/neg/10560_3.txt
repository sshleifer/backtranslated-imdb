It was an unremitting effort at a time when the atmosphere between sex and violence. Jess Franco, his best, made this type of movie very well. Unfortunately, Joe D'Amato, a non-profit filmmaker D'Amato's most well-known films are famous for their high emotional intelligence. This is his early film that has no disgusting scenes that he has named. "Anthropophagous" and "Beyond the Darkness" In the end, it is an unrelated movie that is not related to the audience in any way. As I said, other people enjoy this movie. But I just found that it was a perfect example of an incredibly lazy writing. <br /> <br /> There are a few advantages for this movie. Ewa Aulin (from "Candy") is there.

It seems that he is bored with the role and doesn't have the fanaticism that he does in his best. The music score is very good and there are some short moments of unintended funny blood. But still it is a movie that is arrogant and pointless to make it incredibly boring (3/10).
