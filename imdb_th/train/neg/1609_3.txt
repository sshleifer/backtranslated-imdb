The first part of Che in Cuba is part of his life. There were too many indistinguishable fights and servants who were injured until indistinguishable. (Remembering that Che was a doctor) It ended when Castro won the revolution. Che never reached Havana. The second part, Che in Bolivia, was a guess. It has too many indistinguishable fights and Che gets hurt and can't be distinguished too. <br /> <br /> When I know this should be "epic" (I never know * what? * But the name before it starts) I think their greatest epic is David Lean Lawrence of Arabia. More than that later, <br /> <br /> In order not to be racist But apart from what I have said is the fact that there are too many characters that cannot be separated - unknown Hispanic actors Similarly, especially considering that they wear "Che" beards and wear Che's fatigue. This results in the viewer unable to identify with anyone who is not Che, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has Very little role) While del Toro is great, think of "Lawrence" and Peter O'Toole as the only visible character: No Alec Guinness, Omar Sharif, No Anthony Quinn, etc. You will get <br /> <br /> Because other characters can be used interchangeably Has resulted in the loss of reference. When Che's top assistant is killed, you will not feel guilty because you don't know who you are, even when Che is killed (I don't think it's a spoiler). Killed <br /> <br /> He has one dimension that is related to humans. In addition to morality and vice versa from Jesus, the only thing we learned about Che was that he married five children. (He told another character that he was nearing the end) What is his motivation? <br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps Soderbergh is heading to Lean as well as Soderbergh's Che, Lean. Never let us know anything about Lawrence, the mysterious person of Arabia. But at least Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and a colleague (Guinness, Quinn). He had courage like that that was not safe - such as having human qualities. Che is like a warm machine like a terminator. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the year, another epic war was Mongol. Che made it look like it was a wonderful life.
