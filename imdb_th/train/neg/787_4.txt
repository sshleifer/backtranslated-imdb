As a director who inspires himself, this film is exciting to watch along with criticism in mind. Shooting with a low-end digital camera may have a 35 mm adapter for anon. Editing is good. Sound effects are not at the top. I will give 7 for indie movies. But the story is not interesting It has more than drama, character development, rather than a horror flick. <br /> <br /> Not for those who want to be shocked, scared, shocked or sit down with popcorn to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie would be good if we were still in the 50s. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a family with dry grassland and that is like that.
