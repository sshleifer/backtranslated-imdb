I have to admit, when I go to watch this movie, I don't expect high expectations. But even with low expectations, I was totally disappointed and totally ... <br /> <br /> In general, Luke Wilson is an actor who is likely to hang out with his girlfriend. crazy about There is a mention of a woman secretly following him. Which I didn't think much because it might be underdeveloped as much as other movies. <br /> <br /> So while on the subway Rainn Wilson (which I really liked before this movie) lulled Let him speak To the "hot" woman Uma Manman, this is strange to say at least as much as everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman is not in the "hot" category. <br /> <br / > Rainn Wilson's performance is still far from "hot". Normally I show everything. But even then he was unable to recover this matter. His characters are scary, scary and annoying. You can't tell if the writer is trying to make him gay, funny or desperate. It's almost painful. <br /> <br /> However, some people steal her purse while she leaves the subway and Luke Wilson is a charming savior who works after the robbers. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is a superhero or "G-Girl" as they like to call her in the movie. It also makes me confused about what "G" stands for, but we will let the debating message boards <br /> <br /> sex scenes that I think should be funny. But I found myself Ask who has sex like that? They almost threw the bed through the wall because of Umar's passion. It hurts my head, but not in "I think it's hard to understand this." <br /> <br /> When Uma cursed Anna Farris, calling her "a prostitute" I didn't have any arguments. In addition to the fact that she was unable to select a suitable movie, she could not act and had to rely on the fact that she was a blonde and a normal person. <br /> <br /> Overall, I Will walk out of the cinema if I Did not pay $ 8.75 to see it. The character is normal and there is no chemical certainty, especially Ummurman Some people should tell you that just because you move your head a lot does not mean that you are acting. <br /> <br /> In addition, scripts and stories may be very usable or competitive and Light weight liquid I began to feel embarrassed for actors and dying professions. Overall, if you focus on your money and self-respect, don't waste time on pathetic efforts in movies.
