As a big fan of Cary Grant, I expect to watch this movie and laugh with laughter while AMC charges a joke. I've never been disappointed with movies before! The normal charm and humor of Carey is AWOL from all of these movies. He encountered stress, stress, and not himself. Mississip's character ranked one of the worst maps I've ever seen - his accent is exaggerated. (And incorrectly, according to Mississippi, he claimed to be part of) and whenever he sent the line Only the other members of the Mississippi have tried to make themselves stand out in this film as a cute and rustic footballer. But he eventually managed to just divert attention from the already weak plot. Mansfield looks like an obscene doll rather than a sex Hollywood kitten, and while she has never known Hollywood about her acting ability, this film cried that she didn't. Used to have that ability before Ray Walston's characters are tasteful and ultimately planned. For four men who went to the shore, it was a pain I had never seen before. I watched this nightmare until the end, and while I wouldn't destroy it for anyone, I would tell you that it's the most ridiculous you've ever seen. This film tries to spark patriotism and feelings of debt for the fighting people. But this movie completely missed that point because it had weaknesses and weak characters. Sorry, Cary!
