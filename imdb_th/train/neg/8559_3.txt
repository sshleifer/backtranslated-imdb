"It's hard to like to explain how excited it is to create a relationship like drama, like a pornographic scene that is thrown in to measure good results and encourages like contro-like -versy and makes us more. Like money and like things "- Ellen Missing Words <br /> <br />" Kissing, likes, top, likes, mouths and things "is like the best artistic effort ever made. Seeing Ellen's hairy arms and like Chris contemplating, like the height of my years of movie viewing experience But before I like to start to break the record of the program US-20-air-airhead with my "Likes". Let me like a short program like the high light of this image like a celebration: <br /> <br /> 1 Chris made a deed with his penis. And not only that: the way the camera (directed by Ellen and Patrick, gracefully) rewarded the audience with a full screen image of Chris's fat white trash after he did something non-Catholic Truly exciting I can honestly say that I have never seen such grace before. Chris, you should make more of that scene in your next movie because that's what we want to continue with what the talented man Lars von Trier and his "Idiots 95" started *** as w Quick and hairy. White belly fat: What movie viewers can ask for more! I can sit all day and watch Chris exclaim. (Although I honestly ...) such poetry can be moved Such style Not less than all, the sacred aspirations began filming that scene - combined with a lot of Zen philosophy. Even Barbra Streisand could not have a greater spirit than this. <br /> <br /> 2 arms have a feather. Ellen's thick Close-up photography, camera shake, expertly photographed by both of us (I can't emphasize this enough) Ellen and Patrick often cause confusion about proper gender identification. There are many scenes that we will see part of the body. (Legs, arms or feet) But it is often a guessing game: Is the body part of a male or female? By nature, Chris and his fellow artists, Ellen Patrick, and their nicknames are working hard because their bodies are perfect for confusing sex. Sometimes it is difficult to guess who sees the legs of women or men. Patrick is very thin and weak in his movements, no hair, and completely, while Ellen and the other girls look very sullen. <br /> <br /> 3 Brilliant - especially the way In relation to the theme of orderly reversal between sex, so original and incredible Ellen behaves like a man wanting sex all the time while her former Patrick wants to speak like a shaking woman. <br /> <br /> 4. Ellen searches for a left-wing partner. "He must love 'The Simpsons' who are leftist I am glad that the creator of this film decided to break the long tradition of presenting a genius leftist. Ellen is a refreshing and realistic person - changed the number of "likes" that she and her free-minded friends manage to emit in less than 80 minutes. That is a true phenomenon (3,849 is certain). Manage to transfer their real-life ineptness to the big screen with the least effort and I applaud them for that thing <br /> <br /> 5 close-ups of the toes There are many things here for foot fetishists, which I think is a liberal and highly commendable way to reach people who have sex. In the end, a pair of shoes and a little fetish foot was offered in a modern theater, so it was good to see that someone was bothered. <br /> <br /> KOTM or KLOTLMAS offers more than seen. It's not just a simple small movie about people who are superficial that are involved in hollow relationships while immersing in meaningless conversations. No, it's more than that. It's about the light that guides all foolish creatures. The guiding light that dominated the useless life of many pseudo-art literature that had just left the film school and planned to attack our senses by drifting dusk, hoping to play well at such a great festival. Sundance and Cannes The necessary revelation for this reason, real cash for change, which they will hire people like Sean Penn and George Clooney to promote the savings of this world and resolve all political problems in this world. What better way than doing pornography at the beginning? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Ellen make a camera here as clearly stated in the credits, who is the holder of the camera while both are ahead? They may hire people to pass and push the camera in their hands ... <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and watch "TV and movies: 150 bad cases.
