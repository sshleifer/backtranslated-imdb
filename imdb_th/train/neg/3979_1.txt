OK, this is the 2nd worst excuse, 4 movies that I've had unlucky to watch. Like all other Olsen twins, with the possible exceptions of the New York minutes, this film has no story, plot, scandal, offensive acting and bad filming. In case you are not guessing, I also hate Mary Kate and Ashley !!!!!! The only reason I watched this is because I'm really bored and nothing else exists. I wonder if both twins will stop making the same stereotypical movies that they have an incredibly stupid adventure in an exotic and economical place all day, while also asking for help from a young man. Two cute At least they may have 4 1 men or 4 of them fall together. The story in this story is boring and innocent. Even the toddler can see the flaws in it. But they should separate and start making movies individually or maybe a movie with a different story Anyone who likes this movie has no offense - whether it is foolishness, artificially or never seen a good movie. Or maybe they are smart and have bad movie choices In any way, I would not recommend this film for my worst nemesis for a good movie experience .. The only thing that is good is 4 laughter, some rib split, that laughs pathetic, trying to be cool. If you look laughing, it's hilarious. In general, I give 0 or less.
