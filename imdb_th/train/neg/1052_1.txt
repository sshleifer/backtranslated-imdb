***** This review may contain spoilers - but that commitment is not important in this classic and well-known story. ***** <br /> <br /> CINDERELLA's story is organized In my favorite fairy tale rank The world will not have this wonderful story. <br /> <br /> The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own story. Unable to use if the story deviates or tries to throw some interesting ideas along with a magical photograph and a formidable production design with a bad direction and correction. <br /> < br /> Story of this tale Or rather not converting into a swan /> The Cinderella's entrance is not good. There is no drama about waiting or excitement in the discovery. <br /> <br /> The writing work makes me very excited as well. Prince Charming is the most unpleasant memory. Why any woman wants to marry a prince who is imprisoned and obsessed with herself who does not like women That there is one liners rather than expressing differences. <br /> <br /> Even Cinderella is still very interested in or sympathetic Cheap, <br /> <br /> what must be These mentioned and discussed in the infamous shooting was a magnificent performance coatings and production design. It is a pleasure to explore the landscapes, scenes and scenes while the story begins. <br /> <br /> For Cinderella's storytelling, go to two stones: <br /> <br /> 1) Rodgers and Hammerstein Cinderella Musical with Lesley Ann Warren, although there is a clear TV on the stage - 60 of this set is the best model in celluloid - no bar. Maximum entertainment Participation, deviation and writing and memorable music This is a classic. <br /> <br /> 2) Forever - Gems. Drew Barrymore is still maintaining a historical perspective, changing the story. But not enough to destroy the effective development of outstanding scores of this classic tale All characters and supporting roles are written wisely and work well.
