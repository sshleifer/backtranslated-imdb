I gave this movie star only one thing because it was impossible to make it less. <br /> <br /> Scientists have developed a formula for mimicking any living thing in their lab. (Warehouses that have run out in LA) They create a T-Rex, an industrial spy group invaded to steal the formula and the rest of the film is an endless chase. <br /> <br /> Of course. That the T-Rex (rubber puppet) fell out and began to get rid of the cast. It had an amazing ability to sneak into someone's 2 or 3 feet distance without notice and then Bite the head They immediately <br /> <br /> One actor member escaped in a police car. Through the city She has superior mental abilities which she cannot use on the radio. She never tried to drive to a sub-station or donut shop and disappeared hopelessly. <br /> <br /> The T-Rex caused catastrophes throughout the city. But only one police car or army or anyone who appears Such activities must be common in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> We can hope that there will be no further planning.
