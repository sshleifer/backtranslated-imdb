This is one of the movies that you see in a video store that you need because it looks terrible. And of course we can't get the most benefit. <br /> <br /> But then we found the scene where Robert Englund seduced the female protagonist CRIPES. I never watched one scene from the movie many times. (I'm about forty or more) and I've never laughed so hard in my life. Did you see Englund having this for his lumbar performances? I watched this movie a couple of months ago. But I can't stop laughing as I type However, the scene is a montage of images - Englund rips the bra of a young woman, Englund, riding a naked and mysterious woman. This is a true genius. You must see by yourself.
