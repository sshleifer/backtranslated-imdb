I have to admit that I do not remember much about the character or the story. But I'm not sure if it really exists. I feel very frustrated with this movie that I have time to focus on difficult subjects. How do you name the movie "Keys to Tulsa" and be screened in Texas? The flat desert country around Arlington (I think that is the location) never looks like a green hill around Tulsa and the famous Tulsa people have better neighbors to live. Tulsa or otherwise, they will know that there is nothing in this movie at all. At least nobody saw Rumblefish or outsiders? I know that it sounds meticulous. But can't help I watched this thing because I love James Spader and I often find Eric Stotz interesting, but even the two interesting actors can't make this crooked and mean the story of the people involved with themselves Not in Tulsa !! I'm sorry. It wouldn't be more expensive than filming in Oklahoma. What if "Life and death in LA" was shot in Toronto? Will this suck as well?
