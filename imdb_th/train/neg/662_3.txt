And renting a good horror movie It's like the author has never seen a horror movie before and is not aware of everything he wrote as a cliché and being made into nonsense.> During a scary bit, the most boring dialog box and The most boring thing ever written, stupid. "We are going to the premiere" Garbage. I want to withdraw my ears. Honestly "The Hills" has a better conversation. <br /> <br /> No need to create a movie. funding The leading lady is not amazing and I still think "Are you really the guy who is obsessed with you?" <br /> <br /> Every character is stupid, including police. (Covering the place as a team 2! Front and back, no sleepy police, sitting in his car with a window rolling down, just waiting for his neck to be slashed) <br /> <br /> The serial killer who just swan Kill everyone he wants without problems. There is no resistance from victims (or gates). No one has any protection or the smallest idea of ​​fighting back. (Or turn the security lock at the hotel room door) People are like mentally disabled sheep. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan, you will be disappointed as well. All killings are kept outside the screen and - Ahem - done tastefully. (So ​​hilarious for you!) <br /> <br /> There is no killing that is the least interesting. Most of the time that they have already happened by the time we find <br /> <br /> The lost ancient idea is the cat that appears in this movie. "Oh Kitty! you are scared of me! I think you are the killer - AIIEEEE! "<br /> <br /> And finally when the time of the murderer dies - Okay, let's say it's the easiest and clearest option. Snore <br /> < br /> The audience laughed at and talked back to the screen throughout. It's too stupid to believe and not really scary enough. Don't support this kind of lazy movie. <br /> <br /> (Oh, and anyway - no elite kings or queens, no crowns. No crown, no blood tank. <br /> <br /> So save your money and rent "Carrie" or "Friday the 13" or "Halloween" or "Scream" or "Scary Movie" (one of them) to create. Terror for the original twist
