After seeing the remake in 1996, I thought it was the most fun way to see Cruella De Vil being punished by torturing animals for their skin. Both movies are quite funny and in my view better than movies. But actually it doesn't have to have a second First, if Krela comes back, don't treat her and make her mad again. Just make her escape from prison and that's punishment. I think it's not very funny. It should have one real puppy coming back. I expect it to be lucky because he is the most attractive person and also has Roger and Anita coming back. However, they decided to have a completely new cast and couldn't really add one hundred, not even one hundred and two. But only three puppies and a parrot that thought he was a dog (wise) She was baked in a giant cake. That was a hopeless humorous effort, trying to imitate the same effect from the first time. That didn't work too much and was not too funny. I'm really sorry about Cruella.
