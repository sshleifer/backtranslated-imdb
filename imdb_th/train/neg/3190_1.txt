Jimmy Dean can't be a bad person or more irrational. If looking through the eyes of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I rated as 10, I mean the eyes of stewed pork fed with corn that puffed corn around Malta should be enough to send you to vomit. Far into the movie This ugly joke should be placed with the likes of "Booty Call", "Pumpkinhead", "Swarm" and "The Smurfs Go to Bangladesh". This movie shows that sometimes actors, writers, producers and Others are often mortgaged or stoned to become insane. It is a question, "Who is stupid, stupid to raise money for whales?" But then there is a good judgment and "Final justice" has never been so. We will not have a pleasant murmur in the "Mystery Science Theater 3000"!
