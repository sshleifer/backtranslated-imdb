Its official They've just killed the first American Pie 3, of course, with hysteria. But this one and other things are very bad I mean, this story is about two brothers who fight each other for my home. I mean talking about the weak plot. The first three things that are related to growth, change and marriage. <br /> <br /> The new Stifler is the greatest joke. I know it's hard to compare myself with Steven Stifler but without a cigar. I gave this movie 3 stories because there are 2-3 jokes in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best character in this movie is Jim's father. I don't know why he continues to do these things.
