This ambitious film suffered from the delusions of the writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson. Things that have come from a much better material ("Nashville", "The Network" of Lumet) of Altman. Elephants that use this wood take too long to get around. There are two ways of misunderstanding. (The infamous musical interlude in the Bible epidemic) didn't help anything. Both performing at an uneven level Not particularly good: William H. Macy, whose characters and stories can be easily eliminated. Julianne Moore for her insecurity And how many times have we seen Sad Sack shtick of John C. Reilly ("Chicago" and "The Hours" are enough)? Tom Cruise came out well by comparison ?? Those who have a hatred of the women of the Holy Roller are disgusting. When talking about the foul mouth, the script is filled with "F" bombs. They lose their impact in no time. Don't even talk about the terrifying soundtrack, filled with light and annoying cries by Aimee Mann. The meaning that expands her of "one" is the number of Maudlin, starting to drive me At the beginning of the movie I should be careful of the handwriting on the wall and save myself for another three hours by the time I was pushed to hell. One exchange feature that I didn't see in other reviews is the best performance in the group by Melora Walters, who doesn't know the role of Claudia, which is a coke that is damaged in self-destruction. Her credibility is more than any other. This movie takes way too seriously and doesn't know when to end.
