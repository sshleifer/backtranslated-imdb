Richard Dreyfuss is really in this flick But in the relatively small part He is not a "lost" filmmaker - he is a business manager / group accountant. Even the box describes this movie incorrectly. There is no erotic scene with Sondra Locke as advertised, unless using the word "erotic" rather loose. I would not think of watching this movie without Richard Dreyfuss, the main character. However, I might know that Leonard Cohen's 60s "Suzanne" song has an artistic influence. In addition to the brief lecture of the chapter from the end of James Joyce's "Ulysses" and the reference to an interesting image of the end of Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal" Bad "Last year at Marianbad" and "Un Chien Andalou" If you like the idea of ​​a strange art group, there are many excellent movies from "Bye, Bye, Brasil" to "Cecil B. Demented"
