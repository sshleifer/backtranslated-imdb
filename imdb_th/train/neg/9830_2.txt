I am afraid that you will find that most people who rate this movie as 10 people are very high Christians. I don't. If you're looking for Christian movies, I recommend this movie. If you are looking for a good general movie, I am afraid that you will have to go elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I feel annoyed with their characters and irrational behavior. The evidence of this film is to teach morality without teaching that Jesus is the basis of morality. One scene shows the main character who tells the child that it is wrong to steal. Then the character will continue to say that he is Jesus who taught us about it. I find that I am not satisfied: we must believe that "Will you not steal" from Jesus? I think he wrote the Ten Commandments? And the theft was accepted before I rented movies from Netflix. I should be aware of the nature of the movie from comments. Oh well.
