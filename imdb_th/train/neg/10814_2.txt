As a fan of "Jane Eyre", I was thrilled when the film came out. "Finally," I think, "Someone will make this book a movie written by an author incorrect!!! If the casting director intends to play "Jane", which is a normal person, he is definitely successful. However, of course, he may find someone who can act as well. Where is the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where is the suspicion of the novel when laughter floats into the night? Looks like nowhere? Where is the spark of the child, flirting and dancing like her mother? Finally, why the plot changed at the end? One wondered whether the script writer had actually read the book? Disappointing things
