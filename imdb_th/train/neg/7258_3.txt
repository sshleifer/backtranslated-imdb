This film has a small grain that has the following doctrine and is one of the word-of-mouth qualities you have just seen. May be hard to believe But there is a rural community in Arkansas in the southwestern part of Fouke that knows the legend is true This story has been told in a documentary format described by Vern Stierman and filmed in a real location, talking to the people involved. The myth changed with storytelling. But in the late 60s and 70s, most of the area around Fouke was seen by animals like Bigfoot who traveled along Boggy Creek with three inches of legs standing 7 feet tall. Causing damage and fearing 'bejeebers' from most communities I crossed the small bridge of Boggy Creek in 1974 and yes, the hair on the back of my neck was higher. Of course, it's about 13.00 am in the rain. When I arrived at Shreveport, I laughed.
