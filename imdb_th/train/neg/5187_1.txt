I will not approach and criticize the theory of RAW. I mean, this is a movie-related website, and whether the movie will be delivered or done well and is not a philosophy of debate on the website. That it is a shot that talks about the head of some RAW as a video archive, so you can see that he is older over the years and it's quite cool But otherwise, the viewing experience is monotonous and uninterrupted. <br /> <br /> It's a strange comparison. But I missed Sunday afternoon when I watched the Barbra Streisand * Funny Lady * movie.) After a while, I did that with OD in Barbra. I hope there will be a scene that you won't appear in: you Did you know that "At the same time, other characters in the movie depend on other things ..." While it's all about Barbra, this video is a * Funny Lady * of RAW. <br /> <br /> So if your thoughts are about the moment Well, look at the many different corners and angles of RAW as he struggles with his theory gathered in a weak structure that does not add any interest or insight, then be my guest. For me, I can't get it after 20 minutes.
