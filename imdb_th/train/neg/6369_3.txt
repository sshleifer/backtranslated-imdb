The only reason I rent this is because Fangoria's magazine article makes this movie look interesting, it's okay. All the actors in this movie are scary, except Faye Dunaway, who is always happy to watch. But too much time focused on Gina Phillips and the ridiculous confrontation with Ka and Dulio Marzio. Marzio has a very thick Argentine accent. You can understand every word he says. There is also Nicholas Pauls, a gentle love actor with Gina Phillips. The bottom line: This movie is not scary. There is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of the movie. I will give this star But gave three because I liked Faye Dunaway a lot, but even then she was not great in this matter
