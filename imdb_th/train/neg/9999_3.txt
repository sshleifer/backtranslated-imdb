This is the kind of movie that my enemies are satisfied with that I watch all the time. But it wasn't true blood. I watched it once in a while to make sure that it wasn't as good as I thought before. <br /> <br /> Some gangsters have a Boeing 747. The plane went down in the Bermuda Triangle and sank to the ground, which was a de facto post-submarine. Both stars fell or barely hovered over the horizon. <br /> <br /> "We are our own people!" Pilot Jack Lemmon said. He was right, except for George Kennedy. <br /> <br /> Watch other movies instead. Oh, not the original "airport" that is not good as well. Look at the good flick about the attached plane, such as "Flight of the Phoenix" instead.
