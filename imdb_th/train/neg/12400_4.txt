Matt Cordell returned from the dead for the third round, although I'm not sure if anyone would care at this point, except for the crazy MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died from the last flick, received Resurrection through Voodoo and now is hot on the path of many disobedient people involved in shooting a friend Cordell. I missed part of the quick money making in the early 90s, but was pleased to see Cordell destroying the body in a form that is so diverse and gruesome. The problem is that the film is quite stable and Cordell is not Jason or Freddy. The interest is rapidly decreasing, even though Robert Forster, a film expert, is a doctor who ends with his brain being disturbed. Next to the first film in the series, which is funny and scary and exciting at the same time
