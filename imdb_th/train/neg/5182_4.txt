As well as the most festive programs at Hamilton, built to watch interesting movies that are a little thought and action Although it is impressive because it has a low budget. But this film turned out to be a distorted and terrifying final moment when it was drawn and a clear conclusion. This film is about a family of expelled murderers who tried to survive after their parents died. They kidnapped people, drained blood from them, and fed something that was trapped in the basement. There was a dark comedy show from Mckellhar and Firgens and the rest looked good. This film has never felt real or disturbed that much. But for the first half taps into a funny and dark mix which is a surprising achievement The second half was not as successful as it could be, because it had been forgotten with an unrealistic twist that became the final scene that was laughing until it became a ridiculous movie. It is a shame even though there is a doubt that certain abilities are related to this production, and although there are profound flaws. But still original and creative Unfortunately when referring to the delivery of it completely failed at all levels, <br /> <br /> ** / 5
