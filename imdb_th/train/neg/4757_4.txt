Not long ago I saw Sleuth (1972) with two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine returned, but now he is a husband and Jude Law is a lover of his wife. The story remains the same and is a great drama. <br /> <br /> During the movie, I always have the feeling of watching. That's one of the reasons I didn't like this classic remake. When I watched the movie adaptation of the play, I still had to feel the movie watching, not just playing. Director Kenneth Brannigan used to do great movies in the past. But this time he missed Another reason is the look of the movie. Modern design, clean, stylish, uncomfortable and cool. I never felt that someone had lived in this house. Photography is not bad. But losing weight is terrible Sometimes there are blue, black, green light, to make it unfriendly. <br /> <br /> The performance is really good. Michael Caine's and Jude Law do the best. I want to see these 2 people. Play together on stage But I have to admit that I was never a big fan of Jude Law. The weakest part is the middle part. I remember that in the traditional part, this part is still very mysterious and amazing. I tried to watch it twice and often in the middle that I felt asleep. The end is better and more interesting than Sleuth (2007). Not scary. But it seems to be a film for critics rather than for audiences. Detective (1972) is still a masterpiece and more fun than a detective (2007).
