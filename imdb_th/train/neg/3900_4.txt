As someone who has read this book, I can say that this is a very inferior story about America's big version, starring Gwyneth Paltrow. There are many reasons for this. Firstly, Emma is not too happy. Yes, she has flaws and is not the one who likes the easiest. But viewers should not start to insult her seriously. Secondly, Mr. Knightly is a crafty person. His mourning and sorrow in this version is more suitable than Bronte's adaptation or Gaskell than Austen and makes the mood of both "off". Third, Samantha Morton is stronger than the actors are relegated to. Came to take the role of Harriet And why she makes it look weak Harriet should be a blonde girl and is blooming - do not see that she is being carried by consumption in the next scene. Fourth, the structure has been excavated and cut. At the end, when Emma decides that she loves Mr Knightly, he is faced with a lot of confusion because the story has not yet been shown and taken throughout the story. Fifth, what happened to Mrs. Elton's accent? She started to look like an American actress who tried to get rid of her accent from the first half until reaching the American half-way and then back to English at the end. Finally, this dragged at the end. The large version of the books and movies ended with Emma's wedding and Mr Knightly. This version dragged confusingly after announcing the wedding without showing us the truth. <br /> <br /> All is a rather hectic effort. Read a book or rent a Paltrow version instead.
