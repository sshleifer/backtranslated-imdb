As soon as this movie is ridiculous Not that it doesn't have to be exchanged for different sides ?? For example, the best thing about this movie is the beautiful backdrop. Anyone who does not live in the East Coast should know that the south has no beautiful mountains as found in the West. I know it is Utah next to the bat. But perhaps Dalton couldn't stop his English accent, so they apologized by saying that this is a southern city. The destruction of his accent to the south is easier. Of course, this film has a turning point. But the feeling of a fake place is something that I can't go through. It's not like Utah that doesn't have a cooking lab ... so why do writers think it is necessary to pretend that in the south is above me? <br /> <br /> Another thing in the picture Invites me to think of Why do they always create "cock" effects when the character pulls out an automatic pistol? It seems that other sound effects in this movie are "chuk-chich" that indicates that the 9mm loading is ready to shoot. Of course, weapons are already around, so it's not necessary. <br /> <br /> Finally, the fireworks are on the top. But wait, this movie aims at 'Market segment' I think ... It's too bad. Each actor can act. But this movie is not good
