Keenan Ivory Wayman may be one of the worst directors. I swear that he has no real knowledge about how to make movies. He created one great movie and that was a horrible movie. Horror movie 2 is ok as well. But everything that Keenan does is a real disaster. Avoid names like Do not harm the South while drinking your water in the hood ..... I know what the name is !!! Obviously, this movie, too, everything with the name Keenan on credit. <br /> <br /> It's a half hour in silly nonsense that never made me laugh. Just believe me in this matter, maybe women will like this movie a little because of the things that have happened, but overall, this movie will not be liked in the movie ......... 1/10 .. ..... jd seaton
