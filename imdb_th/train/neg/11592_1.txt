I'm still trying to determine whether the previous installments are worse than this or vice versa. Since it was almost fifteen years since I watched this movie, the fact that I remember very little about it was not a good omen. It may be because I only watch once or twice, but I doubt if there is anything worth remembering about this movie, you can be sure that I will remember it. <br /> <br /> While This film was released. The franchise still entered the dying period. Was allocated to it It's not a good sign when Teenie Pop Magazine has a basic explanation of the story. There is an article that explains that Freddie was left too weak to disturb the growing human dreams, so he decided to follow Alice's unborn son. Until now is very good But this is the duty of the writer or director to explain to the listener. It should not be left in unrelated publications. <br /> <br /> Using the trivia in the third part about Freddie's ideas, half of the people might expect the scene to raise a joke. Leave the category "Horror for babies" but alas, that should not be It shows the stupidity of the American rating system that junk parts. B'harni-esque This will get the same rating as the truly scary pieces like the original. <br /> <br /> At this time, the franchise can't attract anyone with an enthusiastic career. Luck or bad luck depends on how you look at Lisa Wilcox. There is to show the ingenuity of a talented show. Or maybe she may have the ability to compare with the rest of the actors In any way, because her last role is in what is called the All Chastity Blade's new adventure. I wonder if she has nothing to happen to her anymore. Even the poorest young Robert Engeland has a better production performance in the past fifteen years. <br /> <br /> Because the box office has come down. Continuous Thinking that the studio is aware of their film sterilization, doesn't make them sell better. In fact, this film, especially as well as its ancestors, was sterilized until not only But will not be able to attract new audiences But both succeeded in making the main audience supporting the franchise Even with this, the fifth part must be given some credit for not having a bright and glowing feeling that makes the fourth part look insulting. <br /> <br /> I give A Nightmare On Elm Street Part Five One in ten. By trying to attract everyone or everyone's mind at MPAA, it succeeds in attracting no one. As with the second and fourth sections, we can remove it from all continuity and no one sees the difference.
