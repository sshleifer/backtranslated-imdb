What started out as a gentle yarn of the country, a mild and unfriendly romantic story that gently changed when Edward Harlan's initial charm gradually revealed about himself. He himself In the west, <br /> <br /> The laborers (Norton) walked into the city and built a charm for a young girl (Evan Rachel Wood). It seemed to save her from death by Have a father who is in a bad mood But it gradually became clear that there was more cowboy in the eye. <br /> <br /> Edward Norton ?? Actual chameleon actor (Change the hairstyle to match). Play outside the country. Focus on a little accent. But probably because he just tried to show the script without worrying about the accent Of course he makes it seem difficult to make all the minor adjustments that are appropriate when we learn more about Harlan. However, with too many minor changes, it means that we are not sure where to come. Harlan and what seems like a good performance from Norton will be confused. Evan Rachel Wood is a favorite without having to do it. What's more than her eyelids at Norton <br /> <br /> going down into the valley is a bit uneven due to changes in rhythm and never before. The motivation of the protagonists to be clear, sympathetic to the audience for the characters remains uncertain. Should we like this homeless person? Even after the dramatic changes, it is still unclear. This ambiguity is caused by the decline of the film as if the author could not decide what they wanted to tell. If this film is still one or the other, it may be a solid movie. But what we leave with is a mess. Fans of old-fashioned romance will enjoy the part of the movie. But will be postponed with dark tones. The perfect Norton fans (or fans of the lush scenery of the San Fernando Valley) make a mistake.
