Anything that may be interesting in this content is sunk in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events that we are about to see will not be known and "This is the whisper of Hollywood's most exciting mystery. <br /> <br /> Okay, so we don't get anything new (and" Mysteries & Scandals "of E! Will help you set a better foundation in particular events ... and that is not a lot of endorsements). What will we get? <br /> <br /> We learn that Hollywood is Is a nest of poisonous snakes and decayers No big news at all. More interesting, we learned that any director who is willing to do in order to get a position in the entertainment industry and / or political establishment It raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich speaks from his experience through these characters or not. But what is said is cynical and ugly and confused Found it more annoying than fun We do not sympathize with anyone and the great "Citizen Kane" removes the relationship between Davies and Hart in a more reliable way in "The Cat's Meow". We are not sure that Davies has Motivation to stay with Hearst As soon as we received a notification, she went to do other things. <br /> <br /> And do we have to believe that Davies is the love of Chaplain's life? Or that he just tried to provoke one of the most powerful people in America This film doesn't make it clear. <br /> <br /> The convincing thing is the value of production. There is a famous recreation of yachts and medieval costumes. I went out and watched some of the construction on men's jackets rather than following the stories that bully the most famous personalities in Hollywood history. No one can remember that the screenplay is pure fiction. The denial of responsibility for the film frame just makes everything unstable and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The actors can't be wrong, even though Meg Tilly walks through the parody. She exhibited the most sincere performances in the sea, chewing the scenery. Only Joanna Lumley added above the material. But so much that it seems that she is distant from the entire organization instead of telling the story One of her first lines is "I'm not here!" And I'm sure she doesn't want you. <br /> <br /> This isn't a waste of Bogdanovich. It's bad. "At Long Last Love" It is on. Trying to do something serious But hesitant and stumbling very much because it is full of bitterness towards the "evil beast" named Hollywood This is the creation of the movie "National Enquirer" and not only makes the name of the person who is on this week's Top Oneida movie only. But the audience is dirty as well
