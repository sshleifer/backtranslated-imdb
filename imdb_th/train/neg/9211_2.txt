This film reminds me of many anti-drug movies in the 50s and 60s due to the fact that it was created by people who have never experienced the social evils that they warned us about. Tom Hanks and his friends are "role-playing", but without dice, lots of candles, and then you are swept away in a bad montage that shows Hank is falling in love with women in the group. But mistakenly, I suspect that a number of poor children have destroyed their D & D and have been told that using their imagination is the path to destruction. In general, movies are special after school, poor performances. (Although Hank shows some of his abilities) and talking about relationships and seems like no one is fun It seems that these films will give psychological importance to teenagers starting on the road to maturity, which will become more intense and require you to buckle and do what others do, even with my 2 points. It's worth watching because it's a unique horror movie that I find quite funny.
