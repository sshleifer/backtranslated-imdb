After watching this film that was heavily censored on television many years ago, I was curious to see an unedited version. I was surprised that it was more reliable and better than I can remember. But there is one thing that really stands out I think other investigators talk about this, what is the nature and motivation of the character Chris Sarandon? Has he ever raped another victim? He is completely psychotic or is a "normal person" who likes society? How did he expect to escape from his sister's attack? Is this character reliable or is it just a matter of background needed? It seems that he is almost ready to be an incredibly insane and too crazy character to be able to teach a job that makes him contact with a weak and weak girl. This seems to be the biggest complaint of the general audience. It has nothing to do with his performance, which is a very scary story. This film is in a position that is uncomfortable between real exploitation and serious action in half way Not the worst movie ever created But not all good things as well
