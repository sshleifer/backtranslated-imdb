As long as the movie HEIST proceeds, this movie is rather weak. Continuity is a pretty punch, without the continuity of character enough to feel like you understand any character. Peter Falk is great and he is one of the reasons worthy of watching. "He will go back. He buys saugages" or something like that ... There are a few good scenes, even though they are due to the efforts of the actors. Script direction and editing are pretty lousy.
