I'm a big fan of Michael Madsen, so there's no need to say that I bought this movie without even renting or anything ... This movie is terrible. I didn't take it back to the store. I don't need anyone. Something else that has to be poisoned by humans. I just threw it into the trash. Don't pay attention to money. It's worth it. The performance is not bad, it's not good or anything. The story is terrible and the ending is something that I despise. He is an alcoholic. His life is rubbish. I think his peanut horse is a terrible device to show his childhood innocence. The dog is much better. I also hate religion, so this ending without doubt makes me angry. Jesus heals everything ... I hate that I know people like this, who are large Christians and Catholics, and that time shows that God does not cure all or anything. It's a scary movie if you have the option to look through or better yet buy or rent and throw it in the trash and leave the coffee grounds in the morning.
