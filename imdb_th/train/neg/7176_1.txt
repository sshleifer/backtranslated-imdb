I have nothing to say more, but it's terrible. I can't imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this decadence. And if some actors do not want people to question their sexuality, maybe they should stop making these movies more At least someone saw that I was curious. Just my opinion, SHUDDER thinks what has been cut out of the movie. SHUDDER wondering what happened in the minds of actors who made this movie. Shivering thinking about the thought process and the sneakiness that occurred in the director's mind. Like I said before being a decomposed mess, it's not funny, as Ebert mentioned in the Caligula movie with Malcolm McDowell. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
