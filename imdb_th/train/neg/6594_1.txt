I have seen the most, if not the classic movies of Laurel and Hardy. I'm always happy there, funny, even after watching it over and over again. This new film tries to bring the classics back with two new actors who are similar to both Laurel & Hardy but fail miserably for many reasons. One of them is how their clothes are. (Still early 20th century) However, both images in the environment of the 90s, some past conversations were brought back. However, it was pitifully failed to approach the classic series This movie may be the worst movie I've ever seen and should be pulled out of the shelf and locked forever. The real Laurel and Hardy are turbulent in their graves in a bad imitation.
