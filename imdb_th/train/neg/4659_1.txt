This movie loses movie stock. Do you believe that the map of the military action plan will be placed on a tripod on the daylight for everyone with a binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see? It happened in this movie. Do you believe that deaf people will be in the army stationed in Europe during World War II to serve in the "Negro" unit ... cook, supply, service, burial details, etc.? It happened in this movie. Do you believe that black officials (And clever) will choose this DEAF as part of a combat mission to protect the dam from being destroyed by the Germans before the allies arrive? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that DEAF soldiers didn't know that the German aircraft were approaching from behind and strafing and killing him? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that a group of American soldiers caught a barn in a barn in which the Germans had happened to shout out when they saw a German soldier just 50 feet away? They do it in this film and leave the possible entrance in the German barn. They may check without protection altogether. Would you believe that in the waves and clear English, the captain talks about the position of the general if not his name as the person he speaks with and the general person speaks good English with open wind waves. must Be protected the next day? Perhaps they should send representatives to tell the direction that America's attacks will come from just to make it easier in Germany. The movie called this movie should be on the list of the 50 worst movies. If it were, I was sure it would be well done. See your own risk.
