I was tricked into visiting this movie after reading positive reviews from other websites and I am a p.o'd !!! I spent at least 15 minutes to pick it up from the b / c rack. I don't want anyone to see me then another 10 minutes to create courage to take to the counter and use real money to rent. I think all my stress will be compensated by the time I get home and watch movies. B / c The comments I read say that this movie is surprising. As a joke! If you can do it through the first hour of the movie then you are lucky! b / c it can't be until the movie turns into a horror story Don't worry about this person. You should look at it.
