The fact that this film is eligible for the most successful movie in Switzerland's film history makes me shake the head! It's true But pathetic at the same time The Swiss army flick might be better. <br /> <br /> The story sounds interesting at first: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) Antonio is forced to practice. Soldier by the army The church is married to his love. Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter) <br /> <br /> Acting in some way is not different from the recruitment of only a few people who are drunk and drunk in a sense. real Melanie Vinaker plays the role of Michelle Bunchi in moderate strength. Personally, I find that she is quite annoying. <br /> <br /> The story consists of a funny movie combined with love which is not. The result Love is a very worthless part, and the funny part is not funny. It is a cheap effort and does not change throughout the movie. Is a joke for children aged 12-13 years, but not suitable for people searching for comedy The humor is weak, except for some shots. <br /> <br /> Drugs? cold! steal? cold! If you want the right comedy about Swiss RS, make sure you don't practice your military and even don't expect too much. <br /> <br /> I'll give you 4 stars out of 10 stars because Rikori came quite funny during the time he was on the screen. Not a lot of screen time
