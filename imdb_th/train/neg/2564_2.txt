When I go to see a movie, I will stay and watch or if I don't like it, I will sleep. But this is really nonsense. I got up and walked away! .... This is a terrible script. I hate it together In addition, they should not take Brendan Frasier out. He is much better. This is not as good as I expected, because I really like George of the Jungle 1 and the graphics are not as good as the first graphics like birds and when they hit trees I hope the director of this movie will be interested and the next movie he does, he must consider again ... scary! I want Ursla to do very well because she makes the movie worthwhile. (Until I walked away) ... Overall, I gave this movie 2 of 10.
