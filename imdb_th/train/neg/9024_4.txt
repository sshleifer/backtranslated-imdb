"Shinobi" is one of the movies that think that killing characters will bring feelings or feelings to the story automatically. Unfortunately, the audience is really interested in people who are dying, you have to develop the character, otherwise all you have to do is randomly violent actions. The problem will increase especially when you have a ton of characters that everyone dies. <br /> <br /> Ok, so if you don't care to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way. Give a reason why they can die, right? Nope, here we have a war between two tribe tribes, without which no one knows why they fought themselves. They killed each other because the emperor said so. But after the emperor apparently wanted them to die, they still refused to abandon the meaningless mission. That's not stubbornness ... that's just silly. <br /> <br /> Never mind! No character development and plot does not give a reasonable reason for fighting. At least they die in a cool action scene, right again? No! In fact, many fights are not fought at all. Super ninjas that the movie takes and attempts to introduce sudden death. (And in my opinion) I'm talking about things such as "La Lala, I'm walking and I'm broken-neck *". The end for that character Even though halfway through it, I lifted my hand in frustration at its ridiculousness.
