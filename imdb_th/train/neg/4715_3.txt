I just watched Johnny's test in an attempt to find humor in it. I failed horribly. Cartoon Network often tends to make their performances enjoyable by all audiences, but Johnny Test is "entertainment" in the lowest form. The writing can be incredibly predictable and the jogging is not gagged as much as the children will love and that is the story. <br /> <br /> Now don't say it's all bad. The original default theme is quite catchy. But for some reason they brought their skeletons and smashed them with aluminum figures It's a shame because that's one of the best things to happen. <br /> <br /> Some characters are very interesting in theory. With a little work, the characters can work together well. But it has one dimension Then again, this makes it easier for children to follow. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is too fast as well. It is now very busy, leaving little time for clever writing. This is a real shame because there are many interesting ideas presented. However, on the other hand, fast pace will stop children from losing interest and that is the real goal of all target groups. <br /> <br /> Overall, the list looks very good on paper. Succeeded in being funny or interesting This is the item I want. But I can't do it There are many potentials that are not realized. Children will enjoy it, but that's about it.
