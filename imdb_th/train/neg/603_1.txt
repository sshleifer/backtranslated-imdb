Definitely laughing movies I live in London and this plot is not well researched. It's ridiculous. No one can be threatened on the London Underground. In a short time, it was not open for service each night. There was a team of maintenance technicians there, checking the route and making repairs, etc. that there were no homeless people living there. Or it may be possible to be locked and unable to access mobile phones today and age ... <br /> <br /> The worst thing that should happen if someone finds himself after the train The last procession is So that they can spray graffiti on them Although this is under control due to many security cameras on the network But there is another thorn of the story (Remember that in London, in general, we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.) <br /> <br /> If set in the city, I'm not familiar. But it's not a high quality movie so I can't bring myself to suppress my unbelief and try and enjoy it for a tedious little story. <br /> <br /> I'll give It's time to 10/10 if there is a rating! It may be the most frustrating movie I ever thought I needed.
