<br /> <br /> Now, before many movie actors are choking on their latte, allow me to do it thoroughly. As much as I enjoy it, this is just one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it's the worst movie I've ever seen in a movie theater. (It's an impressive quote because I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen.) Both leading actors (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cutbert) is not the most reliable and scary. Of course, they did not get the help of a script with an emotional depth as much as singles, Daphne and Celeste, and an explanation of the credible characteristics equal to the protection of OJ. There are no scenes and scenes of 'Gore' while cruel, undoubtedly relevant and laughable. The plot of what has been twirled around twenty things (Cuthbert), kidnapped, imprisoned and tortured by various organs, both physically and mentally The scene of torture feels like a lack of connection, parts, and frankly emphasized rather than shocking the audience. While there is really very little, very little positive to pull from this film, the exchange feature is very flawed that makes it a scary movie. I never heard the audience speak more in the cinema. Within twenty minutes, all the theaters were in stitches and remained forever. For my part, I came out with laughter, buoyancy by movies that had been on the pinnacle of horrifying filmmaking. No matter where you look, it is the cinematic success and blueprint for future film directors who have detailed details about not making movies. <br /> <br /> PS I refrain from talking about that. I can go into the movie for free ... so I was able to laugh about it. I still want to ask for a refund ... It's a really bad thing.
