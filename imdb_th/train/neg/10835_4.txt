Excellent actor Great performance The first half unpredictable story. <br /> <br /> An hour or more. I want to know what will happen to each unrecognized character and how. <br /> <br /> It seems that their different lives will become intertwined, but when <br / > <br /> The writer picks up the glue to start connecting the players. <br /> <br /> Use the super glue wrong and bring the movie to a standstill. <br /> <br /> For two hours Ago I always thought that would be better, but <br /> <br /> would be worse Do not believe opinions. This is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think about it - Tom Cruise made an ugly story. - Why? The hunky bartender <br /> <br /> Beautifully wearing braces. I know that it has to do with the plot. <br /> <br /> But without them, at least there should be a charismatic actor who must remember. <br /> <br />
