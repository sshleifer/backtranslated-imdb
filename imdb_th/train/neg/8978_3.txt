If John Waters wrote and directed "House of 1000 Corpses" after being hit by the head with heavy objects repeatedly, the result might be "The Blood Shed". It provides a gentle entertainment in the first half hour. But after that, it slid down in the form of continuous screams and people doing things with each other's genitals with electric carving knives, knives and pliers. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is annoying. Unbelievable and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad as what he did in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about "The Blood Shed" is that it won't take a long time. Most will forget about it.
