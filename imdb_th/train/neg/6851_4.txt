Feh, this movie begins with an interesting way. But accelerating the boundaries of the sound to be confused The most confusing part occurred at the beginning, where the scenes were cut so much that it was difficult to tell what happened in the first twenty minutes. Dullness comes later with a warm romance between two living people. The vengeful spirit of the dead girl is the most lively person in this movie, which is sad. If the rest of the actors depend on her abilities, the movie may be better. <br /> <br /> Perhaps because of the story, it is very interesting in a moment. To revive her daughter from death with unfortunate side effects that every dead person will return As well, accepting a strong and worthy human body to start killing everyone The Night of the Living Dead mystery in Japan, but this didn't happen. Although the priest with a small coat with a small basket tied to his head would tell young people who do not care that this will happen if the priest ends her ritual. There is no rising mass of death, no army, no funeral. The priest simply made the girl's spirit back to the land of death, bringing her boyfriend's clutter as she crushed his spine like a brittle peanut (at the point I was tempted to cheer like this. The madman goes to kiss and caresses DEAD, ewwww !!!) The best friend Robitussen sucking without mind has a long thoughtful shot at the end when she leaves the village for the last time and that is There is no real horror. There is no real horror that Japan usually does better than American filmmakers, with a focus on popular face makeup, no screaming. I'm very disappointed
