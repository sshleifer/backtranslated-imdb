I am a big fan of Lynn Peterson since her development role in the blockbuster "Far North" in 1988, and although I love her in other movies "Slow" (2004) where she plays "Fran Sis "Her strongest role is far away. <br /> <br /> Lynn, because I'm sure you all know (or should) play an important role of" driver ". <br /> <br / > Too bad for others than Lynn's amazing acting. I'm afraid. This movie will not happen a lot. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait - there's another thing - the amazing creativity of editing to remove the rough words for TV viewers. Memorable streaks like: "You are the son of a gun!", "You are the son of a witch!", "Shoot!" And "Okay, forget!" <br /> <br /> OK bye. <br /> <br /> Primary H: Does anyone know if I can find Lynn Peterson posters again?
