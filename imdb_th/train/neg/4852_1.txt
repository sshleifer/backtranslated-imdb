I saw this movie once and I think it's ok. Then friends in the office said "Look again better" So I made and with my surprise it was WORSE in the second! There are limitations, so I will take the ball rolling here. <br /> <br /> - The bomb scene is very stupid. Why would anyone on earth wait for an explosion ??? - No characters here, even cute from a distance. Not the first time, not even the second time. <br /> <br /> - Oh, and the last time I checked the car, not mine, from shooting a single shot. Tiny fire extinguisher ... Is the audience above 3/10 really watching the movie? - The camera is very shaky. I can hardly tell what happened. The opening scene with the robot makes my stomach removed. The rest of this movie is not that good. <br /> <br /> - The McManus Brothers Night Scene (from "The Boondock Saints") will be Peeling their eyes is so stupid. First of all, why do men put their guns in places where people are shot? In addition, why did he spend so much time cleaning up new ammunition, aiming and not being fired when there was chaos around him? -SAS Running type instead of staying and fighting back ?????? Ha????? Be a soldier ... gay ... ??? I didn't intend to listen to homophobia. But actually, that scene was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> - Too long for my own goodness. Bigelow seems to think that the more you do, the better. It looks like she's wrong - the movie is filled with extravagant action scenes that are thrown into it to divert your attention from the lack of a central plot. I know that Watchmen took more than 163 minutes, but at least That film didn't drag. On the other hand, this film is able to make and feel longer. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is Renner, which is the most pleasant. But do yourself a favor, just skip this thing and don't let the ads
