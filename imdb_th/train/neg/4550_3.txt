My beloved is a movie! Let's talk about "special techniques" first. Do not understand me wrong. Here I am not one of those who are crazy about those effects. But I think overlapping is a long practice, mostly in the 60s, so sometimes I think they may have recorded this movie for a long time and they have to cut and release it forever. But as far as I know they don't have a mobile phone in the 60s ... <br /> <br /> What I'm looking for in most movies is good, with really good messages. The acting is secondary, the effect is secondary, I do not care about anything that conflicts slightly. However, in movies such as unbelievably bad performances, etc., increased to make movies worse - that's what happened to me with the Celestine prophecy. <br /> <br /> My wife said that This book is actually really good, and even if I don't get into everything about the soul, I can see that it can be brought in a convincing way. - The movie failed to do so. <br /> <br /> There may be only one reason to watch it, but if you really love movies that are wonderful, it will be the movie that suits you. If the IMDb star is a magical story instead of quality, I have to rate this movie ten stars. <br /> <br /> By the way, the three stars are due to the fact that there are worse movies, such as "Mass. Crisis "(see comments about that thing - hilarious) Celestine prophecy, at least some fun
