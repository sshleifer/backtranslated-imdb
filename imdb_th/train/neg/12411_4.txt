There are many great horror movies created in the seventies - but this movie is not one of them! It is a shame that children do not improve because it works from good ideas that sometimes take in sometimes successful horror forms. We have ideas about vindictive children who work well in classic movies like The Bad Seed and then we have the theme of the central zombies. The storyline is like this: The girl blames a lot of people for her mother's death, so she goes to the cemetery and makes the dead die for revenge. All this is good and good, except that it's boring! Nothing happens to most movies, and even if it ends with good blood. It's not enough for the final scene to show the rest of it. Obviously, this movie was filmed at an economical price due to the cheap location and all the actors were rubbish. There is not much I can say about movies as a whole because there are not many. Children are horrifying horror movies in the seventies and of course I do not recommend.
