This is a blind second-hand DVD purchase. It killed a lot of hilarity that I had when I played Convincing and disturbing and convenient. I finally found that it was depressing to watch. <br /> <br /> Maybe the box might make me expect more The film Caper Uneven (I know that I know the words in the Oscars & nominations box have nothing.)
