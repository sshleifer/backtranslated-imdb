This is the worst thing and I mean the worst movie I have ever seen from a computer. The whole story is unbelievable and full of foolishness. <br /> <br /> I mean ... <br /> <br /> The guy in this movie can actually speak to the computer as a real person You may now think that this must be a very high-tech computer. But he did a very poor and weak computer that doesn't even have a graphic interface Really My mobile phone will turn off the light to save energy. But apparently this intelligent computer cannot decide whether to use resources to deal with national security threats or to download computer games. <br /> <br /> There is something bad as well. But I don't have time for this. <br /> <br /> I'm just not convinced that someone can record such stupid movies.
