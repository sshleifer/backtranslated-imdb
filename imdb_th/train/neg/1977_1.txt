Wait, don't tell me ... They throw the movie away. Did you know that the film might have been shot in the back alley in New York "Gangster Bangster"? I guess Gangster Rap, a designer of clothes, a thug brush, which includes a handkerchief that has been moved from the neck to prevent dust storms going to the head I guess it is to protect the head from the heat filter through the K-Mart hat. "Budget-rent-a-horsie" seems to give the horse. One scene in the bedroom where the woman is talking and the guy talking her words .... I even though he said You know that watching this movie is a confirmation that it's not about acting anymore ... It's about the look and it's about money. It may not be too much about this movie. Okay, I think this movie will go down at the worst time ever created. Another thing, though, Ice T is where he eventually goes to Oprah?
