I borrowed this movie because not only because of its gay theme But the idea of ​​playing that role made me very amazed. I was surprised that it was shot in San Francisco since I lived near SF. And of course it was good to see the pictures of Castro (Although Castro for me is more important to gay men than women) but other than that, I can't really recommend this movie. The characters were not developed for me to be interested in and finally when they started to get. "Roleplaying" I'm already bored. And the role of playing the scenes that I have seen is quite embarrassing to watch Acting makes something something is needed Needless to say, I didn't finish the movie. I will skip this one
