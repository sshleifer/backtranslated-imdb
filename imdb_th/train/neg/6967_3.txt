Oh, God, it's an idiot movie that has special effects, incredibly cheap. (Creatures played by a man in a weak suit) and a stupid plot, all the conversations are incredibly bad and these actors Just laughing. For example, I've never seen such annoying characters like in this garbage. (Stupid children or pregnant women with their husbands and many more) All of this is a great entertainment if you're drunk. Avoid. Like a plague, I'm drunk? I don't think so ...
