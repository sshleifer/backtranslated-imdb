It's a really good movie. I like it a lot. But the ending was sudden !! There is absolutely no closure and makes many loose ends. What will happen after the concert? What happened to her boyfriend? Are you related to Grant? Did you come into the next semester? And Angela Obviously, Holly's performance will make Angela fall a few pins There is a lot of air remaining and not very pleasant. I don't know if I'm trying to leave the room for the sequel or anything But it's a terrible ending and I think it makes funny movies. I'm very disappointed
