Please do not rent or think about buying this movie. They do not have to rent at the red box which will cost $ 1 & I think it is less than that. The main reason I rented this movie. It is because Jenna Jameson is in this movie. Haha. Between 2-5 minutes I will give credit that this movie has a little hot chicks and nudity. But other than that, you might buy another horror movie that has the same thing as No one you know, Ginger Lynn has more time to perform than this movie. Jenna and she's not on the cover of the movie or her name. When this movie was a big disappointment and wasted a lot of time.
