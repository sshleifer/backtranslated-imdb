I watched this movie based on a readable review that I read about it from others. <br /> <br /> They saw something in this movie that I didn't see for sure. <Br /> <br /> The movie starts quickly and during the first 15 or 20 minutes is interesting, then it starts to be locked and dragged away, not to mention unbelievably. <br /> <br /> You finally find that Yourself says: "What?!? He will do that too. How far can he go with this? "<br /> <br /> The story begins with the character of John Jeff Goldblum John. Buy a bottle of wine There was a robbery and a new shop clerk, Auggie Rose, was killed during the robbery. <br /> <br /> John was in the ambulance and went to the hospital with men. Seems to be less than this <br /> <br /> John is totally obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> John, who has a very good life, is a beautiful girlfriend, loves to love, safe work, pay results. Good returns, beautiful houses, good cars, suitable for reasons that have never had any reason. John who has a very good life - decides that he wants to be a loser like Auggie Rose and experience life in a precious job Low returns live on the set with the girlfriend who has Minh and connections possible with malicious /> <br /> witty film <br received good reviews, I would not know. Of course, Gold Blum serves well - he always does - and his appearance is better with age - but if you don't have a big passion with Jeff Goldblum and have to watch every movie that He is. I do not recommend this turkey. It is about two hours in your life that you will not come back - and believe me - you will have nothing to thank for the last two hours. Ending, in addition to being grateful, you are not sitting watching this movie! <br /> <br />
