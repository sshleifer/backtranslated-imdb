As far as this film is satisfying enough Fun characters, good conversations, interesting stories I would really like it. If I didn't get so much frustrated while watching it, don't respect it. It shows that the city is located in Glasgow. <br /> <br /> In Scotland but every character In English (Except for a Dutch fan who is a Dutch) The Scottish accent only heard about work and roles. As a Scottish woman (& as an audience who likes her "real life" movie is more like real life) I don't think it will hurt to use Scottish actors. With many talents At least there are British people who can use good accents! A futile effort to use the word "Wee" a few times did nothing but insult
