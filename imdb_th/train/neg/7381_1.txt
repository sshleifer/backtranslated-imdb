Okay, first of all, Seagal's voice dubbed more than 50% of the movie ... Why? Because it was clear that the script was written and the story as they were being filmed and they needed to change his dialogue for the continuation of the story because there were many versions From the beginning, you just scratch your head because overdubs not only distract But it is not reasonable. <br /> <br /> that the story is still being sucked and there is no reason When I reached the end, I was just scratching my head because that movie was pointless and the ending was not reasonable. <br /> <br /> Avoid like a plague. This movie made me stop watching Seagal straight to the movie video because they were getting worse.
