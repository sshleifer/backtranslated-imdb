This movie is terrible. It has a terrible taste and is a pedestrian and not confident in the script, although it depends on the actual event - which doesn't add anything more than this. But more disappointed The direction is not good due to scenes and outings. Not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. In the beginning, Williams was not convinced that it was gay to separate relationships and relationships that were interesting. The worse thing is that his character is forced by the ugly pedophile story that is basic and there is no place to put the device. You have an old version of Rory Culkin spraying "d_ck_smker" in a fun, boring way - which is annoying enough. Laughed by the character of Finally, you have Sandra O as a mentor to the guardian angel for Williams and be thrown to explain all the failures. In the end, Toni Collete's character is annoying and simple. But hidden with the performance of her 6th Sense with a worse direction.
