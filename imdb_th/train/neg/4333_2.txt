References: Christian: Everyone who has more than 50 I.Q will see this movie. What is it? A prequel acts wisely for a modern day classic. Yes, it doesn't have a blockbuster or a big budget. But it still works very well. <br /> <br /> More than 50 IQ people you say .. which mostly means that you have a FAQ below 50 .. Its name is CARLITOS WAY: Add the power !!! Means that it should have something that the first person will do .. <br /> <br /> All and everything is a movie that can be used if you change the name and character that is not named BRIGANTE. /> Ps Do not comment on the movie if you don't know anything about the movie. But I guess that is a common question under 50, you will not know if hell I shout about ... <br /> <br /> Peace out !!
