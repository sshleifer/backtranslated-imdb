This movie may be stupid like The Naked Gun (which should be). Point: <br /> <br /> 1 In order to counterfeit her drowning, Robert is secretly studying swimming at the YWCA after YWCA calls her husband to work to show condolences. Hello, how did they get their work numbers? <br /> <br /> 2 Before she left the city, she would leave the wedding ring in the bathroom. A few days or weeks later, her husband discovered it in John. Does this mean that the bathroom has never been washed out? <br /> <br /> 3 There is no explanation about how she paid for caring for her mother in a nursing home. (Because she followed her rich husband back) <br /> <br /> 4 At the end of the movie, Robert, who is suspicious of her husband, is in the house. Instead of running for her life, she ran to the kitchen instead to see if the cans were stacked together or not.
