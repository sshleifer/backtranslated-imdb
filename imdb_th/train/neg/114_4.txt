It's not an actor The more detailed actors you can't find It's not a setting The director falls in love with New York City and at the end of the movie, we are all! Woody Allen can't improve what Bogdonovich does here if you're falling in love or searching for love. Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with movies is that there is no script at all. Actors fall in love at first sight. Words are not necessary. In the Hollywood director's experience, that's what happens when they go to work on the scene. It is true for him and those around him. But it is most of our imagination in the real world Therefore, the movie will eventually be hollow and shallow and without text.
