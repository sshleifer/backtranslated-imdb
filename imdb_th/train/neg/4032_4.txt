I have never heard of this before before it appears on cable TV. It is very common in the late 1950s. Sci-fi: Quiet and not paranoid! Despite having a romantic couple in general But there is this documentary in a documentary style - which may be a cheap way to make the narrative easy and an excuse to insert as much stock as human can do. For the exact thing is that investment with a very low budget! While not interested in himself (the-apocalypse-through-renegade-missile angle, used later, with greater self-confidence, for DR. STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964]) in that matter resulted in laughter Unintentionally - especially in the scenes related to the approaching childbirth
