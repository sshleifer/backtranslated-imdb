Manoj Agrawal After the failure of PARDESI BABU (1998) came back with this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has Govinda in the role 8-9, while his parents, grandfather, sister and later fake him. <br /> <br /> His friend is a useless detective, sending stories to friends to prove that his wife has photos at the airport while flirting with Rani. <br /> <br /> He disguises himself in As Sardarji on the plane and again as a girl. Is a simple way and in a short time he did it <br /> <br /> He then disguised as a French singer and television to get into proven. As Maharashtra (yes on TV) <br /> <br /> The rest of this film has the same misunderstandings and ends on a predictable note. There are funny scenes like Govinda, who was bumped from Africa and many others. <br /> <br /> The direction by Manoj Agrawal is okay. Music doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Govinda once again proves that he is one of those. The most watched show that he used to be a fan tastic, even though he has acted loudly. Before he got along well with every role and role, here again, even if the 6-7 hyped role is too bad for the movie, Rani looks fat but works with Govinda. Excellent, and continue to do this type of work. Among the rest of the Nirmal Pandey, as always, Johny Lever is too loud sometimes and funny in places in 1 role and frustrated when Tinnu Anand, the old model, is okay. Satish Kaushik hilarious
