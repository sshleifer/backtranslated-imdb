I love the sexy action and sci-fi movies of the sixties and because of the actresses that appear in them. They found the sexiest woman in this movie and it didn't matter if they were able to perform it (remember "Candy"?). The reason for my disappointment from this film is because it's not enough to miss. The story here has a European sci-fi movie called "Dragonfly" being created and the director is fired. Therefore, the producers decided to give the filmmakers a little. (Jeremy Davies) created a picture. They were one of the beautiful women in the movie who played Dragonfly, but she barely got there. The film was written and directed by Roman Coppola, who used his father to exploit his early days and put it in the script. I hope this movie may be a homage to the early movies. They have many cameos by actors who appear in them. There was an actor in this film that was popular from the sixties and John Phillip Law (Barbarella) Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also appeared. I guess I will have to wait for the director to show respect for the sixties movie. If someone read this message "Make it as sexy as possible"! I will wait!
