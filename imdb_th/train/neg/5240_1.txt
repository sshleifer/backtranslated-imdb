As soon as it enters the screen, it will destroy all intelligent creatures around! But on behalf of the manufacturer, I must say that it is not in the well-known movie category. It deserves to get its own new name! It's "Drama Neurology"! It makes me sad and depressed every neuron in the human brain. <br /> <br /> It's the closest thing we can go to the rhythm without suffering. It makes you speechless. Every member is stunned. Your mouth is open and still and the most strange symptom is that you get yourself wanting to be blind and deaf. <br /> <br /> Sort of " The movie "like this <br /> <br /> The only word in my mind that just finished my test is OUTRAGE !!!!!!
