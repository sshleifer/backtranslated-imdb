If this film is written, directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad classic movie, it may be popular. Have you ever watched a movie that was so scary that it became interesting about the disorder? In this way, every actor should be nominated to receive the worst acting award. It would be difficult to find other movies with this type of production budget that has very little value. All things from the opening scene challenge logic. The conversation is completely unbelievable and irrational. For the behavior and general story of the movie itself The really incredible thing is that some in the boardroom have decided to use the money in this trash. Wow.
