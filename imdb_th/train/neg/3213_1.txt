I can honestly say that this was the first time I was exposed to a movie without meat or potatoes in it. The whole movie feels like it's just a salad without a main dish. The story is misleading and ridiculous. The character is a single dimension, the truth goes out the window and the animation is made by four years old Is it covered? I have never been embarrassed for the concept of my life. I never read cartoons or watch other programs with this character. But from the characteristics of other reviews, I am not at my observation. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, the story moves too fast. For people who are not familiar with the characters and situations, I need more reasoning than finding a solution. I've seen other anime characters (if you call this anime) doing good things with their characters because they spend time developing them. There is no setting for Lady Death. In the short scene, we see her train with the Cremator and immediately become a fierce beast of hell. This was difficult for me to swallow by considering the time before she was introduced because this weak and weak woman was controlled by her father. Suddenly she was immersed in hatred and was able to fight millions of years of life. This is ridiculous. Lady Death's presentation is terrible to say the least. I feel as though she is nothing more than an animated character instead of a woman who is desperate with revenge in her heart. For me it doesn't work She had nothing more than an eye candy for a young boy before he received a training that required a huge amount of skin that she grew up on her chest when practicing with the Cremator. Like the character of Cremator, who is this random person? The explanation they gave was not enough, and I was left to talk more than real development. It was a very sad day in hell when we abandoned the character to show violence and action, especially in the form of animation. <br /> <br /> Continue to have Lucifer as himself. Let me say that I think I can fight with the King of Hell and survive. He was weak, laughter, and he didn't represent the image I had in my heart. As if Disney was in control and wanted to make him a semi-PC He lacked the darkness and nature that Lucifer had predicted. He is not the ruler of hell. But instead of being a lazy person with more lives When talking about life or death, how do you die again in hell? That is definitely a concept that needs more explanation. Most characters worry about death when they do not consider the options they have died. That is the way they go to hell. I think it's the level of thought that destroys my movie. I did not capture the idea that your soul is still in a strong body in hell. But that may be me? Or it may be because there is no development in this matter Nothing was created. Just prepare. <br /> <br /> The fight sequence is terrible. The animation in this cartoon feels like it was created in the early 90s. There is nothing impressive about the way this film draws. Why are we in America behind the scenes of animation? It's very big in Asia and it is creeping into the hard core here because we make movies like Lady Death that doesn't challenge or use any part of the imagination. We are cheap and this movie shows <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is terrible. Animation with sound work that is awesome, cheap I have somewhere that this movie is about production for a long time which is difficult to understand because I think I can create this movie with my credit card. Production is a scary story, just like the story. There was no development at all, allowing large vulnerabilities that almost everyone fell into. The character's strength is gone and nothing is explained. I waste time with this person and would like to remind others that when death comes, you will not find yourself in my status and regret that you wasted 80 minutes with this piece. <br /> /> BLAH! < br /> <br /> Grades: * from *****
