The original "les visiteurs" is a hilarious original, interesting, balanced and near perfect. LV2 must be an option for "The sequel of the best first movie" in LV2. Everyone still shouted when gagging, not working before it, repeated 5 times with a vague hope that it would eventually become a joke. LV2 is an awesome parody of LV1 Except of course, the parody should be creative if you love LV1. Don't watch this movie, just watch LV1 again !!
