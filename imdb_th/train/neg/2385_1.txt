I watched this movie because I was a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I would try their sister Rain Phoenix. I'm sorry to check it out. She is embarrassing and this movie has a strange story, if that's what you want to call. The strange sissy and the jellyfish were just sitting in the bathroom where the couple slept with the old man in the mountains. What happened? I have never been satisfied in my life. It's all garbage I can't believe that the actors agreed to make movies, lose money, time and place. Sisters are 'beautiful', not coming to me. I think she is everything, but those thumbs are stupid and why do we care about how she can wave the car? What is the point ??? 0 out of 10 Unfortunately, the survey has no 0 not deserved. 1. Hope Rain is better in other movies. I forgive her for this performance.
