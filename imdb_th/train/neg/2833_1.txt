With the movie Bo Derek, viewers will get what they expect. A thin paper plot and a couple of Derek wearing 'Ghosts can't do' clothes, only the first fifteen minutes was a regular TV drama, as long as Scott [Anthony Quinn] was alive He is a very good actor and has a long experience in many different roles. But it seems that even famous actors have to work for money. Bo Derek is the opposite. Play as a good-looking girl with or without clothes. This film is completely time consuming. If you want to see Quinn for rent, Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see nude women or poor performances, rent any porn.
