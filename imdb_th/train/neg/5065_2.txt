This movie is not normal. Weak stories, weak directors and performances are below average. What really frustrates me is the overt-all-time advertising - for famous internet service providers. Obviously there are some scenes written to do that. Advertising This movie is a slap in everyone's face that pays for this story. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this story. It's not worth your time.
