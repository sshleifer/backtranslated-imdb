Now I love Bela Lugosi. Don't understand me wrong. He is one of the most interesting people who have ever made a movie. But he has a clunkers share, of course, that he is another one. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays as Dr. Lawrence, a doctor who pulled the driver's license for reasons that could not be explained. However, he was doing experiments to make his wife young and beautiful. It revealed that she was 70-80 years old, but Lugosi seems to be in the middle. 50 years, so why did he marry this old woman never had a real explanation? <br /> <br /> However, these treatments or trials involve giving the bride to the altar the decoration. Work with some sweet smelling substances that they passed Lugosi and some of his assistants stole the body to the morgue and brought it back to his lab, where it was stored in animation or in an unstable state. Then the bride that was stolen Somewhere in their body, maybe the neck and the needle hit The body of Lugo's wife to bring her back to youth and beauty. We have never seen where Lugosi is attached to the needle or what he pulled from the bride. But it returned his wife in some way The wife made many screams until she returned to her brother's status. Helping Lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this movie .... the strange old witch and two sons who Deformation .... one big son A person who looks like a slow lump like a bride and other people is a little dwarf .... A little person who will solve the political problems in the world today. The three people are piling up. The lab on the ground floor, who has 3 people and how they are the awesome helpers of Lugosi, such as in this movie, never explain much. <br /> <br /> So a female journalist was able to Assigned by her voice Fix tool to find out where every stolen bride is going. One of the most common things in the stolen bride is the rare orchid found in them. She then asked around and was told that there are world-famous orchid experts living near experts. This person is creepy, Dr. Lorenz. She quickly follows him quickly and makes his small house horrible. I'm not sure where the police are in this period. But they came to mop after the journalists did all the dirty work. <br /> <br /> Looks like Lugosi's movie often has an unnecessary nonsense plot that makes everything stink to heaven. High class. I mean, the famous orchid experts around the world kidnapped the bride by delivering doped drugs. He knew himself as an orchid. D'OH! <br /> <br /> Later, it was revealed that the girl did not need to be a bride for the work process. So why did Lugosi kidnap the bride from the church? Was heavily protected for his experiments and created Interest and news topics of all newspapers? Why not just holding a prostitute outside the street like a strange spoil? This gangster reminds me of another Lugosi stinker "The Bat Bat" .... The stupid plot line and bad performances and The silly journalist is the same - he's creepy and scary enough to make you interested, at least enough to watch him. The woman who plays as a journalist is a terrible actor ... She doesn't have any emotions. Just send the script like a machine gun Spraying out as fast as possible. Others are very beautiful as well as being good actors. <br /> <br /> But this thing can be watched if only for Bela LugosiLugosi fans. Always like that Even when the picture is a dog, he must know for sure that he is doing a bad image, but maybe he also knows that if he gives everything he has a little intensity, it may shine through bad plans and bad performances. Around him. <br /> <br /> And he is right. ---- We, horror fans, will always have love for Bela Lugosi. He always gives him everything. He was in front of the camera. We gave two f ** ks to you Bela.
