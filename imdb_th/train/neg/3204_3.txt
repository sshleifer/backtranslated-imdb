Although not as bad as it used to be (I've seen a lot worse.) This is a very weak movie. In general, the new improvement of "Coogan Bluff" of Siegel, with a significant difference, is that Clint Eastwood's hat is more attractive than both Joe Don Baker, an actor that is not interesting if it exists. <br /> <br /> Is a good thing (and a lot of fun) as a bad guy, Vittorio Gassman. Budget. He is the main reason to have squatting while other actors deliver a terrible performance, especially the bad old Rossano Brazzi girl. Will believe that he was the leader Romantic (see "Mondo Cane" to see that he ran away from women). Look here like Ben Gazzara. Second level. He doesn't do anything. It was all the performances of Joe Don. Unfortunately, and all of them scored for the song. "Action movie" in the 80s that is no longer boring. <br /> <br /> Greydon Clark can create a B-good movie ("No warning") but here he travels. Rest his nose and lose three teeth At least the location of Malta is good and there is Venantini to try to save lives. 3/10
