I was really disappointed with this movie. It started really well and created a good atmosphere and suspense. But when finally having the "monster" finally revealed ... it turned out to be a psychopath that has skin problems ...... again boo-de-do another story is a nutjob movie ... just like us There is not enough of them. <br /> <br /> For justice, "Creeps" are truly insecure and the way they move and weird sounds, they make it look creepy. But I'm tired of renting a movie like this, only to find that the monster is a human, even if it is a crazy, crazy animal. When I saw that I told the story Early on, I was hoping to get a hybrid creature between mice and monsters ... It was like this when releasing a creep. <br /> <br /> At the top of some things in this movie is no reason. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why does Creep kill Security Guard? What is the point that goes beyond the excellent honking registration that says "Hello, I'm a psychologist and I'm here!"? It's stupid and seems to happen just to prevent Franka Potente's character from getting help. <br /> <br /> What hell is he eating there? I received the impression that he installed effectively and only had an unexpected turn in the tunnel, causing him to loose ... so he chewed the mouse all the time and if so, why did they surround him so much? ? Why did he kill so hard? He was thin, gaunt, and not at the highest performance ... but it seems to be continuing, even if the injury is equivalent to those who are non-psychotic characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> DVD commentary tells us. that Intended to sympathize with Creep, but I just found him disgusting This film is powerful enough. But it loses many opportunities that make me sick
