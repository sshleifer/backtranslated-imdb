This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen *! It's not good even at the standard level of TV movies. The plot has a brutal flaw and the name that is known in this film is lost to the characters that are confused and uncertain. I don't know how the director will handle the movie's excuse - it's terrible. 'Psychological horror horror' - it's absolutely scary. There's nothing exciting about it. And it can destroy your heart! The first opening scene has such a promise - the action that is possible that the soul is just part of the brain or not. But the most chaos that follows the car scene is beyond belief No matter how hard you try, you don't care about fewer characters. There are many ideas that make this film a collage of phrases that are not linked from Chinese philosophers and the worst that this movie will cause you to use a dead brain. <br /> <br /> I Buy more than 300 movies on DVD and this is the first time I get a refund. Steer CLEAR
