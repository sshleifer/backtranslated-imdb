This list is terrible. The jokes are terrible and worse. I am one of those people who have never been a big fan of Corner Gas. But at least I liked it at first until it entered the second round of the season. All the jokes were played out, and the characters had nothing for them at least. Corner Gas was good at first. Fear that nothing happened in episode 1 Who is the person who is watching this program? I'm really honest. Or maybe just someone who lives on the grassland? May be a joke for them and they work there? I do not know the one who likes this show and cannot stand on its own. All comedy can be predicted and the characters are less developed in the Corner Gas. Hopefully it will not be long because the success of this performance seems to me to be based on the location of this performance. It is a Muslim which is different and may / should lead to a great performance.
