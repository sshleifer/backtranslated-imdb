It is difficult to find any positive results in this movie. It seems that the producers have to make money without much effort, so we are treated to the full range of Galaxy, which is the worst excuse for movies in history. The female police look super sexy in their small uniforms. The more action shots of the two policemen & the lesser galaxies are the way to go. Of course, to increase the budget, so they decided to fill the gap with the screenings again. Ms Albright looked sexy and her performance was excellent. Ms Stabs I had heard But never saw the screen before, it seemed very satisfying But seems to lack the basic acting ability, apart from Ms Albright, is still a real waste
