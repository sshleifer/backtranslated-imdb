Unfortunately for me, Busby Berkeley's first film that I used to watch was "42nd Street". Then I expected that everything would be good. I find that it doesn't have to be like that, even here with my favorite classic actors. James Cagney <br /> <br /> Oh, the musical numbers at the end look impressive, but that story. Like others and quite boring They seem to be involved with the producers, screaming and not always happy. In this movie, it is Cagney, who ends up shouting out often, causing me a headache after a moment and his character is slim .... fast! <br /> <br /> Even the music in here is near everywhere. "42nd floor, the song that you can hum for many years and dozens of years. I should say that The songs in this movie are not memorable. No, this is one of the few things in the beginning of the movie Cagney - and Berkeley's movies - I don't like and feel very disappointed with watching.
