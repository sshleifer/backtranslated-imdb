It seems that this movie was created by someone who has a good idea. But never made a movie before and never thought that the script should be edited or funny When I watched this movie, I saw it for John Kandy and assumed that it wasn't that hilarious. But with a stupid plot about mind control and an unsightly moment And above all, Candy sent the roughest line I had heard until that time. So even with handsome ideas and funny stories But we still have a skilled and rude movie that might be too stupid for general adults. It's really a shame - it's probably much better. I mean by Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy. It should be great.
