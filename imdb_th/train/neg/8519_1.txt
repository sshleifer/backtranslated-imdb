I went to see this movie, according to a review by Siskel and Ebert; Not only will I be trapped only But also brought friends and had to spend the rest of the day to apologize to them so much that they had to sit aimlessly crap After this, I have never been to the movie in accordance with the advice of Siskel & Ebert solely.
