Yes, there are great performances here. Unfortunately they happened in the context of a movie that seemed to be unaware of what was being done in the first 45-60 minutes of this song. Suddenly, about an hour, the characters that until this point had talked together, began to sing to each other. In order to get more confusion, things that were far away then they made conversations through the conversation for about 15 minutes, then seemed to leave that idea and move on to other things, such as numbers that started in the jazz club too Two electric drummers and guitars become completely prepared parts with an invisible string. Above all, in the way of using music is the ambiguity of the author in writing songs in a predictable style. While the first pair of parts mimics the sounds of motor vehicles in the 1950s, the rest of the film is just a Broadway musical performance (not good). Then there is a pure purity example of the group that imitated. The bad Jackson family and Eddie Murphy were turning from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie when he started cursing Stevie Wonder. I couldn't help laughing out loud. The film is one that makes me feel that I have very little time in the world and I was not happy at the time to see this movie for two hours.
