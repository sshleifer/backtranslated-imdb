This film has the longest ending, suffering and suffering the most of any movie I've seen for a long time. Unfortunately it started immediately after opening the credit. In January, Jones gave a wooden performance. I was surprised that she didn't get flared when she approached the candle in the movie. I can't remember you from the other movies that you do (I have to believe I never criticized the actors of the actors because in movies there are many things that may affect it. But in this case it's very bad for it Distinguished from the ATROCIOUS script, in fact, she received the genre and situation that Meryl Streep would have in trouble, but I sometimes swear she read from Cupid cards. For the true story, the plot, the conversation and the pacing are terrible as you've seen. But there is no excuse for this performance, or for the director who let it get angry, I feel sorry for the other actors. The little Indians / breakfast clubs were pushed into rotten burrito. Came back to regurgitate by the director of the school director, brought back here with crayola management studios all over
