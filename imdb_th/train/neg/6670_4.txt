This movie really started. It has the potential to become a romantic and captivating love story with movies that record the love between "Harlan" and Tobe in the long scenes, poetry and beauty. It doesn't have to be anything more than that, and for a moment there I was excited that finally there was a beautiful movie maker for myself, timeless classic, perhaps a modern legend. Why Oh, why make it halfway through the creation of a lead character (Norton), another psychopath? Maybe I miss this point. But do we want another movie about Psychos? Or the need in Hollywood to show the sick side of human nature that indicates a common illness in the film industry? For a moment I will write the director's name. Now I don't care. At least it should add to the protection of movies that all actors seem to invest in their roles. In addition, Ivan Rachel Wood is very cute to look at and is a potent actress.
