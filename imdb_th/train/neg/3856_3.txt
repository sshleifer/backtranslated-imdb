"A Guy Thing" tries to capture the feelings of "There Something About Mary" or "Meet the Parents" but it turns out that it was cut from the cut-out room of both films. Fortunately, I rented it for a 5-day rental because I couldn't sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> The location is in good condition and I like the scenes that others automatically hide Paul's mistake (the investigator at Save-mart is great) but the scripting is terrible. The conversation is still all the time and when you think that things will eventually be tracked in an unnecessary eye - stuck in there is no reason. There are also a number of jokes that are needed in one movie. <br /> <br /> Don't be misunderstood. The joke is a great story when it is done smartly like in other movies that I say. Unfortunately, I love Julia Stiles (ten things I hate about you are great), but even then I couldn't help me sit and watch this movie. Save your money and go to rent "Something about Mary" again
