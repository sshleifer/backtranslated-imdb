Fishbourne's performance (which looks like some funny jokes) and (short-lived) Ed Harris is an amazing person who is different from Connery who does not appear in his role and ends up in 80yr old man's behavior, in fact, the screenplay is not reasonable. Imagine 60 minutes ending the plot happiness plus the appendix suddenly opened without any argument structure in relation to the character. It is an accident rather than a screenplay and may be good for the purpose of the screen of the wrestler's school. The more you remind, the more impressive this will be. The death penalty is not an issue here, even if it is an issue from the beginning. It faded without further comment. Topics and environments should be good.
