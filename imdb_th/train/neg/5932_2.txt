What kind of documentary about musicians who failed to combine a single track by the artist himself! Unlike "Ray" or countless other movies about artists, half of the fun in the theater (or on the sofa) is to enjoy their own wonderful music. Here, every track is covered by unattractive characters and these repeated performances failed to capture Cohen's slow and lively style. Often the blanket is a bad folk song. Yuck <br /> <br /> More interviews with musicians and other people than Cohen himself. This movie is not just Cohen reading his own work. (Not singing) - such as letters, poems, etc. This film is not very involved in the story of the artist's life or about his development over the years The big disappointment for Cohen fans
