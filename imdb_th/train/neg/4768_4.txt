I stumbled on the Nine Dead recently and read the current criticism that I think I can handle the movie on average. However, this movie is slightly below average. But can watch The script was poorly written and the average performance for the B-level movies with good-looking couples Saw's border plot teaches people what they do wrong in the situation and tries to make them more appreciative of life. But that is true that the comparison ends Nine dead people try to have a heart and a purpose behind a simple concept that is not new. The main offense I found on Nine Dead is to hit the audience's face. The events that occurred 3 minutes earlier in this movie and not totally necessary and the ending is not enough that people will not see. Clear, I have seen movies that are worse than before, and even though they did not end this matter badly. Valuable flick, poor performances and ending, though ...
