This is one of the worst movies ever. When Kate appeared and Jed was with a group of people and they began to clap ... Another bad Hollywood scene is when Kate is running on the sidewalk. Andie's show was terrible in this movie - I couldn't connect with them or felt that there was love. However, the other two women are very good and obscure Andie. However, this is a movie full of people. I always like this type of movie. But I can't get into this movie The situation is not too much and Andie's performance again didn't help the movie. In addition, she is all gums. Lancome will have to makeup with a knife because she looks attractive in the commercial.
