This is a truly bad movie. The character "Cole", played by Michael Moriarty, is the biggest reason that the actor feels that the actor feels that drawing an awkward painting of the South. Incredibly will make this character more evil. After about 20 minutes, I want the speech therapist to appear. This will add sincerity. <br /> <br /> - 1) Bad actions - 2) Characters that disagree - 3) Thin line /> <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br />
