Where to start ... If this movie is a comedy, I will say that it is FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me and anyone with free time and enough money (I think that's the price I paid from Wal-Mart). This movie is meant to be the THRILL thriller. The only thing I get is to see Kirkland's brutal actions. To Anne Wilkes from suffering in a snowy forest area If you want a good laugh on a Friday night with some friends, I recommend this movie. But if you want to see something at least half way, then good, don't bother. <br /> <br /> I'm for one, enjoying crappy movies that are worse in most cases, but wow ... I mean wow !! The only one in all movies that doesn't smell is the little boy played by Vincent Berry. The only reason I gave 3 stars is because it gave me something.
