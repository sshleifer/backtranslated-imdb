If another Hitler had happened, it would be a grateful part, like this movie, which disseminated ridiculous thoughts that he was obviously insane from the beginning. Far from following the person and choosing him to hold the highest position in the land, people who are conscious will cross the road to avoid him and he must die in a ditch without a name and nobody knows. <br /> <br /> Anyone reading a story about Hitler's close companion - the autobiography of Traudl Junge, his secretary - will be hit by the fact that people find him kind and generous. In addition, he is a great speaker and the fact that his speeches are melodious and bragging with modern ears, ignoring the time they do when posing is normal in political speeches. As well as exaggerating anti-Semitism, which is not the central board of the early Nazis - which is mostly anti-communist - and sometimes not unusual or unusual The movie makes it seem that Hitler's ambition from the beginning was a disaster. <br /> <br /> If you want to identify the next person that will cause the deaths of tens of millions of people. One life here Looking for a charming and charming person whose appealing words inspire the whole nation and the political work that is useful and clear to the country. I am afraid that his personality will be more like Barack Obama than Fred Phelps. '<br /> <br /> I hope so much and nothing but a caricature. Stupid people who do this cause crime against reality. This is a history equivalent to 'Reefer Madness'.
