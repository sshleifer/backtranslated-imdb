I watched many horror movies. (Or at least they try to be) and this must be the worst movie, if not the 2nd worst movie that I have to make myself try to watch I never knew the depth of Masacism until I rented this cheese in the contraceptive latex used. I'm a fan of Julian Sans, but it's worse than I expected for him. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the story is brilliant and I was amazed ... in the first half of the minute. Accumulated credit and I haven't seen the pain seem like the first hand. Maybe there are some viewers who like this and can point me in the right direction. But then again, I realized that those audiences who understood if not remembering me, especially when we had to close the video and that was not finished. With our view (We have to make one exception clearly) <br /> <br /> If it's a remake, I'll give you the opportunity as long as they contribute the most 1% of the original. That's all.
