I will not rate this movie. But not worth it I watched it just because I was a Pfieffer fan. I love you and will watch everything you do. Even in a fool, she doesn't disappoint. Every scene that has her in there makes the audience watch ... wait ... for something to happen. But nothing to do It has a good story. But they ended immediately as some other characters began to have potential. But nothing happened. <br /> <br /> Pfieffer is 29 years old when she made this movie and made her the most cute. The wardrobe and the scene were surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> I can see most things and rarely see movies. I can't find anything like this. But this is a stupid thing. I don't understand. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about it all is the big cliff at the end. It has an ending scene that wakes you up and wow. Finally, this movie is about to happen. Good grief. <br /> <br /> I agree with the review that says. 99 will buy 3 cans of cat food and watch my cat eating will be even more exciting. Speaking well. In fact, the comments are more fun than movies because it sums up very well. I wasted too much 0.99 cents for this dud.dud.dud
