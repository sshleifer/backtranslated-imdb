Let me be clear about this movie. I didn't watch this movie because of the plot. I watched this movie for a cheeky sex scene. Which was said that this movie is very good, God condemned me to turn between the pure happiness of seeing the figure in the god of Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and throwing my eyes out for a disaster from the plot The first scene of this movie makes me cringe .. You see women drawing some pictures on the lake in pure and quiet happiness. Then the beautiful girl approached and asked if she could paint her side. When they were both finished, they showed what they had done ... and the girl painted VINEYARD when she saw the lake's face. What kind of ball director did this kind of mistake? In another scene, Tracy kills the lover of the teacher by smashing him with a boat pole, and then she swims and doesn't have any police officers in the city. Wait? Her will is above everyone's boat !! After that, it's the worst. Whenever Mandy is nearby, there will be a "cool" effect that plays like a female cat. It is also a shame for Rosanna Arquette in this movie. I am really sorry that she has to perform in this extremely cheap porn movie. Likewise, for JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who is unlucky to star in this movie, all in every 2/10
