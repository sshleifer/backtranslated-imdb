This movie is not a joke. It uses the D&D nerd scheme and extends them. All the main characters do less than 30k per year. They all live with their parents. They all socialize. A scary and unimaginative joke, like two gamers who were hit by a black dwarf because one of them had a KKK hat that was looking Funny. He's a fool. So he doesn't know about sports.) You may have to be a high school student to find this funny. The cynicism that is not good is very painful. I feel sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I guess this is the only chance to get through their important moments.
