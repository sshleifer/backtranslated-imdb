<br /> <br /> The worst <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this remake? (In addition to changing to 90 minutes for movie soundtrack)? Zombies that * run * ??? I guess the director has never watched the original "Dead" movie, which shows the hardened creatures. (From the brutality) The animals that shuffled / shambling to their lives The boat in the marina is just Steve's. <br /> <br /> 1/10
