Director F.W. Murnau was cleverly attached to the media silently. He knew that he would cover the life of a native islander in the South Sea. Documentary style works very well in the first half of the movie. Beautiful landscapes and daily activities of interesting islanders to watch. This film loses momentum. But when it became more focused on the story of two lovers The story has never been interesting, even though being well-managed. Murnau has won the Academy Award for Best Film, although the award may be the best scenery. You can't give DP credit with taking pictures in such a beautiful place.
