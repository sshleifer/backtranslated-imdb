Do not spend your money or time in this pathetic movie in the mask of the movie. When every third word is devoted to an inappropriate language and there is no real plot. Performing the same day from the past and not having much development in their careers to say I expect better things from the actors who have won Benicio Del Toro. Vision that others may have Puertorricans Will be permanently distorted by trash, such as the Maldeamores. The rough words at a certain time in the movie may be used to emphasize a given perspective and may be funny or sad depending on its context (See the movie trailer of Elsa and Fred) but should not absorb the story. This movie is very embarrassing and there is nothing funny or cute about this movie.
