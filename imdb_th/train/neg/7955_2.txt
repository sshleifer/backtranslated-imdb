Carrie Fisher said more than once that she had done this movie during her life when she had a hard cocaine problem and she couldn't remember much. That will explain why she created this movie. But it does not explain why others in the actors or teams do I can't believe that everyone has a coke problem. This is one of the worst movies ever. The penalty cannot be placed on the feet of "superintendent" Tim Kincaid or "writer" Buddy Giovinazzo because it is clear that this image is not written or directed by anyone. Obviously it happens naturally because there is little evidence about consistency, consistency, design, plot, feeling, intelligence or anything else. The really amazing thing is that there are some experts involved in doing this. Robert Joy, who works well in other films and songwriter Jimmie Haskell and film actor Arthur Marks, is both a veteran in the industry. Mark is also a director, but not bad. Why are they involved in the garbage dump? This machine is too much to understand. Tim Kincaid, the alleged director, has made sci-fi and horror movies for rent, and from seeing them most I can tell you not to use One great Although this is the worst thing he has ever done and that is a major achievement in his part. Everything about this movie is the 12th rate - the best. This movie is terrible. The show is ridiculous. "Special effects" make "Plan 9 from the outside world" seem "Spiderman". Such stories are ridiculous and ridiculous. Don't waste time even looking at the video box. The most complete, loud and loud
