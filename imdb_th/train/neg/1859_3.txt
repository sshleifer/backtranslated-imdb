This boy makes me fooled. I honestly thought that it would be a horror movie full of humor without any matter at all. The boy I received a cold shoulder at that time. This movie is real and I can speak really well. It's not scary. But the kindness and humor turned out to be really crazy. This movie is interesting. Scary performances and some genocide are very painful to watch. I almost laughed how bad it was. But sometimes I enjoy it All killings involve snow and Christmas sports, which make things even more interesting. The POV camera angle is excellent. <br /> <br /> This film is about a viscous killer who died from a car accident with a truck. Chemistry while being sent to prison After that, he resurrected the very same chemical with snow spliced ​​into the mixture. These are the ingredients that have been chosen for the perfect killer snowman. He's more than taking revenge as the snowman, the police officer, convicted him. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad role, such as Christopher Alport, which is a joke. I would say that I was quite disappointed that the film was not a horror movie. But actually is a dark sitcom They have a great story with a good plot. But it is not correct Overall, I like the first movie. But now it's really annoying But this movie is better and darker than the sequel
