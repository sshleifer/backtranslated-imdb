Today I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood created a movie from one of the darkest days in our country. 911 changed everything. It changed our perception of safety. It changed our understanding of human and human evil. The most important and destructive thing is to change our world. <br /> <br /> However, I cannot stress that the most disgusting, indifferent and most angry thing is. From death and destruction This movie and people who like this genre will cause controversy between viewers and critics. Of course, most will be reflected by the mainstream media. Hollywood plunged to a new low level. Even lower than the low-damned, the most vicious acts of barbarism and cruelty that do not allow Behind all is Uwe Boll. I'm very angry with this film. How can they dare to insult the memory of a lost family? They dare to mimic the lives of brave men and women who risked their lives to help those trapped in the tower on the day of the infamous destiny?!?!? They dare to try to be sarcastic and at the same time take advantage of the national tragedy in the fog of sadness and fatigue of the post-911 world!?!?!?! How ... brave ... are they? <br /> <br /> For those who have the courage to even think of seeing this terrible moral imitation, I say this with a strong heart with all my strength: Remember to think back in That day and ask yourself whether you are a conscious and moral person or not. Think back on that day, asking yourself if this movie is embarrassing and disgraceful for the life that disappeared that day. Imagine going back to the days of the rioting of your loved ones family. Think back on that day of the lost life with the two planes. Think back to the next killings that occurred after the attack. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself if you have a soul. <br /> <br /> Think about respecting the memory of your lost life. In 911 without watching this movie
