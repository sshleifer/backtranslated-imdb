Very good story. Excited ... but the last 10 seconds destroyed the whole movie ... What happened? Made out very well and a good story was destroyed in the last few seconds ... sorry to say but 1 vote ... That's what is right. I think Chris Shadley might end up better. .. but maybe next time :) What does the meaningless blood all be worth? In the end, the story will be close to 10. But it's not .... Finally, breaking the whole story, I think most people aren't weak, and when they go to the movies, you want to end well, even though it's complicated ... Only weak people here are the end ... sorry
