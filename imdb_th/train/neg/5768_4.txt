At first I was excited to download the open source movie which was destroyed by the demo reel. The animation is great. The lip synchronization is terrible and you still watch the movie, hoping to understand what happened You don't feel the emotions of the characters only. Unfortunately for the creators who waste time I watched a short film that has twice the mood in half time! This may be a great short film if they just take the time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone at Blender is excited to show their software and display capabilities. But telling the story of those apologies is what makes the movie
