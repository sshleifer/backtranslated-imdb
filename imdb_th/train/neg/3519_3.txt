There are some Stallone movies that I like. But this movie does not meet my expectations I found this movie difficult to believe. For example, a group of terrorists who hit the ground in the wilderness prepared to survive for at least two days. In addition, in the Stallone forest, the company continues to run across bridges and stairs that provide shortcuts or convenient plots. In addition, the Treasury seems to not coordinate with local helpers. In addition, the bad guys who can't attack the barn with high-tech automatic weapons are looking for <br /> <br /> I like John Lithgow's villain. At first, ignoring his own bad guy or being killed Finally, I don't want to believe the characters anymore. <br /> <br /> Not worth the price of the rental.
