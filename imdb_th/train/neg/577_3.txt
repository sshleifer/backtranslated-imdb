First of all, Jon Bon Jovi doesn't seem to be in the vampire movie. When combined with other interesting characters and bad stories, the whole movie is predictable. If you remember and you are a total vampire movie fan, you can enjoy some scenes. Don't expect the Tarantino style script here and the story of Annice. (I expect to forget the whole movie tomorrow)
