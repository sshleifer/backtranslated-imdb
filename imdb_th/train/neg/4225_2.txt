This movie is another Christian propaganda movie in The Omega Code, whether it's a bad thing. But for the fact that most propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the messages they want to deliver If you enjoy drawing foam of street life and the way the Gospel can change lives, maybe you enjoy this movie. I say save your money and rent The Cross and The Switchblade or The Mission. The Christian director will learn that sometimes people speak rough words. It was frustrating to see a criminal who was not allowed to swear. (Criminals say rude words) and flat characters that I can't relate to And it would be good if this film shows some terms and conditions Now is what I want to pay to see. Who is the one who discovers the film's wafer story with The Boondock Saints and The Sting?
