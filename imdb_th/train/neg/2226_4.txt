The DD movie is a stupid story and has a storyline that looks like a thin wafer. In those days, they were at least a plot. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't just a comedy. But it is a combination of romantic love. <Br /> <br /> Every drama scene is wrong. <br /> <br /> Funny movies, but too repetitive. But this movie gets you entertained. In those days, Govinda's movie was very loud, but they were funny. The time when people are happy. <br /> <br /> David Dhawan works well. The music is ok. <br /> <br /> Govinda performs well in both comedy and drama. Karisma is good in the part and The nuisance in Kader is normal. Gulshan, Prem Chopra is typecast. Shakti is hilarious.
