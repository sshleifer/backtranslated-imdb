Here again is the movie Diane Lane, another story that she cheated on her husband. Is this the only role that you know how to play? This time it was set up in 1969 and she deceived her husband with a shirt. I was not surprised because it was very predictable. Then her husband was angry and threw milk. I won't be surprised if you sleep with the milkman as well. I won't be surprised if you sleep with ice cream too because this is a very boring movie. Then, after throwing, she apologized and saw the shirt again, then, as she was doing with him, her son would be punched by a wasp. My mother always told me not to throw stones at the nest. This child mother didn't have time to tell him that she was too busy with the shirt.
