Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I felt that he sold out in order to take a leading role in the big budget. Foxx followed in the footsteps of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who saw their abilities lost by a fixed manufacturer. Who thinks that black men who commit beautiful crimes are funny concepts (see: Money Talks, Blue Streak). <br /> <br /> Okay, I laughed a couple of times and all these comedians are still playing. hilarious But I like to see these people separating Ala Marlon Wayans, drawing in the Requiem, Dreams or in Tommy Davidson's Living Color and Damon Wayans to move the performances in Spike Lee's satirical work.
