This movie is terrible. Not offensive But can be very predictable This film follows the life of a small town family. In the mid-60s, the father, the headmaster of the school, was experiencing a mid-life crisis. Enter a cute teacher from a big city that starts to challenge students' thoughts with thought-provoking things such as thinking by themselves. The headmaster does not agree with her teaching, but she is beautiful. You can connect to various points. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick) is tired of life in a small town and wants to live. She received bad advice, went out with the bad boy and apparently the family planning was not taught at her school. Shocking! When seeing that director Paul Shapiro worked mostly on TV, this movie played like an adult drama after school or a very special episode of a sitcom.
