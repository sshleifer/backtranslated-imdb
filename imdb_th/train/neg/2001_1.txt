Why are there so many people coming in the evening to perform Roberto Moreira's "Up Against Them All" ("Contra Todos") at the San Francisco Film Festival? "It's a killer story," my friend said, "Hmm ... and it's a Brazilian." I add people of various colors, beautiful, tropical air, lush rhythms and a hip gangster plot? There is no doubt that many temptations. <br /> <br /> Some people forget to tell a little detail: this is a very bad movie, very scary and it doesn't look as good as it does. br /> <br So "Contra Todos" on this planet has built around Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, many small local festivals and now San Francisco? Obviously, due to the promotion process and the film festival cycle, <br /> <br /> First of all, it won the Rio Film Festival, which is known as the Brazilian Film of the Year. It must be a bad year. They are a lot better. Then the movie, a short story in the catalog, including rumors that led to the crowded auditorium, and because the film was not presented anywhere and to avoid close scrutiny from Criticism - it continues According to promotions, sometimes it is very goose. A festival in Chicago called "Contra Todos" "a speedball cocktail that shot straight out of Brazil" and called Claudia's boyfriend as "The core of the slum-like neighborhood" Soninha is "Teodoro's teenage daughter with growing sex." The film is "Filmed with the urgency of mobile cameras often," and the director "working with real frustration and obviousness from despair and decay in the country" The result is "raw and unbelievably honest" and This film drew to the conclusion that ended with death. Not the best writing But of course, adding excitement to some potential audiences. <br /> <br /> "Contra Todos" involves two killer men. Actually, wife and daughter and The Christian girlfriend, it was shot - in an amazingly ugly digital video without the ability behind the camera work - mostly in a suburb that looked inferior, barren rather than in one of the "favelas" or Brazilian cities like villages This great movie, "Black Orpheus", "Pixote" and "City of God" was created and not in Rio at this time, but Sao Paulo <br /> <br /> The killer with family problems is Teodoro. (Giulio Lopez) and ask The partner with drug problems is Waldomiro (Ailtan Graça). Both actors have a little TV experience, just like the actress who plays the blonde wife of Teodoro Cláudia (Leona Cavalli) and Silvia Lorenço. Soninha's daughter, who is ready to protest These actors may make it through the rear corner of a few times. Who knows? - In better directed movies, they may do well. Apart from them, there were some young men who were hit by Teodoro or when he was busy gangs of gangsters. The employer did not appear much, although the camera expanded their pores. <br /> <br /> Two observers, one at the Berlin festival and another in London, saw the failure of the film. Buried in a remote area of ​​the site, Henry Sheehan observes from Berlin that "movies" (his words) are "the worst videos". "The filmmakers seem to choose a video just because it's the right choice. Filming a movie, "Sheehan wrote," and still didn't take advantage of this new media "- and he added, not doing anything else creatively. /> <br /> Chihan pointed out the big mistake. Under The first movie of this movie: "Beginning as a local drama that should start when half an hour of action. Moreira reveals that his father and friends are professional. Men, waiting for thirty minutes, didn't add anything to the movie. It seemed like a completely arbitrary decision and at least wasted time. But ratcheting was something that Moreira had done like a small child who received a set of tools. For his birthday and around, fight everything in the eye without touching the reason or the "destructive but true skill" <br /> Writing about the 2004 London festival for Kamera.com, Metin Alsanjak Trying to look at the positive side However, still lacking qualifications to restore performances The best qualities "Yes, it's very easy because everything is not good. Alsanjak acknowledges that" accounts with low budgets, violence and irrationality of unlawful people in Sao Paulo are without any favorite character and result. To cause hope, darkness and disdain for the human narrative Not helping bad subtitles .. "Alsanjak is connecting Contra Todos with" Dogme "and Mike Leigh doesn't help. <br /> <br /> In addition to the first half hour that doesn't mean nothing. To compensate for the boredom of waiting for the first violent action - which, when they came only "Fighting everything in the eye without touching the reason or ability" - Moreira looks up at the end of the episode by adding what appears to be the final scene after that, followed by an unbelievable final scene. The characters will marry No doubt that the director wants to show "The evil of evil" of low-level people in the working class neighborhood But he couldn't create the characters he saw in general, come to life for us And the structure of the film shows that he is unable to edit his content. <br /> <br /> (seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 28, 2005)
