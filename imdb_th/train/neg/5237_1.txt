One, if not the worst movie to come out of England in the 80s. <br /> <br /> The story of the chaos of middle-aged lazy people. 'Seduce' two teenage scrubs who take care of him and his wife. His courtesy has nothing to redeem. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there is no value. The movie is ridiculous, innocent and unrealistic. This movie dives deep as it fails pitifully in an attempt to be a provocative, intellectual and controversial comedy. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst thing about it. With this movie is the way that the strong actors of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran have been completely sewn by such weak scripts It is not surprising that this is the only tip of Andrea Dunbar to make it appear on the screen. Complete the garbage collection at all levels.
