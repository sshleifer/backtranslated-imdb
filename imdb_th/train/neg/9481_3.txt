James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to 'mental illness treatment' to receive medical treatment with Dr. McCort (Bruce Pennes) There he realized that many trainees were killed by 'The Ripper', which brought their spirits to the cult demons that were promoted by Dr. McCormick, this story is ridiculous and ridiculous so it is impossible to write a summary. The dialogue is ridiculous, especially when the character of Helen's fiancé, James Bishop, arrives at an asylum that is almost unbelievable that the writer will have the courage to include it in the script And about the return of James at the hospital to bring the files of the dead And actors, consisting of actors and actors Ham? Honestly, I don't know what or who is the worst person in this movie: screenplay, director or actor. The correct answer, of course, is all of them. I saw this flick on cable TV and I was amazed how the producers could spend money on garbage. This horror movie became very funny when considering the nonsense of the story. My score is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): `Demônio '(` Devil')
