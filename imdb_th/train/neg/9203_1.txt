Many people like to point to this TV movie when arguing with the many legions of Hank-Fires that actually make Tom a really crappy movie (I think "Bachelor party" is good. The movie focuses on "Dungeon and Dragon style game" which ultimately pushed our young gums into a psychedelic madness. The story has a fascination in the early 1980s, focusing on the threat to our youth caused by evil role-playing games. <br /> <br /> However, I like watching "Mazes and Monsters" as a point Change, pointing to "what happened to Chris Makepeace" story, we all remember him as 'Rudy the Rabbit' in "Meatballs" and as Clifford in "My bodyguard", where he gives excitement to all of us (Especially those of us who read "Dynamite!" Regularly) that there are many good things waiting for him. <br /> <br /> Rona Jaffe comes to the line between bad performances and bad writing. So thin, so I let you decide that Makepeace's performance is the fault of anyone. All I know is that the last big release I saw him was "Vamp" and that was 1986. He played a small role as Sean Penn's brother in "Falcon and the Snowman" but at that time Forward to others with a straight hair style and better flashes. <br /> <br /> I can't be guilty of introducing this movie. See if only to see Chris Makepeace, who is more younger than ideal before Rona Jaffe celebrates with his spirit.
