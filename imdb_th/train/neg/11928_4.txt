The life of the Saints begins with the vision of London's atmosphere as a bustling city of busy streets and exotic sunlight. I hope it will preserve this atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Othello works for Mr Carva Fat Yai, Mr. Fat, his father-in-crime (at least I think that is What he was supposed to be because he had never really defined, but he put a kitten in a cage that had deep fat. One of his colleagues is an enthusiastic black runner who runs from A to B until the day he meets a nearly homeless boy. The runner-up left the boy who disappeared in Otello's flat, which he immediately began to desire. There is a desire to follow his own wishes. Karva causes the kidnapped child. But he wasn't sure what would make him happy Is it the innocence of being a child again or is another hand job? Either way, I don't want to see the little boy giving him the second right. <br /> <br /> It takes a long time to get there and there are many repetitive scenes. But due to the lack of stories behind the investment in these characters, it serves as a launch for a weary audience. <br /> <br /> Terry Grisoni's favorite writer, Terry Gil Liam Trying to blend in the allegory of some religions that become pretentious like all hell. Ironically If he makes us more easily accessible, or at least has a better explanation for the characters that are acting strange, it would be a fun movie. As it was, we were introduced to a crowd of annoying sounds that seemed like a miracle to develop intelligence when confronted with a mysterious boy. Who's origin has never been revealed? That's just an ordinary irritation! <br /> <br /> In addition to the moments of the atmosphere and the mood score, this movie has little introduction.
