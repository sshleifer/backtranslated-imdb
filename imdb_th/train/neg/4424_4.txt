Uh oh! Another gay movie This time it shows the black side Bet your final dollar, it will end up unhappy! But why, with the exception of less than half a dozen gay movies, all things must end with death or the last scene of "Addio". Or a woman must die or ride alone in forgiveness Why in the name of God must have writers, directors and producers let the audience leave the theater until they feel depressed? In the end, it should be gay ... maybe the category should be changed to 'glum'. Most gay relationships are high and spouses will ride together at sunset! Regardless of the author or producer, he will only show the bottom of gay life. This movie proves my point. If you rent a DVD, try a sedative because the movie 'Gay' comes again! This is wrong!
