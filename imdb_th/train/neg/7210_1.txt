Once again, Disney can create a movie for children without ignoring the background of it. About the only thing that is common to this and the original gadget cartoon is the name The most obvious mistake is the character - Penny doesn't have her book, the brain has been dropped from the character that is a fancy pole. The claw is more than an evil villain, etc., but more than that. The horrors start from the first minute of this film. Having a gadget as a security officer named John Brown doesn't help to identify him as a traditional investigator. And at first we saw Disney's clear efforts to turn everything into a love story between men and women - they introduced Brenda, who created the film to be compatible with Disney only. Add the fact that "Claw" seen in this film and Dr Claw classic is opposite diagonally and you will see that this thing is close to the original story. Things that will help the story better to replace it - but when you guess, Disney also fails. All movies are just devices that act silly for the sake of foolishness and greed after Brenda. As if adding insult to the injured, Disney introduced the "new" gadgetmobile - it didn't look like a function or thought like an old gadgetmobile. It's just a number. "Comic Relief" is accepted. Clearly, Disney has acknowledged that the gadgets of the gadget are funny, so they make this movie a joke as well. But they took out all the funny gags (Such as the paper assigned to the head bomb) Gadgetmobile is smart and shows "Claw". Some people should tell Disney that "Movies for children" does not necessarily mean "lack of complete brain use". Gadgets should be targeted for children aged 10-12 years ... not children aged 10-12 months like this movie. Regardless of what the film is like, it doesn't repeat. The gadget of the real investigator. Because i love old gadgets i hate this thing
