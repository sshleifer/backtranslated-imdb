We now have one more screenplay. There are many worth watching, even if there is a tired sexual reversal. However, this is not possible. In previous reviews, I thought I had pointed out the general entertainment decline for Haim movies that followed in the late 80s. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> 'Just One of the Girls' story is about high school children. (Corey Haim) trying to avoid bullying by dressing up as a girl He joined the cheerleading team and became friends with fellow cheerleader Marie (Nicole Eggert). Obviously he couldn't keep track of the puzzle for too long. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is the most nonsense. And it's not funny But judging by most comments, it seems that fans of Alanis Morrisette or Nicole Eggert, the sex queen, are the only ones who want to watch. If you are looking for a good Haim property (Or role-play comedy) Do not look far beyond 1989. This is where Haim's career goes.
