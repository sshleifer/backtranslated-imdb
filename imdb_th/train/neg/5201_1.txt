This story has been seen before. But that doesn't matter if you can figure out the right storyboard. Obviously, the director has not spent time working on the storyboard. In addition to this, the camera technician also spent too much time tilting the angle that did not match the text of the movie. However, the most fun thing is if you look at the movie's website, you can read that it has a purpose that the director chose to create a movie with a bad camera angle. Because it reminds us about hunting But I have never heard of hunting with bad camera angles ;-) It will have 1 star because the story is ok. It's a shame that Ti West didn't spend more time reviewing his story. As if the movie is more important than planning Because you don't have a camera that means you should create a movie immediately ... everyone can make a movie. But not everything is as good as this So the advice for Ti West is: Stop and label what you want. Take your time to start planning and not filming until everything is on the storyboard. Of course, you have the ability and desire - so do not use your abilities in the wrong way.
