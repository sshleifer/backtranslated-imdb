It happened to me that some movies that were banned during movie history were very important and very good movies. I would like to argue that instead of challenging films, censorship debates should consider banning a movie that is so threatening to your IQ and intelligence. If they had to do that, one of the first films that were quickly hidden would be "Stroker Ace". This movie is scary with the capital 'A'. It is the worst movie Burt Reynolds that has ever shown in .... quite a song for a guy with "Cannonball Run II", "Cop And A Half" and "Rent-A -Cop "in his resume! <br /> <br /> Some wafer stories suggest we get to know the stocker Stroker Ace (Reynolds), who loves fast cars and fast women. He was stuck in an insulting contract with promoter Clyde Torkle (Ned Betty), who insulted the contract, requiring him to embarrass the sales promotion for a new fast-food restaurant, such as dressed as a giant chicken. Throw into the mixture: Lugs (Jim Nabors), Ace's dim and Pembrook Feeney (Loni Anderson) Bimbo with brains with smaller brains than nuts that are sad as <br /> <br /> Hal Nidham, director of solid waste This low level used to be a stuntman, and he used to create many movies based on his expertise in performing stunt and chase / racing scenes. Some of these movies are okay, such as "Hooper" and "Stunts Unlimited", but with "Stroker Ace" he reaches the lowest level of career. The characters are so stupid that you feel sorry for the actors playing. Anderson was grateful for the stupid role that caused you to brush your teeth in despair. Humor is always weak and unfriendly, and stunned performances and the order of competition are meaningless. Even accepting credits (Which can be found in the cooperation of Reynolds-Needham) is not that fun, which makes the film feel that it may not be fun. "Stroker Ace" is a big problem solver.
