You may be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Sellers appeared in this movie. That will be a mistake. This is one of the most pointless movies ever created. I'm still waiting for something funny to happen. But nothing funny appeared in this movie Even the film industry admitted that this was a very weak movie and didn't try to promote it. It is surprising that this video was created. <br /> <br /> I wonder what kind of contract makes the seller in this movie. I also wondered why the person responsible for this story was allowed to make other bad movies. Of course, this movie is a waste of money that is used to build it and waste the time of anyone watching it Of course, there are high school students who can write / produce a movie that is a plot.
