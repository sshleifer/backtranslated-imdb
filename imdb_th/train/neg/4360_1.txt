First of all, let me say that I have to think a lot about writing comments for this movie. The best examination for this type of movie may be just silence. Movies sent to housewives and grandmothers This film tries to see "authentic" and the characters should be "real people." What is life in the Italian countryside? The plot is weak. (Which plot story) and humor doesn't make people laugh at age 12
