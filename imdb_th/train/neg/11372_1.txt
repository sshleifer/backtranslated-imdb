I've been using IMDb for many years and I never wanted to participate in movie reviews until now. This documentary has many problems that I almost don't know what to say. I am not a Muslim or I am an Islamic education expert. But I know enough to understand the one and only clear aspect of this documentary. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie begins with the fact that it's a documentary. Most of the documentaries that I have seen, seize myself around a few correct points and surround those points with interpretations and misinformation. This is the case of Islam: what Westerners need to know Yes, there are extremists around the world and some are Muslims. But creating a documentary about Islam, all about a small percentage of people who are incredibly misunderstood This is a documentary about the basic aspects of Islam and nothing more. <br /> <br /> For those who want to explore the problems in this documentary more objectively, here are several issues that may help. <Br / > <br /> There is nothing positive about Islam presented in the documentary. <br /> <br /> The documentary focuses on the Middle East. But many Muslims live outside that region Many Muslims live in China. Believe it or not, in Saudi Arabia, about 40% of all Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> Translation of the Quran used in the documentary is about suspicious I watched the documentary while watching another translation and the difference was amazing. I have been warned about the translations used in the documentary and now I know why Surrah 98: 6 is a good example. The documentary suggests that Surrah says that the unbeliever must go to hell. But the translation that I read instead: "Those who reject the truth among the people of the Scriptures and among the believers will be in hell." The difference is that those who deny the truth are those who know about God and God's truth and decided to reject it anyway. <br /> <br /> The film says that there is no moral in Islam. But this is not true Although it is a very true truth from the Quran and Hadith But Islam is aware of a concept called 'Urf or' normative behavior '. Obviously, what rules can be interpreted in many ways, but' Urf 'means "good" behavior that people generally consider right or wrong. <Br /> <br /> The documentary presents Shar'ia (Islamic law) as a unified knowledge that all Muslims follow. This is just not true. There are many Islamic schools and ranging from advanced and modern to radical groups in the interpretation of laws. <br /> <br /> Similar hadith traditions There are thousands of hadith and each law school accepts and rejects others. Using a Hadith without serious scholarships to determine which ones are true and valid, choosing and choosing a quote from a history that suits what you want to say ?? Which is what the documentary is doing. <br /> <br /> What I hope people will recognize is respect for fundamentalism as a problem, not Islam or other religions. Christianity has fundamentalists who shoot doctors, abortion clinics and more. I know that this is not the same thing as suicide bombers, just understanding the legitimacy of fundamentalism. issue If you feel that you have an answer, everyone will be wrong. But if you feel that you have an answer, you can work with other people's views about politics, religion, God or whatever.
