Today, before this, I debated why so many people complained about modern movies that I found suspicious words: "The development of characters in new movies is not only Depending on the movie, this may have been caused by many things, sometimes general special effects and garbage in Hollywood that have been plotted on War Of The. Worlds, but in the case of an effort that is not interesting Social desperation and desperate struggles to bring "art" back to the movie. It's like Dog Days to blame. <br /> <br /> Usually I have a lot of patience for movies. Bored or pointless, find them (from long-time good people like Andrei Rublev and Dogville to those who I think is painful to sit and watch Alfa and Wild Wild West dogs). I closed the movie for 45 minutes. Which more than 30 minutes I should have I'm not interested in the characters In any way and found nothing but a pessimistic curtain In an attempt to say something about social waste, this film fell in love with itself, mocking and exploiting too easily. It is true that I have seen many annoying movies in the same story. But there are many better movies about sadness, miserable people (Happiness, Gummo, Kids, Salo, Storytelling, Irreversible) that consists of characters with deep emotional personality .Dog Days is nothing more than horror. Of the eighth grade, for society, choosing to ignore the true wisdom about the way people are real and instead choose to be boring, scary and without hope in an art "art" is hopeless. Not the nature of the unknown or the intelligent observation of social waste. It's boring and nothing interesting.
