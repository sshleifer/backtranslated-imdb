... for Lt to choose this one First, this movie is not scary. It's just Hollywood. The worst case I want this to happen or we don't have a movie: If Willis's mission is to help the doctor, but she insists that her "people" make it out of the missionary Will make her stay with the first chopper and walk those refugees to the border without her He will not give his package to the refugees. That's not how it works. But as I pointed out that this is Hollywood, we have to have a drama. This is the reason we create movies because the truth is not complicated. However, I think Willis and a good doctor have a functional chemistry. That said that there are still good fighting scenes in the movie It doesn't have to waste time. "Tears of the Sun" is worth the DVD rental fee. Try it on a rainy day and you will be satisfied.
