A good actor is astoundingly wasted in this film that is slower than molasses and badly known jokes. Peter Ustinov strives hard here to bring something to life. But the result is that boredom is missing from all the correct rhythms that may make it look This film is scary, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. You have to sit and watch hundreds of movies to find bad things. <br /> <br /> The story is busy and worrisome about the story. Ustinov talks about American insurance companies to hack their computers and misappropriates millions of pounds. The way they do it is more than weakness and reliability. (He just learned his computer skills overnight by reading leaflets and Robert Morley, a computer expert who came to South America and stole his identity) <br /> <br /> Plot Ustinov's side loves Maggie Smith's eccentric friend who just happens to be his secretary accidentally after he gets banned in her building. She ended up sharing a hidden sexual scene with Bob Newhart, where nothing else, while Ustinov proceeded to receive bribes in small increments and tried to move forward like Newhart and Karl Malden. Married to Smith, then they flew to Brazil, which became the final scene of every British comedy since (Nuns on the Run? A Fish Called Wanda?) <br /> <br /> The surprise of The end Laughing more than everything that happened earlier At the end, I thought I had to be a real rocker to drift like this. Even the pendant by Cesar Romero couldn't help. One of the most unsatisfying and poorest "comedies" I had. I've seen and are the worst caper, don't waste time. If you love this, you have to watch a better movie.
