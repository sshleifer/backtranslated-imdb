I watched the beach, stir the cable for a while and I liked it. Fat man is the best character while he seems to be a good person. The remaining characters are just different patterns of young men and black men. I like to watch cheap movies that catch a period of time because they are almost like a documentary about the attitude and fashion of the year. Stir-fried beach is also a joke because the low-budget babies in this movie are strictly home girls. Most cheap movies are of high quality. "Newborn baby" and you can tell that the baby in this movie is a local dancer and lingerie model for JC Penneys. Some people have a lot of cellulite hanging from their bikini that It is a joke to see how "children" walk to something that is actually partly used too much and high mileage. There are some parts that are too cute. That is the charm of these cheap crappy movies. You will see many doggies and real cuties! I checked something at IMDb and seven years later, Phat beach was their only credit. Very bad. It would be interesting if someone ever made a book. "Where are they now?" With a cute story that appears in the history of the movie and never comes back. What happened?? There may be one or two young people in most movies that seem to do many things, but many years later, when you watch a movie again on TV, you suspect "What happened to X?" However, this movie will mostly explode. But there are funny moments
