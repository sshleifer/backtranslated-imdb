This movie has too many skeletons. It's a relatively low budget movie. (I hope!) Which can justify But the lack of a good actor and the story that came out to hurt it too much Phillips has faith in his role as a broken son of a happy family who is looking for himself. (Although his family is ... uh ... uh ... a little white ...) but other actors are holding straw Every potential moment will be destroyed by excessive sexuality, and there are * ways * too many subplots. (Which is a clear sign of lack of plot, they need fillers ...) I won't recommend this movie to anyone. Not a strong Phillips fan or anyone who does nothing. 4/10
