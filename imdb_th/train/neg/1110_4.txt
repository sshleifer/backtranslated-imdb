One hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds in this flick and I think it's quite lame. That was after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) fell on his horse to join the good people. I was very surprised with the 20 Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar mechanism which didn't translate anything. Clearly, Coppola's name on credit can't do anything to guarantee success here, even though there is more than one item. <br /> <br /> If you end it. Ask the same question to yourself. What is the hook and glove? What happened to the livestock simulator? Who are the strangers should represent? Why do they make this movie? <br /> <br /> May I continue But my energy is gone Look, there is a Western name "The Gunfighter" from the 1950s, with a man named Gregory Peck as the main character. Watching it will make you feel as good as watching this, making you feel bad. I highly recommend it.
