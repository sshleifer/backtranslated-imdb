This must be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I remember watching many years ago when the video first came out and for strange reasons, I thought I enjoyed it. So I became an idiot. I ran out to buy a DVD when it was released ... It was a sad mistake! I won't bother going into the story because it's so transparent that you can look through it. I'm a big fan of Herschel Gordon Lewis, so I'm familiar with the horrific effects and bad performances. But these people take this to another level It's almost as though they are trying to make the worst movie possible humanly ... If that is their goal, they will succeed. If they intend to make a movie that should make you scared or make you believe in any way, shape or form that is true, then they fail ... wrong! Avoid this movie ... Read the synopsis and you have seen!
