I saw this movie in the cinema when I was 10 years old. Even in that era, 'humor' was mildly insulting the intelligence of teenagers. <br /> <br /> In the past every time I saw Ed Begley Jr. Goldblum I will cringe and start feeling uncomfortable and a little sad. Until I thought of the existence of this movie today, I'm not sure why I felt that way. Obviously I blocked my memory of this movie. But my negative feelings for the two offenders remain Obviously I forgot that I had watched this movie. But regretted that my subconscious was unknowingly stolen. EATEN by the creator of this human being. <br /> <br /> I'm not brave enough to try to be an adult. Should look at the face of this childhood fear so that I can put it behind me truly Some regression and / or hypnosis therapy may not be a bad idea as well.
