This film is poorly written, acts poorly, and is very predictable. It's a very low budget and I can understand why it's never released and go straight to the video. It's not so much fun. But it was a complete disaster and I hope to come back 1-1 / 2 hours! The color is scary, along with a plot with a large hole. You can drive a truck Mack through them. <br /> <br /> The story itself has a young bride who does things she can't really do - It's a stretch! Skip this movie and see what's better in the horror genre. Think of a movie that is better than this. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
