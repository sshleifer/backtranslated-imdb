This creative team must have hope for the effective use of uncomplicated and original elements. The 'Party of Five' is crazy. Genetically inevitably has little root interest because of elements that are not murderous. Which is singular, is a gentle mopester, two great performances, terrifying 'Wes Bentley'. In fact, all the performances are skin deep Although dark haired women attract attention But the salinity is still minimal. There are no nudity here. The lack is enough blood tanks. All feelings are kept in a safe distance tease ... The unfortunate truth considering the name of the director is 'Butcher', with only the soundtrack, scenes with pressure and Severe fluctuations cause clear tension Sometimes the storyboarding of static storyboards adds a compelling perspective that adds to the illness ... but for movies that call themselves horror, I don't get close to struggling once. Perhaps the emphasis on social revival through blood eating, scenes with different geometric shapes outside the square and a focus on continued fun through malice or family traps must escape to Escape the embarrassment But this is not a good starting point for my travel through horror.
