A frustrating and boring crime horror movie with low-quality actor Jeremy Renner muttering his way through the role of Jeffrey Dahmer, one of the most famous killers / cereals. Of the century Released with a video dating back to the beginning of 2003, "Dahmer" is a boring, boring and bad-hearted talker in a true crime drama festival that never delves into the evil and mad minds of Massacre killer Like it has great potential to do! However, what made the effort for reasons unknown to me caused some sympathy for the audience for men by showing him that it was ultimately a lonely person, Nebuchi and An angry society For love everywhere that is wrong compared to the cold, the computation and the atheism of Kyo and the madman he is! Overall, in 2003, "Dahmer" is a true crime game anywhere that may cross because I am not kidding when I say it is one of the worst serial killer biopics ever made! It's even worse than the trash like the pathetic and disgusting videos like "Gacy", "Bundy", "Ed Gein" and "The Night Stalker"! (Turkish stars are zero)
