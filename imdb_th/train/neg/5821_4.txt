As others have said, this is probably the best hammer style movie, and it seems to me that that's how most actors are ordered to play ... There are many boring stories.

The only actor who came out really well is Patrick Stewart, who is the most favorite. Freddie Francis may be a great movie photographer. But he is a lousy director
