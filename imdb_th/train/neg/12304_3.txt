I watched this movie last week and has the biggest laugh I have had in a long time. The story of the movie is quite stupid and complicated in a bad way. The only thing that can be found everywhere in this movie is Corey Savier's impressive abs. Alexandra Paul (I think her name) is scary like the wife of a preacher with a depressed history. Ted Mackenzie is a bad person and his character is the best. And if the fact that you think that you have sex with your son is not enough, they throw an unnecessary saxophone out on every occasion The end and the focus of this movie is disgusting and ridiculous. I mean, who the hell wants to hold the children of prisoners trying to make you think that he is your son and you have a sexual relationship with him!
