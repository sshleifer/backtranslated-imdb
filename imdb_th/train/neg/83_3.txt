Jill Dunn (played by Mitzi Kapture) is an attractive and good-looking woman with a clever teenage daughter, Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a husband and petty assistant Sean. (Rick Roberts), both of whom <br /> <br /> This is being advertised as a family with a problem that a mad killer walks in an unstoppable storm. <br /> < br /> The storm didn't happen until about the last 5 minutes of the movie and then there was nothing to send anyone running to the storm's basement. <br /> <br /> The spellings were not severe. Until almost finished the story. <br /> <br /> picture Most of the movies that we use to listen to Jill and her poor daughter, Liv argue until I want to slap my daughter next week. <br /> <br /> Jill and Lil's problems She lives with Zack, who is a suspicious character, and they continue to do so - in fact, Jill goes home to find the two of them on Liv's bed. <br /> <br /> The rest of the time, we spend time listening to Jill's husband, groaning at Jill or criticizing her. <br /> <br /> Sean is not interesting - because his face is full of freckles. So you can connect to various points. <br /> <br >> Stories start. From Jill, who has been notified of the outstanding bill on their credit card for a hotel she has never been to before and she thinks Sean has never been away as well. <br /> <br / > Jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner & manager Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very old man who is divorced, who is very good, sympathetic to her In fact, when he saw her husband there again, he called Jill and introduced her. <br /> <br /> Jill returned to the hotel to see Sean and another woman. She was upset by the leaves that Sean didn't see her and didn't do anything. In fact, she didn't say anything to Sean when he got home. This story is not reasonable for me. <br /> <br /> Jill gave Richard a business card for him, so he called her and apparently she was in the real estate business. She showed him the condo. After that, they had a drink and there were things that were warm between them. <br /> <br /> Richard and Jill were hot and heavy. In fact, he seems to be too aggressive when Jill decides to be cut off immediately. <br /> <br /> Jill and Sean confront his cheating. Sean lamented how Jill left him since her father died. Obviously he lacks any morals, is her fault. Eventually, Jill confesses her own lack of morality and is close to committing adultery with Sean - and of course it's her fault as long as Sean is concerned. <br /> <br /> The small family decides. Going on a camping trip - - which means whimpering and gratitude among them, especially from the destroyed daughter. <br /> <br /> I'm rooting enough that the stalker will get everyone, but Jill. <br /> <br /> 3 stars
