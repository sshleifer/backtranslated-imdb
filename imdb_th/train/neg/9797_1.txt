Today, it is a trend to see all the programs from the early 90s as a classic (modern people are not easily seen from the nostalgia of this era) and while some of those programs / certainly not good. I watched this program a lot back in those days because it was re-screened on TV and at the time I didn't like it. Even an 8 year old boy can still see that people in Power Rangers are doing too much activity. When the show didn't turn to a painful, bad fight scene, it caused the audience to scramble with an unnecessary audience about a group of teenagers and they had little social problems every time. I do not know anything about you But I didn't give me about that, and it was filled because they had to fight with another friend in an ancient alien costume with fireworks or toy-robot. You never felt that 'involved' in any way. One of these performances and the fact that most actors act like no interest, except their wallet, just helping to increase the feeling without /> There is nothing memorable. About this show, and it's quite surprising that it has been spinning many times (Beetleborgs is a good example). All of this is just a quick way to make money. I challenge 'fans' to tell me what is. Things that stand out in the episode should be good, because I can't find anything that attracts the attention of the child a little. I guess the Power Rangers' fans are mostly telling me that I "Just don't understand" or whatever is in that line I don't really care This is the shit back and it's still shit now.
