As long as this film is a science fiction movie There are many good things in it and some quality scenes. As mentioned above, it is not good and some things are used far ... <br /> <br /> For calling this movie cube is the most complete and perfect! This is the definition of milking the original and excellent original film ... all the feelings that it can translate into the core of the first film. But introducing people / robots as part of the "team" behind the cube would rather stretch ... <br /> <br /> I gave this 3 with the back stabbing of the original. This movie should be sterilized in many parts of the movie without the location or time to talk about them all ... <br /> <br /> Can be viewed for those who do not see Cube & Hypercube. But not recommended for fans of the series ...
