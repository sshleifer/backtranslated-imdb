I saw this movie last year in Media class and I have to say that I really hate it. I am in the 10th year (and 15 years old) so there may be something related to it. But for English language this year, year 11, we have to read Animal Farm as well by George Orwell. Apart from the fact that this book is based on revolution, my idea is that it is a terrible book and I hate <br /> <br /> But 1984, I think it's the most annoying movie. I've seen it and I think George Orwell is one of the most crazy people who have ever lived on this planet. I apologize to everyone who loves his work. But i can't The theme in the movie was well received. But how to set all the movies and events that occur within that does not meet my standards This is just my opinion and I'm sure many others are happy with this movie.
