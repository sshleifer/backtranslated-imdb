This is the most horrible movie I've ever seen. I don't know who has the courage to put this product. <br /> <br /> The production standards are cruel. There is no excuse here in the movie. Camera work, script writing, acting and sound are unbelievable. I think there is a plot. But can be done within 10 minutes. A girl with a hysterical nerve at the center of this work is not reliable. <br /> <br /> I want everyone to avoid spending time or money with this name It's really bad. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14, 2008
