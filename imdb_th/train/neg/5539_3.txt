Stuffed shirt Wimpy Armand Louque (played by Dean Jagger, an actor with a rare leading role), together with a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret techniques for creating zombies. Armand fell in love with Claire Duvall (Called Dorothy Blonde Stone) A gentle milk user for Armand Clifford Grayson's colleague, Armand's colleague. Armand uses knowledge of voodoo for revenge. Sounds exciting, right? Of course, it's not like that.

Alyn Warren as Dr. Trevissant, who couldn't manage to make things a little more lively. Welcome and focus on their lives Floppy stock film library scores, painstakingly obvious stage sets, and raw movies are pretty lousy and not impressive as well.
