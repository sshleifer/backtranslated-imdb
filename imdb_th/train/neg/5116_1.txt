I rented this movie today because I thought it might be a good football movie because I am a big football fan. I am wrong. This film has a religious method and preaches too much. This movie says that if you are a Christian, you can easily get everything you need in life as a great footballer! You are not a great footballer by being a Christian and asking God to do it through practice and hard work. All you have to do is ask God and he will give you something .... Not true. In any way, I laughed many times because of this shame. The only funny part is when they are stupid (Shultz, a cartoonist or not, a friend who flew across the Atlantic, etc.) but actually this movie isn't great. I do not recommend, especially if you are not a Christian.
