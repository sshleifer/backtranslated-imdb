I am interested in this topic and only Drew Barrymore fans who dance on David Letterman's desk will find something interesting from a distance. Ok she shows breast (Or maybe the body is twice as much) The plot is slashed a bit and the performance is terrible. There is no lead that will work with while the direction of the movie leads to the place. Don't waste time. See Donnie Darko instead if you want to see the creepy Drew Barrymore movie. See Darko again. <br /> <br /> Keeping the legendary Doppelganger is a criminal offense as well. Referring to Charles Williams' "Descent Into Hell" novel for what is worth considering This is just an excuse to create a movie B to go straight to the video and absorb the lives of people at Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> What makes these people think that acting here is admirable? Let me take a break.
