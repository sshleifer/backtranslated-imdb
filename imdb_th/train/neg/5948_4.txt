I will not talk about any plot because even though it can be highly predictable. But the notable plot is given everywhere in the movie reviews in the summary, synopsis here and even in the summary on my Netflix envelope. I might enjoy it more if I don't know Maybe. This movie has a tricky performer, most of whom are reliable actors with relatively limited material on hand, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Anwar. Rain Each Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore, it is impossible to like William McNamara, but that is by design. And there are a few nude scenes by callipygian Lenore Zann, but this does not bring a little suggestion from me No good actor, read these scripts before signing, right?
