You may hear this phrase when talking about this film. "" Herbie: Full of shit. "And yes, it's true. This movie is terrifying and really weak. <br /> <br /> This is the second worst movie Lindsay has ever done since Teenage Drama Queen's confession. The only good thing about movies. This story is a more talented actor who is better than this movie millions of times and is the selling point of this movie only. I do not see how the famous actor Matt Dillon will be part of this movie. He didn't read the horrible screenplay before he signed it. <br /> <br /> What I am. The dislike about this movie depends on whether Herbie is surreal and has a fantasy like talent and climbs up the wall. I know it's a movie for kids. But they have to go down with water and it turns out to be more funny than entertainment Need to have a little bit of realism and the story is too predictable. <br /> <br /> Last word: If children are less than 5 -12 years old, I doubt very much that anyone can enjoy the ridiculous movie What is losing my money? I feel like being cheated. <br /> <br /> Score: 3/10 (Grade: F)
