This is a very low budget in the horror film Roger Corman / Flick. DinoCroc was created when dealing with prehistoric genes that are rampant. Crocodiles that have been engineered before killing themselves first then get the taste of human beings and become a panic that quickly escapes after escaping. There is no character that has any depth, but not a focal point. We received a small glimpse of two large legs of dinosaurs and some of the best "kill" scenes in a small budget movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is a funny character trying to use three. Dogs with legs for prey and become crocodile food by themselves There is nothing left on the pier. But with an upper ankle There is no real dominant role: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. The most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and the professional crocodile hunter Costas Mandylor. P. DINOCROC, which is respectfully feared, is exchanged for pickles.
