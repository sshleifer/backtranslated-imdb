I will rate this movie with minus 10. But unfortunately there is no one. <br /> <br /> Why don't I go out in the first five minutes of this movie, I can't speak. I should go with my intuition and go out immediately !! Many people in our theater do, and sadly, I didn't follow them. <br /> <br /> The story lacks all the rules for the movie. There is no terrible acting plot! Even Robin Williams was very disappointed that I had never seen another movie that he had only had a relationship in the story, in addition to the talking room, I didn't like the tazer scene. Causing some meat to fall in the sense of the story Someone wants to make writers and film directors!
