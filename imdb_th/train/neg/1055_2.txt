* Warning Spoiler * <br /> <br /> First of all, I rate this movie 2 of 10. <br /> <br /> The idea is good. But there are silly errors in the movie too, can not Making it a psyching drama that it seems to be First of all, she never fought alone. After having a strange question from her mother (which is unbelievable when the mother proves that there is encouragement and love in the movie), those who are raped are not alone. <br /> <br /> She's still innocent. Unbelievably falling into the strange trap of the crew. <br /> <br /> Her friends are incredibly disgusting. <br /> <br /> What I think is the most unbelievable is Etha. Failed to control the team when he changed He loves attention Ethan is the leader of the crew. (Hey, they say that) and people think that other men are lame. But when Ethan changed his opinion, he couldn't convince even one person in the team. He was right and his old friend was wrong. Everyone just hates him ... Why? This movie has no explanation. How was he the leader? <br /> <br /> The funny message is that my girlfriend thinks I'm watching Beverly Hills when she comes in two actors from a successful TV series ... Cheap way to watch
