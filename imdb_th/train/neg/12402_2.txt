I tend to think that people are insulting about these old Andy Hardy movies. Their counterparts are not bad. New movie critics are not those who like disgusting movies, so these good-looking leather shoes don't get praise. <br /> <br /> However, I can't protect this movie. You can still have old conversations but still laugh and cry with the story. When watching this, you just shook your head and asked yourself "How foolish are you?" If you know what I mean It's so repetitive that I can't fathom too many people who actually sit for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The typical story is "Andy" (Mickey Rooney) trying to get out. Get stuck because of him Compose a story about the connection with the d√©butante from New York City as if it were the end. People have more social consciousness in the past. You will hear the word "Social climber" as if knowing that the rich or the beautiful person is the highest success you can make. It is the absolute nonsense and looks even more today. <br /> <br /> However, it is a naive and clean story and series. (There are half a dozen of these hardy Andy movies as you can find. In addition, if you like to hear Judy Garland singing, this is your ticket because she sings a few songs here and she winds up in Andy's heart Oh man, I'm almost throwing even writing this thing!
