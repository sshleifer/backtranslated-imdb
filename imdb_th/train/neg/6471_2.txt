This is a bad movie in every way possible. Of course, we want to know what happened 12 years ago from the last film and it can be used at some level. But the new characters are not interesting. Melody is very scary! Alas, while logical that humans cannot be under water forever, being treated for other basic physical logic will be ignored. It's chilling if you don't have a cold weather outfit if you are in the Arctic. I don't know why most comments here. Jafar's return rate is getting worse. I think this is even more terrible.
