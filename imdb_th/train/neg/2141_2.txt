I have a dissatisfaction with watching this movie with my girlfriend who likes me as a fan of the first person. This movie is down to the right. Suck! It lacks the first magic. You can understand every word that I can say. The crappy animation of the palace is very different from the first movie. There are new characters that have never been mentioned before and very bad. From making silly sounds In general, it's the same as The Lion King 1 1/2 except for the different stories of all that I said. The reason I gave 2 out of 10 is because the songs that are not sung by the characters are the most fun.
