This is one of those movies that should be better than that. I was afraid to think that the revision approved by Blockbuster would have to be because the director's reduction in the DVD was very boring. By nature, you don't expect it to be a "godfather", but a performance or a second class may be useful. <br /> <br /> There are also many cute men in this movie. Viciously exploited. I like to watch hotties. Squeeze around in their BVD as much as the next person. But I have the right to expect a little more It's not a total loss but; At least we watched Drew Fuller's junk (full of) and truly irritated me, and had a more cute Huntley Ritter than he had done in "Bring It On" (and acted as well). In silver color is always for children You just have to look at it hard. And sometimes you have to use the pause button
