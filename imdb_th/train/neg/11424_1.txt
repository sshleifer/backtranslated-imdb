I noticed that "light" was on the cable the night before and I started watching it because I didn't remember anything special in addition to that I remembered it as a horrible movie when I saw it in the year 85 twenty. The next year, this movie is still very bad. In addition to synthesizers, the saxophone is also the most abused tool in pop music in the 1980s, as shown in the title song. When hearing that song again, I wanted to pierce the screwdriver in my ear to end the misery about the noise they made. And the music of Rob Lowe plays the saxophone and there is a scene in which he plays the solo that continues like Charlie Parker, just his treble and the play is reminiscent of a monkey that plays Kazu. Every character is not very interesting, even though I have to say that they do a great job in casting actors that aren't equally interesting in drawing them. In fact, I think the Mare Winningham is interesting and at first I felt sorry for her character because she was wearing funny underwear. But when near the end of the movie, she decided to have sex with Rob Lowe's character of sexual diseases.
