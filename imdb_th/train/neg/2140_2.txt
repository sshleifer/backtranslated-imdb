The mission of Assassin Hauser (John Cusak) is to strike an oil minister in the middle of the East called Omar Sharif (Neikov) in Turaqistan, managed by the American people. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the words may be beyond reason and become the most annoying matter. Here it is done too much: government, politics, music, war, general people are not accepted by society, and I talk about "war" and that's what we have here - the most annoying movie that surrounds the nightmare. Very bad happened I still ask myself why I continue to use the DVD. There are also many members of the Cusak family. In this story, John Cusak appears as embarrassed that the family is there or just me. <br /> <br /> It used to be a movie John Cusak while a little. The aberration is at the end quite well. Not here. Believe that John Cusak has a hand in writing and producing of this mess Do what you want. <br /> <br /> What happened in this movie came with a fire blast gun and shouted that you can't really focus or be the point? It may take too long to set up an attack which will be forgotten until the last 15 minutes. In the meantime, we have a meaningless speaker among actors. And the chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I don't think so, but you know: boys? What girl ??? And they want something that will take more time. <br /> <br /> Yes, for what they should be (Odd and annoying) Duff and Kingsley's performances are good. But when I saw Dan Aykroyd's character at the beginning of the show, sitting in the rubbish bathroom, I knew that the rest of the show would go to the bucket as well. I'm not wrong. I'm sure some people will sing the praises of Try this But if the rose is still another name by rose, so too is the mess ?????????? <br /> <br /> Do I now remember why I continued using DVDs? I hope the story will be downgraded and never saved myself. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes Sex: No Nude: No Language: Yes
