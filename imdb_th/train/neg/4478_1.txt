I didn't expect much from this movie - it's a bit of a fun diversion. Wuthering Heights can turn into a modern story that is possible - a good story and a soap. But this movie decided to leave the talents of the people involved in a similar tone version, so from the amazing source of information they had the courage to call it Wuthering Heights. The fact that it is the story of people who are important, different, most sympathetic and often cruel to others. It changed the character of some characters - Isabelle, for example, in a novel without bones in her body - they separated her blind fantasies and made her a prostitute. Foxy Heathcliff was a terrifying person who Torture most people in his path But in this version, Catherine ended up leaving her daughter in his care. The conversation was repeated and wondered how the actor managed it with a straight face. In places that have real depth or emotions, we know that they have some meaning when they scream in front of someone. I read the criticism of the early 90s, "Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights", which was the highlight of Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche. Slightly correct comments, but the MTV version goes a step further by using a basic story structure to deliver a chipper beach with bad content.
