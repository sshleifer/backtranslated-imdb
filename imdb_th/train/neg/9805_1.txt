I never understood the popularity of Saban's Power Rangers performance, which is America's second-best version in the last three decades! What is cool about the Japanese version is completely lost in the US version, appearance, special effects etc. <br /> <br /> Of course, many children will say that the power ranger is the greatest <br /> I'm sure that if they speak Japanese, they will learn that Super Sentai is better than the US version. <br /> <br /> Take it. Power Rangers is very scary. Try Super Sentai instead! Looking for a better show, try Voltron The Third Dimensions instead!
