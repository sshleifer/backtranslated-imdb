Although I have to admit that I laughed a lot more in watching this movie compared to the last few stories I saw. <br /> <br /> The budget must include changing the bag from the actor. The production cost is so low that it makes it fun. Reminds me of a monster robot created by a man in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet. <br /> <br /> In one scene, the unfortunate victim gets their arms and legs cut. Geez is hard to believe But the Dark Knight scene from the Holy Grail is more realistic. I always wondered why the victim didn't start shouting. "There is no going through" and "It's just a wound to my flesh is worse." It's one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the past year. Between horrible and cheap dresses and the look of the man's seductive look, the result is madness. <br /> <br /> Indeed, movies that are not good enough to be viewed. Like seeing slow motion accidents on film. <br /> <br />
