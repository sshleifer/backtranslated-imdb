So ... it's a woman and a classic, and I think it might not be in the beginning of the movie. For example, when Stella tells Steven that she wants to change herself and start talking correctly He said She will not change Well, he definitely changed his music and it seems that other investigators followed suit. At first, it seems that love stories are about social placement and women as mothers who are sacrificed. At the end of this movie didn't make her a hero, it made the whole story sad. And it's sad that people think it makes her a hero Maybe that's the opinion of movies that people should go to. Positive feedback reflects a steady stream of patriotism in social consciousness.
