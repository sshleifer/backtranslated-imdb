Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. That is the first, most important and most annoying thing about trying to imagine Scooby-Doo and the new company. <br /> <br /> Shaggy's voice is treble. The previous incarnation of the Scooby show, they changed the traditional dress and walking mode from the original. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what they're doing with the villainous corner. The formula used in the previous performances of Scooby <br /> <br /> And the movement style is strange and very distorted. I like it, but it's not an actual Scooby-Doo animation but an animation. Strange things that were used with other WB shows also increased with me. This may be the same. <br /> <br /> It's worth it once - once - if you can handle the lack of proper Shaggy sounds, that's enough to make people enjoy the show correctly. In addition, I am trying to not be a fan of nightingping that is not flexible. Evolve or die according to the words that go We will see if it takes care of the second episode again - then I will create a more stable opinion.
