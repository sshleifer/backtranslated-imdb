This "movie" tries to keep track of the types of low budget, mobile camera flicks that have proven to be effective and successful. <br /> <br /> The film fails and is possible. <br /> <br /> It's great. It's called the "prize". This piece of garbage has been put on the cover ..... It makes you wonder if these critics launched when they really sent this story. > <br Words that cannot be described as images It's just awesome. Seriously, that is a bad thing. <br /> <br /> I watched it in 20 minutes on a continuous fast forward. <br /> <br /> From the light of the garbage to the horrible governance. Grainy images to muffled sounds and Of course, don't forget the ABYSMAL performance. This is one of the most complete and pathetic works of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> It's serious, there is no quality of redemption - whatever. Save your money and watch horror. With a limited budget, there are many - Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC to name But only a few <br /> <br /> Avoid all these costs. Don't waste money or time with this trash that pretends to be genuine leather. <br /> <br /> Be careful of other comments! You have been warned!
