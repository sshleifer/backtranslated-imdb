Now i like sci-fi cartoon However, when "Robotboy" appeared in Canada in late 2006, I watched the premiere and was absolutely shocked. The characters are ordinary and stereotypical. (Do they need to make African-American men wear tiger tiger pattern clothing and speak with a Jamacian accent? Why are all women in Asia bright and yellow? And breasts and complaining all the time?) At the point where things are unrealistic, predicting and disturbing. Sometimes, Astro Boy has many similarities. Allow me to explain (Dubbed names for children): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay and others. As a teenager robot "," Star Wars "," Ninja Turtles "," Kamen Rider "," Sailor Moon "and associates are moving Not to mention the overall picture of race / gender. Don't even let me start at Innuendos. I just say it's hidden and very dirty. But seriously, don't even try to see this. Especially if you like Astro Boy
