It's getting worse. The series is falling aggressively. The first two sequels were accepted, and after that we saw a really scary movie. Robert Englund performed great again as Freddy, but the remaining actors were unable to perform. The story is Alice after surviving from the previous Nightmare series. Freddy Krueger's brutal dream begins again. At this time, the ridiculous murderer was striking and sleeping in Alice's womb. His intention is "reborn" in the real world. The only person who can stop Freddie is his dead mother. But Alice will release her soul in time to save his own son? Try to see the first three people miss the other three. Then look at the last one.
