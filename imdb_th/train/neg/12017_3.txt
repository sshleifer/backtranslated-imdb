I am a big fan of Ludlum and the Covert-one, and I always think how they should make a movie. Imagine my excitement, then, to learn that this movie actually exists! 'Hades Factor' is the first in the series that seems to be a clear starting point. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, this movie was disappointing. Simple elements from movies, such as Griffin's first meeting with Smith, do not have to be different from the book. Many characters are of poor quality as well. For the start of Dorf, it was so bad that Smith was not a bad actor. But is an incredibly bad choice because he is too soft and unable to show many clear qualities of John Smith. <br /> <br /> New names, repeated assignments and omissions Of some characters, causing the film to deteriorate further For example, the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire background of the virus, including the involvement of VAXHAM, makes the whole issue of the film quite dark. Very different (Not to mention that the characters in this film are nothing like the characters in the book.) <br /> Rachel Russel is probably Randi Russel from the book. Not only should she be Sophie Amden's sister. (Should be called Sophia Russell) but she should work from the CIA, not "covert-one" which leads me to my last point and I think one of the most important things COVERT-ONE does not exist at this point! No, until the second book of the series will be Covert-One that the president has set as a measure to prevent further biological terrorism. <br /> <br /> Speak straight. I will go all day. You like books and want to see good adaptation. I'm afraid you will be bitterly disappointed. Although it is an action movie But it has a wide average, mainly due to the cutting of luster and bad effects The story is messy and the script is boring like water as the final nail in the very cheap coffin of this movie.
