I like "American Movie", so I rented the first movie of Chris Smith, which I think is a documentary too. In the first minute I saw that it didn't happen. But I let it go. <br /> <br /> The movie is dead. Being true to life can hardly help you if you just check the boring. The boredom that we are already familiar with. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but it will be related to anyone 1) Extremely suck and 2) Most are crappy, minimum wages. Jobs in the service sector ??? I know before I watch movies. It doesn't really give a check on that, because while the film tries to feel "real" (camera, cell phone, no music, etc.), things are happening almost as though in the world of <Br> <br /> The employer is very cheerful with Randy when he picks up his check after Randy resigns from him after 3 days when the man says he expects him to stay for 6 months. ? Or the day after leaving his job (And make the machine work harder) to make everyone easy for him. <br /> <br /> The big problem is our "hero" (?) Randy. This guy is a loser. Not because he was stuck in these jobs or having a room that was crumbling or seems He is a drug He doesn't care or even try these jobs really. He has no private center. If I had to hire someone, he would not pass the interview. <br /> <br /> I waited for what Chris Smith had done, but they gave up. "This is what I want". Important for movies. "American work" does not work
