I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is a charming and talented actress. I'm sure this will be a good movie that has happened in there. Nothing short (less than 90 minutes). It's longer than 75 minutes. After one hour of frustration, I scanned through the remaining 20 minutes. Exciting. /> <br /> Freeman plays as an actor - who has not worked for a while - researching what he might play He visited the supermarket she was working on. Nothing happened. She decided to let him go home and they went to the goal of Arby to wash the car. Nothing happened. They talk about their lives. Nothing happened. <br /> <br /> I don't understand, but I don't get Bill Murray, measure "Lost In Translation" and "Broken Flowers". If you like those movies, you might like this. Many people find that this movie has a strange charm, or for reasons that prevented me from searching for interesting conversations. The general equipment in the film of this family is that it takes a long time to remain silent / silent after the actors present the lines that should be meaningful. We know it's meaningful because it's followed by two minutes, nothing on the screen. Sorry, I must be a Philistine. I do not understand. For me, this type of movie is not funny or charming or thought-provoking. Why are they boring? Because there is no joke, no drama, no tension No laughter No suspense No response. Nothing to see In short, there is no thing that I go to watch a movie for. I'm bored for free I saw strange characters / strange things in real life. I went to Target and fast food restaurants and car washes. These elements are not made from movies, even though the stars are doing this. I pay to be entertained. <br /> <br /> If you're crazy about Morgan Freeman and want to hear that he keeps walking, if you want to drive to Paz Vega, you can watch and listen to her. But nothing happens. I promise to include snoozefest
