After reading good reviews about this movie, I think it's time for me to watch. I don't know why I care. In general, this family has been entrusted with clues that lead to the accumulation of large ancient treasures hidden by the Knights Templar during the War of Independence. Obviously it must be in the hands of the British at all costs. First, why did the knight move the treasure from Europe to America? How do Nic Cages characters think "Charlotte" is a real boat? How do they find clues and puzzles in about a minute? And how can two people become thieves and steal the boss? Suddenly, the best protected paper in the world? This is just a part of the plot in this erroneous Hollywood action scene. Cage has been in a great action movie - 'Face-Off' and 'The Rock'. - Why did he lower himself to this point? Is he too old? His character is quite annoying - whatever this ordinary person steals, the Indyand Declaration escapes from the gun by escaping from the FBI. This film does not give any feelings at all, and all is quite disappointing.
