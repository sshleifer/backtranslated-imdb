It's a terrible thing. The movie! One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I always like to watch all kinds of movies like this. "A man found an unorthodox woman he liked But he is involved with someone who doesn't suit him .... I expect something predictable and I don't mind Movies are often fun, mixed with romance and comedy appropriately. But not this movie! Every joke is down and "Love" makes me want to vomit. The character name is one of the characters "Please kill me", the most I've seen on my TV. "Unusual women" are not very strange, like strange people But it can happen as well as annoying This film is flat out, then suck, there is no way around, do not waste your time.
