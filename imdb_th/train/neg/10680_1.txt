The front spoiler <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies ever created - it's very easy. There is no redemption quality about this movie. The first 10 minutes are quite tricky - in fact, guys. He makes you believe that this movie will be shocking and will make you sit on the edge of the seat. You will spend 83 minutes punching while watching the stolen scenes and poor quality without any organization. The ridiculous lake looks like an aquarium and has the same plant in different parts of the lake bed. The characters show the power teleportation Their advanced, such as Alex Thomas, who fell into the lake (drunk) and ended up with his boat in an impossible position Angie Harmon shows a pathetic work as Kate makes a continuous conversation during free time which seems to be written at the last minute by a fifth grade student. This example is when she says "Torch!" In a stupid manner that shows how the human body can cringe before it breaks in half. Finally, editing this movie is the strangest and scary thing I have ever seen. It's like the cameraman is a bunch of chimpanzees that have received cameras from scientists. This example is when we get close to Alex's car headlights. I bet there's no time to fix this movie. The ending is absolutely pathetic. Obviously, the author tried to create a mysterious storyline that caused the audience to say, "Oh, yes!" But we went back to see the dumb paintings of the spider that matched the story. Unfortunately there are many views in the millions that can't help make this movie annoying. <br /> <br /> I give this to. 5 out of 10 which is true from. 5 that this movie recorded in movies instead of picture books
