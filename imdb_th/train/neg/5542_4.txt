First of all, if you are checking the Revolt of the Zombies as the Night of the Living Dead movie (1968), early to forget it, this is about "zombies" in psychological terms, rather than the words that refer to people who can't. Can control their will But who must follow the will of another person instead of "zombies" here, just as much as they are in the movie, as a metaphor for the surrender of the state or the general authority, as in the war It is quite straightforward to call this horror movie. <br /> <br /> This film was created during the First World War by accident. "French Khmer" hears strange stories about being zombies, zombies - and has a story of a zombie army that easily defeats enemies. Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) brings the priests who know the secrets of being zombies back. But he would not say so. Louque and the international troops headed to Angkor Wat in an archeological survey designed to find the secrets of being a zombie and destroying information before the zombies had a chance. <br /> <br /> One of those strange things about the Revolt of Zombies is that the author / director Victor Halperin may decide to change his game plan while filming the script. The movie begins as if it will explore the zombie / military metaphors and may contain adventure elements. But after about 15 minutes, it will change gears and become a love story. <br /> <br /> Halperin doesn't stick with subtitles about wills and strength (and this movie Nietzschean is interesting at that level. But the script and editing changed very quickly This is another older movie, which I would not be surprised if there are missing scenes, especially when some scenes are faded or missing while the characters are talking. <br /> < br /> amid the romantic story Try to refer to the zombies thread. But the zombie content is slightly reasonable. Louque discovers the secret of being a zombie. But it doesn't mean much to the audience The mechanics of the zombie material are vague and confusing. Halperin also uses a double image of Bela Lugosi's eyes from his White Zombie movie in 1932, but never explained anything related to it The story has a large gap, including a love story. The trend of interesting characters from the wheel at the beginning is gone for a long time. A potential villain has been unceremoniously eliminated before he can do anything. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of old funny movies, the zombie protests may be worth watching. At least once The show is not a bad thing, and if you have a good imagination, you can include interesting stories in your heart to fill all the gaps. But this is the second time that I have watched this movie, only the first thing about five years ago, and I almost can't remember anything - so it's not a memorable story.
