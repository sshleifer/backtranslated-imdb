A Christmas Story is a classic movie about Holiday and my favorite movie. Naturally, I was delighted when the film came out in 1994. I saw it as a launch day and prepared to enjoy myself. I came to dislike and not satisfied. The expectation that the real nest in the Christmas story disappeared from this mess. Curiously, the Red Gun BB Rider is better to get than Top China and it's not so funny. Charles Grodin is good, but Buck stopped at that Bottom line: 1 star. Don't even bother.
