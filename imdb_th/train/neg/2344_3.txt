For me, this just came out as a TV drama. I guess the narrative of the lost person is regarded as "Social criticism" But in the final analysis, I don't care how you create the appearance of this movie. There is no favorite character or participation. I do not feel the chemistry between Hudson and Bacol. If there is a love story here, it will disappear in malaise. And even with the end of the rotation reversed by Dorothy Maguire, complete and immediate (And difficult to understand) so the story is not enough to make me interested Regardless of Freud's symbols and psychology, this story is something that is unbelievable, insulting and boring. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is a famous wood. This is the least engaging role of Lorraine and one of her worst performances. Dorothy McGuire and Robert Stack give more inspiring performances. But her character is useless and he is pathetic. Robert Keith, as a father who loves the touch of two adult children with love, is the most sympathetic character. However, the most interesting thing is Robert Wilke, who looks serious in the small role as a bar owner. He is best remembered as a disgusting subordinate in the West. But here he is honest and pleasing. <br /> <br /> I use my social criticism with interesting and engaging stories.
