Private practice should be a medical drama. So I think my biggest complaint is the lack of initiative in the medical story. Just watching the house, I solved two medical puzzles (from nine items) before the doctor would do Boooring seriously. If you are a lazy writer, why not copy some cases from the old er or the obscure Brazilian medical soap? The house has just been popular - recycling. Their ideas are hard to get out ... <br /> <br /> The second largest complaint: these people should be forty - yes. silk? If so, why do they have to make emotional maturity of 15 year olds? For three weeks (Like all three episodes of cursing) that requires serious thought to understand that if your best friend doesn't want to be Your "useful friend" may not be because he wants to hurt you. But because he didn't Don't want to risk your friendship? All characters that do everything But being a psychiatrist - the whole story is unrealistic until you can't buy it to a "drama" that is worth it. <br /> <br /> And I won't start complaining. About what items made with Addison, everyone's favorite, as we have known her in the anatomy of gray ... in the sidenote, you don't think it's funny how Addison became a desire after those Lost Pete (Sorry, but everyone who tried to treat Can't sleep with Mozart's requiem as a doctoral loser?) And Derek entangled in a relationship with the lazy Meredith away in the rainy season? In addition to Mark, they seem to be perfect for each other. Sometimes I think the subconscious mind of Shonda Rhimes is trying to tell us that in our relationship, our first choice is always the right choice ...
