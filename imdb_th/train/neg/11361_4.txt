It's quite true, what these flies can do ... Eh ... This is a cartoon, so everything happens. <br /> <br /> At first I have to tell you that I love cartoon movies. Unfortunately, this year's drama is very weak. This cartoon has nothing but a list of bugs: <br /> <br /> 1) I refer to the tag line. It suggests that this movie has a great 3D effect. At least I can't see anything at all, at least there's nothing special that I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> 2) "Flies" In this movie, there is nothing like a real fly. At least they might make them black. But the blue fly seriously? With a giant head and slim body. <br /> <br /> 3) The story. I think it was written for a 6 year old boy. I can tell two sentences that it's easier. <br /> <br /> 4) Too much patriotism For example: "They are American files after all!" Oh, please rest.
