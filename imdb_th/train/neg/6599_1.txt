Who is George C. Scott? George C. Scott is a famous actor. All movies that he screened are better. Now, George has nothing to do with this movie ... But once he said something that describes the movie that was spoken to T. <br /> <br /> I don't remember the exact words of he got But in general he spoke Excellent writing can record bad performances. But excellent performances cannot record bad writing This little observation has never been greater than "Laurel and Hardy's new adventure: For love or mummy" <br /> <br /> The two performers are perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy ) Not only look at the different parts, but they do a great job in imitating the true agreement (Manner and all) this movie should stand as a testament to their abilities That said, this film is flat on its face when it comes to (You guess it) Writing <br /> <br /> In addition to opening the dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (which is "character") and briefly gagging about a taxi, this movie is a boring job. <br /> <br /> Problem # 1: Too much time and effort in planning. <br /> <br /> I don't want to. To know why the mother wanted to kidnap a lovely English woman What I want is to see Stan and Ollie. (Or at least it's their standby). The way that takes too much time on the screen is used to describe the plot or the non-funny secondary characters that say the plot has a rotation. <Br /> <br /> However, even though this movie is all a joke, we who have ... <br /> <br /> ... Problem # 2: Most jokes are what I would call " <br /> <br /> What do I mean? "Tide." <br /> <br /> In my body, the character gets hurt. Hurt in an exaggerated manner for funny effects (Ala Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ... or how about Laurel & Hardy?) <br /> <br /> in " Slapstick "(as I defined) the character is slightly injured or inconvenient, and the filmmaker plays it for funny results. <br /> <br /> Maybe the illustrations may help: <br /> <br /> In Looney Tunes, Daffy Duck was shot by Elmer Fudd. His bill fell and reused. That is a classic pain. <br /> <br /> In this "jewel" Ollie accidentally collided with some people. They turned their back to tell him to be careful and move forward cheerfully. That doesn't hurt That's not a joke That is just ... boring ... and this movie is full of this kind of joke. As if they were the bread and butter of this movie Writers and directors just take boring moments and act like they should be funny. Granted, the example I gave was the most severe case. <br /> <br /> The short story is short: this movie is not working because the script failed to take advantage of Pinchot and Sartain's ability to disguise himself as Stan and Ollie script will take advantage of comments and jokes that are not interesting instead. Watching this movie is watching two emulators who do not have content to work with. <br /> <br /> Not a good movie. But it is a good sleep aid. <br /> <br /> I said this one, missed and stuck with the real deal. (As long as you steer clear of "Atoll K" and "Be Big")
