How did this movie get ranked at 6.7, beyond belief? It doesn't deserve to be better than 2.0 and should be ranked in the top 100 of IMDb's worst movies of all time. The national treasure is a confrontation with national intelligence and is also an attack on the audience. American by Hollywood critics say that the plot story, you can drive 16 wheels. <br /> <br /> I like the righteousness of this movie ... "Nicholas Cage is cute". Surprising people Global think that the American people stupid. This is the most stupid movie I've ever seen. If you want to watch good movies this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways, national treasures. Unfortunately, it has been published more than those great movies. I bet that most of you who have read this have not heard them, because some of them have not been widely published. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is a great actor - when he was in Correct movie Over and over again, I saw Kage using his great talents in movies with horrific minds like Con Air, The Rock and Face-Off when his talents were well utilized. In the Adaptation of Charlie Kaufman, he is an incredible actor. <br /> <br /> The bottom line - I should raise my hand with a wood chipper rather than face the brutality of the image.
