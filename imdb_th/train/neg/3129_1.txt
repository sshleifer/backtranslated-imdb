I have time to kill before watching football, so I saw this film being presented in a scifi channel and it's literally after watching it. I think I met my generation of minds in walking. The movie that ripped the Mummy series and Jurassic Park was terrible that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it fell so deeply that the recent stock market decline seems to be a symptom. hiccup The performance was so poor that I hoped to be buried in the end. The leadership by Casper Van Dee made me want to have a high-level performance of Steven Segal in "On Deadly Ground" because of his reading of Woody Woodpecker's wood, thinking of making a cameo on his shoulder. I also noticed that his emotional range was so limited that I felt that my kitten was able to express better when he asked for popcorn to eat. The direction is very bad. I look back at the nephew's 3rd grade narration, which has a better speed and vision and the fact that this movie seems to have a connection after thinking about Fran. Such movies Is a show of FX respect for this movie so bad that I think the director and producer are eco-friendly by recycling cheap special effects from horror grade Z movies from the yesteryear. What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Jeffrey Lewis are doing in this film is beyond me and they should consider prosecuting their agents to misrepresent the truth. Causing them to share with the ruins of the movie My warning to one and all is to watch this movie at your peril, because this movie may cause your IQ to decrease by watching for a long time. In the side notes, I noticed at IMDb that sometimes the salary for a movie that was published, I wonder if it was the way the actor should give the salary back for their bad performance in the movie. Be careful and safe, avoid all costs.
