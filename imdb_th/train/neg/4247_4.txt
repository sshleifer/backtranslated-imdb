My predictable duke and drama, Garney Talks, my twenty-five, Garbo Talks has been anxiously prosecuted at the end of a low-quality quest. <br /> <br /> This film is a document of A young working man named Gilbert (Ron Silver), the son of Estelle Rolle (Anne Bancroft), Baroque, and above all, is a big fan of Greta Garbo. When Estelle is faced with a brain tumor, her son decides to follow his own mission: Follow Greta Garbo and take her to her mother. <br /> <br /> Ann Bancroft is full. Out of Auntie-Mame mode, chew the scenery here, where the favorite Gaza girl, whom she likes to talk to people and stand for her ideals and end up in prison all the time. She stood outside of this movie as an obvious invention and every scene of her was disabled. Every wrong note is outstanding. The remaining characters are equal in one dimension. But is much less interesting Ron Silver is as flat as possible, and the love he is trying to do is a graphic telegram like anything else in this movie: He is dating Lisa Rolf. (Cary Fisher Fisher) The rich, I call every scene three scenes before it happens. <br /> <br /> That's another problem. One-dimensional characters can survive if they are posted in interesting and fascinating stories. But nothing here The pace of this film is freezing, beautiful, with external material that is certainly not strong, and when this film starts with a linear plot, it is both vertical and not interested. There are many guest stars to speak, including Harvey Fierstein as a New York gay. (Imagine that) in a scene that is no longer necessary. <br /> <br /> At the end of this film, try to do half-way. A proper statement about the nature of the statue and its role in our lives. But at that time there was no character that had really existed, and this movie made me weary because he surrendered, so it acted like it was too small. Far too late This movie is my twenty-fifth film directed by Lumet, making him the most watched director of mine. But apart from the rival who missed a lot (Strangers among us all?) He didn't get deep. <br /> <br /> {Grades: 4.5 / 10 (C / C-) / # 21 (from 24) from 1984 / # 23 From 25 movies Lumet}
