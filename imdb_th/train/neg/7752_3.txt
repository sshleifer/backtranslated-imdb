This film is about the sound of a paw in the amusement park where teenagers are scavenger hunt. Because there is no rule that they broke into the building and started to be killed Death is wonderful and foolish. But at least it has a better effect I gave these three things because Stacy was in there and I loved the movie of Bluetooth. I think it's ok. But some people died outside the screen. There were stupid scenes in which two teenagers kissed each other and the head of the sabretooth appeared. Then the match stems up in the vents and bites the children away. The final death with the owner is all fake graphics. Even the death was stupid because the toothed figure had passed through his mouth and hung there to support and there was a scene in which a German girl lost her contact and didn't find them and seemed like she didn't want This movie is silly and a waste of time.
