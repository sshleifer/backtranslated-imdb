This film was created and cast from my home town. I can remember the annoying story and all the rumbling about the truth. Molly Ringwald is in town ... <br /> <br /> Story ... <br /> <br /> Basically 20 years after That the film was put to rest ", without completion, the movie group students began to finish it with the frightening results It seems that someone doesn't want this movie to be complete. <br /> <br /> The story is subtle. We have to remember that this is a joke, so have to use a small tongue in the cheek but there is no real trick Most characters are arrogant and little information you get about them that you don't care about seems irrelevant. It is strange to hear that Kylie's accent is Australian again and was glad to see the children I went to school with in the actors role. But that didn't exchange movies Goodness knows why the producers think they will get in Molly Ringwald, probably because of the nature of the film. (It is a homage to the 80s movies / horror movies that are not good) But in reality, the Aussie actors should do well. <br /> <br /> As far as casting is concerned The show looks like constipation. Some of these kids (especially the two main chics - they play as "directors" and "producers") seem to be trying to show them. That is, never looks good In addition, the picture also has a rough feeling. May be brighter? Not as smooth as it used to be. <br /> <br /> Will the killer be less scary? There are some shocking factors and there are two combined scenes. I like this movie But it wasn't great. It took 90 minutes but probably less. Maybe if they make the lyrics tight They have a lot of characters killed - but there is no real creation for them to be executed. Maybe if they kill people less and focus on the scary atmosphere, it should be better. <br /> <br /> Now I know it's funny and various elements are funny. Or unbelievably funny But I'm not confident <br /> <br /> LM
