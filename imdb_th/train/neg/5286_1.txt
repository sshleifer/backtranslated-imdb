I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and I ordered movies from Amazon, the UK, just seeing it without having to wait forever to come to the United States. What is Ann working with Wentworth? The whole point of Anne Elliott's character is that she is quiet and polite. She is not impulsive and rude. And Mary, are you suffering from a stroke or something? Her words are not normal or normal. There is no chemistry between the two main characters that make their "love" completely unbelievable. In the final scene, they also have Sally Hawkins wearing the same costume, Amanda Root, wearing between the letter scenes. The same clothes didn't make the same movie. In my opinion, they did not see the 1995 version, which, despite the flaws But still close to the book Books I don't think they will read. This is like the movie Cliff's Notes. Persuasion hit the top spot without explaining anything.
