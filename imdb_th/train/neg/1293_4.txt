I may be one of the few viewers who do not recommend this movie. Thought it was visually appealing to everyone like Ang Lee's work (Each frame seems to be worth printing) I was very disappointed with the disjointed rhythm of this movie. It's really long. <br /> <br /> The story is set in the Missouri Civil War era and is about a young man (Roedel) who joins the brutal forces of the Bushwackers who are traitors, conspirators. Perform geurilla, type, fight with their partner Jayhawkers He and his best friend, Jack Bullsill, played by Skeet Ulrich, joined the group after Chile's father shot an empty spot and his house was burned, presumably by the Jayhawkers. The following story is an adventure. In the attack of Roedel and Chiles and the interaction with other victims of the war, including former slaves who fought for Bushwhackers (Daniel Holt, played by Jeffery Wright) and War Widow, played by Gems. <br /> <br /> Looks like That every time That this movie develops into an interesting point, it will turn into other subplots and let things not be developed For example, the turbulence in Roedel's group caused by former slaves of Holt who participated in the cause of the federation would show briefly through some conflicts about suitability and protocols, and then fell until later in the film. Bushwhacker Minor / Rascal hates Roedel and directs anger and violence against him. But we never know why Some characters do not appear. I think it's because the movies gather too much, including a lot of history. <br /> <br /> The historical details are great. I like to see housing, furniture, clothes, etc. and I think the actors have done a great job in making the characters become human, even if they stumble on some conversations. Even if you enjoy history or a big fan of Angie
