The movie begins with a voice telling the audience where they are and who the character is. And that was the time when I didn't like the movie With endless possibilities that every film director has on hand, I think it's a simple and cheap solution to convey the situation with the voice that tells everything. I believe that the voice acting is a betrayal of the concept of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> I hate to hear from the voices saying where we are, the day we live and especially the characters feel and think. I believe that the director must find a way that can be seen to convey the feelings and thoughts of the characters to the audience. <br /> <br /> But after the intro has a bad influence, a very prominent movie begins. And continues for quite a long time The life of a middle class family and all members is a perfectly realistic image. I think the director has the ability to capture real life situations. For example, a father who has to call him privately from the bathroom may look unusual at first. But life itself makes us some situations that may look unusual But it is normal as well I think the director is a very good observer about real life. <br /> <br /> But that's it. After a while, the realism in the movie began to sacrifice the narrative. I felt like I was really a big headache because the characters didn't stop. It's as if the actors and actors get the story and are allowed to interact. It's really true, but the characters often ask "Is it really like that" etc. or say "No" or "You listen to me" ten times when saying that only once is enough to make me a headache. <Br /> <br /> I still think that the dramatics and reading scenes are much more than they should. I understand that playing and books in movies involves a lot of stories. But I think the director missed the point that he should stop showing these scenes.
