Ok, Hollywood isn't free. <br /> <br /> Obviously I'm lying because it's I am conservative But politics, I will stop commenting on movies. This film against Bush against the Middle East, a big anti-oil propaganda. But that's not the reason why it's not good. <br /> <br /> Never mind. I'll give you credit when the credit is due. I saw this film released tonight because I like this type of movie and is an important political science in collage. The movie is great and the performance is as good as I can tell. <br /> <br /> The plot is impossible to decipher. I have been tested and have IQ 138, but no matter how hard I try, there is no way I can combine the story of the movie and the characters that are doing. <br /> <br /> Stories and scenes There is a continuous sequence and a complete arrangement. <br /> <br /> Except that this is one of the movies that are intended to be viewed many times to get a very profound story. Think clearly what happened. <br /> <br /> The sensible thing, because if you want to argue with politics and don't receive any criticism, it makes your argument impossible! If you can't make them feel bright
