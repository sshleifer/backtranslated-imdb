Flawless computer images flawlessly on a fantastic background creating horrible predictable animations in this movie. There is nothing to surprise you. You can also tell that the voice of Brian Adams is about to come, which is always wrong. <br /> <br /> The main character, the horse spirit, gets annoyed Sound when he describes what happened No need to describe But because everything happens clearly You can tell what the horse says, even if what they do is that it will be good, but all the horses make the same sound - one for warning, one for sadness, one for laughing, etc. There is no change between the sound of the horse. <br /> <br /> Small children may be like this movie It's enough for families to sit down and watch and there is a little danger from everyone who is scared. If you don't have anything to do and want to watch movies with your children, this is not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> But otherwise not recommended.
