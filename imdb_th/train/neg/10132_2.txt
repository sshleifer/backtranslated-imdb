Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> American soldiers have just launched a fighter plane. New important stealth that can Avoid detection that is unique like a traitor pilot (Steve Touissant) steals it and plans to give the US government a ransom. So they were forced to send the best people of John Sand (Seagull who went) to stop him in exchange for his freedom from the detention center where his mind would be erased. All <br /> <br /> I'm skipping the Attack Force because I can tell from the cover and posting all the modifications that happen to be nonsense and when all negative comments and user ratings Low I came in. I thought. But I decided to give FOF because Shadow Man (by the same director) was not bad and what Seagal was one of my favorite actors and maybe he would make a great movie. Big again Oh, a fool. <br /> <br /> The gruesome video of an invisible stealth fighter aircraft, awesome camera work, cheap production costs, battle scenes that became Seagal's trademark and boring. Where does it go? <br /> <br /> Luckily, his next movie, "Once Upon a Time in the Hood" (which I will cross), apparently ended his contract with Sony, which has no meaning. Anymore Of these scary European action movies and his next movie, Prince of Pistols, may be a sign of returning to the cinema. Hell, he had done it before, and Stallone can do it before him (Rocky Balboa). <br /> <br /> This is not Flight of Fury. It's not even a flight of fun. It was a flight that failed to remove the floor. * * * *
