I am a big fan of Willem Dafa and have actually searched for this movie. (I have to get the 5th DVD of China!) But it's one of the worst things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The performance (except Dafoe) is terrible. Direct this (Although he did not receive credit as a director) and they have no visible talent for writing or directing (Attached to the Willem show; Giada leaves the business please!) <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. With the exception of a complete set of convictions without the motivation that was believed to be done by these two people (who had just met) in this house, Colagrande was sleepy. And the sex scene is really lame. Actually, I cringed twice on one of them. Yuck! Of course, they are not the least erotic. But only once that this movie doesn't make you sleep Then it was busy driving you out. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
