The music that is crushed on the nerves like nails on the blackboard, acting like zombies, is a shame that makes the actors lose without creating a second movie. Selection of all actors to be real zombies --- by actors from Sabrina the Teenaged Witch as heroes ... A terrifying movie, if "Stoner" is still around, it may be considered The cult movie --- but oh, so the actors may have been taken by the actors with their chapters being read as they slowly walked through the movie --- repetitive, illogical scenes were modeled after Township of AspenEver created a movie that is really complete and useless? Logic flew to the wind in an unconscious and pointless mind. "Mysterious" and not ready to catch the turtle in the ice box --- lowcut, legs - and Amazon! It makes me interested all the way; How the chain of serious accidents in the fog associated with many vehicles is watching the end ... such as after a ridiculous ray fight in a prison on another planet. Balance Chase refugees outside of the world that are hindering --- to the world! Don't let anyone in your popcorn, you may enjoy watching this one. It's terrible!
