I can count the number of good movies starring Joe Don Baker (one story). This is not one of those scenes. <br /> <br /> The chase scenes that never end, the conversation is dim and the waste continues Make this movie the top choice for sending MST3K. <br /> <br /> And that's the only way I can see this ...
