If you are a type of person who can get a very bad movie role, I recommend this. If you are not away This is a surprisingly cheap movie, and sometimes you may find yourself wondering if it's not just a joke that someone pulls you in. The most positive opinion I can do about this is that the responsible person seems to know that it is nonsense at the lowest budget, so at least there is fun here. <br /> <br /> But this is Skillfully received Their idea about the giant killer mushroom that was just a man was covered with a beige sheet with what looked like a trash can covered on their heads. Obviously, it doesn't mean seriousness (to say the least), but even if there is a disclaimer you will find yourself shaking your head at all the wonderful magic of it. Or laugh out loud as it used to be
