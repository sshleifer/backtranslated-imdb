Hamilton tells the story of four Hamilton brothers, teenagers, Francis (Cory Knauf), twins, Wendell (Joseph McKelheer) & Darlene (Mackenzie Gaines) & The most senior David (Samuel) Hamilton's mobile home is very much. Franics is not sure why & is not satisfied with things. The fact that his brother & sister were kidnapped, detained and murdered by people. In the basement does not help to feel relaxed or calm. Castle of Francis. Something that Francis knew was not correct. Finally, when he discovered the truth, things would never be the same again ... <br /> <br /> Co-wrote, produced and directed by Tchel Altier and Phil Flores Butcher brothers (Which is just another film director until now, April Fool's Day (2008) rebuilt) said that this is one of the 'Films to Die For' in 2006 After Dark Horrorfest (or what? Whatever the so-called) treatment with other things that I have seen, I think The Hamiltons is perfect and the most crap I found that the character was really bad. I didn't like it very much and the slow-moving story couldn't catch my imagination or keep my attention. It was 85 & a half minutes for too long. 86 minutes. There is a very large built for things in the cabinet in Hamilton's basement, and eventually it is revealed that he is a little boy with a doll. Are we really scared? Would that really shock us? Is that what we should be talking about as a credit at the end? The harmless little boy is the best 'twist' that the creator would think of? The tedious plot has never been so clear that Hamilton has received all the money to buy a new home because it seems that no one can work. (Except David in the slaughterhouse & I wonder if it's paid a lot) or why they didn't get caught earlier. The script tries to blend the drama every day with powerful horror, and it is a terrible job to combine. These two things together until the view is not memorable or effective. The really bad movie that I tried to say was good about <br /> <br /> Even though it was written and directed by the butcher, the brothers didn't listen. But there was no blood and there was a slight bloody scene Chained in the basement But nothing you can't do at home with one bottle of tomato sauce and a video camera This film is not scary & due to the setting of a suburban suburb that has no atmosphere or mood. Have lesbians and recommend kissing kisses But Hamilton is low and there is not much here for the horror crowd. <br /> <br /> Filming in Petaluma in California has a modern low budget about it. Not doing badly But quite memorable Performances by actors (with me) who do not know, nothing to write about the house & I can't say that I have never felt anything with anyone. <br /> <br /> Hamilton accepts important sins. Of being both boring and boring from Which it never recovered Add to the story that is slim, no blood, death and junk characters that you don't leave. & You have movies that don't impress me.
