I found that this movie is an interesting study about the causes and effects. But more than that The basic storyline tracks the lives of a number of people and their actions. (Intentionally and otherwise) affects the lives of others The location of the movie has a good contract. But I feel that it failed to deliver as promised There is too much time to tell the audience about chaos theory and there is too little time to show it. As a result, I never had a real feeling for any character and never had a good relationship with them emotionally. At the end of the movie I have an attitude that "About them all" The strong direction in character development will make this film good. But it looks fairly good
