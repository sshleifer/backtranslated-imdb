Have you heard of Taiwanese horror movies? Or any Taiwanese movie can be reasonably possible This is really boring, even though it has black magic, including the body that has been shriveled and the people who burst out from inside with thousands of eels. And gore, but not many Puke, blood, and other weak things. If you are waiting for blood, graphics or horrible effects, you will be disappointed. Obviously they don't use eels and anything else that has the highest potential. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good about this movie. The only character that is not sweet and a few black magic spells, like eels The story is confused and boring. Thin and annoying characters, including the main characters The horror aspect doesn't work at all. The most scary thing is albino women. (Not really scary) This is the worst horror movie in Asia I've ever seen.
