"Well, Chuck Jones died and let his character by adding a cheap explosion, an anime that pulled out of America, made it stylish and made the superpower" "but you? We are all not ready to have many performances in the works that are already present or not less than leaving the original creator's dream. "" Yes! And those things make us a lot of cash and we need more! "" But all women and children won't get annoyed or not? "" Hey, you're right! Set in the future, making them all the original characters and changing all the names slightly ... but not too much, even though we still have to succeed from the classics.
