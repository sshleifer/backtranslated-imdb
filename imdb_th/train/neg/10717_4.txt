I give this to four out of ten stars or points or marks or something. <br /> <br /> There are two really funny scenes in this movie, all with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear ( Greg Kinnear !!) Moving as agreed. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, trafficking in normal patterns, obvious speed and "sound track" is kind. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the two scenes that are really funny are related to Amy P. She is the person that Hee. In the animal model She is mixed with the male monkeys they made with SNL and Lucille Ball. <br /> <br /> I hope they (Amy P and Tina Fey) just flat, accepting that they do it for money because if they do It caused Palestinian Sarah Palin. Then I thought we could say yes. It's worth it to bring the black man back into the servant role that is really there to help you become more human. <br /> <br /> 4 outta 10, like I said, is a generous person. <br /> <br /> But not again. Woman, okay? Oh, I almost forgot my mother from "Two and a Half Men" in this movie, and she has some plastic surgery, so now her mouth looks like a mouth for 30 years, so every scene you live in, I like trying. To rearrange her face or gather it in my heart or just answer questions "Don't wait, wait, do you have surgery?" Because as a viewer, you don't want her to have surgery.
