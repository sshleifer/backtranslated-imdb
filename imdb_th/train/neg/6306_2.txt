Working at a video store, I have watched a lot of movies and sometimes I try to watch movies that are not too big. Proud to be one of them The initial idea of ​​telling the story of a black ship with a main crew during World War II has some advantages. However, in less than 10 minutes to watch a movie, you find that the main point of the film is telling about the racial tensions in World War II. The basic story is about ships, crews and exploits in the war. This main point will reinforce you to the point that it is beyond reality throughout the movie. I commend men who serve in the USS Mason for their victory in the face of adversity and hardship they have to endure. The film should be focused on the success that these people do for themselves, the navy and their country, and not creating films that focus on racism during World War II.
