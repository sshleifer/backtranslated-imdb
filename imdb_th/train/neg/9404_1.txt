This absolute trash is based very closely on Friday, the 13th edition of the carbon copy, acknowledging that it is an Australian movie with people who cannot perform their duties. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time as a child Inadvertently burned during the filming of a music video at Lake Eildon. Years later, the boy grew up and took revenge on anyone who came to the lake to film a music video. It's boredom and wasting time and money to watch it out of curiosity, or if you're an actor who wants to learn how to not do it (can't) Alan Dale's leading role in the drama Neighbor TV, but ended up at The X Files - how did it happen?
