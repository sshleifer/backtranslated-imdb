First of all, I think they are naughty to say in the credit that the story and screenplay come from Preston Sturges. Sturgis is one of the better Hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired However, it is not Preston Sturges, but Preston Sturges, Jr. This story is based on Robert Louis Stevenson's short story "The Bottle Imp". He will eventually punish him for hell. It doesn't matter. No one says that the screenwriter must be original. Actors are generally reasonably talented due to moderate writing that they have to translate on the screen. My biggest complaint came with the ending. The hero thinks that he discovered the way out of his dilemma. But trying to solve problems in a different way in trying to save the innocent life At first it seems to work. But it's true with the code of modern horror movies. They feel that they have to give the final horror doll at the far end of the movie. This is a foolish meeting. The older horror movies get along well with allowing the hero to come out at the end. There is nothing wrong with a good victory over evil, no matter what the current film makers think. You can make the audience scare well and also make them happy at the end. In fact, I think it's better.
