Wow! Why didn't anyone create a sequel to the movie that was rancid? Half Past Dead is a bad movie. But at least there is an idea of ​​what it wants to be. HPD2 has no clue about what it needs It is on the screen for reasons that I cannot explain. Spoiler: All movies are: Twitch (played by Kuput of Tha Dogg Pound) was transferred to another prison, which may have a box full. With gold inlay bricks In prison, a riot arose between rival inmates, one of which was a man named Cortez and Cortez planned to escape. During a visit to the marriage of Twitch's fiancee and Burke's daughter (played by Bill Goldberg), the daughter was kidnapped and arrested in the execution room. Burke was reluctant to make friends with Twitch and they had problems with stupid prisoners while discovering that Cortez had someone they loved. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is the sector. The most unnecessary extension since Universal Soldier: The Return. The script is terrible. The acting is scary. The conversation is funny and everyone in this movie is a parody. Look, I know it's a cheap movie. But that is not an excuse for these people who will not use the effort they do. No one in this "movie" believes in the characters they play. There is no one in "This movie that can be shown seriously in As an actor, Kurupt should be ashamed. His "Twitch" character is a naive puppeteer who takes most of his time while being jacked up. Bill Goldberg spends most of his time. The film is as though he takes PHD (data transfer size), the fight scenes and pathetic and poorly designed for action movies HPD2 quite boring, even when the action happens! Don't let anyone tell you that this movie is quite good. It is foul and is a major reason for people to disparage Follywood.
