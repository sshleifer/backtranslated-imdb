Wow! I remember many horrific movies that revolved around high school since the early 1980s. They often have incredibly stressful plans and many 27-year-old actors who pretend to be students. As I watched this film, I felt a little nostalgia that occurred in the 1980s. However, I found that the film was created in 1989? what do you say! The nostalgic factor ends here. It's terrible. The plot has the city prepared to close the high school and threaten to bus all the students to the high school in the city. Which is strange that students in this school have both richness and abundance In fact, the main character lives in the mansion. Make you wonder how they can't make money for this school to live. They have never heard of property taxes. Oh, but this is a player. The school board said they would make the school live if the student could raise $ 200,000. So the seniors do this. Um, you add $ 200,000, but instead of being a college fee, you take to help the high school you are seniors. And why are they shutting down schools that are overcrowded before the year ends? And ... Ah, forgotten, this movie is stupid and created in 1989 !?
