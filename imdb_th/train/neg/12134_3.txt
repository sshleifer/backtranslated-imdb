On the face of it, it should be a great movie, a great actor, a plot that has many possibilities and one of the best Hollywood behind the camera for the first time. <br /> <br /> However It's clear why it was 8 years before Spacey decided to try directing the movie again. This film has failed at many levels in movies with very few action scenes and most scenes were filmed in two places. It is absolutely necessary that the director must keep doubts and continuity. Not here. The great actor is horribly unusable. No one is more than John Spencer. At the end of the great year, this plot has many stories and nothing you haven't seen in the picture. Another hundred television movies There is very little character development until you are not interested in any of the protagonists. At least we know that Spacey has a lot of friends and is in a Hollywood studio to get out of this flick.
