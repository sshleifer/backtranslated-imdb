IMDb's guidelines state that you must declare if your comment has a 'spoiler'. <br /> <br /> Okay, this movie is about spoilers ... a story that reminds of things. It's a reminder of the story of a lost youth who doesn't know where he is going. <br /> <br /> I just saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival. This movie is not really bad. It is really bad. <br /> <br /> The performance is inconsistent. Most of the characters are ancient, with depth and farnsworth's performances are very bad. <br /> <br /> From the patron accent to the plot, nonsense to the 'graphic' elements, to the conversation and situations that are monotonous ... it sucks the great things <br /> <br /> I think he is looking for 'Cowboy pharmacy' that is newer and more modern with touch 'The natural killer', but there is nowhere sensitive to the characters, as in the past, and there is no astounding place (outside of the level of some stairs). Must have A). Edit the movie. <br /> <br /> (There is something in there to create and a clear proposal. <br /> <br /> With the story that should be worth ... If trying Reach out) B) edit the movie If it is cut to the core, it may pass. <br /> <br /> I will go below 1 if I can ... like maybe zero Kelvin.
