I rented this movie to see if the action movie stopped and there was a very grateful and dramatic action that made Kickboxer look like Die Hard Lou and Reb in Vietnam and when Lou recorded Reb from the gook. He will be shot in the head, one of the worst effects. The Vietnamese scene was taken in the backyard. I swear! Lu, now the brain is damaged and Reb and he lives together and owns the Super homoerotic bar. Lu believes that he will fight in the cage for money and Reb to kill him to come back to have fun. There is no good fight scene, so fleas are away from two fingers. The character character changes in a matter of seconds. One man is not good and in the next scene he is good. The performance is scary and the music is a touching song. Frank Stallone makes you feel sick. I hate this movie
