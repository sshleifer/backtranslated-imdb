I am glad to watch this movie for free because I work in the hotel industry and this movie comes to our film library. Nothing compared to cheap movies. But this movie has horrible acting and directing How can the movie be like this? The director should be blacklisted and for all the poor actors, of course, it is not a jump into the profession. Please make sure you don't watch this movie. The show is weak, the camera and the horrible director. There are a few other films that should be dubbed "LOW 10". Another example is "Dracula 3000". Those who make money from this movie should give for charity, so at least it has good reasons. br /> <br /> In this case, I will see 10 more items (or at least once).
