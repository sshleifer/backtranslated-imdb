I'm shocked to discover the number of fans that this program has. Haven't said that Friends is the most 'normal' and not as good as others do Let's see if it's not a selection of actors from Courtney Cock, Arkett, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Leblanc and who knows? I wonder how much Although the series is progressing, friends can be more predictable, weak and boring that I don't care about the least characters in the history of television - or their fate. And it became a joke in the first four seasons to be funny from time to time And even though these Hollywood actors from the film world, I still do not want to customize the writing in Friends, became an old story that I lost interest in this program from the sixth season onwards and for the episode end It is a predictable thing to say the least. <br /> <br /> The annoying thing, though it lasts for ten seasons while some of my favorite programs take only three, four seasons and eventually. Was canceled and Take out the air well The show should be stopped immediately according to the time the actor wants more salary. In fact, as much as the series fades away, it is a much bigger program than the actor, not the other side. <br /> <br /> When it ended in 2004, I was relieved to have Saw the sitcom on the back Now there is a discussion about a list of friends coming to our TV screen shortly. And for me I will not wait for it again
