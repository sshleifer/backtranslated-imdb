Eyes of the Werewolf (1999) is a really bad movie. The place is really good, but the overall operation is terrible. I hope filmmakers will spend more time on this project instead of accelerating production. Some blind friends get new eyes. The bad thing is that they are old werewolves. Nasty things began to happen to friends as he became a mysterious creature. Can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend can find it? Who is a strange little troll that helps him out and what happens to that woman's police? If you really want to know, take a look at the Eyes of the Werewolf! <br /> <br /> It's not a good idea for movies. I just hope that the creator will spend a lot of time preparing for the work before they decide to shoot a movie.
