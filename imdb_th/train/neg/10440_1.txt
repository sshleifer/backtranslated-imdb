Unless you are between 10 and 14 years old (except R ratings), there are some things you like One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we should see him more) and Sam Jackson has humor and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can consider her surroundings. Poor plot. Poor performance. Writing and shipping worse Special techniques that are depressing As far as the whole situation is funny, strange and scary, each person's important embedded situation is terrible. If we consider the action, there are some unbelievable action scenes in the movie that make you dizzy and there is something that makes you groan. This film has only the latter type. This leaves only a little. I'm glad I didn't pay for this. <br /> <br /> Despite having any ads, I can read and think, so when I sit down to watch, I don't expect anything good. I didn't expect But rather worried about going into But like a train wreck, one cannot look out And even without expectations, I was disappointed, not good, not even 'bad', it was a good material, I _very_ tolerate bad movies But this makes "Six String Samurai" (which I like) Oscar deserves. <br /> <br /> Not the CGI parts that are in the same company as Battlefield Earth, Little Man and Gigli. This method is organized. Rank 7.2 surprised me completely. Brainwashing or stacking the voting system is something I think is the answer. <br /> <br /> I can go on. But when I can say that tonight I saw a train wreck I have to wash my eyes 1 of 10
