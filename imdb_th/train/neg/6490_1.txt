Okay ... So I've seen many strange / strange movies in my day. Fear and hatred in Las Vegas is important when thinking of that thing again ... From here, whenever someone asks me what "Hey, what's the most unusual movie you've ever seen?" Slipstream is what I will say! And I do not mean "unusual" in a good way. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the movie, it is clear that this will be one of the movies "trippy camera effect". A little like flashing images on the screen, rewinding and forwarding words and scenes of people quickly, busy with colors on the screen, continuous flash forward and backward ... then you have a real show Random people get violent, shoot things / People say the most bizarre things that don't do much, if there is a reason. <br /> <br /> This film is about writers who start blending real life with books. his Writing and lacking a better way of explaining, you generally see that the "journey" that he continues in this movie is Johnny Depp. Similar trips to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but the only difference The only thing is that his journey is fun to watch, not pain! Honestly, I had a really hard time even ending Slipstream. It made my brain a little painful. <br /> <br /> I can watch some movies that claim to be this movie that has some differences in movies. As it makes it not only But unique But increasing the feeling of dementia ... other. The point is that this movie hurts your brain when you look. It looks very sensible. It's used to concentrate on trying to understand from what happened and even at the end. That you can do is Happy about where it ends ... and you can say that you sit through it! So in closing, if you want to watch a movie that will let you say "Hey things" over and over again, both loudly and in your head, go ahead and waste an hour and 30 minutes and check this. <br /> <br /> Mr. Hopkins, while I clap you as an actor and praise that you choose to direct the show .... please don't create a movie like this again. Next time, try to do things that require a great storytelling rather than a camera technique that often causes headaches.
