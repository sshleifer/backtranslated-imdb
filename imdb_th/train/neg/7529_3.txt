Bruce Lee is an excellent martial arts artist. But this movie is still one of the worst movies ever created. Bruce Lee died due to a helicopter crash after being hit by some ninja knives on the back of the neck. But it did not explain how he came to be a helicopter because the previous scene came close But not on a helicopter that has been in the air for 200 feet. It's completely ridiculous since then, like some things from cheap comic books May be a rotten idea But it does not happen with the art of the film's perspective There are many martial arts bombers that are usually produced in Hong Kong. I think Jean Claude van Dam has improved the genre by adding a rational story in his movie and having a filmmaker who knows how to use the camera Even Steven Seagal's films are better than junk movies, martial arts created in the 1970s and 1980s in Hong Kong. 'Game of Death II' falls into the category of junk cinema in my opinion. Lee will be in there
