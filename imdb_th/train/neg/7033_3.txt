Black Candles is quite messy from the same director who made us "Vampyres" and later "Rest in Pieces" among others .. I just noticed what I saw. However, we have lovers who make love, and then some places near the pins are placed over the voodoo doll and then pierced and the man is confused. Not sure if it's good for both of them at that point? Fast forward to the place where the man's sister came to the house to investigate and hear the readings of the will or something that happened, and of course everyone, other than her, was in something. It is very difficult to tell who is who at the time between the movie and sometimes confusing. To make things happen, there are scenes that show nature. (I hope it's a model) with a black goat. Ugh. Sometimes this echo "Rosemary Baby" removes the child because the hostess usually gives one female herbal tea and places the reeks of Satan herbs. These nasty things too, because that has been observed However, herbs are not the only thing that causes this film. The end seems to return to the beginning again and many viewers may find themselves wondering where they are in the middle. It is not absolute, not very good and I think everything depends on what you like to watch in the movie and here there is nothing much for me 3 of 10
