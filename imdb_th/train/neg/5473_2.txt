I have never seen these SciFi originals before. This is the first time. I think it's fair to judge the performance, direction / production, scene design, and even CGI effects in other SciFi movies to compare with your typical Hollywood production. Fair. I would say that the Aztec Rex in general did not remind Werner Herzog's masterpiece, Aguirre, Wrath of God. <br /> <br /> I'll start by noticing that yes, I remember this movie. What is more relevant to the culture than dinosaurs do? Although this is a sci-fi movie created for TV But there are some contexts that are related to the stories that I will investigate The symbolic elements are clear enough. <br /> <br /> So, as a student of history, theology, myths and movies: I found outrageous conversations and plot themes that are insulting. I did not ask the PEA rules. Any on behalf of the manufacturer - as I said before the movie is like that But what I worry about is that the majority of the minority population in this film may have to rely on television so that they can learn about history and cultural diversity. <br /> <br /> The main problem can be seen clearly. Most clearly with the Ayacoatl character (not a description of Dichen Lachman's performance, but the way in which her character was written, although I said she had a job to do before She will get the nod Emmy) It is through her character's actions in Spain, the Europeans were right. Her duty in this film due to Rios' love interest confirms that the European way is the right way, just because they are European. No other reason It was only the assumption that the audience intended to connect themselves to the North European Aztecs because they were dressed in language, ideology and others that they were more familiar with than the Aztecs. Saw that it was an opponent. 'And not just the audience was left with that presumption due to ethnic perceptions of the audience But it seems that the story really tries to convince the audience - as if the Aztecs can't make plans - if not the better ones - to lure the dinosaurs to death on the bed of punji sticks. <br /> <br /> Fairness has a subgroup of Spain that shows that it is a temple to steal property and the intention of abusing the natives. Mesoamericans There are also scenes in which we have sacred Christians who observe Aztec's success: "They have agriculture, medicine, calendars, etc." - but in the end it is also an Aztec warrior that has been shown to be the main enemy. Even movies 'Thunder lizards' (more later) He shows that he betrayed and repeatedly tried to send European Europeans romantically by tricking him into changing the psychedelic mushroom consumption to change the mind - an important spiritual element. In various aspects and religions of the native Meso & North American again That he can make a woman feel that he is his and away from the Spaniards. <br /> <br /> Now in analyzing the true nature of the story (Out of the Christian vs. Pagan theme that is clear from the table) From a symbolic perspective - viewers can easily bring these thunder lizards to represent MesoAmerican's ideology / theology, in which the film shows that Is one of the following intentions: bloodthirsty, mercy, cruelty, cruelty, evil or even evil? On the other hand, we have a group of Christian people, led by a young boy, Hernando Cortes, who shows her innocence. But overall, lambs that are trapped in the Aztec dark world In addition, the name of the film is the Aztec Rex, one of those who believe that it is about dinosaurs going out to eat people. However, what the Aztec Rex means is the Aztec King, the leader of the Aztec state, or in the 'living status' in this case (so why the film's name has changed). In fact, we can see who as the new Aztec king. ? It is the remaining Spaniards. Rios Aztec Rex refers to a new European ideology that overcomes the disease, bloodshed, war and famine of Native Americans. Rios is the ideal symbol of Europe - as the presenter of this film wants them to remember. (In contrast to Cortes, which is representative of 'Europe useful But still have the honor - Europe) but when you examine the devastation of America, let us be honest: the symbolic element of the story of this movie is not backward or <br /> <br /> I must say that Tex Rex is the worst racist person or will be kind to him without knowing anything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And yes, I know it's just a movie. All that means fun. I understand. But we eventually left the idea that Rios was the father of the remaining Aztec line. I wonder if Native MesoAmericans Must think of this ending ... For myself, I think it is a little self-indulgence. <br /> <br /> The best support of this film goes to Ian Ziering's wig - even if it can be seen. Clearly - at least changing the look of Ziering enough so that I wouldn't think I was watching yuppie from 90210 leading a group of conquerors into the heart of darkness. Ziering proved himself to be the third actor. I bought the car over in this film his show, or at least I was sure that it was Ian Ziering anyway, I do not know who he represented. But he should work more. <br /> <br /> At the end, it was a pleasure to see Jim McGee again. I am a big fan since staging a short scene in Scrooged in 1988. <br /> <br /> Alexander Quaresma - DeusExMachina529@aol.com
