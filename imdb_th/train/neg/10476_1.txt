I am a Christian However, I always wonder about movies produced by Christians. As a rule, they will "know" when talking about film production. I admire TBN that tries to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen However, they do a terrible job of it. The performance is terrible, and if no one is familiar with the Bible, in some cases, one person may not understand that the film is trying to skip anything. But the people who made it wrong However, in this "criticism", those facts are irrelevant and too deep to delve into. In short, the Omega code is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I won't recommend anyone except the jokes from every day.
