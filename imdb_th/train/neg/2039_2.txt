This film is almost unbearable to sit and watch. I got more than the fact that it looks like it was taken with a home video camera and this movie should be extended for several weeks at a time. But the character never changed the set But the show broke the 4th wall for me. I saw better performances in level 4, in addition to the unrealistic plot. If the man suspects that the man will make him come in, I am very disappointed that all the killings are done with a gun. That is not the imitation that the zodiac didn't kill by using a gun. Just the officer must know that it's not him. Another thing that really disturbed me was that they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4 When the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders is not the name of the disorder. Overall, I think this movie is not a type of movie that can be done with a low budget, at least not as low as they have or they can make sure they have better performers or have more blood Many people travel along a low-budget route without using horrible actors. See Easy Rider featuring Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and low budget.
