The story of Nikolai Gogol "Viy" has been filmed again and released in the home video in the United States through faith movies. <br /> <br /> The original story involves a priest who must look after the witch with his faith only. To protect him Extensively expanded and located in America, although clearly filmed in Russia (Houses, clothes and decorations are all wrong, despite the English signs). This is a strange movie that doesn't really work. Partly is a strange scene that tries a lot. Hard to be an American rainforest But it is not clear, there are some strange and deliberately deliberate moments as the main characters in the beginning of the journalists and priests in no time I'm not sure why they did that, even though watching DVDs.) The other problem is copying which is beyond horror. It is made in the place where everyone speaks when their lips are not in the camera - or if they are sounds that do not match the mouth flaps. I do not know if it is the fault of Faith Films or the producer who created the film, hoping to leave the West. (Revealed in the creation of parts) <br /> <br /> This film is not good. As I have said, it has all the technical problems that make it a strange ball. Even with horror images that look really good But this movie didn't work like a horror movie As a movie that creates faith, it is too confusing to tell the number that will make everyone feel closer to God. <br /> <br /> By the way I want it to pass Even in the bargain bin price My advice is to search for stories in the 1960s called Viy which will bring both trembling and understanding about faith in God.
