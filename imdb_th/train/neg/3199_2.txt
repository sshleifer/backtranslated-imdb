Joe Don Baker, he is good at "Walking Tall" and has a good participation in "Goldeneye" but here in "Final Justice" all hope is gone ... Dark side wins. <br /> <br /> Like most humanity, my main experience with this is in MST3K and what kind of experience it is! Mike and the robot dig the claws deep into Baker's flesh and flick this flick completely. Obviously, they just started with their "Mitchell" in their anti-Joe Don kick, and here they are still in continuity. <br /> <br /> It makes a funny experience. But: there are many options My favorites - "Sell John Rhys-Davies", "It is 'Meatloaf: Texas Rangers'", "None of them that are reasonably priced for sponges", "Why do you wear a prom dress for her to sleep?" My son ... 'What is he? What is your son: the son of a preacher? "<br /> <br /> By itself," Final Justice "is As Joe Don put in the movie "nada big fat" but here it has entertainment value You have a chance to catch this "Final Justice". <br /> <br /> Two stars for "Final Justice", ten for the MST3K version only. <br /> <br /> Oh and try not to go to Malta when Joe Don is in town.
