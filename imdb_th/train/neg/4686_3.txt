There are good performances by Robin Williams and others, but this movie is boring overall and very disappointing compared to positive reviews. <br /> <br /> I think Sy might become a serial killer. That makes people die Ugly clothes lead his victims to the food court, referring to Oprah and reciting their medical history until they ask him to shoot them. <br /> <br /> I think this movie attracts. The interest of native people who think strangers I expect most retail workers to rest from customers.
