Back in 1985, I caught this. (I can't call it a movie) with cable. I was in college and I was with a high school friend whose hormones were angry. I thought early that it was hopeless. The Stupid script (a group of old men hired some young people to show how to score with women). good (With one exception) and the funniest jokes. The rich woman here makes my friends happy while - but he's bored after 30 minutes. Remember - this is a high school male! This is back before the nudity is easy to access on the internet and so We continue to watch, hoping to have something interesting or funny. But never happened The funniest thing about this is the original advertising campaign that the studio admits that this movie is ridiculous! (One poster has a review, assuming "This is the best movie I have seen this afternoon!") Only Grant Cramer, who is the only leader who demonstrates his ability and has entered the career. No budget and bored & t skip it.
