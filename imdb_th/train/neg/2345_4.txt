I watched Written on The Wind starring Rock Hudson, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone - Robert Stack. Terrible - blood horror - he should be a charming jet millionaire - instead he came out like a jerk. The plot is stupid and failed, and the three "romantic" actors do not have chemistry. Dorothy Malone won the Oscar for supporting the best actress, although the characters in her camp were boring - thinking that the sister of Splendor in The Grass was full of malice and bitterness and lack of charm. The director Douglas Sirk has a role more than they will pass through the dialogue that feels forced and the result is a 99-minute time hijacked by the actor who plays as the leader in Get Smart.
