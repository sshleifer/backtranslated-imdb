I have two reasons to watch this swashbuckler when broadcast on Danish television yesterday. First of all, I want to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I am not disappointed. She looks gorgeous. Secondly, from reading the story about the film, I get the impression that there is a ridiculous humor unlike those found in Philippe de Broca's film. In this account I was very disappointed. I found predictable jokes. (In addition to a few observations about the topic of war) and characters in one dimension completely Action scenes were created in a style that is unique and unpopular without any feeling. I watched it until the end. But I was bored very quickly and sat there waiting for the scene with Lollobrigida
