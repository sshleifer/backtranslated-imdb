I can't believe that this movie makes it a video and the video rental shop is willing to put it on their shelves. I'm literary asking for a refund. Eliminate the fact that this movie has no historical truth and is still a movie that is worse than it had been found in video stores It's not good enough to call a movie that has a B rating. Don't waste money or time on this movie. Just following the list of sounds and scary songs makes me sick. Anyone associated with this film should be drawn from the union, causing the industry to have black marks. But after watching this movie, most of the time, I don't think everyone involved will be a union member.
