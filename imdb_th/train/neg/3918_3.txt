This movie may be the worst story I ever had in renting movies from IMDb's reviews. Overall, I just found that this movie is the second movie. <br /> <br /> Leslie Chong Can definitely pass through because the hero and Ma อูu manage his character with a cheerful ability On the other hand, the makeup of Ma Wu (facial hair) is obviously fake, so I can't be serious about him. He looks like a teenager who is overweight, dressed in Halloween with a beard. $ 4.95 <br /> <br /> The special effects look so good, even though the "undead" in the basement is quite good. The tree tongue looks like something from a bad monster in the 50s. Flick, but the view of the tongue from the tongue's perspective is similar to Sam Raimi's trademark in the last three episodes "Evil Dead". The final battle is boring as you can get. (In fact, it reminds me of the episode "Lost in space" closely where the Robinsons were caught in a sandstorm and ....) <br /> <br /> The plot is not particularly original and there are countless people telling. Times in the form of European fairy tales No doubt and without twisting the plan In fact, you immediately realize that you have been introduced to good characters, who are not good and who will survive. <br /> <br /> I just returned this movie to Netflix and I sat down. Write this review The first thing I do is check the production date. Yes, it says 1987 ... not 1967 that I think it might be. And that sum is quite close: the production and FX value is normal in the 1960s. The plot and action look much older because Hollywood created interesting and challenging films in the 60s. <br /> <br /> ** from *****
