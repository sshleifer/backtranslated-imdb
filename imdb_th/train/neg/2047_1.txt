I don't want to rant here, but ..... This is the "worst" movie I've ever seen. Worse than the avengers Improper governance, disjointed writing and scary performances are just consistent elements. Shooting a video that is very cheap seems to be a high school project. But without emotions Light often looks like a Sun-Gun only once. The sound is slightly better than the mic on the camera. But everything about this thing is a little scary The plot goes out in a strange direction without a foundation or correction later. The technical element is ridiculous. It's not bad enough to be funny. It is terrible. BTW Packaging deliberately mistaken. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate owes me $ 4.00
