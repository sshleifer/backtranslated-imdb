Everyone noticed that Tommy had only 3 facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1 An angry eye made him see every enemy. 2. Holding his hand to confront his mouth, gaping and fearful eyes. 3. Tommy Turnbull's smile <br /> <br /> I must say that I hate this show so much. But it's like Code Lyoko. We all watch at least once. Saying that this show is a racist, uninteresting, and pointless line. <br /> <br /> Every episode ends with a robot win, except for one case, basically the robot will let the freakazoid look scary. Too fly on jetpack. <br /> >> Funny gags are too rough. I think most people say "suck" or fart. I think the gangsters in the show are quite shocked. <br /> < br /> There is no hidden bowling ball Forget the hatred of him and another chain for the sake of God, he will go to school now. Not to mention his brother, who is psychologically bound and has no other character. <br /> <br /> All the performances I feel are tearing megas, XLR and Fosters. As you can say, all three. People from random, jamie and Kiva as well as Robotboy that are similar to Megas that he wins. Everyone, regardless of odds and freedom, is brave, even a robot. <br /> <br /> Not attractive. For this show, I was surprised. It is still running
