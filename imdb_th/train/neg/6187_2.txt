This is a very short disappointment. Until now, the worst modification of one of my favorite novels The conversation was horribly clumsy. I do not feel the feelings behind the words expressed by the characters. The lines were sent hastily and felt quite out of place. They can refer to the statue as well. Chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York does not exist and the American look at Rochester feels strange. At least he can try to pronounce the English accent. I like George C. Scott as an actor. But this doesn't work I felt like watching highlights from Jane Eyre, where the main story of the story was randomly taken, regardless of the story. The scenery and music are all very good. But I do not feel the passion and love that should be between Jane and Rochester and the movie makes me totally captivated You watch the 1983 BBC series with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or the 1997 version with Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton. Both of these are great adaptations.
