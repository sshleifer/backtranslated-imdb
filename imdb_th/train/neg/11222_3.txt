Cybil Richards brings the masterpiece of the full moon / Happy Surrender Cinema. This time, Jacqualine Lovell (wearing a silver dress) is assigned to destroy all sexual evidence However, she couldn't resist watching the tape and she liked them. The sex scene was filmed well and set up as a great soundtrack. (At least for this type of movie) Most actors are scary and generally look normal as well. Jacqueline Lowell is a very attractive herself and during watching the sex file she can reveal her breasts and feel a little down. She is also suitable for little lesbian activities. To be honest, Lovell deserves something better than this type of fare. Here she looks very good, but is actually more charming than in her money dress that describes the 'drama'. The most junk movie with Lowell and the soundtrack is the only true redemption Moderate, even for the productivity of Surrender and clear that the new budget is low for them as well.
