After watching Blanche's first 20 million times (sorry that I couldn't get more than this), I now insist that she doesn't. <br /> <br /> In general, this "movie" is an insult to the French actor. Truly participating in this garbage It started with a successful concept of using French comedies ("Deux heures moins le quart Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs", ...): Historical movies with this tone / dialogue. Can provide excellent results if supported by excellent actors and "Finesse" of the direction. Avoid the "heavy heavy" comedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Lou Doillon must face everything and Blanche instead of being funny, just change to Horror movie The horror of the movie cinephiles that want to be puzzled and shocked to see the top performers such as Decaune, Zem or Rochefort who are struggling in a funny story.
