Because Little Mermaid is one of my favorite Disney movies when I was young, I wanted to know about the sequels. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid (one) is a classic animated movie with every High quality Score and target general audience On the other hand, Little Mermaid 2 is primarily aimed at young children because it is natural, reflecting their own views of children. The music is less active and amazing, and the ending feels like a rest. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid 2 began when Melody Baby was presented to Ariel's family. Suddenly without any eye guidance to help the giant bearded giant I laughed. Wait a moment. It's not funny. Children are attacked! Okay, I'll stop laughing. Morgana's crime in the daytime and her naturalness bring out the potential drama because it happens quickly. <br /> <br /> Melody seems superhuman, which I protect is the way. Most children see themselves. The quality of Melody's character is clearly shown when she fights with Morgan without fearing her face. <br /> <br /> Like the first film, Melody has many problems with Ariel except The opposite Queen Ariel became like her father by restricting her from the ocean while Ariel and Triton's limited king from the surface of Ariel and Melody rebelled against the rulers. <br /> <br /> This song is moving. More emotional than the first time The sequel to this story has many songs. But there is not much music work about the band It's great for children because it doesn't use the orchestra to impress them. <br /> <br /> The ending of the first movie is strong and leveled up. The sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone plays in the water. It is definitely a goal for children, of course, because instead of ending with solemnity and leaving you to the end, this makes you think. "It's time to relax!" Finally, this movie is fun for children, so we should let them enjoy.
