I just read a book about Dillinger. This film is horribly wrong. It's like they have names and create everything. Rob and his resting place are well planned until the second - when it's time for them to leave if they have all the money or not. They have records of every road that turns, etc. Purvis never saw him at the restaurant. He said Dillinger paid his food after Dillinger went out. Peris never even saw SAW Dillinger before the night of Dillinger, who was killed with only his photos. The way in which his gang members died is a lie. Dillinger never robbed the bank himself as he did in this movie. If I had never read a book, maybe I was happy with the movie. Performances are quite superior in place. Too much action In the second thought, I wondered how I would enjoy it even though I didn't read the book.
