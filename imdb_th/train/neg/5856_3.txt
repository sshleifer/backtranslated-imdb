T. Rama Rao created a very beautiful film in 1980, but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot grow in the age, style and fashion change. He likes to stick to the style of old-fashioned movies. <br /> <br /> The actors are not bad as well. In general, Kapur Kram performed two functions that believed in the role of his father and son. But the flawed script often makes him look funny and pathetic. Rekha is good but then - she's always good and here she has nothing more than this. She made the best of what she received. But she always did that In summary, there is nothing good at all. Raveena is ok, which means ordinary, not bad, bad, nothing. <br /> <br /> This movie is absurd. Maybe it's a delayed movie? Even though it is still below standard The script is terrible. This movie has too much and the story is endless. It feels like a movie created in the early 1990s, but the script makes it look older than that style like in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Not recommended unless you're a big fan of Starring actor
