War, Inc. - Companies take over the war in the future and use the killer Brand Hauser (John Cusack) to work wet with rival CEOs. Dark comedy movies biting army and companies often difficult to understand what happened. I wait for the right thing There is no reason or madness. <br /> <br /> Cusack is considered "Spiritual successor" to Grosse Point Blank, like more or less war. We see Cusack again as a killer. Protect * Spoiler * The person he should kill while he captures with conscience. Good of him To be fair, John Cusack has a credible nature that will easily take half a dozen people. The fight is short, looks good. The rest of the film is not. It is all quirky, often bordering on the bizarre War Inc. Not funny enough to mock and exceed expectations for everyone to think about what the text of this film, which I think may be. The cruel way that companies like the war department and competition, regardless of How does it affect the average person? Interesting, but the words don't work because it's not funny and is the heart of this movie without heart. We should give a curse about the war that affects the shell of the character of Cusack, rather than the millions of lives that have been torn out of the war. <br /> <br /> John Cusack gives good performance. His characters capture the hot sauce and drive the smallest private plane. But quirk means changing the character Marisa Tomi is sluggish as a romantic love reporter. There is not much chemistry between each other. Hilary Duff tried to use the Russian accent and did not fool himself. Joan Cusack just screamed and lamented and withdrawn. Blech Ben Kingsley might have to return the Oscar if he didn't start a great performance in Now, pathetic <br /> <br /> It's not a scary movie. But in the end, you have to ask: "What war is good for it?" Nothing really. C-
