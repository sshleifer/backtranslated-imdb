I totally hate movies. It's a moron They need to receive acting lessons .... Don't wait. That doesn't help because the Brother group. Do you know why I'm here even though I'm a Naked Brothers Band? To warn people before they watch the dumb movie so that NBB will not receive money from it, so they can't create stupid songs, amateurs no longer have to slow down until the old ones. Only But only retarded But they sing badly Ok, I like to leave the movie here ..... However, it's boring and they act horribly. It's not funny even though they try hard to make it. I guess they deserve credit for this ... Uh, the movie isn't worth your time. Just watching the score of the movie (and the series) is very painful to watch anyone with half the brain. If you like it seriously, you have to go to see the movie that the actor actually acted without having to talk about monotone. I am at the drama club at my school and there are some people who are better than Nat and Alex before it's too late! I think Herbie Fully Loaded is better than this Poopie. I don't even know why I passed half of this movie. I don't think it deserves to be called a movie ...
