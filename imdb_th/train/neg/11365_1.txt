This is a really sad movie. Nothing happens in this movie. The script is not good !!! I guess they just copied the first 15 pages to 90 pages. The producers had to think that we had created a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They are not successful Now, in the third week, it is only available in Antwerp and Brussels at 22h45. In the past, we had very good movies in Belgium, such as Daens Shades, a waste of your time. Maybe you can sneak into the cinema after you watch the actual movie. If you see the shadow for 10 minutes, you'll see everything. It was advertised to death on radio and local television. I hope it will disappear in the Shades soon.
