In one word ... deeply, I gave this star for a hippie sex scene and a woman with an otherwise sweet eye. Corman's worst attempt was no bar. Benveren should have his name permanently blocked. I can't believe that this will be on the DVD (as of 2/15/05) and "Wild In The Streets" - another fraud I woke up on the bed this morning with coldness, decided to watch a movie to cheer me on. Some people scanned the digital channel ... The place looked interesting enough because I liked watching B-movie sci-fi movies, hippie culture and Rebellious teenage rebels seem to be very familiar, and when Ben Beren joined the show, I thought ... Why? It was a big mistake ... It was a terrible start for my day. <br /> <br /> After watching it, now I know why familiarity has come into the brain just recently. Wake up I remember seeing interesting places for this movie at the age of 14 years (I'm 45 years old). Go back in the early / mid seventies at Sombrero, a local art theater that no longer exists. ... All theaters laugh like crazy and Even wailing loudly that this movie looks terrible Will watch after my warning. Remember ... "I told you." <br /> <br /> "Gass-sss" is the perfect name for this movie ... You feel " Gas "after watching this rotting movie - or maybe you Should be taken to the "gas" room to get rid of your brain I used to watch home-made Super 8 movies that made this movie embarrassing. Of course, it's a new addition to the Top Ten WORST movie of my time ... It's there. (Uh, go down there) with "Mustache" <br /> <br /> Ted in Gilbert, AZ
