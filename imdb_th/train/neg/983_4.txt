When Marlene Dietrich was poisoned at the box office in 1938, one of a number of female actors who were named after the trade documents, it was a movie such as The Garden Of Allah. Which is amazing and looks boring than me How is Marlene if she tries to expand her boundaries and doesn't play sexpot that is stuck with this old-fashioned story beyond me? <br /> <br /> The Garden Of Allah, one of the first films of the era Modern technology Is a series of novels that changed centuries ago by Robert H Jains, who collaborated with the drama adaptation with Mary Anderson, who ran for acting 241 in 1911-12. Then there were two silent screen adaptations. A story about a monk who escaped from a monastery in Tunisia, France to see what he had missed in the world. He ran for women with similar protections that had not been married and spent many years taking care of sick parents. Now she is traveling in the desert and the two meet on the train. <br /> <br /> This girl, of course, Marlene and the escaped monk are Charles Boyer. I'm not sure what is in David's heart. O. Selznick in the filming of this story Some people, like Ingrid Bergman, may make the audience satisfied. But you can bet that the movie that went public in 1936 when they left the money to buy tickets, they expected to see Marlene as a new era Salome instead of a saint with that name. The people still remember that Rudolf Valentino and you can bet that it is love and temptation that the desert they expect. <br /> <br /> For the monks you have to remember them. Support themselves in their monastery One bottle of special wine that Boyer is one with the secret The monastery must rethink that it is economics if Boyer goes out. Sincere from extremist groups But from the chief man Charles Waldron coming down, they have the right to worry a little about their interest. <br /> <br /> However, there are many religious recitations here. By leading to a pair that is not suitable for parts Mostly, especially Marlene Dietrich. I will watch this movie with my eyes to see the desert movies, special colors and forget about this.
