Yesterday was Earth Day (22 April 2009) in the United States and other countries, and I went to see the full version of the movie "Earth" by DisneyNature. I guess, as with car manufacturers, Disney is trying to convince us that they are Pay attention to the world Maybe they are interested in this world. But I don't think it will guarantee a special unit with the word "nature". In that I know that my youngest daughter likes Mickey Mouse and I will tell my personal feelings about Disney. <br /> < br /> Apart from the amazing movies, it was a disappointment for Disney for me. Led by a half-dozen Disney movie trailers filled with Disney clich√© ("The Circle of Life", "Falling in Style"), an amazingly exaggerated song, a recycled video (Disney claims "40% new image"). I started to think that James Earl Jones's narration was already bored. I like James Earl Jones But his work with Disney and Morgan Freeman, who made Warner Brothers' narrative, began to thin. I think Disney bought the amazing nature of the BBC that they created. That it will sell itself if they slap the musical instrument and the bite that is known on it. <br /> <br /> And what Disney is passionate about hunting, chasing and killing baby animals? There are half a dozen scenes, with the children singing loudly. I think Disney needs to realize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and the battle for death that attracts the attention of teen action movies that their parents dragged to the film. I also realized how Disney stopped short, not that the man was involved in climate change. Are they afraid of the minority who deny that they think it is still a controversial issue? <br /> <br /> I would suggest skipping this and renting a Blue Planet DVD on Netflix. It seems that natural movies are best done in England at the moment.
