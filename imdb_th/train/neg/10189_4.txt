I saw this movie many years ago and I was impressed ... but then again I was only 12 years old. I just watched it again and needed time to come back. This movie is quite bad. While I like Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (see My Bodyguard (1980) if you want to watch the GOOD movie that he is in ... of Meatballs (also starring Bill Murray) for laughs) <br /> <br /> However, Frank Linhart, the character of Lee Majors, is a racing driver who is planning to drive a race car. (Which he kept) throughout the country to California. One problem: The government has banned all private transportation. I think the concept is valid. (Not a worse thing than I have heard), but the executions failed horribly
