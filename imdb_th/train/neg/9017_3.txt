I caught this movie in sci-fi before heading to work. If you're interested in seeing Dean Cain diving and avoiding being wrapped in flames at least once, this film is for you. If that is not the highest point that you are interested in, I am afraid that you will want you to be someone who is wrapped in flames because this movie is quite bad. The acting to start is scary, scary, scary. The characters are completely disgusting and the dialogue is worse than your typical Sci-Fi grade movie. At the end, the movie begins to remind me about 'Hollow Man' (ending by escaping through the elevator shaft) except the dragon is not the guy Naked and invisible Different from other similar flicks, but this one is not very bad ... It is just plain bad.
