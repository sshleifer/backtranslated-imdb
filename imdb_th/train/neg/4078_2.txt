Jessica: The ghost story is the name that represents the ghost story. That theme is awesome. But came close to comedy. <br /> <br /> A woman who was brutally murdered returned from death. This is what the film tries to pass on as a plot. There is nothing more. The film consists of a continuous scene involving a man who has a relationship with this woman before she dies. <br /> <br /> Immediately from the opening scene, this movie has the character of "Frankly-DVD". Trying to be different from gems such as VACANCY 2, movies have no direction or creativity and of course movies. "Straight to the DVD" is a bad name! That direction is as bad as it can be without complete fear, fear or stress. Although the elements of the drama are hopelessly managed and represent something more boring than the worst drama you may have ever encountered. <br /> <br /> The whole show is the best. The balance has no related actors. Demonstrating the lowest potential of a successful actor career. <br /> <br /> Each scene is incredibly long, with a break between conversations. I'm not exaggerating! <br /> <br /> The only reason I rate this movie more than 2 stories is 1 because some bad performances combined with a bad conversation makes me laugh inadvertently. I emphasize the word "little" in the sentence. That is not an overview of the movie "Bad-Bad-Good" like CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh like crazy, watch those movies. If you want to watch the appropriate horror movies about ghosts, see THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, CHANGELING, RINGU, EYE (traditional Korean version), GRUDGE, one lost call or phone. <br /> <br /> Who do I recommend? Which has good luck in avoiding seeing Jessica: ghost stories to keep up the good work! Just forget that this movie exists, don't think about it!
