Bela Lugosi is an evil botanist who sends a poisonous orchid on their wedding day, stealing his body in a fake ambulance / his corpse. The second actor who plays the ratings tries to unlock a scary and scary mystery. It's a lot, but you can tell that he wants money. <br /> <br /> This film is extremely scary and most actors are probably better than standing on the waiting table. But the plot of this story is amazingly ridiculous. Tell everyone what happened in that and they often laugh and want to watch movies. I received a DVD in a 2-pound discount store for 1 pound, which I think is an accurate assessment. Anyone who pays more for this thing will not be on their mind.
