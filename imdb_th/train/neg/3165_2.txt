This movie is terrible. I think every good actor should be better. Don't waste time. Eva longoria parker is terrible. She should be stuck with a desperate housewife. Paul Rudd became an actor The chaos that he made in the movie I can't be your woman is the best of what I say. And the bell lake she is cute But need a lot of acting lessons Looks like heaven with Reese Witherspoon ... it's much better Or other ghost movies. You will be grateful for not wasting your valuable time. PS I love you too. It's a good person, too. It's time to start watching movies that have more than 7 out of 10 points and listen to people who have already watched.
