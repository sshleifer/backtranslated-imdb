Last night I watched this movie after receiving good reviews from many sources. I would like to point out that if you are not ready to try and work continuously, who is who and everything means that you will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm still struggling to make Understand the role of the actor In this film, the movie jumps from a different story and does not allow you to really sympathize with any role. <br /> <br /> For political films and those interested in corruption in other world governments Have this movie May be quite good But for the average movie viewer, this movie is quite uncomfortable, very boring in places, and you will make the movie theater confused and annoying that you pay the first fee. Not 100% every minute detail or the politics you are interested in Don't see if you like watching movies
