I rented this movie because it was under the "love" and "west" with a view of the Grand Canyon. But if you expect Western romance to forget about This movie is a pure trash! The romance is a story between an underage girl and a middle-aged man! Children also have a lot of sexual needs. It is boring He tried to chase her out at first. But eventually he gave up and they drove out to be happy and happy couples. It's disgusting. <br /> <br /> I don't see that this movie will attract anyone besides the pedophile
