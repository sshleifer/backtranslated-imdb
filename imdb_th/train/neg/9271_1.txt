For a small minority who saw here admiring this serious GET film, I knew it was a personal opinion of the public at the end of the day. But anyone with more than two brain cells can see that this is all garbage. Terrible that is not worthy of being part of this franchise. I can assume that those who say this great is a friend to someone who is involved with this movie and is trying to push their career badly in all areas. The story is the weakest form of the program before the script is the same. Trying to hide the lack of originality by using a woman instead (WOW!) Do not disguise the filmmakers lacking ideas. There is no qualification in exchange. I received this singer award, just making a mark to have someone to bring people to fund this shit. They have to spend more effort to create a film of shame.
