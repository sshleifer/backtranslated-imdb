I am considering this from one observation that I saw last night (9/27/06). I don't think I will watch again. The show is completely wood, a completely predictable plot, a completely unrealistic ending - I mean, who would believe that a 30 million dollar decision for the death of a drug addict lost from Cancer, leading actor (Victor Garber) looks uncomfortable until embarrassed in his role - maybe he knows how bad the writing is !! I realize that the drama presented this season is quite pathetic. But they can find better writers Maybe they're hiring to write to India or China !! I'll bet we won't see this season next season!
