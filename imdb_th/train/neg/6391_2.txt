Usually, hg can be used and it never bothered me before - I like "bloodfeast 2" but I don't like scam science or play heuristic. This film is based on men caused by electrical accidents and witches. I'm not against witches and I like "carrie" (novels and movies), but this one bothered me. I think it is because the main character that develops esp from electrical wires. In addition, the university professor also wasted time studying various cases I didn't live in the 60s to know whether first-hand whether it was unusual or not. But I think that any theory of nature like this will be discredited. What really disturbs me is the way the police describe schizophrenia as an unpredictable villain that can look like 99% of the time and just snap. Nothing will be further from the truth. I hate such ideas because they increase public stupidity. Many people still think of schizophrenia. Anyone who writes this script doesn't know much psychology. <br /> <br /> There is a concept that is suitable for movies. I like the way witches use men. It's a good change I like the way she can make herself charming. But not when she was near her forced lover I found it interesting how her second lover burned his face. If the script has been touched for a few weeks before production and is not focused on making the audience sleepy alone, this may be a good movie.
