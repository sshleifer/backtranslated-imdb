In this movie, about twenty minutes, I'm already bored. Quite simply, these characters are quite boring. Sometimes something fun will happen. But then things will slow down again Fortunately, my patience was finally rewarded and the ending of this movie was not bad. However, it is not good enough to show sitting in the first ninety minutes. So I would say that this film has a moderate overview and considering all the abilities of the actor, I would call it disappointing.
