I read Tom Robbins. 'Even though COWGIRLS accepts BLUES as a teenager, I love every word. It's sexy, funny and full of beautiful scenery and beautiful writing. But when I watched this movie, I couldn't believe that it was boring, sour and unhappy. how did this happen? I think there are people in Hollywood reading this book and submitting it under the heading "GAY PRIDE - WOMEN - LESBIANS" (that is the subject of the Library of Congress). Now anyone who is over 12 years old will read the book. Know that it is not really related to lesbians than STAR WARS is about space travel. Obviously, this book - and I mean OBVIOUSLY - written by a heterosexual man who loves lesbian thoughts. (In the nude all the time) but never met anyone. <br /> <br /> Still, someone in Hollywood says "Oh, oh, should this be given to a gay director or a gay man would be better?" Nothing with that man, but - but he may be really gay - he has no clue about how to create a funny movie. Gus Van Sant, the imagination of a playful and guilty woman and an action watch, turned into a lesbian poster, a power character treatment. It's like changing the Oscar Wild comedy into a tragedy of Arthur Miller. <br /> <br /> The main clue that Gus Van Sant does not really know what to do with the source is casting. good His influence makes him the best hire. His shyness about his true subordinates (Fantasy of straight men is not a gay pride recruitment poster). But not only good <br /> <br /> Come and meet with the actors of COENGIRLS Blues. <br /> <br /> PAT MORITA as "THE CHINK", the Asian actress, who knows a few names and Pat Morita on a happy day is quite funny. But the selection of him while THE CINK was wrong was wrong. Pat Morita didn't know that Chink was a very funny person (Gus didn't tell him). Pat didn't know that Chink was like that .. well, SEXY !!! In the book, he's not smart. Mr. Miyagi He is more like Hugh Hefner! He is a very horny old goat and he knows a lot about the happiness he received from his husband and Bonanza Jellybean (you see in the book, they're not really lesbians. Did you know that this is the fantasy of straight men? <br /> <br /> JOHN HURT is "THE COUNTESS" Okay. He is a gay friendly person. But he is a serious actor SHAKESPEAREAN !!!! You need someone who enjoys and enter the camp for this role. For John Hert to play as a fool, the Countess is sad and sad. I always expected Paul Scofield to walk in to dress up as Thomas More and shake his head sadly. "Richard, do you know that you have completely lost your soul for the shame of the old students of Me! "And yes, John Hert is a funny person. (And cute gay) like Kaligula But that is the humor of BLACK, not humor, playful and cheerful like the book. <br /> <br /> RAIN PHOENIX as "Bonanza Jellybean" has no ability, no training, no problem. Except that in the book, Bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful (mostly), heterosexual and loving In this movie, she is sluggish and uninspiring. For her tastes for women, Robbins in the book makes this like "God knows that I love women. But nothing can replace the right man. "Ergus? Have you read this book yet? <br /> <br /> UMA THURMAN as "Sissy Hankshaw" This is a difficult role in the book. Sissy is a cowardly and really cowardly heroine. Even so, the more successful actress may blink in her eyes or sway in her walk to indicate the hidden strength. Uma didn't pull it out, probably because Gus never told her Sissy that it should be fun to be a beautiful hiker and a giant thumb. Uma plays her role more than in a television movie about a girl with leukemia. <br /> <br /> The film is sour and boring. And I accused Gus Van Sant!
