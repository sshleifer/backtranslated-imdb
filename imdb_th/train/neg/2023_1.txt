As a conclusion that you just expressed the most stupid comments I've heard about RPG games, do you think seriously whether they are gay or not? Are you mentally retarded If you go to help your best friend and someone decides from the goodness of his heart to help you, then you are a serious debt to the people that Lavitz is a good person and every time they help each other make them He became more close as a friend. They are not gay lovers as you like. And so you know that this game is set in medieval times In the past, women had just prepared food while men were fighting. Do you know your history? Do you know how long women will be accepted in the army in the present day? This game has a lot of realism, even if you are too slow to capture it, and you have to separate the evidence clearly instead of using an uneducated hypothesis.
