Briefly discovered is a terrifying and pointless remake of the 1945 David Lean classic, which is based on the play of Noel Coward's "Noel Coward". The doctor removes gravel fragments from the woman's eyes at the train station. He has a miserable relationship. She happily married a social worker of Italian ancestors. They meet by chance on other occasions, forming an attractive place and meeting every Wednesday. Both fell in love. But after spending a few afternoons together, they knew they had no real chance of being happy and agreed to participate. Coward's first dramatic performance involves two ordinary people who fall in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two superstars and Hollywood Epic veterans, are common concepts. In particular, Lauren is a different story - Sophia Loren is a million dollar face, working as a voluntary social worker at the Citizens Counseling Office. Burton looked at the hypocrisy that had hair dyed, too much makeup, and couldn't find the platform shoes as your general practitioner. That said you can't really blame them for adultery after seeing their spouse Burton married a literary critic who spent her evenings writing poisonous reviews and treating her husband by insulting Jack Hedley, Loren's husband, the potter around the house every day and the most boring thing. The most exciting thing he ever did was almost six years ago. Their final scene together will cause nausea. ("You are far away, far away", etc.) John LeMesurier, an outstanding British actor, has a cameo for three minutes as a friend of Burton and seems to be slightly more drunk, speaking his voice too. The sound that is heard It was a sad and memorable performance in the form of a horrible classic cinema. Avoid all costs.
