I bought a DVD version of this movie based on the advice of my beloved wife, the version she saw on television. But the version inserted into the DVD is disastrous. The light is not good at all, and the whole scene is easily cut off. There is one example in which Adele is going to sleep and we will immediately cut the other scenes into the middle sentence, which is the next night. Characters like Grace Poole and Mason have never been used to let someone wonder if they will. Doing a few minutes during the movie <br /> <br /> The DVDs that we saw were produced by Platinum Disc Corp at $ 6.32. It is gyp. <br /> <br /> Please be careful of this movie you bought! We sent this back.
