When I go to see a movie about zombies, I do not expect to show the oscar caliber or writing at the level of The Godfather. No, it seems that it will be printed 10 minutes before the actors will read into the camera. This movie is terrible. Actually, I got up and left for about 25 minutes and then went ahead and watched the Cold Creek Manor that wasn't as good. But it seems that Citizen Kane compared to this garbage collection in a positive way. The girls are very cute. That may be the only thing that keeps me in the seat for more than the first 5 minutes. Will attract my attention after that.
