Entering this movie, do you know that the film has six lab technicians in the sealed lab along with an invisible madman? You are immediately guessing who will live and who will die. Ultimately, the survivors are the ones that you expect to be, so there are no points for planning to twist. <br /> <br /> And if you're not sure if this is a movie B or a movie that just Happened in a laboratory with interesting stories. William Devane participated: Instant movie status. <br /> <br /> The movie is likely in the beginning. At the lab, we were introduced to an invisible gorilla that is becoming increasingly violent. Oooh The best scene in all movies is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again. Excellent special effects The same thing when they made Bacon unseen. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of bare breasts, really funny jokes, and enough to swear to vote for this unwanted movie. > <br /> For the thriller, there is no surprise, except when Shue behaves like MacGyver in the freezer, which is 'Whaaaa' rather than OK. There is a surprise. That was when Ken (Bacon) returned for the last time in the elevator shaft. It's amazing But just because you shouted at TV 'Noooo! You are dead! End the movie! 'Speaking of shouting at the TV, that's all I did in the last 25 minutes.' Put on your #f% @ glasses! 'Instead of wearing their infrared glasses so they can see him, they try. Other tricks in the book (fire extinguisher, sprinkler system, fire ...) <br /> <br /> The story is lost at the end. But the special technique is good That's the only reason I gave 2/10.
