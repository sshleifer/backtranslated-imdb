I can't show most reality shows and this list is the worst one with Paris Hilton and of course it's his company, but "have you been fired" or "are you hired" for now? How many seasons? After watching the program, I didn't want to work for a man with his ego, and I think watching the paint has more entertainment valves. <br /> <br /> I like to hear only one person, get up and say " Donald, I broke up and collected your money and bought a good hairstyle. "I saw that he was trying to buy a celebrity in WWE wrestling. I hope he gets hurt so I don't have to see his poor face anymore. It must be sad to want a bad reputation and no ability and make yourself try to buy it. I will give this mark as negative if possible, but get 1 and not appropriate.
