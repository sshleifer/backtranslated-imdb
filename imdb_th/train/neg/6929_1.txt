I read reviews about this movie and decided to shoot. I am open-minded and I have received good reviews about poorly measured flicks. When the final credit ended at one place, I searched for the meaning and good things to say here: "This movie is short-hearted." That's all I get. The image was very good and the music helped the hospital's mood calm down. But this film is very painful to watch and the endless dialogue is far from good. I found myself laughing at this movie. But the way you laughed with your best friend who just embarrassed himself in front of a large crowd And let the corpse fall into the place where it fell I don't know what can help this movie. The show is not bad and seems to have a budget. But there is no way to make it look Not even the appearance of beautiful bare breasts Maybe I should spark a doobie or drink a lot of beer to get the full experience of this movie. I didn't watch this movie again unless I was really depressed. Then I could tell myself, "At least I wasn't in Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon. I'm better than those."
