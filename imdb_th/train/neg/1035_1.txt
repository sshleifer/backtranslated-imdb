Awesome performances, awesome actors and cheap props Would be better if being set to act as a parody of a movie, starting with the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Enemies", the name "action movie" will make it better. (Contributing to parody) Police look like a 60-year-old player. The blonde girl has the same boring appearance on her face all the time. At the end of this movie he and she are working together to get rid of the bad guys, and every time they exchange words, it feels like a cheap line that has been received before the horror sex scene. Don't waste time.
