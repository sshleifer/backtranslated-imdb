Is it a thriller like I thought when I saw the cover at the video library? Not it is 'Food ideas' while the author tried to do, right? Not really. What is it? It is a very ordinary movie that has high potential and is well directed. But there are stories that are confusing without strengths, beginning, middle, and at the end, with bad performances expected from the serial killer that even though he looks too diligent Delivering the best performance of the performers as a whole. It's a good movie with good colors, cool, high tech, beautiful scenes. But causes you to get lost as you go and where you go And with our feelings, hurriedly wrapped it in the end OK to see that there is nothing on TV.
