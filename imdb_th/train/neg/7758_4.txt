This movie has a lot of blood flowing when attacking it. I like it when men and women are having a good time. Then Sabrette attacks the woman and eats the stomach and brings the liver out. That is the best thing and 1 ton of sabretooth that walks on its front leg. Hilarious to make this movie better and say less. If you know what I mean and please please. Have made anothwer movies like this movie It is terrible to live 1 sabretooth and kill the woman. In the end, this movie reminds me of the dissatisfaction that always ends. There are 1 enemy left! I condemn it. This movie, I can't believe that I like it very much when my brother is frozen from the stomach attack and causes blood to flow.
