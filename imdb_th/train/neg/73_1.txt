This is the worst garbage I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is impatient. Does he look deformed? I hope I know that he and Naomi Watts are objects in Real life because I spent the longest 2 hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. <br /> <br /> Orlando Bloom is a bearded dancer with long stretches and a headlamp deer. Can't say I agree. <br /> <br /> Chase Blackburn Huddersfield's identity from a set down to wait for her incredible /> <br /> I should feel <br apologize to the banks and murderers? This is a far way from Butch Cassidy, which is actually an entertainment movie. This is a monotonous and boring thing. We can't rest because we believe it will be better. <br /> <br /> In the last 10-15 minutes, hilariously unintentionally. Heath and his gang are trapped in a border hotel and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not a joke But it's funny when they walk out of the hotel with armor because what we can think of is the black knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I'm waiting for them to say that "I will bite your legs away!" We laughed more like other members. When we left, everyone said that this movie was a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I might not. Pay to see disaster (see for example), but it's not absolutely free. It costs 2 hours in my life that I will never return.
