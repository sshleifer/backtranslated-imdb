Sean Bean is great as well as shooting places and costumes. However, the plot is quite confusing and the conclusion is flat. The story has been completely changed from Cornwell's novel and is not a better story. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better to read. Sharpe was narrowly drawn down here, in contrast to his intelligent and determined autobiography, despite his understanding of his new role as an promoted officer. I enjoyed the short scene where Sharp was "the real" staff stumbled and after stopping and staring quickly, immediately pushed the surprised and shocked officers back. It sets the tone for his later experiments as a supervisor. <br /> <br /> Score: "4" of "10"
