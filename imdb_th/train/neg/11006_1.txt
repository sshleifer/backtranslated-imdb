This movie is a star, including "SlapChop" Vince Offer (author, composer and director) and Joey Buttafuoco - not a name that definitely sings "quality" and with elevation like "Supermodels taken away" (it's something It sounds like) people who rob sperm banks ("Rhymer"), necrophilia and rotting bodies in the fetus market Should be them out of the bottle) funny and gay, a lot of jokes about the giant phallus that is superhero and forced to abort These games are incredibly painful (eg "Batman and Rhymer"). Performances that are not good enough to be considered amateurs and this film is raw for the benefit of being crude ... and really. I believe that a group of 8-year-olds can create movies that are more fun at the same price. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie resulted in a lawsuit by "Slap Shot" Vince. Science Frankly, I don't know who will root in this case !!! Obviously he was accused of anything. Scientologists Destroying his reputation and sinking the film Regardless of whether this movie is a junk drove from the beginning to the end and 99% that is not fun (by comparing Ebola more fun) ... and this is the most delicious thing I can say about movies. <Br / > <br /> By the way, IS Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") wearing diapers and participating in stupid porn movies It's amazing that his career can overcome this.
