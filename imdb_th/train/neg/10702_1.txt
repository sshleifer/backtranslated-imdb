Dialogue: Pride, clichéd; Performances: hammy, clichéd; Synopsis: predictable clichéd <br /> <br /> Just Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski made in this "B" garbage? Plummer has been established for decades before the film was created. Kinski has masterpieces such as "Tess" and "Cat People" behind her ... must be hopeless. > <br /> Every bad guy has a bad accent - * Not good * Focus on bad sounds! (Plummer especially! * Where did he learn to do "German") and most of them had bad shoes as well Every innocent person threatens them too much to make you laugh. The good man survived among other things: * A knife threw a 5-inch knife buried deep in his shoulder, just pulling it out and a few seconds later using his arms without difficulty. * Marines' machine gun ( I think some people call it. 50) In the legs, which he used to bandage and wrap his legs and afterwards, he almost had no limbs. * Many fist fists that he sustained many punches including a skull run - into the door frame. Looks like the third floor is on the sidewalk without any signs of distorted ankle or other inconvenience, such as this script. There are 3 wise lines. <br /> <br /> Okay, it's not bad at all. Plummer has brought some classes to his part and is undoubtedly the best actor. But he can do the evil villain without using the ham technique that most villains use here. But he always knows that you are watching Christopher Plummer who shows the villain. <br /> <br /> This movie is a really great waste of time. Such performances were the 007s' 70s film that passed through the woods with the scene of Bruce Lee's apparent battle. But not even close to Roger Moore 007 or Bruce Lee's movie, don't bother
