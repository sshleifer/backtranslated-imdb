Umm ?? I agree with the reviewer saying "The stranger with good taste has reviewed this movie." I think this movie is interesting enough to be watched. I think that is because Marsden and Speedman - not the plot. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this film has a mildly attractive temperament in one hand and deeply insults on the other side. Thumbs up on the former and third thumb I'm not sure if this film is intended to promote dialogue or to spread fear and propaganda. <br /> <br /> I think that acting is normal. Many conversations about reality are about 90 degrees. I want to get some meaning from the plot. But in the end it was just a conversation with a madman (Speedman). I felt a bit sorry for him (Speedman) because he lost. But not really His loss is not greater, and of course less than the losses that occur every day around the world for more important reasons. <br /> <br /> This film reveals the innocence of AI. V / AIDS? Yes: that is from the target group Is HIV a mysterious and evil dark killer? And what about the victim The answer to both questions is no. HIV and victims do not have bad intentions towards others more or less than lupus, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, hepatitis, cancer, cancer or their victims to the extent God's salvation Just because the contagious disease does not make it intentionally or negligently - or is evil - is it just <br /> <br /> Is this an excuse or a foolish risk? - Does anyone should have safe sex? - Yes. Safe sex will save the world? - Does safe sex come true in all cases of love and desire between a man with passion and emotion? ?? Of course not. What kind of world will we live in if everyone follows the rules? No one is risky and sex never happens and is passionate? Am I ignoring whether this movie deals with gay sex in particular? ?? Yes. HIV is spread by sharing blood or body fluids between infected people and non-infected people. No need to have sex in the transmission of gay or otherwise. <br /> <br /> I am often disturbed by the intentional violence of one person to another. I think this film serves well to show the absurdity of Tom's violent kidnapping, imprisonment and intentions on the land and the frenzied violence that occurs every day <br /> <br /> The stream of consciousness. Movie: Tom is crazy. <br /> <br /> Why did Dan not ask "Why?" "What are you doing?" Meaning: Men who have sex with men receive "AIDS" implies: HIV = AIDS. Where is Tom's responsibility for sexual acts? Why is Dan's responsibility to use condoms? "Maybe you slipped before you caught it in?" What are we talking about here? Is one of the parties unconscious? "Maybe you don't want to hear the truth." You're kidding me. "She is in heaven and hurts unbelievably about what she knows about me now" right? Life of Dan is greater than if he had HIV. Certainly not! Why is the whole world incriminating? They think that gay men are the cause of HIV that they will give to the rest of the world and we will all die? Are you kidding me ??? Stupid enough to think that homosexuality is the cause or not ... is it a problem? Do we feel that about the victims of TB? Of malaria I can see that Tom was injured due to the death of his wife and he blamed AIDS. But is it serious? Who's wrong here, victim or virus? Is illness the responsibility of the sick person? (Assuming that they do not seek and do not try to spread the disease) <br /> <br /> Of course, safe sex is necessary for a safe life. But not driving, not flying, not going out House without life Do we want to blame this disease with victims? Is safe sex between Tom and Dan preventing Tom's wife's final death? Maybe, but not solely Dan's responsibility. <br /> <br /> Tom, crazy. I'm not talking about that. <br /> <br /> Tom and Dan: "Maybe you get what you deserve. Get "Come! 24 days: violent, innocent, and incriminating. <br /> <br /> Do I do a lot? Maybe. But I think this movie points to the gay man because of the negligent and malignant intent of "the opposite world" by practicing unsafe sex when the rate of homosexual sex is safe. together We all have to wake up and be serious about HIV / AIDS. HIV is killing hundreds of thousands of African people every year.
