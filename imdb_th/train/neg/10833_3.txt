I want to like Magnolia The plot reminds me of the Grand Canyon (which I like) 4 different lives / stories that come together at the end. But Magnolia turned wrong half way through the movie. I almost closed it. But I felt that I should be there until the end I almost screamed with discontent after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants was the frog scene. My DVD player still does not forgive me and I am not blamed at all. It's a unique movie. But is a movie that is bad, boring and pointless
