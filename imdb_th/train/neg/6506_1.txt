Unless you are a cute film student who must see everything, this movie is not only But will waste your time and money and make it very disappointing But it also makes you angry beyond belief. <br /> <br /> There may be a story worth telling inside. But Hopkins decided to hide it and encode it under the constant chaotic layers of micro-video, random sounds that were noticeable. Wanting someone like Hopkins to choose a project that is very hard and difficult and certainly not like the first script, first score, and third movie that everyone can guess. Maybe he could play with it in his mind for a long time until it became something that could not be remembered even for himself. The results prove that he has not enough experience or skills to achieve the desired result. <br /> <br /> Even the strangest Carpenter and Lynch movies. Less characters and 99% more stories. <br /> <br /> Sir Anthony, you aim at the stars. Please stick to the show in that department. You are a giant that is unparalleled and no one should ask anything from you more than even yourself!
