Christopher Lambert is annoying and frustrating in his paintings as GIDEON. This movie may be a classic that Lambert performed like Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt. In RAIN MAN or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in I AM SAM because the story has meaning to us in life. The show sponsored by Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters is excellent 3 out of 10.
