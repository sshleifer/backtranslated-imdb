This is a terrible movie of any standard. Match Point stories have clear directions and attractive directions and writing (Woody Allen combines his culture with traditional English murders and explores what can be done) <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> Scoop. However, there's nothing like this. It's not well written. The two leading actors are made of wood, hopelessly and the story doesn't appeal to anything. The fraudulent category requires at least a subcategory that has a witty description and tie. (Why tarot cards and keys kept under the French horn in the locked room?) <br /> <br /> Allen is happy and witty. Various Hollywood types (Curse of Jade Scorpions / Purple Roses of Cairo, etc.) make us happy over the years. Even the Hollywood ending has a very important idea. Sadly, his inspiration made him deserted this time.
