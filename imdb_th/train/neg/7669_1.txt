This film has been successful in being one of the most unique movies you have ever seen. However, this thing comes from the fact that you can't make heads or tails of this mess. It seems to be a challenge created to determine whether you are willing to walk out of the movie and give you the money you pay. If you don't want to feel yourself weak, you have to sit and watch horror movies and develop a poor feeling for the relevant actors. They all see better days. But you know that they get a lot of money To do this and you will lose the same feeling as you do in the movie. I can't say enough about this horrible movie. It's almost what Ed Wood will do, and in this case it will definitely be his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> To start you Forced to sit Open a conversation that you have never seen / heard. This is five minutes long. Moreover, there is a lecture as suggested that the audience cannot read. Then we will meet with Mr. Slater and the frightening line attack is proceeding as if he were working just to line up to the movie poster tag line. Soon we will meet Stephen Dorf, which I always like) and he tries his best not to drown in this matter. From then, the most insulting Tara Red has a wise role. Oh, help us too! Tara Reid is not a very talented actor, and in any way, she has an ongoing role in the film in my opinion, even though she should be attached to the American Pie movie. You might want to see this for yourself when it comes out in the video. I know I kicked it out. I mean, let everyone be honest here. Very happy in the shortcomings of others
