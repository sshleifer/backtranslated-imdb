Gayniggers from the Outer Space concluded that its name is quite large. It only takes 27 minutes. It describes the spacecraft of gay blacks who came to Earth to release men from women. While I saw little importance with the plot, it was really unreasonable. Get it meant to be a comedian / sophisticate in society and science fiction. I found myself laughing many times, so it was a success. <br /> <br /> Scary special effects. When the spacecraft floats over the earth, you can see the stars that are zooming in without a clear reason. The asteroid appears at first, disguising the device on the ship. There is no reason there are many spelling mistakes in the text. The actors are not reliable. The characters are confused In general, all things are not serious about themselves. If you go through all the aspects that make it a bad movie, it can be easily accessed and viewed easily until the end. Some are hilarious But overall, the only thing you can remember is that it is one of the most ridiculous ideas ever. <br /> <br /> Seeing that it's a short film. A little long I can't really recommend it; If you watch it, do it for a unique concept, not quality.
