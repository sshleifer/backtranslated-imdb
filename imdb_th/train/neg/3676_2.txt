Susan Swift is an attractive child, a flower that was planted in the 1980s (like Susan Dey's girl), but she did not have an amazing vocal range and she liked to sing. Even so, she was quite sweet and had bright eyes and a beautiful smile in the "coming" (as was called when released in a short movie theater). Swift may be the spirit of the Salem witch. Flick is a very low budget and borrowed from many other pictures that I gave up for about 15 minutes. It started strong and had some interesting camps. Obviously there are more serious movies that deal with the Salem witch trials that deserve to be watched through this film. However, when the movie is garbage, it's not bad. Boston's location is definitely an advantage. * 1/2 from ****
