I am not the only one who admires the first movie of Sperman. The movie that Richard Donner performs expertly. I'm not alone in watching Richard Lester's Superman 2 movie that leads us to the Richard Donner cut of the same movie. Sadly, it's still a nasty thing. The right place Needing to not believe in a large amount, but Superman 2 extends too many things Does not matter who will direct the Superman 2 because the script is insulting the intelligence of the first elementary student On the one hand, there is no plot because the characters do not have the motivation to do what they do, unlike the original Superman. With or without his power, Superman's power (or lack thereof) is managed in the least convincing manner There are too many criticisms, so I won't bother. I condemn this movie ... Maybe the screamer in the Leicester version is appropriate for the moronic script that this movie created is terrible.
