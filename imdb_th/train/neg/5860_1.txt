It is difficult to say precisely about the horror of this film. All new vocabulary must be invented to explain the lack of something complete, even remotely remembered as 'jokes' or 'entertainment' in "rabbit testing". Therefore, to support this future effort I suggest this word: <br /> <br /> "Hubiriffic" (adj.) The combination of 'hubristic' and 'terrific'; Used to describe too many ambitious debacle, such as the movie "Rabbit Test." <br /> <br /> Joan Rivers and "Hollywood Squares" producer Jay Redack used rare talent in the 82-minute season of cruelty. Collect planes! Funny style with the collection mold (Note to Joan: German doctors are not funny since Vaudeville). Cut off from their graves in the Catskills - that's not good enough, but the crime in this movie is a form of Directed by River, which can be described as the most ugly and the actors of both past and future are eager to please, they overcome even the weakest jokes. <br /> <br >> Adrift in This Sargasso Sea of ​​sap is Billy Crystal who is indefatigable in his first acting role in the film as a supporter of Lionel. Watching the crystal in this picture is like watching a blind man walk in a minefield. Finally, the reflections of the crumbling became a semi-permanent condition, a cheap joke, after a cheap joke exploded on his face. <br /> <br /> I can guess about the type of audience that might like the rabbit test. Cabbage, shells and lizards are slightly sluggish. But for self-awareness, human thinking - I would recommend pouring bleach in your eyes before I recommend. "Rabbit test"
