After reading a book that has many meanings for me, the film doesn't give any feelings to this book. This made me wonder if Kaufman liked this book because he succeeded in doing something else, whether it was bad or not. The most important, where is the light! From the first scene, the music drew most of the dialogue and feelings, and this would continue through the film. I think the creators think that playing rhythmic music through this movie will make this story look light-weight. They completely failed here. Instead of a song that gives everything 'The feeling of the movie' in a way that causes an event that makes us linger on it so that everything feels really heavy. <br /> <br /> An example of failure to adapt is this. The storyline makes it even more amazing. In the film, we see Franz through Tomas on the road, which is traveling to see Sabina. The introduction of this meeting / passing of opportunities, which I am sure does not happen in this book, is more important to Thomas's story than to make it bright. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples at the continuation of The story has changed imo for the worst. However, this may happen because this book can't be converted into a movie as well, like Kundera's style. This makes us wonder if every reviewer on this website is written with a book. And experience in movies rather than writing about movies The movie is as long as it's not sold. For those who haven't read the book, I suggest reading For those who have, I must say that you will waste time and may end up here writing a similar warning that is clear.
