Back when Alex Baldwin and Kim Basinger were Hollywood's hot and powerful lovers, they filmed a remake scene for director Steve Mac. Queen-Ali McGraw, it almost worked for the first time because McQueen was an important person on the screen, even rocky, quiet and tired. Baldwin is not in the league of Steve McQueen. But he is charming and probably a better performer. If so, this is not a demonstration of his features. Basinger did well and certainly looked good. But James Wood is a heartless person in the magnetic mob role. The plot of the sub-story involving a couple who was held hostage by former Baldwin's partner was unable to stand in the movie '72 and played even worse here For the action scenes, they are quite old hats, which makes anyone wonder: why have to create a new original again? ** from ****
