Otherwise it will be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. My wife and I were tired of our minds in 10 minutes. Not having to talk about boredom. It's unbelievable. Women (not lesbians) don't shower together - and don't kiss them unintentionally. The brothers did not live well together in their 30s and ran around, dancing together and participating in footraces in the central garden. Men didn't know that their wives and sisters kissed each other romanticly in the night. Before marriage and never talk to that wife <br /> <br /> Heather Graham may be the best actress in this movie. She smiled when she should cry and vice versa. The only movie she did well was Boogie Nights - and that's because she didn't show. <br /> <br /> I can't stress how bad this movie is.
