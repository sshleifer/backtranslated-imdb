This movie is a disgusting and memorable Sean Connery vehicle. Performances are generally crappy, especially Capshaw, Fishburne and Ed Harris. Connery seems like a pale like a Harvard scholar. This movie is definitely worse. It was a third rate puzzle that became a very invention at the time it was solved. This movie shook to support the great actor George Plimpton, playing a small role in adding some gravity to Connery as they argued the death penalty. Violence and atmosphere create a mystery / thriller at the third rate which is manipulated to the highest level. Scripting and poor direction The charm and appearance of Connery is the only virtue of this film. Violence and nonsense management 2/10 Avoid
