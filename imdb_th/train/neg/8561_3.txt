The cowboy may make you slightly hurt in the saddles. Not one of Johns best movies. Of course, don't understand. I'm wrong with the movement of John Wayne. There are always good points. And this one has a fair share But overall, slow motion and not as inspiring as it should be. Bruce Dern once again worked as a villain. Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the movie. But should be better This will be a good movie for eight to fifteen-year-old movie viewers. <br /> <br /> This will be a good family move to watch with your children. Just know. Look before you let the young people see it. But most children I know who have watched this movie Probably because they saw the children, their age, all the hard work
