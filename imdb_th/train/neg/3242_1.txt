This is a comment for people like me. This movie sucked from beginning to end. I threw the popcorn at the screen and used the entertainment myself. La MSF2000, plotting against the events and relying on the stupidity from people who should be wise. The actor leads the victim into the fight, and it doesn't happen to her that she will be punished ????? And she is rich ?? And she is a famous psychologist ????? Coming to people, she entered the bar at the most convenient time when everyone gathered to talk about her participation ??? That was the scene that felt like slapping the face of a half-witty movie audience. Rain people will be insulted. I admit that I insulted Mamet's conversation with some obsession for the meat-eaters who started the war and those wearing fur. My hatred is complete and resists logic. But i will give it a shot That it shouldn't give a real sound. Well, I don't care. It's something everyone talks about. SAME Mamet can't create a character What he can do is persistently our voice towards us through different actors. It is not surprising that his actors are wood. They are confused about everyone who is the same character. (However, his later movies developed)
