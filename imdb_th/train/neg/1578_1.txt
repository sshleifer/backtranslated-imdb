Imagine it, telling time 12-1 pm - at home, you're tired, you're not tired. This situation occurred about 4 years ago .. I turned on the TV and flicked a couple of channels and found that the film was open. OH MY WORD This is the worst movie I've ever seen! Uncontrollable cars to stop (Because the brakes are cut or something) to throw it on the freeway - what will happen! This movie is terrible, really funny - I think the stunts of the show cost about 2 dollars. There is one example that a baby / small child is being pulled out of a car by helicopter - to try to stimulate the audience. The bridge approaching ahead ... This is the best of the movies that had been bitten - it showed that the boy narrowly lost the bridge. But it looks terrible - you can almost see the model they use. Cant remember the end of this movie But I think it's great. <br /> <br /> I wonder if they will show this movie again, so I'm glad I saw this junk!
