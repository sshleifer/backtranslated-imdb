And that's all about this thing. Slowly, the actors are talented. They don't seem to have the motivation to use their efforts. The plot is not very large and is hindered by all the awkwardness of it. There are some English accents. Uh, many people should be Danish. OK, the accent is not important, but the language is that I don't think they use words like "yes" and "ok" on Beowulf's day. And that is how the ultimate weapon that the king gave him? Did he ever load that? Has he ever seen it? Or is Beowulf a bad target? At least his goal was to match the computer graphics used to create monsters. Those things are quite close as well. Bad special effects, bright spots? Only one person I can think of, Marina Sirtis, has been in operation for many years.
