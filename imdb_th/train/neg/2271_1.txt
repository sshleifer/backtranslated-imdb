Someone may create a great documentary about Jerry Springer Show, but this fictitious version succeeded in draining genuine and interesting things from the TV trash phenomenon. There are dozens of illustrious films (such as "Manos: The Hands of Fate") that show creativity and spirit rather than boring and disgusting movies. <br /> <br /> Seriously, why not a documentary? About Jerry Springer Show to start answering real questions such as: Who are these people? What will happen to their lives after they appear on this list? How can the mayor of Cincinatti find himself here? <br /> <br /> One good line: During the "orientation" for guests: "People I can't emphasize this enough: no weapons!"
