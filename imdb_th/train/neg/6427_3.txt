So I found that this documentary is really strange and ridiculous. I know that it has won awards and things, but personally I don't enjoy it too much. There are no jokes or plays in the story that will make you interested in just strange things and their work. Some people in it are quite different, which is not bad. It didn't impress me. I was very disgusted with this film, without any fault with my creative writing teacher. The circus theme throughout the movie is excellent. But I don't get and the robot and taming the lion is not what I do. What green animals are neat, I like many colorful flower gardens. But how are these four works connected? It's not reasonable for me why some people make movies about that. But if you are like this, you may enjoy it Who am I to stand in your way? I just warn you about the suffering that may occur.
