There is something that is too much to borrow. B-grade <br /> <br /> Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days at the cinema every year. For this reason, movie studios are more likely to avoid screening films with more budget on the weekend. Every few years, studios publish female distortion programming movies (2001 of "The Wedding "Planner) to compete with the big game This weekend's Super Bowl, called "Wedding Day", will try to find success and attract viewers who don't watch the game. <br /> <br /> The sick person feels sorry for her, the only woman, Kat El. list (Debra Messing) TV "Will and Grace") Hire a male escort Nick (Dermot Malronni "About Schmidt") Fans for her sister's wedding in London Her family is giving her a lot of hard time about her unmarried and her seven-year-old fiance who left her without reason. It is the best man. To make him jealous of Kat, flock to her past to allow him to see what he lost But in the end, Nick helps Kat to realize that she can open her heart and let someone love her. <br /> <br /> This movie is borrowed from a similar wedding movie. It's almost a carbon copy of "Picture Perfect" in 1999 and incorporates scenes that are similar to "The Wedding Planner" and "My Best Friends Wedding". The movie has a "Pretty Women" theme, which happens back and known. Her audience, the director, makes a wise reference about this film and other films. "Wedding Day" has all the elements of ancient ideas. General wedding movie with professional wayward mother (Holland Taylor, "Blonde Law") and wedding imitation speech by family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal dinner The ending twist has been done before. But it is something that is not completely expected The real reason why Kat was left as a surprise and changed the direction of the movie in the last half hour. <br /> <br /> Although "wedding day" can be predictable But able to stand on his own. Debra Messing in her first lead role proves that she is charming and funny. Dermot Mulrony has excellent chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of his conversations are Too monotonous and unrealistic He can make the best of what he has received and is able to save his character. <br /> <br /> By using the clever play button (Often about sex) This movie is really funny, although it's generally a movie with chicks. This movie has elements that everyone can enjoy. The story, good feelings and humor make it the best date for the movie that has been released for a long time.
