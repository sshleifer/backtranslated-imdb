Richard Dreyfus is not a star here. He has a pendant for about 20 seconds and what does Gene Barry do with this movie? No idea. Director should be his brother! This is a movie that doesn't make sense. Wrong writers / directors (Same friend) Show everyone's talent with his awesome work. Uh ... I get a DVD for money so can't complain! But it's strange and makes you feel strange and not a good way It has a rather interesting and controversial concept. But as with scratched notes It has an aura of "Manson family on acid". <br /> <br /> I don't know how other reviewers get what they do from this movie. They may be working on it back when? Be prepared to lose your life for at least 80 minutes. You will never get back. Yes, it's terrible!
