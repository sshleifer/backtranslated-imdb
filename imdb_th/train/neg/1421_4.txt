I rented the Lensman English version, dubbed the hope that because it comes from a well-known novel, it will have some content. While there is a hint of content in most movies, not higher than the level of a small cartoon. Perhaps this movie may not be able to adapt the book well or it has disappeared much in the dub version. Or maybe even the original novel is lightweight But for whatever reason, there is not much. <br /> <br /> I noticed many details that were deceitful, too bad or too lacking. "In the year 2001 and the Star Wars image of space The robot that is harvesting looks like a human being with a humanoid shape. "R2-D2" <br /> <br /> It started trying to borrow a Star Wars cartoon style, but it was kind (because humor didn't work). And play it seriously In that sense, it is superior to Star Wars franchise, which begins with a sense of humor and eventually deteriorates with Jar-Jar's bewilderment. <br /> <br /> Details Agriculture is attracted by people who have never seen before. Harvesting farms are driving through the middle of undeveloped fields, leaving silage on crops that are not harvested instead of working from one side to the other. Put the silage on the harvested rows or into the corn truck (corn). Pour the grain. But the fields were drawn like wheat fields. <br /> <br /> When the time that Kim's father faced his fate to the scene, that might be part of the mistakes of the English voice actors. But the painting doesn't show much weight Kim's reaction to the scene was unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Similarly, when the character named Henderson was killed, Chris showed very little reaction, even though they should approach. (Henderson's death is not a spoiler; His name will not be revealed until the death scene.) She seems to have forgotten him immediately. Expressing the sympathy of some people showing more feelings than she did I think the voice of the voice deserves the most offense in that case. At least there is a feeling in Kris's drawing. <br /> <br /> Many times, the villain can't follow his orders. The villain leader often punishes those who fail with a miserable death. I can't say that coming from Star Wars or from previous sources - probably the Lensman's book. <br /> <br /> There was a scene in which the spacecraft crashed. As it landed on the ground, the parts broke out of the boat. But there are many pieces falling that shouldn't have anything left when it comes down. <br /> <br /> In most cases, Chris seems to be a talented and talented space hero, with scenes she sings such as A young woman who is not capable of suffering There is someone who is strong enough to overcome Henderson's death quickly, at least shouting that "Help, it comes to me and I can't reach my gun!" Instead of screaming <br /> <br /> The character with the most personality. (Almost too much sometimes) is D.J Bill. He listens like Wolfman Jack, D.J. In American Graffiti, I wonder if he voiced good in the original language. <br /> <br /> Two planets in the film explode. The explosion is not impressive and seems to be the inspiration for many Star Wars. However, its credit, the cause of the explosion is not the same as Death Star's main weapon. The dialog box has a good and interesting explanation for the cause. Other explosions in this film look good, not just the explosion of the planet. <br /> <br /> Some sound effects look scary as if borrowed from video games in the late 1970s. It looks like the original video game and the influence from Tron is also visible. On the other hand, the sound effects are usually quite good, although it focuses on the part that makes the magic sound. Art is also good, especially when away from scary computer graphics. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a story. If the film tells a good story, it can cause a lot of bugs. But the plot is quite light The innocent boy tried to help someone on a disabled spacecraft and received the great power he didn't understand. He and his group of very virtuous friends fight against powerful and deadly enemies. He makes friends learn about his special powers and grows as a young man. If he is defiant and has morality enough, he may defeat the evil enemy. Details on the way can make the story higher on a simple outline. But there are fewer in this movie. <br /> <br /> At the end, it's just a cartoon character. But since it seems that the main target group is older children, it may not be necessary.
