I must immediately confess that I have never been a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. Of course, from me, he has been "disrespectful". I watched it just because my wife wanted to see it and found what I expected: a silly story without humor. It's really full of lame, raw jokes and completely ridiculous stories that revolve around developers. (Dangerfield) plans to build a ski resort in Utah that doesn't attract attention. <br /> <br /> In addition to Dangerfield, this movie starring weak actors, including those who like Andrew Dice Clay and people. That is above the hill of John Byner (I didn't even know he was still around until I saw his name on credit for this) <br /> <br /> This is a disaster for Dangerfield. <br /> <br /> 2/10
