This is one of the worst movies ever created. Even the biker movie The minimum plot involves a gang of bikers that occupy a small town (a traditional way!) And the efforts of the townspeople to fight with them. Why don't they ask for help from the outside? Who knows? The fight scenes are obviously fake. Adam West and Tina Louise are in there, but both have little to do and both are ashamed to be there (understand). This movie is in the garbage dump!
