It's funny when you stop and think about it: scary movie fans often have a deep and continuous love with those who are afraid of their light. Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE may make us a nightmare. But among us (The faithful) didn't feel the true love of Gunnar Hansen in the brutal story of MASSACRE or Ken Foree forever and is the deadly hero of the deadly DAWN OF? His enchantment in the remake makes me want to stand up and encourage. (As well as the pendant of Tom Savini); I am not you and Brian Halloran and ... Okay, you will be my drift. (If not just standing under the wind ...) This is part of Heroes of Horror. To see these things, many people gathered in a single film, almost never heard. (At least at this level, for my knowledge) If only the author has done this great job There may be other people who are around there to try again. As long as I have not tried the other half of my heart (Eg Brotherhood of Blood, etc.)
