If you've watched Dukes of Hazard, you know that you don't have to worry about drugs or insulting or vulgar behavior of children. If you've seen a movie that you know isn't like that! This movie is awesome! The main character who is addicted to drugs and thinks it's funny and cool is not what I call entertainment. They performed great and just changed to trash. Daisy, who is a little flirting in the original program, now looks and behaves like she is in the corner of the street that receives money for her service. I was so excited to see this movie before it came out 15 minutes in the movie that I was ready to leave. I still think it must be better. But it gets worse every minute I hope I have never seen this movie. It left a good performance and left nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth when I left. Do your favorite things to see what is worth your money because it's not just a waste of money. But it is a waste of 2 hours in your life
