Wow, this is a terrible movie ... as read in other reviews, this movie has no plot, no character development, they may have some scripts. But it's hard to tell the final result. <br /> <br> The editing of this movie doesn't really exist, it tends to jump from one scene to another without any connection or anything to help the audience <br /> <br /> All of this is just a low-cost zombie that doesn't think of anything. There are bad performances, bad conversations, everything is not good. <br /> <br /> The only thing that will help The film is from 1 or 2 as a factor that needs to be done. I think this must be where they spend whatever money they have to try to prove that doing this. <br /> <br /> If you (like me) are dedicated to this search . period of time
