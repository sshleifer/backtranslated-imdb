The girl is taking a shower without realizing that the rape person is constantly staring at her through the skylight. Detective Martin etiquette and Orstone hot on his path But not hot enough that they met him after he killed, raped and ate the nipples of the girl he shot dead Who will hope that this will be the end of the movie? Not because it's too scary But because the level of acting is horrible Sadly, it's not the end, and several months later, the rapist raised as a zombie by Satan's covenant. So he proceeded from the spot where he went with the investigator in this case again. This time, the flying boy kept track of him as well (don't ask). There are very good budget movies. (Trash Street and Filthy McNasty Spring) but this movie copied the bottom of the tank. Scary performances, crappy, special techniques, weak attempts at jokes and oh yes, and the ending is also bad. <br /> <br /> My grades: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Theresa Bestul has been fully bare; Ann Arkee received a bare breast
