If you are following the true story of the Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, you will be disappointed - but if you after a reasonably constructed bodice with an art theme, you will find that you are a movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a picture of the life of Artemisia Tychy, which is wrong, which is the foundation that makes me almost cry (type Artemisia inaccuracies on Google and see articles about facts and fiction) from the perspective of people. The film is not alone: ​​sets, costumes, and especially the chiaroscuro lighting help create a truly immersive experience in the early 17th century; Although the imperfections of GLARING FACTUAL INAURCURACIES Make it a little worse. <br /> <br /> How do I wonder if director / author Agnès Merlet protects her film? Maybe she refused to show that Artemisia was the victim, which should be unfortunate because she faced it.
