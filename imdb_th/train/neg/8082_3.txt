It was one late at night. "It was there." I saw everything. Sometimes they are great, this one is terrible, but it shouldn't be true. <br /> <br /> This movie has very good actors. How will you fail when you have Charlsten Heston and Jack Pallance? We're talking about the Oscars winners here. It has good special effects. It has really good tits! And I mean to show beautifully, full breasts with full nipples and at one point, even some vagina But it doesn't compensate for one missing thing - the story! The plot is ridiculous. I don't mean the sun "Solar Crisis" that exploded But that wasn't good enough It is the rest of the thing - totally bad and predictable. That guy just stunned! There are no good performances or spaceships or any fight scenes that can be done around. <br /> <br /> I've seen the same actors who are very good I have seen great science fiction movies with a short time and budget. All the differences are in writing.
