This is a copy of the classic 1948 Doris Day, Romance on the High Seas. <br /> <br /> The story is more or less the same. Govinda plays a clever friend who replaces her husband on the go. While Rani plays a college friend of his wife who does the same thing They tried to catch themselves while the husband and wife tried to travel to Bombay. <br /> <br /> On the journey, Govinda made a mistake with another girl for Sanjiv's wife and spy for her while falling. Love Rani Ravishing <br /> <br /> There are two roles of father and son, both lawyers who specialize in divorce proceedings. They have holes in each other for the war. <br /> <br /> It's a bad attempt to copy the original classics and the music is quite scary. This funny movie is slapping the staff and will not make anyone laugh too much.
