I browse through Netflix and stumble upon this movie. There are fond memories of this book as a child. I decided to check this out. This is the movie you should really pass. <br /> <br /> It's not worth seeing. It's boring and not interesting. I felt that it would be like that to young children. There is no magic that this book contains. This movie is not scary. But you will find yourself not interested in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There was a time when it came out strange. The family behaves like it's not a big deal, something that is strange By people who have never had the experience of making movies before B. I just closed and sent it back to Netflix. I didn't care that it would really finish crossing this movie and reading the book instead
