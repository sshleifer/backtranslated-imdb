As others say, it starts with a strange preface about a little blonde girl who kills a cat. Then the main story: the photographer (Gaffari) and the writer (Shepard) meet accidentally and travel to the mountains. First of all, they spent the whole night at a hotel where a deaf little house owner shouted. Once on the mountain, they sought refuge again and were invited by a kind old woman who was kind and kind to strangers. (Every Hansel and Gretel?) What will happen next? Now, I like Eurohorror and should be better if only Artigot (the author and director) tried to tell a rational story. The back (Pyrenees?) Creates a wonderful and interesting place for mysterious and mysterious events. The lush peaks can easily obscure the supernatural power and the superiors. Photography is good. Just hope that everything will make sense You can watch this movie at archive.org.
