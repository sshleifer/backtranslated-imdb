Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) made a gentle fun in this 1970s turkey, but the script was weak and insulted to even the youth of Goldie Hawn (after she won the Oscar) couldn't pull things. This can be removed from the mud. As a skirt-chasing celebs in the 40s, most sellers embarrassed themselves at the level of <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10, best performance =? Nicky Henson plays the new generation <br /> <br /> I hope Hawn and the seller will get a good return because I don't see any other reason for this rag in 1970 (a very good year for movies - CATCH-22, MASH HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA. , Five simple pieces and many more) You can't win at all!
