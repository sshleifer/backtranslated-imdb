All episodes in Season 1 are terrible. There is no comparison with Twilight Zone or Outer Limits because those items have the appropriate story. The most remarkable story is boring .. Not surprisingly .. go to rent or buy the Twilight Zone series ... I've heard the 2nd season of this series is much better .. Also There are still some reasons about DVDs. Ray Walston, which further reduces this accumulation One of the great things is to see actors and actors at a younger age than in 1985 ... Most stories can be very predictable and the series may be better when twisting and changing that makes you wonder ...
