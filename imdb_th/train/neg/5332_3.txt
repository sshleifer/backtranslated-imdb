OK, the image of the 'Indians' that are fixed in this story is just a mistake. I agree that Elvis looks quite good here. But yes, his skin color seems to change while watching movies I was thinking of okay ... He never had a tan in real life. It's the most obvious brown cosmetics I've ever seen. It's not as good as 'Indians' in 'F-Troop' and Western Hollywood people played by Jewish actors and Italian, Italian, not Americans. Indeed, <br /> <br /> This movie is ok. Story and medium music, as in all Elvis movies, he did because Colonel Parker tied him to the list of long-term movies to squeeze the most money from Elvis! I always thought that 'Thank God' that Elvis stopped doing movies forever, shortly after the film came out. It's great to see the actor actor Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, LQ. However, Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this movie <br /> <br /> Burgess Meredith's 'Indian' makeup is great. Much It's certainly the worst of the group. What did the filmmakers think? Did Meredith do this for money? I love some Elvis movies. For example: 'Love Me Tender', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas'. I can still watch his movies with future TV actors Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asiner. 'Change Of Habit' that Elvis plays as a city doctor. <br /> <br /> Okay, at least Elvis. Create a few good movies. But ordinary people and bad people overcome good and good people. <br /> <br /> I will always love ELVIS! Thank you very much!
