Credits in the event that only the clothing and dress technology deserves the honorable mention. <br /> <br /> This is the lowest point in BING CROSBY's long career. Paramount script about the clumsiness you might imagine, and informal Bing or William Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwicke can't do anything about repairing. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks very stupid in the boy's face. And the poor, Rhonda Fleming, plays the role of a heroine in the stocking group that wants her to look at Bing cutely, and at least, except for the ballads that are not popular with sound, may be dubbed for That opportunity. <br /> <br /> Mark Twain's intellect is not clear in any screenplay. Only Crosby's fans who have died can appreciate the chaos of this film in an unseen direction. Need Even the special looks as if they didn't know what they should do. <br /> <br /> Summary: Boring like washing dishes. Not recommended even for children.
