I went to watch this movie with low expectations. But hoping to get the charm by seeing my home town on film Sadly, that's all I got. The story covers the familiar territory. (High school integration) But the storyline is complex and supernatural elements add a little theme that is well worn. Although the overall quality of the show is good But the content of this film is scary The sex deprivation of this film is obvious - women are ineffective unless they are married, procreating or both. Worse than that is racism - a wretched Jewish mother, a black man who lives at home - and illogical cruelty. (Torture the class beyond lecture) We should be ashamed if these characters think of the representation of the Kalamazoo people and writers should be punished for bringing this wide and cruel pattern to the screen
