After hearing about George Orwell's masterpiece throughout my life, I am now 37, but never reading a book. I am totally confused with what I just saw. <br /> <br /> I am very much. Familiar with the concepts covered in the novel because I'm sure that most have But through rumors and words This movie will be a complete mystery, and even with limited knowledge, I have not been educated about the story of 1984 more than I ever was before I watched it. <br /> <br / > On the positive side .. <br /> <br /> The movie is an amazing story. Hurt & Burton presents an excellent performance and the overall feeling of the film is scary and scary. The prostitute scene is a dark piece of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Now for the bottom and there are many ... <br /> <br /> There is a war going on (at least as far as propaganda. Involved) but why & with whom does not explain anything There are a few names related to (Eurasia etc.) but they have no meaning without explanation. <br /> Who is Winston? What is he doing? Where did he come from? Where does he work? Why did he change the news report? Why isn't he in the front row? Why does he not eat in the cafeteria? What is the drink he drinks throughout the story? Why is he weak and ill? Why didn't he be brainwashed like everyone else? What is the agreement between his mother and sister? What happened to his father? A little retrospective. Probably good. There is no need for scrubbing for people like me who haven't read the book. Without it, this is just a confusion and difficult to follow an art house movie that makes you constantly guess what happened. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is not connected and is not good. Brother's large screen creates conversations in different locations, making it difficult to understand what's going on. I agree that this may be an art alternative. <br /> <br /> In addition, I know that this has been mentioned earlier. But why are all nude pictures? It seems that there is no charge at all and feels like being thrown there to compensate for the lack of any plot. <br /> <br /> Personally, I can't do what Hollywood feels. For today's words We are not all brainwashed easily, but this is a few steps too far. I can imagine that it depends on the fact that you have read this book because if this film is Many people say that I will find it very difficult to understand why. Classic, it is <br /> <br /> There is no denying that it is many years ahead of time and there are predictions of changing everything in our society. The date is quite beautiful. (Perhaps this is the type of scripture The power is?) But many sci-fi novelists do the same without leaving a hole in the story. <br /> <br /> I guess I have to do what I should do from the beginning and buy a copy. Of the book, if I would make any sense from this story <br /> <br /> All in all, very disappointed in what I had been waiting for years to see.
