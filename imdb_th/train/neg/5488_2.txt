Why in the world is Colin Firth in this ridiculous movie? Has he ever been tied in with real cash? <br /> <br /> This film isn't clear what it's like about grief? Exotic places? Ghost? Vehicles for Mr Darcy? <br /> <br /> There seems to be some idea that Italy must be good in itself and Italy has something to offer in language - but in the end, women are just Want to go back to Yankland. <br /> <br /> There are pointless episodes on the beach, in churches, on busy streets - but what about it or why everyone should pay close attention?> <br /> Also A girl snatched in the movie It's not clear what the job here is. But it seems that she is only there to make nonsensical comments inappropriate and inappropriate for girls Is it supposed to be about paedophillia? <br /> <br /> Scary mess. I give 2 more than 1 because it doesn't have the most scary movie charm.
