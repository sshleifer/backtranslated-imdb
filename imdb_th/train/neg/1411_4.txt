This movie was very good the first time I saw it when it was called "Lost in Translation". Bill Murray became a weird black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson, becoming a crazy Latin woman played by Paz Vega and Tokyo Japan became Carson, California. Instead of the meaningful conversation and silence we have in translation, we get ridiculous talk in 10 annoying items. Instead of being a meticulous and thoughtful character in translation, we get characters that show pointless advice on topics that they don't have a clue. How can a character wear a hundred dollar T-shirt and never stay in a department store? Target expects to give advice to working class women about how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant. Don't think of stopping him. If he didn't give advice on his clothes, he would tell her what she should eat. The most annoying part of the movie for me is that they are going to rush to make an appointment. But the characters still find time to go on other errands, whether it's washing cars, stopping at Arby, or just placing a list, closing 10 lists or fewer items of things they love and hate. I want to yell at them by saying "You don't say where you are? The last minute you came late, now you are eating grilled meat. Until I saw this movie, I never truly understood that there was something that "Confirm yourself." But I think that this movie truly does that and is not appropriate. The dialogue makes the characters magical and sympathetic with the exception that I feel sorry for both actors who signed with this project.
