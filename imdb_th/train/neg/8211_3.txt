I read the book "7 years in Tibet" from Heinrich Harrer and was amazed with it. Then I immediately picked up the DVD and started watching the movie. I remember the first time I saw it in 98. I like it. Well, now I look again in the full knowledge of the book. It depends. And soon I knew that all the wrongs were said: <br /> <br /> When they entered Lhasa, people began to stick their tongues out of their mouths and Thewlis and Pitt had impression So they come back ... in my book, Harry described the talks as a sign of humility and devotion in Tibet, and they may do it in front of the Dalai Lama. But not for these two Europeans! Not only did the mother, but the Dalai Lama still wear glasses in public in Harrer's book, saying that no one in Tibet wore glasses at that time. (Sorry, forgot the reason But described in the book too) The Dalai Lama man made But when he was alone and no one saw him! And what about Mao Zedung, Yung Yellow, destroyed the universe in front of "Living Buddha" young? Naive ... and the tailor makes Harrer and Aufschnaiter Tibetan clothes not suitable for European designers! Why are there so many events that really happened and then cut out the story just to fill time with love, interest, wear (Female tailor ...) that is not completely important? Like all stories about the son of harrers, rolf, no one talks about him or even family members of people who like to speak in the book But that's ok for me because "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about people harrers. It's about Tibet. I am very disappointed with the "modification" of the famous book. And I think Heinrich Harcher too ... 3 stars just for filming
