I will not be able to enjoy this movie a little more. For Jason (Herb) Evers harping fixed in the experiment. Many early critics in The Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifune of acting too much. But while many critics see this film, they see it as an action intended. Jason Evers is clearly not Toshiro Mifune and his expression is too real. <br /> <br / > Most actors in classic B, this is a fairly good performer. Remove Evers and actress. If you watch this movie, you will notice Evers shouting almost every line, that is, until he smokes and blows the smoke out cold. <br /> <br /> Different special effects for the course in B movies like this in the backward understanding, there is not much that stands out in my mind, is good or bad for this movie.
