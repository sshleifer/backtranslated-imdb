The first episode of this new program was released today, and it was scary. Shaggy not only had a new voice that pitched at his torture. But it is still far from the original concept and the animation style that is almost impossible to remember as 'Scooby-Doo'. <br /> <br /> Even back in the dark age when Fred and Vella comes and Scooby's nephew is there. Scoppy, the team can solve the mystery. This new show, instead of Shaggy and Scooby, fought against Super James, the villain and his followers while in the mansion. There is not even a van called 'Puzzle Machine' (and teaser for the next episode, which promises that the Transformers robot car doesn't make me feel comfortable). Can anyone use Scooby Doo and create this? <br /> <br /> The program gets two. The point for two scenes with all Scooby Doo gangs that everyone speaks with the right voice except Shaggy and even now I'm too kind.
