At least the theater seats were comfortable and I ate pop corn as loud as possible to get rid of poor quality conversations. This is not a female movie. Everyone who likes it is a woman that we can be confident that will be far from Silly stories, mediocre dialogues and movies that are cheap overall. I've watched many movies. But this is a new story for the winners in the bad category. If you see it happen, one thing that you will wait for is the ending. So you can run out of the cinema as soon as possible.
