The worst mistake in my life <br /> <br /> I picked up this movie at Target for $ 5 because I thought "Hey, it's Sandler. I'm completely wrong. On the way to the movie, all three of my friends fell asleep and I was still suffering. The worst story, the worst script, the worst movie I've ever seen. I want to hit my head with the wall for an hour, then I'll stop and you know why. Because it feels good When bashing my head in me, sticking to a scolding movie in the microwave and watching it burn ... and that feels better than anything else I used to do. It takes American Psycho, Army of Darkness and Kill Bill to defeat that shit I hate Sandler for taking over this thing and ruining my life all day long. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
