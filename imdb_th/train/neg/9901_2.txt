This should be a star. But there are many clich√©s, guessing, seeing everything before flicking the flick, which I actually gave a special star for the truth. It made me laugh ... even though never Director's intentions. I'm sure <br /> <br /> I don't write comments about movies. Often they have to feel or in this case not really good. <br /> <br /> Say As soon as I saw Jeff Fahey in there, I realized that it would be bad because he had a unique nose to pick the worst movie. <br /> <br /> In any way. The passing may be the hilarious sound of MR T (not Mr T's broadcast, but you know what I mean if you bother to watch). If you watch it, make sure you don't pay to watch it. Really if they put a joke in their hearts But I'm sure you will find strange laughter here and there. Everything ...
