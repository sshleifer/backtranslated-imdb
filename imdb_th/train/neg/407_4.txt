I love special techniques and seeing new technologies that make science fiction seem real. The special effects of this movie are very good. I have seen this movie mostly because it aired on HBO in the past few months. I have to admit that I might miss some scenes. But usually I usually draw in movies and see some scenes more than once. But every time I saw "Hollow Man" I felt almost depressed like "Film Noir". I'm not sure why. Probably because I don't want Kevin Bacon to be evil and disappointed in that matter. But I think it is just a way that he becomes a relentless evil Regardless, I can recommend this film for excitement. (Although some parts are slow moving) but I do not recommend for children under 14 years (may be 12 if it is an adult)
