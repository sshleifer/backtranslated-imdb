Finally, when I had the opportunity to watch Zombie 3 (Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe) from Japanese DVDs imported in Region 2, I was blown away by the fun of this zombie epic. The transfer was as flawless as ever. Will go to see unless Anchor Bay will get it clearly and clearly as it should be and you can admire the wonderful makeup and the wonderful fx. The sound is also excellent. It is only 2 channels dolby but if you There are Dolby Prologic 2 recipients. You can appreciate the wonderful music (actually a very good score) and powerful sound effects, even if it is cheap. It never sounds good and the transfer is good. <br /> <br /> I never knew how much blood was circulating in this movie. It was very cruel with the shooting of a bomb blast a cat full of acne. A big knife on the neck of a zombie, a woman burned (as well)) chewing the intestines, babies, zombies and many others. Lost. <br /> <br /> No doubt, for the action action fans by Only the Italians have Bang Shi. I think people don't give enough credit. If you see a clean print and not a scary copy of the pirate, it is totally totally different experience. <br /> <br /> The film never gave up for a second and I knew it was inconsistent. The performance is strong and the disrespect is celebrated in a great way. But that's part of the charm. <br /> <br /> For me, this is one of the best horror movies you've ever created. This movie is very bad, with the aim of being the highest ranking genius by chance. If they play to laugh, it will be a disaster. But they play it as a direct arrow and the result is a great classicism The nose of any traditional filmmaking standard. <br /> <br /> Many action sequences, exotic locations, fantastic scene designs, sometimes bad. In filming movies, performing magic, magic and plotting interesting stories But still interesting, great makeup effects, beautiful women who can kick the butt, great music, and sometimes hilarious, sometimes creepy But enjoy the zombies There is a classic cult everything that stands the test of time.
