Really bad slasher movie Psycho people escape from the hospital. Three years later he killed a professor of sociology at the end. One semester yesterday later (Hey, that's what the name card says). A new sociology professor is at school. She is a friend of another female sociologist who works there and starts dating other professors. All students are tired of what we have. <br /> <br /> There are a number of title cards that indicate how long it has passed. The scene is quite short and intersects with characters that are different from one another, causing a little progress. Most scenes involve characters walking and talking or sitting and talking and serving as little purposes. Even when the time has passed But many characters often wear the same clothes. Sometimes the time is not clear, meaning when we see the body a second time, we ask ourselves how long that body is there? And at least one of the dead people didn't think of anyone else. <br /> <br /> The killer managed to kill one person by stabbing her in the chest. And another piece by cutting her forehead His knife is poisoned or something. <br /> <br /> Cover the video box. There is a cheerleader: No in the movie. The back cover has a photo of someone in the graduation cap and a cloak, a group of women in the dorm room. With red hair in the middle of the picture in the movie But no one ever wears this dress and there is no such scene The killer is strictly face to face.
