It's common to see why the Scary Movie creator found it easy to disguise these 'teen slasher' movies. They are incredibly incredible formulas. And if Valentine's Day was released a year earlier, I'm sure they will fool this movie - that is, if they really find original content to differentiate from Screams. I know what you do in During the legendary season, <br /> <br /> Valentine doesn't offer anything new to this genre, except for a better ending than usual, which certainly makes a lot of space for the inevitable sequel. For example, once a masked psychic killer sneaks into a group of beautiful women, killing one of the main character's characters one by one, in general, is a popular style. There is no character development, bad performances and very complex bloodshed. <br /> <br /> What I can't tolerate about this type of film is that they pass on themselves as 'Who did it? 'What they did not, because the motivation was revealed only once, when the killer revealed and told the main character that everyone's friends were now killed. Usually, something that has never been apparent in this movie (Such as the fishing partner of the uncle's mother, the main character kicks the dog of his friend's father). Everyone is alive throughout the story. 'The suspect' but they are 'Red Herrings' more than the suspect While we all know that this main character manages an unbelievable escape and kills an undisclosed psychopathic killer after being inspired. <br /> <br /> Valentine follows this formula almost alphabet *************** Spoiler !!!!!! (The next mini spoiler) *************** On Valentine's Day, motivation is not revealed. But more than that is left for you to think because this film does not conclude in the typical 'how to slash a teenager This problem has been partially resolved and the target of the killer, who may or may not be fulfilled from bloodshed and murdered almost everyone. The killer will want more or whether the devil is actually dead. <br /> <br /> This has not made Valentine a good movie. But it helps to escape from the bad as usual, which is not counted for everyone who thinks to create another movie along these lines, please do not do The initiative is very important and it is difficult to see any initiatives that come out of this category.
