I went to watch this movie first and was shocked how wonderful it was. It is a combination of ancient / horror ideas. Every attempt to comment on many things, including obscenity, Satan worship, police uniform, religious affairs ... and it's a mess. The show is a beautiful washing board. The children and friends of Jesus are fine. But besides them .... I admire the effort (Although it failed a little) from trying to show Christians how different ... even though they did so, the way that presented the gospel was very small. But then again, it might be because he was talking to a little boy ... No, in fact, I decided that it wasn't good. Music ... Oh, I'm ... scary ... Right. The person who made this movie in the Premier It looks like a poor student project. I will stop ranting right now and speak the bottom line. Go to see this movie if you want to lose one and a half hours to die.
