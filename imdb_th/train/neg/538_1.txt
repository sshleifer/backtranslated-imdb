Wow, so boring. My husband and I were sitting there, and this idea had to be improved. These actresses were too good to waste time with this nonsense. Unsatisfied characters, hacked scripts and pacing that didn't have the program for two hours. In fact, I couldn't hack it and go shopping at the grocery store. (Cat litter is more attractive than this movie). The husband breaks and insists that it is no better. - By the time Buddy is killed, you want them all to be hit by a car and end their miserable life. It will be more fun without limits. Beautiful scenery and costumes cannot sustain life.
