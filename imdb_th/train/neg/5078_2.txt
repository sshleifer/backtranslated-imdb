If "Exorcist II: The Heretic" in 1977, he did not receive help, it was difficult to imagine what these extraordinary talent Richard Burton saw in this exciting exercise. You've seen it before: Burton plays a writer who has discovered at an early age. He has the power to move inanimate objects using his thoughts. (And you think "Carrie" has no effect on Hollywood!) Although adapted from the novel by Peter Van Greenaway, but "Medusa" plays like a recycler. But special effects in the final scene of the cathedral are strong. (If it is general) Lee Remick is a doctor, but handsome is not good. Burton is a humming man. But bored ... not even psychic can help him now * 1/2 from ****
