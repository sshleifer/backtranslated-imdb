I saw Rating 7.5 IMDb for this movie and from deciding to watch this movie which my roommate rented. She said that she had seen it before. "It's funny and sad! I cried the first time I saw. "She might spill over to other Bollywood movies that deserve 7.5 out of 10. But compared to other movies I've seen in my life, this movie deserves no more. 3 What movies can I predict what will happen next? Not good for me The character is not convinced that the action is unrealistic and their motivation is planned. It is more than drama and music is not all that wonderful. My biggest problem with popular movies is the lack of subtlety. All emotions are way too much and not realistic. Emotions or bonding between the least delicate characters must be expanded with unnecessary songs. I think I understand that the relationship between father and son is like a friend between more than one friend, between parents and children, without having to transmit over five minutes of music. Comic stupid relief with laughs is not a joke or a necessity (we understand Laxman is not the sharpest tool in the shed). If the movie tries to pull tears through the most hacking, it means that it's not. meaning But a little embarrassing. <br /> <br /> ***** Spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> In general, if someone is a lung cancer who is their son. He who lives with them will know that there is nothing wrong without having to tell. Too many holes are planned. In the beginning, this movie was funny and cute in the way that Bollywood movies were shown to those who didn't watch them greedy. But it is boring Having to use a lot of skill in making movies that are fun and impressive, and the best way to make a movie usually doesn't have all the amusing parts in the first half of the movie and all the cute parts at the end. > <br /> ***** Higher spoilers ***** Maybe it has more depth than other Bollywood movies I've seen. But not much I spend more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the funny part. I didn't shed tears even once and I didn't feel like it. But I felt overwhelmed with an enduring endeavor. I do not recommend this movie if you want to see anything good. I recommend if you want to watch a sad Bollywood movie.
