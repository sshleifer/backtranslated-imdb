I read about this movie in the magazine and I was amazed. One day women saw themselves driving through her car. I think this is interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... but not before the name cracked or broken ... What? There is something that cracks ... Oh, wait ... I understand it. Its name is "broken"! Wow, smart! Unfortunately, this is the only thing that can happen. <br /> <br /> The evidence is not bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland did a lot better in 'Mirrors'. One that is quite moderate at The more appropriate name is 'The Boring' because it attracts every scene for the blood age. Or may be 'confusing' because it does not explain anything, not in the story or in his own story, only a vague idea about the evil copying and something fearful And the cheap scenes are messy. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the performances and special effects are quite good. But then again, it's not a difficult role to show. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie twice, I still feel a bit displeased and not like EA Poe or Stephen King. Shouldn't watch this In simple terms, there is better excitement.
