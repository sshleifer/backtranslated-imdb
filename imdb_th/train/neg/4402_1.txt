I always love lesbian movies even if they are not good. I'm biased. I guess! <br /> <br /> But this one is just a hole. Yes, the scenery and buildings are beautiful and have a short time that is beautiful but hidden in the arousal. But in other words, this movie wasted no time. Annamarie alternated between sulking and high / stoned / passing on drugs or any useful liquor and Ella described this disgusting behavior in the entire film. We will not understand why this or why Annamarie felt depressed and withdrawn. <br /> <br /> If at least there is some closure Do not even know!) The relationship between the two may be satisfied. But at one point, Annamarie asked Ella "Why do you love me?" Ella doesn't even accept this. It was never clear whether this would be anything more than a lesbian who behaved badly in traveling on a boring road with women. <br /> <br /> Even the interaction between the two women and the people in Local they meet The journey that seems to be lively and informative is quite flat, boring and difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> There's a good joke in this movie. Women traveling in two-seat Ford Coupe with medium body But when they camp, they have tents, children's beds, sleep equipment and even tables, chairs and typewriters! Moreover, when they boarded the ferry, we saw that the baggage seems to be theirs, and should be carried in the trunk of Ford too! <br /> <br /> And from the whole movie, we have never seen a gas station or somewhere that seems to have a place to buy gasoline. Most of them travel through desolate deserts. Where will they get fuel? <br /> <br /> There may be too many lesbian movies, whether good or bad. But there are many that are better and there are very few that are worse Leave this in the rack.
