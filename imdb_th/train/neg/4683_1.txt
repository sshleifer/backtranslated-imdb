As a former submarine, this is one of the worst underwater movies I've ever seen. First of all, the US Navy's rebellion, especially the submarines that use nuclear weapons in the unthinkable These guys are the best of the best and dedicated to their mission. The responsibility they have is great and they are very serious about it, from the captain to the most junior members. I never saw any crew of the ship split their allies between the captain and the executive officer. The executive officer who acts as the character played by Denzel Washington will be removed from the job and the court of justice, then hit by the navy. It is not surprising that the Navy refused to send a technical advisor to help create the film. Ultimately, if the members of the submarine team make a lot of noise on this boat, they will be severely reprimanded. The submarine learned at the beginning of their career to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. They do not close the door and speak quietly and wear soft shoes when processing. I was amazed at the loudness that they showed the crew while they were doing. Loud music will not tolerate I know that drawing underwater life in reality will not sell movie tickets. But this is the highest point to the point of being ridiculous I will not recommend this movie to anyone.
