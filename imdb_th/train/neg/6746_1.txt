* Spoiler * <br /> <br /> With the name "Bleed", you know that creative juices are not high when this puppy is thinking. This film is a minimum budget slasher movie that limits the budget. Oh sure it's trying to be creative with its proof. "Kill Club" but we know it's just a joke. Okay, for those who are interested in these things, actually the plot of the basic story is that a new woman in town starts dating her colleagues. He invited her to join his friend's circle and at the party, they told her that they had "The carnage club" and they kill people blah blah blah. We know it's a joke. But not before our heroine killed a woman in the garage. Now, the "members" of the murder club are killed one by one. Oh and the villain wins and the movie ends in frustration. At that time, you will not really care. <br /> <br /> Looking back at the first 10 minutes of this film, there is no reason. The motivation for killing at the beginning of the movie was never explained. I would say it's a way for the director to remove the film, but on the DVD there are scenes that have been deleted! I'm not sure why everyone wants to see more "Bleed" versions of feature lengths. But clearly the people behind the DVD think that the audience will receive more vocals In the box it says that there are Easter eggs But why the hell I want to waste time looking for something special in this movie is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I expect to have a bad movie and send "Bleed" in front of it. Not a fun movie Everyone looks good in the movie and has many nudity. But the performance was terrible. My least favorite character is a man who becomes a murderer ... I think he should be funny and amusing. But he just came out as a tool I think the most fun time of the movie is when our heroine kills a woman in a parking garage in a fun, unbelievable death. The heroines pushed the woman into the parking building, the cement pillar, and the woman seems to be hitting this thing and she throws a full mouth and "dies". <br /> <br /> For those who think of making movies It's a complicated and creative process by experts. Check "Bleed". It will change your mind and you will know that there is a movie hacking. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, don't waste your time or waste money on the story. Am the
