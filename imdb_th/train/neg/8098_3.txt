This is one of the most brutal new things I've ever seen. If they want to create a movie that has a nasty story, they should refrain from giving good titles.

At least the change should not hurt the final product. The final scene in this film is not very painful. The actor is wrong. The director and / or screen writer can't decide whether to make a comedy or an unbelievable sermon. <br /> <br /> If you've watched this movie If you have watched this movie and like to read books
