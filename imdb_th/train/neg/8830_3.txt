There are too many holes in this movie that will be fun and a strange thing almost like the ending of Hollywood, which is not entirely out of context with the rest of the movie. (This is not a spoiler. <br /> <br /> You will need thick skin with all kinds of legitimate undertones. The conflict between whites and blacks is highly planned and one-sided. I do not understand why the author has a black community behavior in an unacceptable manner. Does he / she try to be racist? <br /> <br /> A truly strange movie. Look only if you like to bother with the holes in the story and like to discuss everything that may or may not happen. <br /> <br /> But on the positive side, filming and acting Is excellent
