I'm really looking forward to watching this movie. But after watching, I was really disappointed. The best bit is when Stephen King is in there. Rober John Berk can't do his life, and others can't do it. Some performances make me laugh out loud! This film is not as I imagine after reading a great book. I think it is darker and more scary. If I'm Stephen, I'm really crazy. <br /> <br /> I don't know why they changed the ending. I think the ending of this book is very good. If you just know that the pie kills your daughter, you won't give food to anyone else. You will! <br /> <br /> The book is much better!
