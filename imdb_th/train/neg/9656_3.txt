This movie is made for foul TV all over. Although it begins with a great intention, which has good looking scenes and real props and costumes. This film quickly deteriorates into a terrifying nose conversation. The characters are so happy that sometimes I think they are going to deteriorate into a dirty pool and the action is complex and unbelievable until it seems that the soldiers are standing around. The Germans draw realistic images. Exaggerated until painful The only thing German officials said was the greatness of Americans. Please use my word for this. I'm a big fan of this kind of war and this movie is shit. However, this DVD has excellent special features covering the characters from the WWI front line, making this rental not to waste my entire time.
