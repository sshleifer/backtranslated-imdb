The Return is one of those films for people who like bored and confusing movies at the same time. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a female businesswoman who doesn't kill vampires or nudity throughout I am willing to endure this. But I am not willing to endure the worst revisions that have ever been combined with a pointless event At the end it turned out that she hit her car with herself when she was young. Or maybe I'm wrong and that's just a flashback With this movie it is impossible to tell Can you believe the same friend who made the Army of Darkness create this shit? A better idea is to stay home and watch the Army of Darkness in the Sci Fi channel. The movie has everything: sluts, zombies and friends with an electric saw for the arm. The forgotten person does not even have one of these things.
