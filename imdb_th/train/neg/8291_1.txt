An idiot dentist discovers that his wife is unfaithful. So there is no new story here. However, the author can make movies that are stupid and disgusting. If you enjoy watching a child vomit or see a dentist who imagines that he is pulling all his wife's teeth in a horror-blooded form, go watch (or rent) a movie if not moving to another thing (MY FAIR LADY who?)
