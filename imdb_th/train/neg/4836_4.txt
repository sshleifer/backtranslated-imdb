Start from a simple line from the side of the audience. A good "director profile" is a few views in a good movie scene. Special effects are good. Performing good scenery / scenery But the story is too easy It shows that the forces of the elite army are alive, actions and sometimes die. It shows the drama of living in war. In my movie experience as a serious action movie "Addicted" I miss the click that keeps my eyes and mind stuck on the screen. One of the things that needs to be presented in the movie is to let me consider that one good thing is the ability to immerse the audience in reality and the time of the movie. It didn't happen to me. I was "conscious" throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Honestly speaking, I think this movie is popular, based on the word "Subconscious" of American patriotism Inadequate use as a reputation building tool More than movies about war, it increases the popularity as well. <br /> <br /> Simple ideas: If this is a World War II movie or I just change the time, everything remains the same Got this award? Not sure why? Because there are wonderful people who raise bar highs. <br /> <br /> Compare with competitors in the Oscars. I don't think that all the winning prizes will be correctly received.
