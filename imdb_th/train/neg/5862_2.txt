Answer the question of one person "Why doesn't anyone remember this movie?" Because it's actually not that many people will see it in 1978, and it doesn't have much TV performances since then. (If it's a video that is a news for me!) Even in the age of unconscious comedies, sometimes 70s, movie viewers have the wisdom to avoid this film. Unless they love Billy Crytal, Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers. "That's" a lot! <br /> <br /> Paulinder enjoys "Sek" or "Hollywood Square" more than here. Joan Rivers, at this time in her career, began to laugh at cruel jokes about the lack of weight of singer Karen Carpenter! Har Har-Joan! It seems that everyone is famous in that era. (The biggest surprise was Doris Roberts later "Everybody loves Raymond") <br /> <br /> However, a good idea for the story is a man who is pregnant instead of a woman. With the help of a male friend, Crystal has been set up with a prostitute to lose his virginity. But eventually because she is "on top" instead of him, he is pregnant! (Comments on women who took power from men) <br /> <br /> Crystal's belly grows. He must go through all the emotions of women and the feelings involved. Unfortunately, he is now a misguided person in society! He was attacked by a group of people who wanted him to rub off (I guess) <br /> <br /> He was forced to live in solitude in order to have children ... in the barn or if you want a manager. (God knows that it may leave! Ewwww!) It turned out to be (no shock here) as a woman! <br /> <br /> Everything else about this movie is worthless and forgotten. Humor is at the high school level or lower. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for good ideas and good times. Billy Crystal Don't care about the rest of the Rabitt test. It's a big deal. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that Roddy McDowell signed! (end)
