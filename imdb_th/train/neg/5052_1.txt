Platoon is a Vietnam war because Rocky IV is a heavyweight boxing championship. The story of Oliver Stone about the experience of the US military division in Vietnam in 1968. It's too much to laugh. While most or all events in the category occurred during the 10 years of US military involvement in Vietnam to show things that happened to a small group of men in a short time frame ( Week) War. In the category of people watching all the following categories for a period of one or two weeks: US soldiers kill civilians, civilians, US soldiers, rape civilians, sergeants, US soldiers killed One US military sergeant, US sergeant, wounded / wounded soldier with friendly fire 90% + killed or wounded in the division For Stone to try to pass on this film because of the general experience of US soldiers in Vietnam is a shame. Two Vietnam War films that I would like to introduce are We Were Soldiers (the true story of the worst battles for US troops in Vietnam) and A Bright Shining Lie of HBO.
