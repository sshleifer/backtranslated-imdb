The sequel of this film is a new style of the first movie. Completely pointless movies Essentially, it only takes Ocean O Rio for the first film, and they will make it new in Omen IV, except this time with a female devil. It ended the same way as the first one! The music is too busy and too busy, and since it's a copy of Omen I, it's quite predictable. It's not a horrible movie. It's not terribly created. There's a worse movie, it's not created. Omen remake from 2006 is much worse and more pointless, so I think. That it has If you have someone pointing the gun to your head and you have to choose to watch this sequel or reamke 2006, I guess I will choose.
