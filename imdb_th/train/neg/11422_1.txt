I saw this in the cinema when it came out and yesterday I saw it again on the cable. I was able to rearrange myself with the feeling that this movie was disgusting. A whole bunch of characters is a narcisstic guide that is obsessed with himself. The worst of all, it reinforces the bad attitude about dating 20 stories, even at the same time claiming to celebrate people. "Find yourself." The good guy finished the last. Girls are all toys for children. There is only one character ("Wendy") who sees doing things that are beneficial to society at a distance, and she manages the purity that has saved her life in one scene that was thrown with a scumbag in The scene that was filmed for romance, this is Hollywood's concept of young America: allowed, separated, promiscuous, cocky.
