A truly scary movie made by film director Ted Tetzlaff. Movies that look reasonably good But for the movie, the time bomb doesn't have any stress at all. Ford, while someone takes it here There are some details being thrown around - the former Army or the Canadian Air Force explodes in a war bomb. His wife is leaving him. The bomber itself is a complete puzzle. Why did he try to explode the transport of this mine? For that matter, what time will we talk about? World War II or after the war I think the latter, which makes the bomber more motivated In general, it's just a horror movie. There are many good time bombs to cross it. Watch any "Danger UXB" episode for a more exciting time at the same time.
