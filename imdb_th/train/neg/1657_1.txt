This movie is worth five punches on my "hurter card". I saw this while stationed in Virginia in the mid-70s. I saw it alone, so I didn't get distracted while watching it suck. Disgusting and the most ridiculous celluloid I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I know that other people who used to watch this movie thought it was great. I offer you this: If it's great, what is the box office? End the conversation.
