About 15 minutes, my wife wants to leave. Not so much because of the material, but lacking it. They decided to fill in the gaps where funny things should be very language and rude as possible When this thing surrenders (very rare), we will sit down and watch. (Don't laugh your heart) and wait for the initial or aggressive speech. After about 35 minutes, both of us got up and left. Everything we want to read says it's great. For example, looking good and Roger Ebert called it "smart". Actually, saying that it is not a rude comedy. He went to see the movie, right? Along with Be Cool, it's the only movie I ever went out ... and I don't regret. I'm tired of going to see comedies in America.
