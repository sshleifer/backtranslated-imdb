The bad image of a professional police officer appeared on television in watching this alleged reality show. Who would hope that the reason for the suspicious truth that led to the cause that would lead to all the events related to "stop" then "pat down" from the outside of the clothes The officer enters someone's bag and retrieves the prohibited item from the scene because if not, the arrest in most places will be thrown if they get through the supervisor. The radio warranty report does not constitute the actual existence of the warrant unless the delegated person has the original summons on hand. If the dispatcher read from the printed computer, it is good enough for arrest. But it does not mean that the guarantee remains effective Since I don't see Dis-claimer from CBS (I might miss) CBS may have problems.
