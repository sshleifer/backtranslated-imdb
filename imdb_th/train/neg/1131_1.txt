The shame that even the talented director Desplechin was unable to gather good performances from the talented actresses like Phoenix Esther Kahn lacked the message to convey a story that was concise and clear. In an effort to fill the center circle of the actors' fate, the performances and presentations are planned and executed too low to draw sympathy from the audience. Over a long period of time, the redundancy of Esther's battle was beyond reality to be effective and reduced to a weak framework of disastrous performances. The content is not continuous and worthless when Phoenix tries to follow Desplechin's orders, just as Esther tries to do the same. Never felt that Esther's victory over the pain, we never felt the victory in Phoenix's talent.
