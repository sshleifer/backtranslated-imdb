This film is a sequel to "White Zombies" because it was created by the same man (Halperin) and with zombies. Although Halperin, who is George A. Romero in his days, can not pass on this. <br /> <br /> We have men who can control the minds of people in Cambodia and search to destroy the origin of His power so that zombies can be delivered for free. In addition, an interesting love for the wicked. <br /> <br /> The movie is good in the picture. Cambodian temples and dancers are very good and the zombies look very powerful. Unfortunately, we didn't see a lot of zombies in action and love stories seem to be too big for horror movies. (Although this is the reason for the correct planning later) <br /> <br I like to see zombies in the 1930s attacking the city without problems. But this film didn't deliver And no strong villains (Like Bela Lugosi) is waiting to fight with our heroes And the use of Lugosi's eyes? Good results, but misleading as he was never in the movie ... Why not create a new one with the eyes of a new actor? Overall, a movie that may be a great movie that has a small screenplay that has been reworked and may be a newly created movie effectively one day. Heck if they can fix "The Hills Have Eyes "Then this movie has hope.
