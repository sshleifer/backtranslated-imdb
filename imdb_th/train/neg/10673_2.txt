This movie is like an indie that is not good with the talent of the program. Stupid plot to the end It reminds me of something turbulent for the home video market in the 1980s. I'll give it one. But there is a short time when you can see the actors who really make stress to make this worth I think the worst thing is the underwater scene. Stop at the pier. The underwater light seems to come from no one, and whenever someone we should pay close attention to the air, this air tank will appear. I will avoid this if there is no other thing on the shelf. Have a great day.
