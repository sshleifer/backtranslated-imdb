Western society has been thinking about India as a poor country. This kind of movie only strengthens those beliefs. This illustration makes it difficult for everyone in India to be accepted abroad. Agree, there are poor people and homeless people in India. But why there are no people who are educated if not successful people? <br /> <br /> I hate the whole idea of ​​the movie that represents Patrick Swayze as another Mother Teresa. In my opinion, this film has shown India in a very bad sense that gives the wrong idea. It is not fair to discuss only one aspect of society. The reason people ask me "When we go to India, can we hire an elephant outside the airport, so we don't have to walk on a road full of dirt and snakes." <br /> <br /> Those who need a second opinion about society Contemporary India should see "Monsoon Wedding"
