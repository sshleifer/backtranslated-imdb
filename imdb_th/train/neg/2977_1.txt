Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /> <br /> Director: Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei <br /> <br /> Actress: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Serafin Deran <<br /> Review: <br /> <br /> To check this flick and get a good background of it, I have to start from the beginning. And the beginning of this is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn came out in 79, Lucio Fulci decided to create a sequel and indirectly call it Zombie 2. Do you know that zombies fight with sharks! OK, so after the flick (the name Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and made a large sum of money, the Italians decided heck to increase the zombie flicks! These things raking in the dough! So the Zombie 3 was born. Confused? The story of this story is just telling the story that we have seen in many American zombies that we have seen before. The best comparison that is thought of is the Return of the Living Dead. See ... There is a government experimenting with toxic gases that will turn people into zombies. Canister is released into the general population and shebang! We get a lot of zombies that crave human flesh. Many people began to run away from zombies and ended up in an old abandoned hotel. They have to fight with zombies to survive. <br /> <br /> There are many problems during the filming of this movie. First of all, Lucio Fulci, the beloved godfather of Italy, seriously ill. So he couldn't finish this movie as he wanted. The film was delivered to two directors, like Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They tried their best to create a movie that was not good. You see that Fulse himself doesn't have his mind and soul in this flick. He was not indifferent to it. He flicked at the manufacturer and generally said: "Do everything you want!" And God loves them. They do. <br /> <br /> And that's why our women and gentlemen are. The big-headed zombie flick with the great Fulci credited as "superintendent". The main problem in my opinion is that it is bored with no point! There is nothing! After the first few minutes that some terrorists stole the poisonous gas and accidentally let it go, the rest of the flick was just an empty soulless character without any personality running out of zombies. In some cases, this can prove to be fun. If # 1, creating zombies and actions of zombies is good and really fun, and # 2 has lots of blood and related organs. <br /> <br /> At Here we can't! There are some moments that have been inspired, such as when some eagles are infected by gas and start attacking people. It is very cool. There are also scenes that are related to the flying zombies head. (Which contradicts all logic and explanations) and scenes with zombies coming out of the hotel pool that were abandoned and chewing on the poor young girl's legs But other than that ... the flick of the rest just put on its ass. <br /> <br /> Endless in an endless scene that doesn't make a jack to move the plot without. Stay true at the same time That was my main catch with this flick. The unfinished scene and the direction of the art does not exist. I hate when everything doesn't look right! I like my movie b But this one really goes down! It's closer than flicking the z-level. If you ask me, <br /> <br /> Does the zombie make up? Pure shit, zombies are all Asian actors. (The film was filmed in the Philippines) so you can see zombies in Asia. But that's not a big problem because this movie is located in Phillip Island. It is the look of the zombies that really suck! They died of the same clothes for some reason. And things that go through for make-up zombies here are black makeup (Like smudges) on their faces One or two zombies are a little more complicated. But still not good enough to make an impression It is just a bunch of pointless goo on the actor's face. So don't just flick slowly But the zombies seem shit These things should be dead! However, for those who expect normal coldness in the temple, Fulci is not expected here because this is the most flick of others. And both involved (Mattei and Fragasso) did not enter into the heart and soul In fact, when you see something special on the DVD, you will see that when Fragasso was asked about his memories and his feelings about it here, he flicked, he didn't think seriously. You can tell that he was ashamed of it, and at various times he said that they "Just got a job and they do" and that my friend is the last nail in this flick. There is no love and no heart to create this movie. So you will get half-flicked zombies. <br /> <br /> For the perfect player or who wants to watch or flick the zombies every time. Others don't have to bother too! Rating: 1 of 5
