Let's be honest As a film school project, without budget and "real" actors, this is a very interesting movie. As a product that has been released on DVD for naive viewers, it is a product that is not very good. If I had to change the gap unconsciously and happen to catch this movie accidentally, it might be eye-catching and for a while. As a person who bought this DVD under the impression that I would get the right movie product like a movie, I was extremely disappointed. It is a TV video show that has played something according to the sixties series. But without such charm In addition to the male lead actor, Mr. Redfield (Who is the director) other actors seem to have broken out of the university (Looks too old for that matter) or the director's family member who appeared before the camera without Help, not just bed for show only But also including makeup artists or hairdressers (The horsehair cap that has grown beyond what has been done, or a cylindrical hat that is a very long way to build the 1840s). Blue screen for outdoor background Synthesizers created a "period" score that was not inspired by romantic karaoke, scolding the audience more than once. The movie tries to be "like a dream" while in reality it's just a collage that doesn't have the idea of ​​those shots that make up the montage. (And believe me, the standard is not too high to start with). Have interesting conversations all the time. But overall, it's quite lame and two-dimensional production in more than one way, without having to be genius from either the director or the team members. That was the way the movie "Arty" tried to look. In the 80s, Mr Redfield worked better than the actor than the director.
