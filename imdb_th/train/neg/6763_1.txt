God is a terrible thing! Oliver Stone may want to experiment or something. (See the use of music and pictures here) But for what? What is behind "Natural born killer" seems to be "smart" to see how the media can turn into a complete trash. Unfortunately, the movie has become a trash. Please, Mr. Stone. The next time you want to criticize the fascism of a violent TV program to get a high rate, avoid doing the same with your movie! Michael Haneke speaks intelligently about this film, that it is a manifestation of fascism, media, with the methods of fascist movies. How true it is ... He forgot to tell us about the big headaches that you get after sitting in the shit that is full of heavy loads!
