The standard procedure for Swedish movies today seems to begin by leaving credibility out the window and walking along that path throughout the rest of the process. RÃ¥narna is another good example of an unreasonable movie. <br /> <br /> Banks in Stockholm are robbed by a gang of robbers with a "military" style that is highly effective. Two police officers began investigating cases that were too complex to appear at first. <br /> <br /> As usual in Swedish movies, most actors consist of the same people you see over and over again. Mikael Persbrandt Must be in every Swedish movie in the past few years! But it's okay. I guess because Persbrandt is one of the few people who show up firmly here. (Like he did) The problem with this movie mostly revolves around its own story. First of all, the robbery feels like most of the background. Rather a movie about a young police fight to prove himself in the world of men (As never happened a thousand times with a great actress instead of Sophia Helin) had a completely unbelievable plot near the end that seems likely when Aliens landed Still, I thought it was a pretty good touch when I was half asleep. It makes things more active (and saves the ranking from another step down). <br /> <br /> At the end, the main problem is the same as most other Swedish movies. And the suspicions did not meet the standards that we are familiar with from other types of movies (mostly Hollywood). In my opinion, Swedish filmmakers should try to focus on planning and acting more and forget to try to create. "Action Light Hollywood" like now because this is another memorable attempt from the Swedish film industry. I rate 3/10.
