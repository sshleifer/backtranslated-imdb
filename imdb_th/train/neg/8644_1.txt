This is a complete hoax ... <br /> <br /> This film was filmed in Rajasthan in northwest India. Look at the chase-vehicle scene as an Indian. All writing is Hindi-language used in India. Drive through the general Jaipur road. In addition, the palace is still in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The filmmaker in the bonus DVD seems to have made them risked for filming in Kabul and around the scenes. Almost all action scenes were filmed in India. The scene in which they saw the group singing around the fire was a fake that they never thought of turning into Afgani's folk songs. They just recorded the folk songs of Rajasthan. How do I know because I have traveled extensively in that area? They are at the wagons to make the point bigger. I challenge the filmmakers to refuse.
