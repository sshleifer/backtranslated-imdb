<br /> <br /> I saw this in the Sci-Fi channel. It came right after the first one. For some reason, this movie made me interested. I don't know why, stop asking <br /> <br /> --- Spoiler --- Okay ... It's great that this guy is involved in making movies. In the first movie, he has "reasons" to kill people, but in the next scene, half of the killings / attempts to kill are generally unreasonable. Stanley kills the director due to creative differences. He captures co-authors due to creative differences. But what is the agreement that tries to kill the actor? No actors, no movies He wants "Looks realistic when they die"? If this would be a high-budget movie to use special techniques, MAN. Of course, like the first, the girl who had been escaped and Stanley became confused and disappeared, Woo (Peck) this movie has potential. And the most sad thing of all ... the sad part ... I will see "Cabin by the Lake 3" just because I like Judd Nelson and he is just a good part about this sequence
