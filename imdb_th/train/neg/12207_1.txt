I remember I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old. There was a Commodore 64 and I like to play Rambo. I put it on the VCR and restarted: this movie is really bad! Sylvester Stallone said that there are 3 words in all movies. (Except for the horrible sentimental words at the end) and the same expression in every way And the silly love that is in the middle, it can only be miraculously predicted I just finished sending all things quickly and going to exchange movies for other things.
