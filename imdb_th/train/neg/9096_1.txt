I think this is probably one of the worst movies I've ever watched. <br /> <br /> Trying to get. 'The same character' with others is a bad idea. If they can't find Sara Michelle and Ryan P. in this game, they should reduce their losses and say it. Instead of getting a horrible new actor in what they do I feel seriously like being in high school or (not good) playing college with a lever in showing these people. <br /> <br /> Where are they from these people? Is this their first movie? It looks like it is sure. <br /> <br /> The film is still parallel to the original in a few lines. I just watched the first program and pop up. # 2 I was very excited to see the second time and it turned out to be the worst show I've ever seen. I haven't rarely ever * ever * turned off * * *.
