Störtebeker is one of the worst television series that has ever happened on this planet. <br /> <br /> The performances are unbearable and the historical background is mostly ridiculous: only two examples: Visby is the third village. At this time it is a big city. But it's the best day Secondly, Hamburg would never be a city that takes care of pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg cannot reach the Baltic Sea. The major city at that time was Lübeck. <br /> <br /> But worse: the director! dilettante, like this man, how to be allowed to direct movies like this? impossible! There is no convincing scene at all. The fighting scene is ridiculous and I can't suppress the laughter in the last scene. <br /> <br /> I can't understand how important TV stations are incompetent
