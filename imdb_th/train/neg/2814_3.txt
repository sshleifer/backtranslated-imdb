1st View 8/26/2001 - 3 of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): Scary pictures But has a violent habit of lust (Which is understandable) which shows the relatives of the Marquis De Sade who acted the same sadistic and not having fun with it. The same actor (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) has a dual role (Marquis De Sade and his relatives). It seems that it wants to stimulate Christian faith. But then finally lost it for my disappointment But left an inconsistent feeling in the movie May be worse than if using sexual violence and violence But they try to make this story as little as possible, even with disgusting scenes My final idea is why Hooper wants to create this movie. Obviously, it took a moment to really publish. Then it must be horribly advertised and with Hooper's name in the name, hoping to earn money from his name and his blood Obviously this didn't work.
