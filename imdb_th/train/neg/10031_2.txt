I just saw a movie in the cinema. This movie has a very interesting point. The beauty of Kareena and the two songs may be just that. This movie is a complete disappointment in all areas. Everyone involved in this movie will be disappointed even in Mumbai as well. (Chennai has now made it a semi-final) <br /> <br /> But the worst thing I feel about the movie is the action scenes. Today, Bollywood is trying to imitate the action scenes from Hollywood. But they forgot that Hollywood director had a great effect on making it look real Unfortunately, the Bollywood director didn't have much time. They spend time with music and movie releases. Now, this stupid action scene might work in the South as an audience, just paying to watch their favorite actors kill a lot of people. But in Bollywood, of course, will not work. All the action scenes that I want, I will forward. At the end, even some Chinese people appear from somewhere to defeat Akshay Kumar. This is the height of madness. The audience does not pay to see such stupidity. I think Bollywood should now forget about action movies. They can't do it. The last good action I saw was from "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon ka Khialdi". The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me. Are these people watching their movies after they finish? Can they not know whether slow motion (Which uses the rope) is unrealistic and looks too young? Better not to have action scenes if you can't cope. I just want to go back to the era of Amitabh where movies like Zanjeer and Deewar are thrilling action scenes. In those days, the sound effects were not very effective. But the picture is better than the current scene. <br /> <br /> This movie should open the eyes of Bollywood film director. Please don't make action movies anymore until you get the art of making it true.
