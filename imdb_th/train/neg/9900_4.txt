I think any novel that is delighted that Moby Dick will not meet with the audience of the economic downturn that has enough problems. But the resemblance to the classic Herman Melville novel is a real coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact, half of this movie is a prequel in the main story we know. It's not that It was kept too much for this movie. The first time we met Ahab Creely (he had a surname and a brother) was lucky with two legs and the intention to marry Joan Bennett, the daughter of father Mapple. Derek, the younger brother, played by Lloyd Hughes wants to marry Bennett. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is Ahab in the top performance. Barrymore still doesn't understand the theater, sounds very much, and he shows off. The era of silence with voice-overs The beam of all the movies that this movie is playing. <br /> <br /> We saw Ahab losing his leg with a wonderful whale. Moby Dick and I must say that the amputation scene is quite gruesome. Of course, this is all that is before the code. Even so, I was confident that the 1930s audience would tremble. <br /> <br /> After that, the story of Ahab's whaling that he thought made him look ugly in the eyes of Joan Bennett. Melville, in fact, does not have a female character in Moby Dick as he writes. <br /> <br /> One thing that Melville did was invest in the crew of Ahab Pequod's ship with a personality apart from Queequeg, a human harpoon. Other names But not personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs may be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I saw this version of Moby Dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else.
