This semi-Italian horror movie started out like a soft main porn movie and became a mystery with a little end that was a good ending and the truth is quite boring, making this movie quite difficult. Worth watching is that there are many girls scattered throughout the movie. The story has a man at the beginning of the movie, luring the girl to his castle, where he proceeds to lead them to his dungeon, go berserk and seem to kill them. They show nude pictures But they have never shown murder at this point in the movie Then the man found a beautiful red head at the party and would do with her and marry her. He has things for the red head that you see while Evelyn, his beloved ex-wife, is one. She died under a situation that was not an audience business. After the murder of a lot of talkie scenes, it began to happen to the snake and fox like that. At this point, it's easy enough to know who is responsible for the murder and what motivation is if you have a ridiculous end. Everything is not like that. This film is not working for me. It gave me a lot of questions and during the third part of the film did not have the two-thirds of the first movie. Explaining Evelyn's death will help the film like the ending that Evelyn rose from the grave. Received a name that was not totally misleading as she left the grave just not under her own power The blood is very light, mostly with scenes with foxes and trails with quite a few blood as well. I just think that most of this movie is boring.
