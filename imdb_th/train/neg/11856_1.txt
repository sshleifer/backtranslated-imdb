I just saw this movie last night at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival and it makes me wonder if the people in the film festival really show the movie. This movie is terrible - I said that there is no impulse or hidden - it's terrible. The days of Matthew Modine as the leader ended. Gina Gershon used an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she was a shame She is involved in this film. Gloria Reuben has a strange little pendant in it - she's ashamed too. The script is terrible and we certainly don't focus on the characters. I highly doubt that this thing will be picked up. But then again, people in Hollywood know that they make mistakes. Sometimes I think "Kettle of Fish" is a serious competitor for the worst movie I've ever seen.
