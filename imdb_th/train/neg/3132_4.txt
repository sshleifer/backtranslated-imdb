I didn't give a great rating on IMDb, but I went to see it because I was a big fan of Bible-related content. The first thing that bothered me was the Indiana Jones movie wannabe a lot, but it seems that Casper Van Dien didn't watch those Jones movies via (But he should) I believe he tried to do the best. But the script just stopped Music also tries to be kinda Jones style as well. But for this movie, it seems to be too much work, as in the video part that doesn't deserve all the great music. Robert Wagner gives his best acting skills. In any way, the script makes everything break down. "Funniest" is an old school, some 20 years old. They only bring smiles to my face. There are some really bad camera angels. SFX seems to be homemade and unrealistic. Kevin VanHook may have a good idea about it. (in my opinion But I like that story) but things didn't work at the end Maybe he should put it in the paper when it was still fresh in his head when I (in the first minute) saw that the movie was going to be one of 'Cheap movie' I hope at least I'll 'hear' a good story. But sometimes the movie is disappointed
