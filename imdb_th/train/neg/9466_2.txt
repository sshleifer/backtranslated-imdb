This movie is very painful to watch. (Like many people who are as old as me and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - funny, clever, clever, strange and subversive at the same time. "The Cat in the Hat" absorbs the interest and spark from Mike Myers' story and performance while most cats are confused. Why are Borscht Belt accent, a patter that is not funny, an inappropriate gags I have to go back and read a new book to see the real problem: the book is simple. This movie is undesirable and too long. <br /> <br /> You don't expect all children's movies to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but this movie has created a new low point. Mike Myers will Need money?
