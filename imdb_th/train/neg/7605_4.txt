I guess "Gunslinger" is not as scary as the movie "Mystery Science Theater 3000" shows, but the Western people are not just the right hand of Roger Corman. (Beverly Garland) became a sheriff in the old town on the west side after her sheriff's husband was killed and had to fight with baddies. This movie was predictable. John Ireland is Rose's new center, working secretly for Allison Hayes, a ruthless (yes, 50-foot woman). In addition, the short appearance is Corman Dick Miller, who As a guest star (Miller is a star in Joe Dante's movie) <br /> <br /> I would like to confirm that you might want to see the "MST3K" version. Enjoy this movie really. They have a good time with it.
