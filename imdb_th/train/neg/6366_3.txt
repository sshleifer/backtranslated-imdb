There is no single reward factor in this movie. Both me and the couple love action movies. Especially the fight scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer are great) but this movie is not fun. The five-minute action was followed by twenty minutes of talk and "angry" facial expressions. The main hero was a character with a problem that saw the fight and was forced to watch constipation seriously at all times. The army interrupted the bowel movement by perfect fighting techniques. The music is not good as well. They fight rap and hip-hop style of the road because they are gangsters. The rest of the soundtrack is the normal background sound to the budget drama. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is classic B, the actors bring their lines as if they were reading them. He from the queue card and the line should be lit and left in the rotten Hollywood alleys. The film is called "Honor" but has no honor in creating this movie. It's a waste of money and spending wisely is something that I think is noble. <br /> <br /> Look at Felon instead of the fight scenes and the situation is more real.
