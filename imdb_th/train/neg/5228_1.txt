I watched this movie the night before. I can't begin to show how much this movie sucked. The writing of the show, even the clay, is terrible. Very bad. It's like watching a C-Span 24 hours a day. /> In addition, the movie animation is also of very low quality. I know this is a movie created by one person. But if he thinks he can lose 97 minutes, he may make a joke at least 1 second The cake that is the worst movie of all time. Yikes. It's really terrible. If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh out of this nasty thing My advice: Don't even buy or find it for that matter. Your brain will be better than you.
