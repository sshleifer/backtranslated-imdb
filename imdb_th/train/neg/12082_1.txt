Alas, a poor little village. I know him, dear reader, and let me tell you that this model! I don't know anyone in anyone who brings money to this flotsam, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They played the classic plays and transformed into the most boring melodrama plays possible. This model is quite bad that even the existence of a great actor like Maximilian Schell in the title role can be recorded. This film has the only ransom quality, which makes it good for "MST3K"; Mike, Servo and Crow enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Shakespeare if he Live when they do this thing. "Hamlet" This is not that bad. It's just plain bad. Absolutely scary
