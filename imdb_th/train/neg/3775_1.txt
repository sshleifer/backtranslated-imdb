As other viewers have said about this film, it is an interesting photographic experiment. The bold color of the comic book I think the director went with His "artistic vision" in watching movies instead of wanting to focus on bad content Even though there are actors who are celebrities But the show is still lacking in clarity and is an inconsistent story Madonna should be an actor who received the news before publishing. The good thing when she appeared here lent confidence to her album, "I breathe (a song inspired by the Dick Tracy movie)" which is a stratosphere strike. Not in and there is little relationship with this movie.) I guess most of the money from this movie comes from being tied to Madonna's "I'm Breathless" album. <br /> <br /> If you look at the house, think "There are two hours in my life that I want to come back". Help yourself to waste time - don't worry about this.
