The worst movie I've ever seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya has no story, no jokes, nothing! The action sequence seems to be a set of Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up ads that are sewn together. Has been heavily influenced by The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle but worked very badly. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much. But watching this movie is an experience that makes you wonder ?? !! ". <br /> <br /> The only thing you may remember after watching it is Kareena, tired of bikini. <br /> < br /> The reason I don't give '1' rating is that every time I think I see the worst thing, Bollywood proves me wrong.
