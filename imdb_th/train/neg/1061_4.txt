In describing the miserable common story of Milan, this movie may be revealed today. However, I feel that neorealism is not the director's bag of De Sica because here he decided to try and create a modern novel centered on a boy found in the cabbage patch in the country. After spending most of his childhood in the orphanage, Toto ended up living in a cottage in Milan. He organizes the residents of the community's operations and puts their spirits by swiping around with annoying, constant smiles on his face and testing them on their schedule. No one told him that his schedule would be above me because these people had more important things to think of, such as where the next noodle pot would come from. However, De Sika uses a delicate drama to highlight why these poor sods are located. It is a matter of capitalism, of course, and to show this, he is happy to discover the oil fields on their land. Great! But now he has surrendered in the making of serious movies, and the capitalist looks like a serious caricature, all fur coats and cigars. They want that land. But our math hero will not support such nonsense With the rhythm of the strange luck, his deceased guardian who died from the day of the cabbage appears in the sky and makes him a magical pigeon. He used it to send gifts to his friends, which proved to be greedy as a cigar smoker. I think this movie is an opportunity to miss. To mention the issue of poverty as many filmmakers had never done before, and then drowned in a fairy tale, why the 'wonderful' director came out with a kid-like plan we saw here. ? Hans Christian Anderson might have thought that there would be a poor group flying to Milan, Dumomo and going to a higher place on the broomstick. However, De Sica was declared a genius for This The fact that these people were so poor that their faith was stable and miracles that had never happened to them were enough for every storyteller to continue working. <br /> <br />
