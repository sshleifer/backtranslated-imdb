I don't think anyone who sat down to watch this movie would expect everything to appear from a distance like a classic ghost story. But you have to ask yourself when it ends This doesn't work at that level. But the actors tried hard and the film didn't end with happiness either. A story about an American couple traveling to Kyoto, Japan, for Ted Fletcher. (Edward Albert) able to write a book and he brought his wife Laura (Susan George) and daughter Amy Barrett, their friend Alex Curtis. (Doug McCall), who worked in the American consulate, helped them find a house and he found a house that was haunted about 140 years ago. In the same house, the samurai found that his wife was unfaithful to him and killed him. Both then committed suicide. Their ghosts still live in the house, and when the arrows arrive, it doesn't take long before the strange things begin to happen. <br /> <br /> ***** Alert spoiler * **** <br /> <br /> Sometimes, ghosts live in Fletcher's body and they start to behave like Japanese people that they used to be before and Laura began to flirt with Alex. Which leads to relationships At the same time, Ted became more rigid and after he poured the soup into Amy's throat, he went to ask for help from the monk. Unfortunately, the ghost received Ted, Laura and Alex to show their death scene like it happened 140 years ago. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Kevin Connor, known as the television director. good Horror movies and science fiction come first and have worked with McClure for a while. While this has never been close to the horror or development atmosphere, there are two things that I like. The first is that there is no wonderful end to which the newlyweds must overcome. It turned out to be a bloody fight in which everyone gave up on the evil of the ghost. Second, it has Susan George in the show! I am always a big fan of you, even though you appear in the schlock for the most part, but her performance is always excellent. In addition, she often appears nude, which she does here in two separate scenes, and while she doesn't have classic features, she has a unique tomboy like her look and it's one of The reason she is popular But after appearing in this stupid movie, I think it made her go out of business or work periodically. This is not a bad movie. But it never believed and watched the ghosts run around when the monk gave the exorcism with the value of a giggle or two The most important thing is that it's stupid and I hope George decides to continue her career.
