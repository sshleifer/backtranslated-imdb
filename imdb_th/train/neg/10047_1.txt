Now I write many reviews of MoH, and now is the worst period. Interesting evidence at the beginning was completely abandoned at the time of the credits. If watching people in things that they never in real life is like you ("Look at the basement!") This is your performance. Except that it's not fun or fun - it's annoying. <br /> <br /> The scope of the virus has never been seen before. I can overlook the fact that it only affects men because the situation is very scary. But then things worsened when the daughter let the dad daft into the house and eventually died with his hands. The woman fled north and ran into dozens of situations. Then the spirit or alien or something that appears and saves her life (What makes you go suck?) Or something. Then she huddled for warmth to the end. <br /> <br /> Awesome. These directors are sending this tripe.
