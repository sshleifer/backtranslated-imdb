My opinion for the Russian space race, Bitva za Kosmos (Battle for Space), which was shown on the first channel in Russia on 10-13 April 2006. Bad translations may destroy some details. The number of errors based on facts is not possible to list them, especially at first. (First missile development) Even half of US movies have many errors and omissions. The audience was not informed about the launch of the V-2 / A-4 from the United States. The three different Jupiter-powered rockets were launched with the serial number 'UE' onboard Apollo. 1 will be launched into the moon, etc. In the Russian half, every person is laughable No motivation, no life at all. Awesome uniforms and decorations Gagarin sings, waiting for the release. (I think this is a special song added in the Russian version)
