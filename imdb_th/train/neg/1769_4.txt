1st View 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): The movie Stephen King, shaped like a vampire. Campy has many strange and stupid elements that you start laughing. Strange about 3/4 ways in the movie And you wonder if this movie may have a religious ritual for fans of the King? It is the story of a mother and child who is sleepwalking. (The shape is like a cat that is shaped like a carnivorous body, needs life near the extinct human race) that moves from one city to another to find a virgin to live himself. They meet as high-class people, except they are secret lovers and cats hang around the house day and night. Cats are deadly animals, so they set traps in their homes to try to reduce the population. We have seen them break their necks a few times when they attack. (Which is the first experience in my movie as well), hoping that there will be no real cats that have been harmed by movie production The boy was a sweet girl that he was fascinated until he became "Sleepwalker" then he wants her body There is a lot of uniqueness of the movie camp that would be better if it was a satirical comedy in suburban life. But the director tries to scare you every two minutes until you hope that he will eventually bring out the blood and the film ends at Stephen King. This story ends. This film is interesting because the humor of the king has arrived more than usual. But his bizarre existence is great and what you have is a movie that his fans might like and should have in their collection. But is a movie experience worth cutting it.
