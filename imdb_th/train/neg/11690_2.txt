It is a waist that will soak up the wonderful actors in the movie that is weak and boring. In addition to all unanswered questions posted in other comments, what is very difficult to catch a thief? Just get rid of the bank staff, see who is at the bank from all camera angles before entering the robbers and you have the remaining 4 robbers in the hostage group. Where is the suspicion? Every body is talking about? Obviously, during the time when the hostages were asked to change to the same set, they all walked out of the front door ... seen many times. At least Spike Lee was able to create this movie with great music scores and art photography. Movies not worth Pronto!
