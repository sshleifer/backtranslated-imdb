For the satisfaction of seeing the Renaissance to have a better life The animation is great in the whole picture. Yes. But the character looks cool and hollow like the story and style of this movie With real actors, maybe the movie world doesn't feel lifeless at all There are many things to admire here. But in the end I found that what I could do was admire I didn't enjoy the movie very much, and it explained something that I had never seen before: the visual element can determine the positive view of the movie. I will not go so far as to say that this movie has nothing. But sometimes it is dangerously close I like the sci-fi sci-fi, Blade Runner and Dark City are two films that I think are great, but Blade Runner has a sad villain and Dark City has an arc of thought-provoking stories The renaissance of shadow and light, but there is little I hope I can watch this movie more. But the weak story and the empty character came in that direction The Renaissance is a burst of color and historical and artistic life. The ironic story that one of the most lifeless and lifeless films I've seen this year has been nicknamed by the Renaissance.
