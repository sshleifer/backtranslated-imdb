This is a cruel movie. Two crazy girls seduce and torture middle-aged men There is not much to give about the plot or "spoiler". I just commented that the ending was almost the most terrifying part of the flick. Most movies relate to Locke and Camp cackling. Offensively throughout the smiling moments of the camera. Added to the soundtrack that was played over and over again, including vaudevillian songs about "dear old dad" that suggested the quality of incest that the audience had never seen before This song is annoying at first, then ultimately causing the audience to suffer even more than what appears on the screen. The theme here is that the youth run rampant to understand that it is a reaction to the '60s, but made with imagination or a little style. Avoid it!
