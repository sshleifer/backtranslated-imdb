I have written a review of at least a half dozen in the endless little flick and no one has been published, so I have to think that the people at imdb.com like this scary movie. The idea that a group of oil technicians can regain a military tank set in the desert for over a decade and build a fighting machine again is a laughing matter. So the show and direction is through it.
