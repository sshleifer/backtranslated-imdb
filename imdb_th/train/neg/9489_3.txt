In theory, movies should be a form of entertainment. At this time, not including documentaries and other film-making experiments. Most movies, special movies, must not only But tell stories or news only But they must entertain the target group in some way All this just to say that in my opinion, a bad movie is not a movie with low production costs or low budget. Bad movies are boring movies. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" or "Asylum of the unlucky "that is known in the United States is a bad movie just because it's irrelevant and boring and boring While it has very good evidence, it is just a bad development and mediocre performances do not make it better. On the other hand, this movie may be a B-fine movie or even a classic. But here is just a bad attempt to create a movie. <br /> <br /> The director Philip J. Jones tells the story of James Bishop (Matt Stasi), a psychiatric youth who just worked in his dreams. At St. Andrews Psychiatric Hospital But the old hospital seemed to hide the secret After the mysterious death of some patients and the ongoing brutal rumors, James decided to find out what had happened. Just to discover the unbelief in his master, Dr. McCort (Bruce Payne), who believes that Bishop is mad like his patient. <br /> <br /> While the evidence is quite interesting Much needed In an effort to create a supernatural psychological thriller, Jones tried to find an easy way and create a movie full of all kinds of ancient ideas. Of course, there are many great movies that are full of ancient ideas, but in "Hellborn" everyone is wasted and turned into a fear of cheap jumping to make things move, resulting in boring and predictable stories. br /> <br /> The performance is quite mediocre for most by one. Great exceptions: Bruce Payne gives a great performance that makes the movie unworthy of such a good performance. Matt Stasi is very weak when the lead character and the remaining actors make a memorable performance. <br /> <br /> Despite all these shortcomings, one must write about "Hellborn"; It has a look that looks very good for the budget and is similar to today's large Holly Productions. In addition, make-up and prosthetics can be made very well and the design for the main rival is quite good. Sadly, the rest of the special effects are scary and outdated, making a huge difference to make-up and prostheses. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" is a movie with good things. afraid Horror movie fans or movies b- may not care about the real location But it's a boring and boring experience. 3/10
