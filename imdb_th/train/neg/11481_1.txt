If they get Ed Asner, why don't they get other actors instead of those who go to the same church as the producer? And why the protagonist threw an intelligent character down to the ground when he was never in danger It forced the old man to conceal the injury from arrogance and the young man would feel guilty for leaving him with a life-long disability. I guess that's why the main character refused money, though, and why the old man worked like a dog, even when he volunteered for a special job. If the d-bag is a bad guy because he is a long-distance fan, then why is the military better? He has a good reason to be jealous of the good reason to take her out of her homeland and protect more than control the distorted father. All the characters that are likely to be unsatisfied and others are 'bad' fans. How do they meet wine brokers and sawmill workers?
