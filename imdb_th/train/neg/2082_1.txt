It's a waste of time and money! My husband and I watched this movie - after watching the preview and thinking "maybe funny" is not correct! This movie is too long, about 90 minutes. The actor stuck in a script that was not well written and could not go out. The jokes are weak and tired, and not even seeing Wilson's naked image, can be exchanged as part of this movie. Special techniques ..... No, I expect half to see the reins and wires Uma in her flight scene And when the effect is obvious, people cannot control the flight or the battle of superhero bullets faster than bullets. They cover everything with a swirling vortex of the screen. Wilson's best friend is an excuse for a man and Wilson doesn't react with Umar or his colleagues. Sex scenes are not sexy and funny scenes are not a joke. I think I expect a lot from these actors. There is no sympathetic character, so I ended up ignoring the flying image. The only memorable performance is a child who plays Bedlam and G-Girl as a teenager - at least they have chemistry. Overall, the movie has a very foul smell - I don't even want to suggest that it is a lease - it will still be a waste of money!
