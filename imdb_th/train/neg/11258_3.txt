I used to talk about this in other reviews without a story. You can let the audience get the smoke and mirrors you want. But no one would give a curse. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have a good eye. For Art Deco 30s (which I like) and I think the idea of ​​using all digital backgrounds and possibly the wave of the future in film production However, it is clear that the director is interested in the digital rendering of his film. He has forgotten to shoot many scenes that will help tremendously in this film (spoiler) because of crying. Out loud, they forget to have a villain in this story! OK, they have one. But he has been dead for 20 years. By the time the movie takes place, Conran misses the point of having a villain. As far as the action goes, we look at Sky Captain (Law), shooting one robot, two or three wing planes (before Dex (Ribisi) telling him to stop shooting them !!!) and a double robot. But most of his time is lively and takes others to fight for him. Paltrow is Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever is completely lost in this movie. (The investigator who commented on her and the lack of chemistry of the law was correct) and I was bored to see the picture repeatedly, showing her that there were only two pictures on the left, both of which she Lost one movie in this irrational one, very funny, even though I saw it from 70 years, no one except Law and Paltrow had a significant time on the screen and that was a flaw Real Movies The audience didn't identify with robots. They wanted a hero that would be rooted and hateful and visible. Without that, including all the good attracting stories, all CG in the world will not help.
