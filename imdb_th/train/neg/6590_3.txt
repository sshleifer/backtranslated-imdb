The comments I read for this movie are quite good, so I decided to try watching BAD IDEA! This is another movie about ghosts for revenge on a group of friends. The story is a silly, two-part story. Ringo and one of the sprites, my sprinkling, know what you did last summer and add a small amount of single white women. There is nothing new in this plot and revisiting the monotonous words that I grew up and didn't like even fun this time. This movie jumped from the past too much, and when I understood everything I knew that it was not reasonable. The characters change from consciousness to psychotic killer in the blink of an eye. Talking about the characters, they are all your favorite songwriters - selfish lawyers, greedy, famous actresses, baseball stars who have been voyeur videos, bitter young girls, quiet chicks, freakin's strange black cats .. And I don't care at all Perhaps better writers may create movies. There are some appropriate scenes. But overall, this film is not a mess. I should mention 'videotape' that would be impossible for filming. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the worst horror movie in Asia. But this is still not good. If you want to see creepy images in the dark, or just want to laugh out loud in a leading performance scene or just want to shout "You're stupid!" On the movie screen or just want horror movies in Asia. Slap your arms when someone asks you how much you've seen - this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Those looking for the right plot
