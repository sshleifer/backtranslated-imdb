This is a superficial hedonism and / or social comment, wrapped in a sad story about a jealous young woman project to drive out of her father and his fianc√©. Is it a good incest or just looking through the eyes of a daughter with Electra complex? Who cares? All characters except Anne (Deborah Kerr) has no void and vile, Seberg is poor (I agree with the opinion "The man and the chest" of the previous review) The plot is full. The material that can be predicted is enough for a movie about 30 minutes, which unfortunately stretched out for an hour and a half! If you want to see wonderful robes and jewels on the Riviera, I suggest "To Catch a Thief" - which you will receive additional bonuses from fun stories and cute characters. <br /> <br / > I like to make movies to entertain me. Personally, I don't care where the movie is set. No matter what time or place, I want a good story - funny or drama. I want to see fun characters It doesn't hurt if I can relate to them. Poor Deborah Kerr gives good results in general, and David Niven has a nasty role. <br /> <br /> Ranking "2" for Kerr and Niven alone. And for movies such as various color scenes and Gloomy, black and white background Unfortunately, the best movies in the world cannot save poor stories with characters that are not fun. The ears of the sows are still the ears of the sows. So watching this mess makes me waste a lot of time.
