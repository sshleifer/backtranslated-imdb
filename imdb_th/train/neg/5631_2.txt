Shooting on a DVD is very dark. I think the screen has died. I think I didn't see half the movie. Even so, it is a bad craft and not interesting. I didn't find a story related to the name "The Black Widow". I hope to be a mystery or thriller But did not participate enough to take care after the first frame I rented a movie, especially for Willem Dafoe and felt sorry for losing his ability. I do not believe that Giada Colagrande has studied the film long enough to develop important movies. She is attractive and may develop into an actor. But she did a lot of things in this movie Even if they are married in real life But they lack chemical properties on the screen Their relationship seems unbelievable. I do not understand why other characters were brought into the story.
