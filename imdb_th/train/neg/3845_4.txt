Although Bette Davis did a great job as Mildred, I felt that this film was not the best thing I have ever seen. At the end of the movie, I felt like something was missing in that story. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis works perfectly and she makes me hate her and pity her all the time. Leslie Howard performed very well, while the beloved Philip Carey and I comforted him in this film because she was in love with her. It was a sad story when he / she fell in love with a bad seed. And especially if being a person like Philp Carey who is a sensitive person, even though it is poor. <br /> <br /> Eventually, acting is something that comes through and not a plot The final scene is exceptionally good. But I am not the only one who will give it, even though others may find this movie good. But I was one who found it fairly good. I should recommend this movie to people who like bad seeds so that they can see what will happen to them if they find themselves falling in love with a scary person.
