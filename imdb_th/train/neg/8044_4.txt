Ok, I watched this movie 2 years ago and now I pull it out of the dust rack to see it again and I have to say that I actually think this movie is good. This movie has been very popular as a boot that I know what you did when the summer year 3, like Final Stab, Scream 4 and this movie wasn't that bad. I mean, it has flaws and of course it will be a laughable story to release this story in the cinema. But still having a midnight popcorn flick, this movie is not half bad. It has a fear and a very hot woman that I might add. It also shows the new look of Joey Lawrence that is clearly not even getting a great Hollywood role as well ...... I feel bad for a guy. He has such a career. In the early and mid 90's, with some flowers, Disney movies, and Lawrence brothers performing forever ... Joey Lawrence is a bit of a player in the sitcom scene. But after that, in a 360-degree view of his career going south, just make a cheap movie like this.> <br /> This movie makes you careful. Ultimately disappointed to find the secret It also makes you know who the murderer is. I have ideas. But still do not think who the murderer is But his motivation, combined with that secret, is much lessened. Is there a secret that has been released? This movie is probably one of the best rated movies. But I am a person who likes college themes, and I went to college in the spring at a large beachside mansion that resembles here, so it makes me appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> A strong slap Good for midnight movies
