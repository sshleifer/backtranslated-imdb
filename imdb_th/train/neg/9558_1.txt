I think this is a sequel to some genres and it has the same meaning as the original from 1983, but the sequels didn't use the original plot and destroy it. <br /> <br /> Actually, I expect less. Much This movie But I just died 95 minutes. No doubt - I actually felt that there was a clairvoyance, a bad performance and a lot of technical errors, so I didn't believe the computer. They try to blend between the typical war movies with 24 hours, but this is not worth the cheap TV movies. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie. Get the original instead The theme is still valid. Do not let the energy come in too much. And the performances and plot are even more interesting
