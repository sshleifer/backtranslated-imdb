Fragmentaric film about two people in Austria during the heat wave This type of movie is done more often and better. The story doesn't have any connection to himself other than the pathetic ending: 'Cruel people', nasty people and movies that go too long without creating issues ... very realistic, right? Hardly ... actually, not even the beautiful Franzisca Weiss can save this! 3/10
