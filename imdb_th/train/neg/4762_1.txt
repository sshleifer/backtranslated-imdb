I saw this film without knowing anything about it before. The plot is terrible with a large gap of missing information. This film has no sense. "Fighting with wisdom" For me, the actors just spoke ridiculous, sometimes causing me to gnash with pain as they do not wear clothes. The plot is predictable, except for the transvestite erotic scene at the end. (I'm not incriminating But makes me physically sick to the stomach) even the ending can be predicted And you can tell that the detective is Jude Law in every dress, from a fake accent, an awesome dental job, a shop hair salon, everything points to it disguised The whole movie feels like a waste of time in my life. This film has feelings about puppet performances, with Jude Law and Michael Kane as puppets and houses as windows to see performances.
