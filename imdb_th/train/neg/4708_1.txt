Oh dear! The first time I heard about this bad item was when one of my friends shouted like a fool "JOHNY TEST" while we were playing video games. I think he's confused "Johny Quest" (by the way, one of the best cartoons I've seen in my life) and changed "Quest" to "Test". The strange thing that I was wrong. In fact, I was wrong. He didn't change anything. He heard this. <br /> <br /> One day while watching TV, I heard that Cartoon Network was about to be released. I'm not sure. What is the plot of this program? So I took myself to see and this is my answer. "I want to come back an hour." (Because I watched this shit and "My Gym Partner's a Monkey" <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst performances I've ever seen. The most stupid in the world then plotted. Oh, my manners. Where am I not saying this plot? It's about a boy who has an amazing genius sister who has a lab and is experimenting with their own brother. OHHH Now I see why his name is Johny TEST. His girl <br /> <br >> I know for sure that Dexter's La b (before it was changed to NEW Dexter, including all the shit). This is a bad copy of a good old show, except that This is not good the miracle Don't look to do more useful things in that half hour than watching this shit.
