This is one of the worst cases of drift movies I've seen for a long time. It's so bad that I'm not sure where to start or even if it's worth it. The story is a real problem, and I feel sorry for the 'hypocrisy' as he plays the role that is right for him. Especially I like the nearest method, he manages to appear from the foot of the mountain to the top while the helicopter is coming. Climbing a day or two takes him five minutes! I can go: but it's not worth it Apart from the horrible openings (Which even five-year-olds are able to predict the results)
