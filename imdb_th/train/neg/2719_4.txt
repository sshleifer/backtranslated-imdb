When a small sphere of space age landed silly plaster on the earth, it soon began to eat the ground and put on weight. The only part of this unconscious drift car that I like is the cool classic cars. This dog has many holes that can be sliced ​​and sold as Swiss cheese. Does this generate $ 20 million in revenue? And McQueen's salary is 3K? Everyone paid too much. 'Monster' looks like a large bean bag and 'teenagers' look as if they have children near their teenage years. And those sounds from shotguns Listen like a pellet rifle with sound resistor. The ending is tragic. Obviously, the manufacturer is leaving the door open for the sequels .... and there are many thumbs down.
