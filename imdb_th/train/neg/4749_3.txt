This movie is very poorly written and directed. I fell asleep for 30 minutes. Through the movie, the comedy in the movie was repetitive and although the story was interesting in some corners. But it was pulled too far and at some point in vain. If you are 11 years old or over, you will overlook writing in the movie and feel disappointed. But if you are less than 10 years old, this is a movie that will catch your attention and be amazed by all the stunned performances. And hope you are a warrior The selection of the actors in this movie is not good and the song is very disappointing because it seems like they are trying to create tension. But it is not compatible at level 1-10 (excellent 10 people, 1 bad guy). The performance in this movie is 4. Brenda Zong has a funny ability But with this type of movie, in some of the more violent scenes, her performance is laughable when she makes her "fight". Some of the positions I started laughing loudly. Such as the part that her enemy has become a terrible villain, possessing her voice changing dark and evil, I think it's incredibly stupid and how Wendy's teacher (Brenda Song) is all of her teachers at the school. So to summarize it all is a disappointing movie. But ok if you are under 10 years old
