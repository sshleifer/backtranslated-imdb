The Underground Comedy movie may be the worst train wreck I've ever seen. Fortunately, I didn't pay for this film and my friend agreed reluctantly to watch it again compared to it. But he wanted to prove to me that it was scary I like color comedy I think at least it will be like that and I will be entertained. No, instead of acting horribly "funny" is wonderful and the plot is not found. Maybe it's not a plot, so I can't stand it. It's quite sad that the most funny thing about the joke is an old woman with her head hit by a bat ..... by Batman ... A man dressed in a baseball suit that holds hilarious baseball sticks. I get the feeling of watching this movie that the creator created and laughed like crazy with their friends about it. Perhaps this is a joke that we don't understand. Or maybe it is the worst garbage piece and it should be trapped in a grave and dumped in the Arctic Ocean. <br /> <br /> P.S. Don't buy this movie!
