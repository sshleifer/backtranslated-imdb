After reading many good reviews and hearing good things about it with words from my mouth, I decided to rent the word Und Undone. I must say that I was quite disappointed. This story is difficult to follow because this movie was created as a backdrop between the past, present and past that was executed. Characters, even actors, will try their best to be flat and not interesting. Sex and nudity are clearer than they want. I have never seen a movie that they seem unnecessary with the plot. The ending is anti-climatic and leaves a lot of unanswered questions in the story, which has not been well explained since first. In my opinion, wasted time
