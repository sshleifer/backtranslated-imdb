"Welcome to Collinwood" is disastrous when considering the people involved should be improved many times. <br /> <br /> Watching, if at least you are bound to believe that it will improve It is one of the potential movies. But was robbed due to the potential of bad scripts and bad performances, not to mention the annoying and unnecessary George Clooney character, so little that I didn't even want to know his name. /> <br /> The only elegance of this movie is a strange vocabulary. I find myself thinking it over and over again when I see more crime. This is the only reason I gave this movie 3, the plot is boring. The characters are nervous, have unwanted emotions and don't like much. They are in a constant state of suffering stress and all of them are annoyed that I celebrate their obstacles. They shouted at each other and swore fiercely. The conversation is the most tainted and insulting the fool at the lowest point. <br /> <br /> I found Steven "Traffic" Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah. They should have been trying to make war crimes if anyone who remembers this shit long enough to pay attention.
