Although it was a movie in 2001, the direction was an art style in the 90s that was considered "old" and obsolete a few years ago. Wounds and effects look painful. The script is good enough and a few scenes make me obsessed. (Eg when the taxi driver took her to the bridge at night) but the story of the detective that his own sister killed himself and how he was obsessed with suicide is just scary The actors of the actors who played the role of Selma Blair's boyfriend made me seriously annoyed. I watched the whole story, which was difficult for random, this movie is something you just found on TV and decided to watch.
