Usually I don't think Hollywood productions are suitable to be called movies, so I called them 'movies' instead. This elephant dung is not suitable to be called movies. Speaking in the story, <br /> <br /> Where do I start? 1. If this is not the beginning of the selection of an elderly actor, of course, it is a good example of it. Over Her age should be 18 years old and she is forty two runs! <br /> <br /> 2 Scary and illogical images of Paris and France that we see ancient characters, such as: the shopkeepers who are sympathetic to the Queen of the deceitful models who are fairies Former angels, queen models Respect for the Da Vinci Code (Which the investigator has considered correctly is a joke) <br /> <br /> 3 It's ridiculous and ridiculous that there are no nudity in movies about the time and place where nudity is common. Especially if the focus is all about that <br /> <br /> 4 awesome accents !!! <br /> <br /> 5. Nana Mouskouri Elevator Music !!! <br /> <br /> I can go further But I think this is enough And I can do these observations after watching this shit for only half an hour while surfing the internet and talking to my friends about mathematical equations ... I mean ... !!!!! <br /> <br /> I invite everyone to add to my list :): P: D
