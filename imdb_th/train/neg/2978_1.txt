I'm a big fan of big horror movies and zombie movies are my favorite, saying Zombi 3 is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is no need to say that I really enjoy it. It's the worst movie I've seen for a long time. The story is similar to "The Return of the Dead" by Dan O'Bannon But while this film is a deliberate joke It has the most ridiculous performances I have ever seen, especially from the main characters of scientists. His scenes with the generals are crazy. In addition, the effects are also subpar and in many cases are sloppy and the scene of death is often stupid. Of course, this makes it even more fun. Possible. Spoiler - The worst is the scene where the man opens the refrigerator door and sees the zombie head cut off and then opens his eyes and flies away from the fridge. The neck kills him. The zombies head is capable. To float in the air now? It challenges all the laws of physics that humans know and is one of the most ridiculous things ever shot. That was just one of those very stupid moments of sillyness. I can't believe that it will get a very high rating. If you are a big fan of bad movies, do yourself a favor and rent this sucker.
