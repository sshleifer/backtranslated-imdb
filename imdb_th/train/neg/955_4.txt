I do not think any player in Hollywood history will remain as long as David Niven makes the most of the weak film that he has to carry with his amazing charm. He can perform and receive Oscars. But most of the content that he has done is as light as the two-story tissue. <br /> <br /> Happy Go Lovely is the point. That they were in the Scot's suit, because this film is located in Edinburgh during the festival But if you remember one song, you must have a photo memory. <br /> <br /> The story is bright. Vera-Ellen is an American lead actor in a musical that is clearly out of town in Edinburgh. She started in the chorus and worked slowly one day. She was raised from the driver of the king, a rich greeting card. Now everyone thinks that she is an avid billionaire. The door opened when they had not been opened before. <br /> <br /> The millionaire is David Niven and he goes along with it and the circumstances caused by the mistake. Cesar Romero had a good time here as The amazing producer of this musical. <br /> <br /> Finally, although Happy Go Lovely is light and harmless, David Niven makes it and is very disgusted.
