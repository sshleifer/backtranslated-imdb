Wow, I can't believe that people will see this movie as 'good'. Now I see things that are worse than this. But there are more romantic / funny comedies with John Cusack. <br /> <br /> This is the best normal movie. While acting is not terrible But not good for romantic comedians There are many loose ends that do not appear or are fixed. Unfortunately, the main character came out cowardly. They do not know themselves well enough to realize that they do not love the people they share. How do we know that they do not love Without the utmost remorse, both characters must leave their finances. I can think of something more romantic than continuing to escape from the commitment that the two perform. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't end with other wedding scenes such as hot potatoes. Approaching This movie is about two people who can't do anything, which is different from the previous character of the chatter that is determined (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank etc.) <br /> <br /> The greatest failure of this movie is the lack of complete twists or anything interesting. When the movie ended, I felt that they did not include important points in the story, which were generally suitable for the whole movie: boring. No doubt, both would come together without being happy when they did not affect the Their actions <br /> <br /> It's a sad story that the blind people of the film's boredom. Any criticism against 'everyone's insulting!' the This is not cynicism determine objectively. There are also many other romantic comedians, even those with Grace Kelly or Eva Marie Saint. <br /> <br /> If you think that this movie is great, try watching these movies. Your heart will explode: You Bride woman, Grosse Pointe Blank, High fidelity, Faith healing, Charade, Rear window, North or something about Mary (which is a good examination of ideal romance with today's society )
