Woody Allen, when his best time had the sharpest pen He was able to observe suddenly and wrapped it around the punch like no one else. However, when he was in the worst of his movies Unfortunately "Melinda and Melinda" has a foul odor from opening to closing. The setting is one of his interesting ideas while Four friends sit in a restaurant to discuss how the essence of life is a joke or drama. To help in ending the argument, a man told the beginning of the story and asked two other men to dispute. (One of the other comedy writers is a playwright) regardless of whether this is a joke or a tragedy The two men then continue to tell the story and the movie shows the stories they weave. Now when I first hear about this film, my understanding is that they tell the exact same story. (Comedy or drama) changed by the way you watch Now it's interesting. However, the story has only one main element. It is a completely different story. This drama has a strong and pretentious script that can actually work as a parody. If this is the point, then it fails because these elements make the audience not feel the emotional investment in any characters. Funny movies are stories that have moments of success. But still short and fleeting It is obvious that Farrell will stand with Woody. But he can play this role more reliably without having to add woody stutters and hand ticks Woody is the best in Woody. When someone else tries, they do not play the characters, they are creating a known actor model. This type of thing draws viewers away from the story only. <br /> <br /> The movie Allen Wood that I like makes me go out of the theater a little bit more spiritually than I walked in. This made me want. My money back
