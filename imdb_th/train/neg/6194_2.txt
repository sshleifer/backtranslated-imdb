"Robert Carmichael" (short) creates a realistic study about youthful alienation and at the same time seems to be a criticism of the Iraq war. The problem of realism is that the characters are unrealistic and very unusual - in contrast to the horrifying imagination of extreme filmmakers, most teenagers do not use drugs. As a criticism of the Iraq war, a film about youth violence (By a classical musician with a complex ability - a society that destroys this sensitive person) is a child with little thought. With signs of technical ability But some examiners exaggerated like Kubrick and Noe. He showed that the desire to be shocked with serious intentions may be the worst trick in the latest movie. People like "Clockwork Orange "and" Irreversible "because they like rape and violence But most importantly, they like superior cultural feelings for the liking of the most hated Kubrick and not enough. Haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) here labeled this as one of the movies that Have the most morals in many years (I'm not against the violence in the movie. Seriously making it difficult. - People in the theater cheered Alex in "Clockwork Orange", indicating that Kubrick's intentions had been missed many miles. Than the excuse of many art film directors)
