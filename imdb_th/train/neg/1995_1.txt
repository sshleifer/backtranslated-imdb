I just paid a dollar for the DVD of this movie and it's not worth doing. It seems that it comes from a bad print and I believe it is in the public domain. <br /> <br /> Neagle - despite its reputation, awards and fame - she is an English girl who cannot sing or dance or act /> <br /> Some big Hollywood actors on display here have to think they're classic. Director Herbert Wilcox (Neagle's husband) always thought that Anna was the most exciting and talented woman on the screen. He was misunderstood. She was incredibly popular in United Kingdom before and after World War II. Her "serious" role is even more ridiculous than her musical appearance here. <br /> <br /> Only a few famous songs are included. The Together Skip this one and find the star at Doris Day. At least you get professional comedy and dance!
