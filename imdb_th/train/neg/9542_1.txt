I don't know what to say about horror movies that haven't been spoken yet. Honestly, I only have myself to be angry. I should know better when I saw the title of this film that it would be a scary story. But I like war games so I intend to indulge myself. I will live to regret this decision for the rest of my life. From the beginning, when the people of the government explained that their ultimate computer was able to decide who was the terrorist, just how well they played video games. Poor plot lists, conversations and shows that are terrible, as long as I try to post an error message. For those who say that they have watched the worst movie than this, please tell me. In fact, I was curious to see what can put this steamed dung
