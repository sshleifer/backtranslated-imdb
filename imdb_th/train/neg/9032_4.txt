I never understood Garbo's appeal. She is often found in her movies like stuck, not everything that attracts and annoying sounds that may drown in the tuba section. She is also a very limited actor, like Gloria Swanson, who is much better in the silent era. In her latest film, her performance is very ordinary and not even confident. She tried hard But it is not effective because the script is even worse than her performance. <br /> <br /> A will be a joke that has never been believed before. The air in the ski scene, which is the only amusing thing here) <br /> <br /> It has potential, but the script fails in almost every department Douglas and Garbo have equally good chemical properties. But this one is not the only point in Ninotchka, which I find too much to be true.
