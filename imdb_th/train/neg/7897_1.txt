This film was created for those who find that Gremlins are too serious and hardcore critters. Just like movies, critters / trolls / gremlins in the 80s. This movie is not good. The sad part is that there are no comments. It's terrible and not in a funny way. <br /> <br /> The problem with this tiny monster movie is that it tries to be funny and ends up being successful in doing so. Howie Mandell is here. In Walk Like A Man. What makes 80 more horror films become classic is that they truly try to be scary. But it's hilarious because they fail miserably. Some people have to tell Bettina Hirsch (Yes, THE Bettina Hirsch). She has a special ability in acting before starting to direct this film. Unfortunately they made mistakes. <br /> <br /> Be sure to see strange little mutations between the ferret and the tumors that wear brown robes. <br /> <br /> The most pleasant part. The most annoying of the movies is Paul Paul Reiser's wannabe schtick character, which is enough to make you start fast forwarding from his first scene until the credit ends only once, to stop watching one scene where munchie throws the ball Pool ... Not that I do that. Br / <br /> So the most important thing is running. Don't walk to your nearest blockbuster and shake hands with the manager and thank him for not having a grape. This garbage on the shelf
