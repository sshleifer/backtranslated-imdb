Had to decide recently to collect Billy Bob Thornton's movie (with the strength of the class movies such as "Sling Blade", "A Simple Plan" and "the guy who wasn't there" among Others) It's unavoidable. Will be a strange turkey in it. What I do not realize is that there may be a bad one. I will give you an idea of ​​how bad this movie is - the most fun dialogue in this story: "Knock Knock", "Who's there?", "The man with a big foul odor", "The big man who Who stinks? "," A man with a big foul odor - is you! "Yes, it's really bad. Billy Bob was there for about two minutes. (I guess he wanted a job at that time in his career) and the rest of the movie was painful. For some reason, even though it is undeniably scary But i don't hate it That may be because I save my exasperation for a high budget. Special effects that are full of junk such as "Fast and the Furious" and not "without budget" flick like this 2/10 in pushing.
