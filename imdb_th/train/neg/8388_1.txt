Came to the subject of warm hope Hope you won't have to suffer with this again. * Ai * Razzie Award * Ai * <br /> <br /> I don't like this movie because it's not funny, predictable and lacking. While watching, I felt like being in a psychological experiment to determine how low the movie standard before people complained. When I asked for a refund at the end of the movie, I was informed that because I watched everything. 'I have no right to receive a refund.' I was told by the assistant manager that many people have complained and received a refund even though <br /> <br /> The movie summary is quite easy. Stole the dwarf, stole the diamond and posed like a baby to escape the police Under this clever outline, is there a drama of fresh and hilarious play? <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: Do you like to see people being hit by a pan? Do you like fart jokes? Do you like to see dwarfs posing while the baby is threatened with a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired jokes? Do you think children say 'goo goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa'? Do you drool? <br /> <br /> If you say 'Yes' to all the above, this movie is for you. Though being charged in some places as 'The Worst Movie of the Decade' may have a movie or two stories that are worse ... somewhere. I can't say for sure I gave this movie 2 stars, because we all know that only one star review will indicate the bias of the reviewer and then the reviews will not be seriously considered. <br /> <br This lowbrow comedy movie is for less intelligent audiences and I can't recommend anyone saving your money for funny things. <br /> <br /> Respect
