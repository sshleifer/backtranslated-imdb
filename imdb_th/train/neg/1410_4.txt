Actors who are still famous But deteriorated (Morgan Freeman) was not filmed for four years. When he was invited to participate in the new project, he asked the director's clumsy cousin to let him down in the poor Latin district of Carlson to research the work of the manager of his small supermarket. Saw the beautiful Spanish Kashmiri Scarlet (Paz Vega) and he was attracted by her ability His driver never returned to catch him and Scarlet for the actors. But first, she got a job interview about the secretary position in the construction company and the actor helped her prepare. Then they spent the afternoon together to have a pleasant time. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, "10 or less" that are pointless is extremely disappointing. This low-priced movie does not seem to have a story and is supported by the chemistry and adaptation of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. In fact, nothing happened in the last 82 minutes. Morgan Freeman's drama returned to his silver spoon world and told the workers that they would not see each other again. Is he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his family? Or a class collision and he realizes that his familiar neighborhood is not enough for a simple worker from the lower classes? My rating is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Astro em Minha Vida" ("A Star in My Life")
