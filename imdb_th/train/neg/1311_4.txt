Jerry Spy Tom listens to eerie stories on the radio and seizes the opportunity to cause his nemesis. <br /> <br /> I can't find it now. Funny: Humor seems somewhat limited and all settings are lame. Essentially, Jerry is a 'bad guy' in this way, torturing Tom the poor without reason. <br /> <br /> Sometimes inspiring. (Such as Tom's 'heart in the mouth' experience) and the period in which nine of his lives were sucked out of his body) but overall, this effort had no rhythm, vibration, great animation and other cartoon images. Most of T&J
