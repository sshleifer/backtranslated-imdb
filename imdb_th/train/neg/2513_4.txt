When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it would come from the children's department - it was fun and sometimes funny and actually was quite a good thing, but it lacked "romantic chemistry". Shows like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins can deliver I must know that Walter Matthau is perfect for Albert Einstein and his performance is not unusual. But that is the only exception This movie seems to be a little forced, the director lacks chemistry and oh yes ... the music is really scary. It doesn't make me feel good. But if you do not expect to be a joke / romance that has been created well, this story can definitely be entertained, like I said .. It should be in the children of Ein. Stein and his friends are relieved of Tim Robbins' boring mission, almost tense to steal Meg Ryan's heart. The movie is very conflicting. But as long as it's not serious, this may be a movie that's okay.
