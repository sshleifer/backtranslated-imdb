This is the worst movie I've ever seen since. "I know who killed me" with Lindsey Lohan Hey Tim Burton, I've been a big fan of you ... Have you ever screened this movie? I mean serious f% #k what? <br /> <br /> Without abandoning anything, this is a short, vague story ... nine waking up. And the movie ends Oh, wait ... here comes with a spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert! At the end of the movie .... It rained. I thought that part of my soul died while watching this movie.
