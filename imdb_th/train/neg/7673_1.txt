I don't know where to start. Tara Reid must stop before she wears another movie, Stephen Dorff. It seems like he was inspired by his character from Val Kilmer in "Top Gun". ship Sound editing direction (Do we need a heavy metal video in the middle of the shooting?) Clothing (Bulletproof vest with muscle) and hey, no visible plot It surprised me that no one attached to the project stopped and said "Hey, these guys just don't have any reason to start again." Hope that Slater's career will be able to recover from this disaster. <br /> <br /> Deliver the worst movie I've ever seen.
