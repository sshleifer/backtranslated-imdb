When seeing Eliza Dushku that was hot in the Wrong Turn quite well, I decided to choose this instead of Return of the Living Dead of all the movies. Have never seen before But when considered as one of the most famous horror films ever There is nothing to recommend this movie and I'm talking about a great killer that should be. It does not have the youthful sex appeal of ordinary movies such as the movie I Know What You Last, Summer or Valentine or Urban Legend. It doesn't make sense. There is no excitement. There are very few performances or interesting writing. Obviously, the release date has been postponed many times for about a year, and the reason is clear. All movies came out as meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly for meaningless effects. Get wrong. If you want to watch Dushku, I want to watch movies with her and Elisabeth Harnois is the hottest - but I don't think Even though this film can be seen, Casey Affleck, the contract in Good Will Hunting is very scary here - he seems to lack both intelligence and courage. Enough for this
