I watched this movie with friends a few months ago. I still laugh today about the most stupidity. The first few scenes are hilarious. I won't lose anything. For those who want to see it, I don't want to break the laughter. No need to speak. All the time I watched this movie, I tried to figure out what the characters in this movie were doing. At the end, we are all bored. But when the hilarity and shock of the movie begins No plot and no signs of proper acting The characters have development about the characters in the book. "Learn to read" They also make lesbian sex scenes unattractive.
