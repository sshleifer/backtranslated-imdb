Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is the worst TV program ever created. No plot, just a group of children who are stupid by using martial arts while dressed in a second-class spandex dress. <br /> <br /> Special effects look like them. Coming from the 70s is a bad joke and the performance is terrible. <br /> <br /> The only thing worse than a TV show is a plastic garbage toy that is rated for our kids in Second level <br /> <br /> There are better performances for Your child, look! <br /> <br /> Try to listen to your children like the jukebox. They have cleverness beside them, which is different from Power Rangers.
