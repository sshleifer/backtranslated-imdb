I have a question for people who think about this idea. Why? What made them think of making the second movie of this story If the memory serves Cinderella, doesn't end with "They are all happy forever" I'm pretty sure it's like that or it is implied. Wait a moment if they live a happy life forever. How can there be a sequel? If they try to create the most boring story in history, there can be no sequel. I mean, of course, they can sing Cinderella about nonsense for two hours, but why? Movies that end with "Happy forever" cannot have a sequel If so, they will not live happily forever! Something went wrong which caused the problem. The first ending! why? Wrong, it's evil That is my last word in this matter.
