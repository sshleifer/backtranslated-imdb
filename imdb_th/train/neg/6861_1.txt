Getting to experience my first Templarios is not a good thing. I am excited to meet this title from the proposal from Anchor Bay Video, which brought us other cult classics such as "Spider Baby". But only cannot hide the fact that this movie is boring There is an exciting opening scene in which the villagers demand revenge for the Templars. (And making things moving) but other things in the movie are slow, boring and eventually unsuccessful Add insult to injury: The movie is dubbed as having no subtitles as promised in the video jacket.
