I want to see it because two reasons, one is the remake of the High Sierra and Bogart in two parts. Bogart is played by Jack Palance, which can play a dramatic role with such grueling as in The Big Knife. <br /> <br /> But now i doubt Why did they decide to create this remake? The following films are the same plot as Hig Sierra; Only here, the actors do not care, the director will get lost in his thoughts and who knows what the producer thinks. Jack Palance is tired of watching Shelley Winter and Shelley Winter. Asked himself what she did in this movie I don't want to compare her with Ida Lupino in the same role. And of course they have to use the dog story again! Of course, they may have different concepts. Perhaps the color may feel good to see the same position that they shot High Sierra, but it didn't add any quality to the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time if you've seen High Sierra first. Therefore, why do not see deceived film noir? For me, I should die more than to see it again ...
