Everyone who sees Tammuz's Child Eaters knows that this is a director who can do better. Hopefully it's not the case that there are too many hands in the pot (Telefilm, anyone?) And that is the case of the second feature jitter. The character is one dimension and more than that used. However, the view is excellent and offers a beautiful Pacific Northwest. <br /> <br /> Great movie Almost all external shots are sharp and beautiful. You can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves. <br /> <br /> Technically, this movie is the sound that they come - it's just a lack of heart.
