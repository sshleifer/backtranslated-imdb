Another big conspiracy movie that tries to blame the US government and the army. (Especially the army) for every disaster since the great flood Anyone who has spent time in the US Army can see what the film is. Uniforms, uniforms and gestures are all wrong. (And of course, every senior officer is a corrupt criminal or an idiot.) The blatant propaganda without trying. Most of the proposed theories have been proven in recent years. Using all the bored words, rumors and urban legends from all the bays are presented as the gospel. (The truth is that no one knows why some veterinarians are sick and others are healthy like horses.) PS This is not new. The war is not fun, and I know that World War II vet, Korea and Vietnam also have serious illnesses. (And the government is responsible for taking care of them all) movies that feel like this will not help solve the problem!
