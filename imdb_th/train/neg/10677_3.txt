I rented End Game without ever hearing this story. But i like political excitement so i think i will try After conducting research on the film, I found that it was intended for theatrical performances at first. But instead of going to the Channel Strait After seeing, I thought "No wonder" The film was shocking in its original sense. The story and the characters are things that are scalding. I can find the answer by the half-way mark. But the ending is a curved ball I must say that I did not expect it to end like I could. But that's not the issue in favor The more predictable ending would be better than the bad one. Perhaps the filmmakers saw how well the movie was guessing, so they decided to twist - even those who made the movie worse. <br /> <br /> Stay away.
