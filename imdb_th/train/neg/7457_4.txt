Chris Kattan is a great sketch artist on Saturday Night Live ... but he should leave the film industry only unless he controls creativity. He plays a cheerful character that is generally slow and slow. Want to know only the funny part? What they show in the example Yes, his actions with me are funny. Nothing else Especially when you can tell that he is trying hard to be a physical comedian, which he should not try because he is one. And yet 'Destroying the veterinary office' of him became worse. This movie made me develop my eyes. Avoid all expenses and watch the next live broadcast.
