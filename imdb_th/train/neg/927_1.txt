I mean, really, Charles Band, Full Moon leader, can release the total foul smell like DEMONICUS. I mean it shouldn't start with a green light. The recurring story, the weakest character, has no real story about other Tyranus. Then he is a bad friend. Then they write or the director leaves his path for a bad ending. That was a bad end. Demonicus grew. The last survivor escaped from a life-threatening cave. Chimera's image came to life again. Then, as she was walking home, Ala FUNHOUSE, a statue that had been destroyed centuries before, appeared again without reason to fall on top of her. I mean, it's unreasonable. What Charles thinks is that this pile of piles has been created with four different movie companies. They may ask me if I have a better idea than DEMONICUS. Thanks Turkey.
