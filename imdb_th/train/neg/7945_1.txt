This film confuses religious ethics and ideology until it fails to create a consistent argument against the death penalty at all levels. By presenting the legal action of the murder that was considered a catalyst for the end of humanity, this film elevates the killer to the state of the martyr for Christ. In any way, God was angry that the society had chosen to eliminate it, a madman who killed his parents by starting them with fire while they slept in bed. But the same God has no resentment against the murderer's actions The character leads a woman who commits suicide at a pregnancy outside of her religion, ultimately making her life in a challenging attempt. But it is unbelievable to save the killer life that was unsuccessful in other areas of the underdeveloped plot. Jesus came back as a powerless and discouraged homeless person to release God's anger as a symbol. The boring nation of Jesus, modern, not only But only reduced his humanity But also mocking the ideals of every church as well He could not affect humanity for good and incompetence. The edge of life waiting for humans to destroy themselves. At the same time, with a little help from Jesus, a mentally unstable pregnant woman found herself having the ability to incarnate herself as a newly born soulless son who saved all humans from the wrath of the Almighty. I also interpret it as a statement that supports abortion at some level. This film, which tries to weave many religious issues into a thriller, fails to make any religious issues that I can clearly interpret, except mocking people's beliefs. It raises many questions that never even try to answer. It does not take into account the religious values ​​of the listener while trying to demonstrate the achievement of stupid Asian people.
