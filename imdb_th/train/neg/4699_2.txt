Wow, the band brothers are naked. What should I say? I think I can say that this program is terrible. Number one: They are not capable. They may not be able to play musical instruments. Number 2: In commercial terms, they say they are famous. But no one has heard them until there is a crappy show coming Look, I don't really hate it that way. I'll give it like 4 out of 10, but the thing that makes me annoyed is that everyone says that they have great talent and Nat is profound and wrote deep lyrics My deep ass! He talks about hard-core wrestlers with inner feelings. Wow, I can read what it says on the bathroom wall and it will be deeper. And they don't have a reputation for themselves. Their parents are famous celebrities and want their children very well, so they create bad lists. I feel that it will be canceled soon.
