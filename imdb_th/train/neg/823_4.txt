First, it took half an hour to get a hackman out of jail and start working. We know that Hackman is going to work for his boss. Why waste almost a third of the movie in these sequences? Then Hackman was in the hotel and the story was no longer endless, just proving to us that Hackman was in close supervision again for another 20 minutes, then wasting more time showing the rally with his wife All of this should take at least 10-15 minutes to set up for real action, intrigue and twisting planning. When the action was about to go, I was so bored that I wanted the movie to end. Hackman is as good as usual and other actors as well, but this is the first big picture.
