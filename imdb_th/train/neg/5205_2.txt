Minimal scripts, minimal character development, minimal camera stillness The highest stretching scene, the highest headaches, encourages the thrust of the highest character that walks in the forest, doing nothing. Until the time flashed on the screen at 12:01 am. You can move fast and do not miss anything because there are three hunters that we don't know anything about doing nothing. For justice, this movie has an interesting string of songs, so maybe a music video might be the way to go with this. Unfortunately, it shouldn't be like that, and what should be a short period of twenty minutes is too long to believe. Forget about "Trigger Man". I know I'm trying.
