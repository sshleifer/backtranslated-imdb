A bloody mania that is likely about eating people, raping a woman He was shot by two policemen and then he was resurrected from the grave because some Satan-style rituals were preformed by evil sin. Women's hunting continues by zombie demons. Babies who sacrifice back from the grave and want the madman to die again But with the help of the police, this thing will be true ... <br /> <br /> 65 minutes of blood clutter ... Living zombies, dolls-babies, S&M, corrupt and distorted police, repent. The pagans who seek refuge in front of Jesus Christ and the screen of the three-part message of the movie explain to us what happened to the police who survived. (Yes, we should know!) ... Two good image fragments can't help the situation. I've seen the worst horror movie ever. But this one is also bad Recommended only for fans who are crazy about this type.
