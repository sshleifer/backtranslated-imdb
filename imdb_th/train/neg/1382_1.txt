This movie is terrible. The theater died in silence because everyone was embarrassed to see the trash. I think someone gave Jetle's lobotomy surgery and made him act with a dialogue written by five years old. The martial arts are 'okay' but when put next to the movie Jackie Chan and "The Matrix", you will see one of them better
