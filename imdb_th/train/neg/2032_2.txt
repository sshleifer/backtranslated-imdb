I gave these two stars for the clarity of the impressive DV shooting which gave the coolness and darkness of the characters. I am a generous person. I know. <br /> <br /> This movie failed in every account. I can't recommend this because it's not both poetic and blunt. Uninteresting or suspicious Not contradictory or unusual It is just a horrible debris that doesn't have a horror fan or a loophole that can be honestly recommended. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this thing. /> Thank you
