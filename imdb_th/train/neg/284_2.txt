Today, I just picked it up at the store for 99 cents only today and I still think I was robbed of "Dream to Believe". It is a boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and for $ 1 is too expensive for this. The film has only two notable features: 1. It has Keanu Reeves, Young and 2. It is directed by Paul Lynch, the man who made the Promo Night as well. Now enter the movie <br /> <br /> It's About a woman named Robin (Played by Olivia Dabo) who was seriously injured in a car accident that made her father's life worse So the accident prevented her from competing in the gymnastics competition. She was often chosen during the class and she eventually met with a wild boy named Tommy (played by Keanu) Robin when not practicing part-time work with her mother. And her sister at Laundromat, her own stepfather In the end, she chose to compete. <br /> <br /> Overall, Kano alone and the 80s song that is the ear is something that makes me not one of these stars and it's not a bad movie. The most ever But still far from good The DVD itself does not receive any coins since it seems to have sources from the old VHS and eventually the sound will disappear from the sync and when the credit ends almost ends. But it faded to black, although the sound is still heard, so this thing may be passed on as a barbarian. The DVD artwork is not as meaningful as it seems to be the latest photo of Keanu and Olivia and the floor. The latter is not related to the movie because it is not in itself. In any case, avoid all expenses, unless you are a fanatic. Keanu I may not hang it anymore. I might give it to The Cinema Snob, a great YT critic. Btw hey. If you have any crappy movies that they don't want in their eyes anymore, feel free to donate them to give Show his work
