Lee hosts 100 years of horror for Ted Newsom and talks about werewolves in the movie. He said something to the effect that only his lycanthropy was The Howling II. He then quipped. "The more you speak the less, the better." Of course, he was right because the film might be the worst in the show's catalog on all of his screens. The first film, Howling by Joe Dante, is a new werewolf movie with incredible special effects, including style and content. It's a movie that must be serious. As with other good original movies, the filmmakers for some strange reason think that Campy's sequel is more needed than the first work (see CHUD, then CHUD II to show this point). Many miles and miles away from one place on every page. There is absolutely nothing scary about this. It looks cheap and completely dark in most important scenes. Lee is the only actor in the movie that should be worth mentioning. (Okay, I'll give up with Ferdey Mayne.) Lee looks shy when he speaks absurd conversations and does ridiculous things. (Checking that ends with him and Stirba) Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what this wreck is, which is more acumen than the two leading actors who left America to go to Romania. The story is not worth checking here and you can bet that there is a little story worth mentioning when you need to have Stephen Parsons and his Babel band play through many movies in the first episode and episode. Sybil Danning is here, and yes, you take off your clothes and we will see that scene over and over again - one reviewer said 17 times (I counted ten - but very boring from that point ) I gave this movie to three stars. But it should be a real center - all three of the stories I give are 1 for Lee and the other two for your participation Nanning yuck!
