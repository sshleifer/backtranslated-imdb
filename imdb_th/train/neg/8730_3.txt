The remarkable thing in my mind in this film (sad) is the introduction to John Berlin (Andy Garcia) driving into town. You see a Mercedes running through a winding road that looks like a redwood tree. It's quite beautiful. <br /> <br /> Andy Garcia plays the character with the surname of Berlin. Okay ... Andy is too Latin / Latin. Maybe the white father married his Spanish mother for this? Who knows. But I can tell you that when you put him in the farm town and the Hicks, he stands out like a sore thumb, especially with his blazing accent when he gets angry. Yes, I know big things, right? He is still a good actor. <br /> <br /> The title involves a serial killer named Jennifer's victim. All the victims are blind and they distinguish them. The murderer has a temporary break but suddenly resurfaces when a blind witness (not asking) appears. Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman) Thurman works well to play as a blind man when I see Lance Henriksen playing Sgt Freddy Ross. I am worried Henriksen plays in Strange movies, especially at the end of the year I still can't forget him in the movie Bloodbath, that is, Kinkin Head. <br /> <br /> The Berlin movie came into a small town from LA. As a detective, he began investigating the murder of Jennifer. Body parts in local landfills His ability to discover one of the victims is blind, the irony of * SPOILER *, Freddy's murder by recording and similar names. I was very confused with the logic of having eight "Jennifer" and the motives of an insane killer that didn't hit much. Looking back, this film may be more true in showing people who are not suspected of being murderers just because they become a little stranger over time or may be born as Tony Looney in Ask his Garcia! Although the police are not allowed by law to press someone who is hard and eggs them without being legitimate. For the ending, it was a surprise. But can argue very much like GT The murder of Ross, the murderer, chose to follow his victim, choosing to fool me. <br /> <br /> And there are many opportunities he has to kill her. It's ridiculous. I will not destroy the end because even if it is shaky Although after that you might say "I'm a lucky person!" 4/10
