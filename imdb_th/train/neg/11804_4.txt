This remake of Billy Wilder's 1973 TV classic is inferior to the original surprise! <br /> <br /> First of all, good things. Lee J. Cobb makes Barton Keyes great. Of course, he's not as good as Edward G. Robinson, but he's the only reason to watch. The first remake of this remake is to reduce the role of Lola Dietrichson, the daughter of the evil woman of Phyllis Dietrichson. <br /> <br /> And that's a good thing. <br /> <br /> The bad thing. many The director records everything in an indifferent manner: if you watch a movie with a muted voice, you will hardly get the impression that something special is happening. Since the taste is not good at present, the film must be colored instead of black and white. Due to the bad taste in the 1970s, the whole set was so ugly. In particular, the expensive apartment of Walter Neff is ugly. <br /> <br /> Modern settings can be painful in many ways. Traveling by train is more strange in the 70s than in the 40s. Therefore, the decision of Ditrichson to take the train seems to be more planned. The man stopped wearing a hat, which prevented Walter from covering his brown hair while posing as Mr. Dittinson. White hair. Women in mourning stopped wearing Samantha Eggar's robotic veil, Barbara Stanwyck's pillars. Take great advantage in the important scenes. (Oddly, Lola still has a line that she revealed that her stepmother is trying to black hat and veil before she wants) <br /> <br /> Stephen Bochko takes care of Billy Weil's role. Der-Raymond Chandler is like. But he changed the small, inexplicable dialogue that made the flabby script a little, which once had a slim body. The famous motorcycle parody artist disappeared. But looking closely, you will see what it looks like after the production that should have those lines. Bochco may not be blamed. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna can pass like Walter Neff. Resistant to Phyllis Dietrichson is really excellent. But we can get Samantha Eggar, which is released from the standard problem of "Barnaby Jones", but who can blame Eggar? With a director who doesn't care about what will happen in front of the camera, how will Barbara Stanwick come out?
