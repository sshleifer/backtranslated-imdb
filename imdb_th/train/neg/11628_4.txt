Wow, you guys are too good !!! Corny, Corny, Corny That's what I feel about this movie. It starts well with a good idea. A man. (Edward Asner) escapes from a prison dressed like Santa. He believes that he is the real Santa. The fake Santa asks the children to help him find the stolen money bag. This movie is like the Christmas version of "Downs Down" movies start well But it will gradually become Cheesier and Cheesier to the end. It eventually becomes nonsense and you are not serious about this movie. For example, you get the character Scrooge, named Sumner (Rene Auberjonois), who is all Douchebag who treats his little son like a garbage dump. Jeans with holes inside! But the 45-second scene with Fake Santa visiting Sumner and at the end of the movie, you get a guy who is happy to sing Christmas Carol and hug his abandoned son ... Oh, that's what Corny is .. I'm all for the feeling of a good movie, especially during Christmas and I'm a big fan of seasonal television movies. But this story is beyond reality. For me, it's a shame because it starts well. But in the second half of this film Movies that do not match the rest of it It's not bad. There are strong performances, especially from children, but there are many better Christmas movies around.
