Just finished looking. Can't tell if I'm impressed. <br /> <br /> It's a good start. The pictures and the atmosphere give a creepy feel as this type of movie should be done. But it will end when the first monster appears You don't just remember them from the lordi band, but they are seriously malplaced in movies. Doomsday monsters with leather jackets and punches have as many as 80. <br /> <br /> For the story, it started with a similar horror movie that people stuck in the pit of hell. But there is no clear story about the cause and what happened The audience is thrown at some lines for possible reasons. But the line never met and ended up with nothing but chaos. <br /> <br /> With all the money spent on this film, there is an interesting starting point. I think there will be more people taking care of the product. I wonder if lordi made this movie to prove that their acting outfit is scary. (Except they are not) <br /> <br /> So this movie is trusted by the picture. But the rest is an embarrassing attempt from the rock band to create a name instead of a monster on stage. To be more scary
