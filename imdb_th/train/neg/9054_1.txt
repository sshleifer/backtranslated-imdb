If you hate a narrow-minded accent, you will hate this movie. And to make it worse, you will see Patrick Swayze a trying to be a narrow-minded person I can't tolerate a stubborn accent. I like Billy Bob Thornton. He's good at Slingblade, but he's annoying in this movie. What's the name Lonnie Earl? How much of this movie is devastating? The story is stupid. I usually don't judge this movie. But I can't stand this movie If you want a good movie, Billy Bob Thornton, look at Slingblade. <br /> <br /> My mother found this movie for $ 5.95 at Wal Mart ... numbers ... I think I will Wrap it To grandma on Christmas Day It may be that I can't stand a stubborn accent as usual or that I can't tolerate Patrick Swayze. Maybe if Patrick Swayze isn't in it. I didn't laugh once in the movie. I always laughed stupidly if they showed that someone's fingers had been beaten. I might laugh. People 's fingers were smashed by accident, causing me to laugh.
