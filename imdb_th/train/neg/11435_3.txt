I hope I will know more about this film when I rent. I will put it in my queue on the basis of Heather Graham and her strong confidence as an actor (IMHO), while some of the movies have charm. Most movies feel that there is a development plan or not. Boring or predictable Not to mention the ICK factor of many people who think that brothers are lovers ... I don't care about how big the story is. And Charlie for a zoologist. She doesn't seem to be close to the signal from other Homo sapiens. What is it about her? (Apart from the heat and common interest) that makes Gray fall in love with her? The story may be even more interesting, with a slightly increased depth, a high score - Molly Shannon (although I agree with the examiner who finds her annoying on occasion), a taxi driver dragging and dancing sequence ( Sam & Gray is a great dancer like this. Because the bits that we show are better than the rest of most movies) should be better.
