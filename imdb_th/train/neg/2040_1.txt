This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I didn't exaggerate. I told people that Blockbuster should take it off the shelf. The only interesting thing about this movie is the box. On the box it says "From the director of the boogeyman" So I thought ... Eh, whatever, if it was created recently, I'm sure the director at least won't be too bad: - But after I saw Movies and see "boogeyman" that they're talking about. It's some nonsense from the early 1980s that he made a great way to tie up with unsuspecting audiences. <br /> <br /> Continue Go, I think they like the name "Zodiac Killer" and are not interested in studying crime or his zodiac sign, or even MO years that he is keen. All the crimes they talk about are not related to the zodiac, and the "story" about the traditional zodiac occurs many years after the zodiac's crime actually happened. They also compare Zodiac to the "Vampire of Dusseldorf" Fritz Haarman throughout the movie and talk to Fritz's "son". Often, the zodiac and the hanman have nothing in common, and it's more reasonable to compare him and BTK to shoot people Not a man who kills people by chewing through their necks. There is no accurate fact of Haman as well, just a nonsense fanatic. His son also said that "Don't forget his name is Fritz Haarman with 2 t's" ... His real name is only one! I think the writer / director just typed in google, searching for a serial killer and the fastest thing that happened was the Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman. "Oh, those sounds are like cool names. We come to make movies about them without Do anything outside! Great idea! "<br /> <br /> Perhaps my favorite disagreement in this movie is the way the experts The killer explains the suffering from DSM-IV and is cured. "I have also been diagnosed with DSM-IV and have disappeared since" etc. For those who do not know, DSM-IV is a psychological guide for mental disorders. If anyone suffers from the book itself, they must have some serious problems! Hahahaha. <br /> <br /> Next, my point is that it will be at the bottom of the top 5 worst movies of all time, and it's hard for the movie to come to that point. But if you are interested in watching a story that is not true about a serial killer that is not boring, a professional and completely unreasonable actor, I want to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> ... Oh and I like the killer "tear gas" his victims with dry ice. Good touch ...
