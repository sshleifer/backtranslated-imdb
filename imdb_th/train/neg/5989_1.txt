Wow, I paid 3.50 pounds to see this movie at the cinema. Can not believe that I waste my time The show is critically most worthy and the special effect is crude Probarly, the worst script in history, some of the most embarrassing words I've heard in my life. I swear to God. 'Swept away.' Better than this, Madonna should win and Oscar against them. My half hour life, I want to come back. People do not see this thing, even the toddler will find that this film is insulting their intelligence. I found this movie very strange in the fact that it was hard to tell who was the one who made more wood. Please ask you not to waste time on this movie. You will live to regret.
