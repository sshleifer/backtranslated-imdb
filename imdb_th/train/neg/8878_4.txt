Judy Halliday hit gold in 1950 with the movie "Born yesterday" by George Kucor and from that point forward, her career consists of trying to find good enough material to make her gold again. Never happened. In "It should have happened to you" (I can't think of a dilemma) Holliday did another form of silly blonde girl who might not be dumb. But everything about this movie feels warm and half-hearted. Even Jack Lemmon, in what I believe is his first screenplay, is unable to gather enough energy to enliven the recycled comedy. The audience knows that this movie will truly end from the beginning, so most will sit and watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you are attracted to the holidays, you will enjoy this. Otherwise I won't bother <br /> <br /> Grade: C
