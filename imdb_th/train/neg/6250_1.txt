I like this program very much, that is, until I realize all the mistakes in it. It's not realistic. I know it's a novel. But it is unbelievable even this is the reason ** the spoiler ahead ... ** Should we believe that children like Yuki are descended from the pharaohs of ancient Egypt? C'mon! He is the most stupid person in the world. And what happened to Pharaoh's hair (a.k.a. Atem and / or Yami)? The last time I checked Pharaoh was shaved. (Except for a little hair on the top of the head) and wearing a fancy hat. <br /> <br /> And we should believe that the evil wealthy boy genius named Setokaiba Can run a successful business legally while still having time to go to a small school like 'Domino High'? Puh-leeze! First of all, he must be a legitimate adult in the management of the company and that will make him not a genius boy because he will be the only adult in his class. And secondly, why did he attend school like 'Domino High' when his business was clearly successful enough that he would attend a prestigious institution In addition, the plans on the side with his younger brother are very intelligent and weak. Every time you turn back, that kid is kidnapped by a villain for bad people. * Yawn * Nothing new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joey is a poor boy who lives with his father. Good for It said that Joey had all the money to go to school because his father was an alcoholic. But you never saw Joey doing anything similar to the job at all. He didn't even talk about the job. And his sister Serenity is a complete moron Why do you choose someone who looks down on Duke (the author of her brother in a dog dress and makes him look down on him on television) with a good person like Tristan? Are you really shameless? Various characters throughout the show are dominated by demonic forces, causing the souls to be stolen by demonic forces and being victims of mental illness. (Oh, it's safe for kids, not) Tea is a kind of young woman in front of the house, which is intended to be a fan of Yugi / Yami only. <br /> <br /> The animation is terrible. Every character looks sick and tired of food. (Especially when they do someone's hand) and the color looks good but not the protagonist. <br /> <br /> But the worst hole in the series is the fact that Yami says that the Millennium Puzzle can deliver Spirit returned to the body If this was so, why did he not help Yuki's grandfather at first when Pegasus stole his soul and saved himself from the problems that would be returned? <br /> <br /> All that is real Commercial for yourself Another advantage of it is "Yu-Gi-Oh: Abridged Series" by LittleKuriboh. <br /> <br /> Please also do something worthwhile. Like to see the Abridged version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
