I don't think you will be worse Collect bad actors, fake limbs and stupid stories with three stories and what will you get? The pointless excuse of this B rate for movies. <br /> <br /> The first story shows poor video quality and the acting is really pathetic. Usually, Grandma Boon will eat a little bit of ears. Including men is ok But the girl is rather ugly "You look good!" No! The werewolf in this one is the best from the three that I say. But still not impressive because it is all bad The woman's face at a later time is suitable for Halloween. But not for werewolves. <br /> <br /> The story that makes you face the worse story is There are two lesbians in this next person who are completely mentally retarded. "I want to be a werewolf too." "How do you do this to me!" Stupid to say you, let's now get it! Werewolves will not talk about ... That mouse <br /> <br /> The third person has no point ... nearly forty-five minutes of running and boring narrative accompanying this story and all the alternate things. Haven't made it interesting, boring. <br /> <br /> The song isn't good ... that doesn't hear even some parts. It's stupid. Animal effects are stupid mice or pigs. Can't they use the lion's voice? Guess not to use good movies. Use it. Now, I = You can get this B rate. Good for you I received this movie because I was a hardcore werewolf fan and I would buy any werewolf movie and watch it again. But that's just me If you like good people, don't waste money. I beg you!
