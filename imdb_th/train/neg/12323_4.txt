Origin is a beautiful animated cartoon. The music, graphics, and the world that are created are beautiful and superior to most modern animation works. However, if you are looking for more than this, I recommend looking elsewhere. The beauty stopped at just the appearance of it, and when it came down to plan and character, it really was nothing special. The action is slow and minimal, and people are sometimes flat and not doing things realistically. No need to talk about the plot holes here and the plot there ... In conclusion, oh my goodness, I've never seen this beautiful anime. And oh my goodness is like ... - motivated - people don't do that It leaps forward in the graphics and music in anime. But it went back a few steps to a period of bad character and unfortunately there was not much action to compensate for that ...
