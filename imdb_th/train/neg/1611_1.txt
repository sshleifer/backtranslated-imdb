I think this is a movie that created and directed very badly. Benisio del Toro should not work in the making of movies. He should focus on his acting and that is Steven Soderbergh, missing the whole point of revolutionary ideas about the most important and important ideals of Che Guevara's life And so on. The camera is terrible, like a person who has 2 days of work experience being filmed. Music is ... I don't know .. Is there any music in the movie ???? I will not recommend this piece to anyone. It only takes about 4 hours in front of the TV or whatever ... I can't know who will rate this movie more than 3 stars. Disaster .... Disaster .... Disaster .... Disaster doesn't look please Save yourself from the misery of this "movie"
