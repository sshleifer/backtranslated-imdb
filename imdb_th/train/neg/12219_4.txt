This is a strange movie. It started quite well. A solid sound track behind the flash of blood and chaos while our psychosis does what he has. <br /> <br /> Later "fall" here, I can say that I am in the movie "B". True magic. Poor acting. I mean, how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop? These guys can't After the death scene of our psychopaths, we received the opening scene and the film started ... <br /> <br /> From this point, it was a bad performance, a big girl, occasional blood tanks and death scenes Can't do well. <Br /> <br /> Saying that I gave this movie four stories because, despite the shortcomings, it is still a creepy story that I can't shake. I recommend this movie, but I have to admit that I look worse
