I've seen some poor movies in the past. But what are they thinking when they make this movie? If the team builds into zombies when they think of the idea to create it because you are sure to have a dead brain in order to enjoy any kind. <br /> <br /> "Shoot 'em up "but combining daft scenes from the game makes this game ridiculous and can't be watched. <br /> <br /> As most people have already said I won't waste time explaining it. <br /> <br /> Everyone who scores this movie above 4 must be part of the production company or Sega or else they have a very distorted entertainment concept. > <br /> I must say that I am more frustrated with the thumbs-up video store that made me rent. Thank God that I have a second movie to see to restore confidence in my movies. <br /> <br /> Comic book men will be correct if they say "The Worst Movie Ever"!
