"Documentary" and we use that word loosely, concluding that Muslims are trying to occupy the world severely. Then said that any Muslim who does not admit that this is foolish to their beliefs or lie to you! Everyone who interviewed in this film found a laughable market in their reality by selling claptrap to conservatives willing to let others think for them. What Westerners want to know is nothing more than propaganda aimed at dwarves. If you are looking for a documentary about Islam and the current state of the Middle East, I will go elsewhere. Try something that gives you many points of view from certified sources.
