I will start by accepting that I'm not a fan of John Ford (I watch "The Informer" just because I'm trying to find a way through the list of "greats"). Disagree with me /> <br /> What a waste of truth and destruction today! I would say that there are good ideas for movies here. (It made me think of a few films about the Irish revolution) but as usual, Ford is determined to bury it under excessive and cheap confidence. I think it's quite interesting to watch for a while to see the less-than-seamless changes that occur from silence to "talker" - the style of performance of some executives is quality. exorbitant Movies and movies feel as though they may play better with the title card than the conversation. (Of course, the name card will prevent Ford from regaining consciousness every six times.) What conversations are usually there? "They always follow my Lucky Charms!" The worse quality is due to the fact that each actor seems to be allowed to use his or her Irish accent. Of course, it's not as good as it should be. The accent is useful to remind us that we are in Ireland because most of the scenes look as if they were dragged from parts. (It feels like there's an eagle eye. You may see some villagers go out to the torch. Dr. Frankenstein in the background.) <br /> <br /> Technological changes Tastes changed So I'm not going to see how crazy it was that the movie received praise that day. But it is not one of the classic stops rather than just "Fair warning" about the simple malaria that Ford is dedicating to his career.
