If there is a zero rating, I will give it to this movie. Today is the second time I try to watch it and I still can't do it from start to finish. I do not want to believe other stars that others give and can think that they will know the actors or publicists in disguise! The show was cruel throughout the script as blah. The child Nichole played showed no emotion even though she was threatened with the "Southern" accent from the actors playing. Texas - believe me, nobody talks about this! There is no emotion that she looks like in any real scene. This story is very serious and deserves much better treatment.
