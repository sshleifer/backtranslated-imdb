This film is not worth the time or money spent. Full of ancient ideas and plot that is not reasonable! I can't believe that many people make this movie so bad Too bad IMDb doesn't allow <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched it because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it. The sad thing is that I have never had great expectations from this movie before. But I felt a little changed Use my words. Don't waste your $ 8 on this trash. The only entertainment I got from this movie is creating fun for every director's name. Highly recommended!
