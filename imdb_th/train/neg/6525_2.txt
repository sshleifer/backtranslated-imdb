I gave this movie a second story and even though I thought I was a science fiction fan But I found this movie very difficult to be serious. It was at midnight of the AMC and I'm glad I saw it for free. This movie may be good for a couple of laughs, but not so much. <br /> <br /> The average special effects that were at that time - not terrible, but not great as well. Of course, we know more about Mars now. But we cannot tolerate this matter The main reason I don't like this movie is because of the story. <br /> <br /> There are many parts of this movie that I want to be explored in a little more detail - injury / condition of astronauts. Cities on Mars, life on the lake and more. Overall, this movie is like the lengthy episode of The Outer Limits, 1960s version - ended with a magical ending.
