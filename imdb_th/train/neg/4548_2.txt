Boring, minimal plot No character development I went to watch this movie with high expectations from the book. It's a great movie. It may become a classic cult. No, it's a giant release. It is badly used and has terrifying special effects. Is it hard to decide who is a bad person: a rebel or a soldier or a church or all of them? I am still confused with some mini plot from the movie. I was puzzled with some aspects of what is called "prophecy" which was never fully explained. I felt like watching a recurring episode of the mini-series on sci-fi. It seems to be a movie created for TV. Don't go to watch this movie. It's a waste of time and money.
