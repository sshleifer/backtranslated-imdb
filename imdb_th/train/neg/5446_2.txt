For loyal Duran Duran fans who want to watch good music videos, skip this one. The producer decided to create and make a 80s video about sci-fi related to the villain Barbarella, the villain that the band was named. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes this idea fail is in the middle of the song. The great Duran Duran of the 80s, a confusing and annoying scene that happened to show the enemy who tried to wear a band in their concert. Not only the good songs are interrupted repeatedly, but we have to suffer. The source of the story was spun by Dr. The evil Mario It is almost tolerable. 2/10
