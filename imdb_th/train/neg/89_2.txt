I've watched all four movies in this series. Each person wandering far and away from the book This is the worst thing. My problem is that it doesn't follow the book. It's named after in any way! The director and producer should name something other than "Joy's Abiding Joy". The only thing about this movie that resembles a book from a distance is the name of some characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scott, and Cookie) Name / age / gender of the wrong child The whole story is not in the book. <br /> <br /> I found that it was a great damage for Janette Oke. Her book and her fans in the production of the movie under her name were wrong. The music is too loud The actors are unbelievable - they don't have emotions. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family movie, it's clean. Don't watch it if you hope this book will have a short version. I hope this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt if more movies are made. I hope Michael Landon, Jr and others will approach the original story and story. The book is great and if followed closely will create a great movie!
