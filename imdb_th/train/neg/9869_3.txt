Not interested in this movie, better book Does anyone know where it was shot? *** This is the first time I have visited your website ... just found the answer to my question. So now I look like a puppet. But i think i will still send my comments And yes, British Columbia is cute *** or why they brought it from the coast of South Carolina (This question stands for this) The important place for the fabric of the book. Oh, I just read that I have to write at least ten lines. This is my other main problem with movies. Kim Bassinger is boring and is not a picture I got from the book. I know that this book is a book and a movie; Well, not good. I found the characters in the book more sympathetic. This book also appears in the countryside, almost the original image of the temple, while the "castle" in the film impresses more viewers. But it distorts the feelings of the story and looks conflicting with the characters
