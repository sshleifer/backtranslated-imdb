This movie is totally time consuming. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with a group of people who like to watch movies that are tasteful in a variety of movies, but it's an enthusiastic eye for "genius" (one In my friend's comment on this website, there is a bile attached to this steaming label)); There is no one who finds that the quality of the ransom is only one time. We ended the movie with a chorus of provocative insults. I will not reprint here. <br /> <br /> I can guess that the positive comments provided here are written by Sir Anthony Hopkins. As one of those investigators will tell you, he gave the film funding himself ?? Because there is no one in Hollywood or anywhere else in the world to risk the single money or their good name in this movie Do not let the famous actor appearing in this movie lure you into its clutches ?? As Christian Slater accepts in the special "Do" feature, he signed a contract with the film without having to read the script or know any details (ignorance, I'm sure he won't repeat it). Unlucky The person who stumbled into the quagmire of his own passion, wrote, directed, produced and financed by a celebrity who was too much to accept himself, not everything he created as a masterpiece. (And if you don't believe me please google "Anthony Hopkins" and art)
