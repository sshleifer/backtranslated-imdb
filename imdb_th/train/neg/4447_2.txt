Yes, there are worse movies out there. They are mostly created for fun on a shoe string budget or as a weekly movie t.v. But even though this is 'Weekly movies', but should probably score no more than two stars. It was a bad movie about serious matters that had abused women who fled the king of the slime to the king's defensive arm. (If this is an attempt to show that she does not want a man to protect her more than a young man who has superior power in the movie and should not be in it), it is without a doubt that there is no character development and heroine. That can be overcome with rotton onions (I think she washes her wedding ring on a boat with a tank, instead of throwing it into the ocean in the ocean (Which her body should continue to live) and after her husband showed her that she was a mentally retarded person, she continued to do A child-like assumption that led to her being killed) I was always surprised when I saw a movie that got this high rating and made me realize that Dr. Seuss still has a market that doesn't receive feedback from people. From his work After I laughed with humanity, I cried.
