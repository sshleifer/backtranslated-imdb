I'm very disappointed in this movie. I don't really know much about it, so I'm eager to see it play on film and educate me about a little history. With a true story that is powerful and a great actor Some screenplays failed. Is it so scattered - is this movie about his childhood? His love life? His own disability? His ability to speak? His passion for the disabled? I'm sure there are ways to combine all these things into a good story. But this movie is not I was left to look at the cold character that didn't like because of their disability. But because of their personality Other small grips: 1. A heavy soundtrack. It's seventies - we've already received! 2. If he is a public speaker, why are we not treated more than examples here and there - and even in montages?
