- Bad Stuff: This movie is true. Bad stunts for one thing. They look very fake. I think this is "The Twilight Zone". The incident is quite useless. Part of the movie that he thought to put anger out of the window would make his life better. I want to know the director of the casting and if he is tall, because acting even from adults is scary. Kiss scenes in this movie suck even This movie kills books. This book is great. I do not recommend this movie very much. Not even for education. <br /> <br /> - Good thing: I don't really know what I can say. There are some suspicious parts that will help you go. But they were shot by performances and performances. <br /> <br /> - My verdict: Don't look.
