There's nothing like a movie about a group of friends that not only But don't like everyone who hates each other But they have a little redemption to prevent the audience * to like or sympathize with others There are terrible movies, they are good (la ed wood or Tod slaughter movies) and only ordinary movies that are not good (like 99% of the "work" of Uwe Boll). A good MSTie sniper (like the Mystery Science Theater 3000). Luckily I have the ability to do that. (It's the way my mind works all the time) For those who are not naturally capable of MSTie riffing into this movie. Painfully perceived that the movie "Forbid" robbed you for about an hour and twenty minutes, you will not come back. Even the ability of my MSTie is almost unmatched for slow and boring time. The most puzzling aspect of this film is: * Someone * Green light and / or give money ... I rent "Taboo" only for Amber Benson with normal abilities. I have other films that are less known than yours in my rental queue. Reviews that I should read first better. The most strange aspect of this film is the impressive maze mansion for the interior.
