This show is probably the biggest and most ugly steam stack I have ever seen in a successful children's program. The protagonist of the story, Johnny, while I understand that he should be a representative of an ordinary child is not satisfactory or poor. The jokes are too weak (eg "Oh! Don't see that coming. "The law comes. That's not funny. Even the first time, it's not even cute.) And there is no traditional wisdom or inspiration. And in the end ... it's ugly to watch while children don't have special artistic talent. But they still like eye candy I can't stand watching the show because in some way, the art style is just ... gross, ugly, in a crummy reality. Just <br /> <br /> I can't help but get a lot of airtime. While I understand that nostalgia may be a little irrational, and I shouldn't have hoped that it will come back again ... I think of old cartoons. Bring Dexter's lab back. The Powerpuff Girls ... What? In addition to this nonsense I think it's just a desirable idea. <br /> <br /> Speak easily. I advise you not to waste your time on this program. I believe that truly good cartoons can be enjoyed by children as well, and this is not cut.
