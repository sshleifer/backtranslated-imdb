Men wicker do something impossible! It replaced Catwoman as the worst film in my mind about my iron trap movie theater. Yes, it's really bad. Terrible that when writing this review I thought to myself that "If I have the option to watch this movie again or have a red needle push my eyes," I might go to find a red hot needle. <br /> <br /> Neil LaBute created a rare movie that Joel Schumacher Can sit and speak with comfort and guilt-free mind "Yes, that's a bad direction." <br /> <br /> I think the first clue for I myself should be tagline: "Must make some sacrifices." Of course, it may sound like an intriguing premonition for you. But the sacrifice will be beside the audience of the screen Trust me in this matter. People who are responsible for this matter should be charged with crimes that hate ... or at least there is a fraud that is trying to send this matter out of anything that is similar to entertainment. Seriously! The movie about the island that men had just breeding and I was still stuck on the island of Gilligans with pictures of Condoleezza Rice only and found myself stuck there. <br /> <br /> The most entertaining part. about this The movie is the one who ripped the fart as loud as I have heard in a movie theater. That's not a joke or a fictional story. I never went to "Thriller" and heard many laughs throughout the story. I can't tell you exactly whether the laughter is intended in an attempt to reduce the tension of the cinema or if they just think crud will actually fly. I find myself searching for power outages or maybe quarreling in the cinema, whatever makes this thing more interesting, which is very sad, since Deez, Powder and I broke 2 beers in front of the movie just a little. (Soon to be a law on all Nic Cage movies. Write to your senator today. Don't wait.) At one point I thought maybe this movie might be And deceiving Anna Ferris is going to appear? Oh, I want it. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage throws a lot of ham on the frame I think. Today there are cholesterol tests. If I thought I had thought that Sean Penn was d * ck for knocking on Nic's performance, Oh, he was still less than one d * ck. Yes, yes. Sean Penn's d * ck has decreased because of this film. All of us are favorites. Nic plays your strengths and attaches to losers and drunkards. You can't play Superman. You don't get a strong, hunky role straight to jail. Don't go through. Don't collect 200 dollars. His best moment in this film is when he finally slips out of the body and punches. A woman with a lot of weight to steal her bear dress (Like a fart is not a joke or a moment that can be used during this examination) masturbating a bear, but there is half of the hilarity of the bear knocking his garbage around. Fortunately, he found his end shortly after That when he appeared as a sacrifice to the crowd on the new hybrid tour of Burning Man and Lilith Fair, yes !!!! I just make your ending broken, and if you know better, you'll create my statue in worship and sing in my legends. I sat crap with this festival, so you don't have to do anything. <br /> <br /> About halfway that I had wrongly thought about myself, Jack Bauer would have ended this case in 20. Minutes. OK 35 minutes. If Kim hit the first mountain lion Even Steve Martin, as a Clouseau inspector, can think about it in less than an hour and you are not a Clouseau inspector. <br /> <br /> If you are arrested for some reason and You have the option to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Somewhere where Uwe Boll laughs at all of us.
