The only redemption is the small part of Larry Miller. It seems that the movie tries too hard to be "Something About Mary", but I don't even like that movie, and it's still not up to those standards. The actor who plays Paul is excellent. But Selma Blair is stuck in the stupidity of her Cruel Intentions character. James Brolin is great, but Paul's father seems to be trying hard to be a Randy Quaid character from the movie. Chat Lamphun
