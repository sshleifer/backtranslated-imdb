I feel disappointed. This film is slightly predictable and doesn't live to the hype that is plastered around the box. Having said that, the character has been well developed. The legendary Windego is used in places like no other, and the house is quite scary. But it just misses me I'm waiting for that AHHHHH or that big BOO! But it never happened. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film is full of bad special effects. Demonstrating many terrible things and not using the atmosphere and imagination of the audience to create horror and suspicion Try a movie like session 9 or cube. If you're looking for horror movies that have a low budget but feel good.
