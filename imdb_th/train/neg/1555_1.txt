When I decided to watch THE BARBARIANS, starring Peter and David Paul, a bodybuilder, I thought it wouldn't be so bad because the film was directed by Ruggero Deodato, who was famous for making an incredible movie BARBARIANS is a very disgusting action / adventure movie that needs to be CONAN THE BARBARIAN and fail at all levels. The appearance of this film is totally wrong. Some scenes can be taken well. But the tone and acumen, the "disco" that looks like the tastes of people dressed in clothes and I do not look even a little sensible at this low budget. <br /> <br> Richard Lynch looks like An old woman with ridiculous hair and clothes He should be dangerous. But he found that it was a clown And it was a joke that saw Eva LaRue Callahan, one of all my stars, appearing in her first movie, walking around in a feathered bikini I'm sure you want this wreck to disappear from the earth! Barbarian twins that are called okay as a muscle-binding hero But it is almost impossible to create appropriate reviews for their performances because their role is like everything in this mess. The only way the movie tries to distinguish one from the other is to use a pair of duvets covered with a loincloth that covers his face, while another pair of muscular shawls barely barely out. I'm not kidding! Do not ask me who it is. <br /> <br /> Deodo must have hoped to make this movie. And his desperation was completely reflected in a worthless flick.
