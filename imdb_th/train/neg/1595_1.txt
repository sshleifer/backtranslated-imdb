The movie seems to attract me because Pokemon Celebi is a new style, but the plot is uncertain and doesn't focus on other movies. It's a waste of money and time. Humor, repetition, and bad people. This film is useless to do if you want to make Pokémon famous. This film should not be associated with cartoons such as Dragonballz, Digimon or Yu-Gi-Oh. Drawing and setting does not increase according to the standards of the original anime. It's a shame even when talking about this movie. I bet that Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the results of the movie and give up with Pokemon. Digimon is more anime and does not fall close to Pokémon. Its second movie is going to be released in late 2002.
