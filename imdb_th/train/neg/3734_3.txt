The chaos that cannot be truly understood, things in most movies seem to be more or less in 1987, but then there are many things that are thrown in like a police ray gun. And that car! The director seemed to love the light. The only outstanding performance is a woman who plays Valerie, but since there is no actor list, I don't know which actress is. This is worth missing. Grade: F
