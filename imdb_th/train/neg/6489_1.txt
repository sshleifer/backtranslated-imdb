What seems like a good proof for the movie ... Unfortunately, it can't be delivered at almost any level. Very difficult to follow at the beginning of the movie, I found myself fighting to encourage closure. The biggest problem from the picture is the fact that the camera works great with "punching" and semi-subliminal Wounds in movies that distract you from the overall story. It tries too hard to focus on you for a moment and creates a suspicious end. But this movie has a half-character set and an unrelated script that makes you feel frustrated and confused why they are buried deep down.
