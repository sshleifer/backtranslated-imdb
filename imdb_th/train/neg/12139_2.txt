I remember now that many kids come out crazy about it. I guess I'm too old to get excited and I'm really a fan of martial arts movies and I find it wonderful. <br /> <br /> In the early 90s we were full of programs like this. Makes children feel that they can fight and be a power ranger or equal to these children in the 3 ninjas. I think that eventually the parents and filmmakers are tired of what we have in reality, there are many children. Who smash and beat everyone <br /> <br /> Many children's movies have important issues that they are trying to do. And it is good for your kids to watch and receive this message without any messages ... it takes advantage of millions of different things in less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> movies There are no great visual features. But who can expect The performance is quite poor. Victor Wong is a cool actor. But it is embarrassing to see him here .. Fart the old, bitter and bitter, the powerful ninja who is hilarious, the kids act too much and the youngest ninja Tum Tum may be the worst child actor I've seen <br /> <br /> This movie has a plot that everyone knows before they read 3 Ninja reviews ... Yes, you know they're fighting against bad guys. And clearly winning ... must O I say more Sorry if I do it for others. <br /> <br /> Everything that children say will love it. This film is intended for children and children who can only enjoy it. If you don't mind that your child will watch a movie about fighting with children, this is a good movie to let them see. If you don't mind getting children to see the full garbage that is not related to martial arts, real performances or moments of reality, you will find movies for your kids ... I speak children because I think. That even girls like ... I remember all women who are interested in Rocky. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 stars because I think you can make movies for kids and also make fun for adults ... Movie this Big failures .. It's too wonderful and nothing original or unique and I won't let my child watch it ... The Kung Fu TV series is on DVD and has Shaw's movie. Many brothers .. Why not show children what to make them fun and not make them stupid all the way? Maybe teach them to move and not just how to kick a man between the legs like a grandfather. Do in 3 ninjas ... No, no, no ... Don't kick the person between the legs ... Never ..
