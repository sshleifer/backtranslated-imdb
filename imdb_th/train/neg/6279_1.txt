No, <br /> <br /> In general, you are watching something that is not reasonable. In order for this film to be broken for those who want to watch this movie, I will explain this. <br /> <br /> Every day women are normal. Every day, walking down the street of her own car, she follows her. And there have been many events that occurred during that time, including her and her family. <br /> <br /> I have created an account to comment on this particular movie. The performance was excellent. The event was excellent. But the story has just been brought up - it can be added a lot and is made into a worldwide epidemic. I'm not sure what the writer is trying to accomplish, usually at the end of most of your questions will be answered. But this movie, you ask, what will happen and another 1 hour and 20 minutes have passed without anything? <br /> <br /> The spoiler begins _ <br /> <br /> They have space between 2 dimensions. (Ours and behind the mirror) that will come into our world and kill us It is not elaborate on all things in the movie, and you never know when it's happening or why it's or when it happens. Nothing is explained during the movie. The main character should not be the main character. At the end of this movie, people who think it has run out and run away (Her sister's girlfriend) should be the main character But sadly, this movie ended 20 seconds after that. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10. Throw it out immediately .. don't waste time. I hope not to do this again.
