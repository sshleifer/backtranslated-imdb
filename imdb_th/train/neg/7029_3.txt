Phantom of the Mall is the best movie in the "Easy Forgotten" category. It is an eerie difference in the famous story by Gaston Leroux, Phantom of the Opera, not a bad idea for yourself. But the story and production of this movie is a weak way to show respect for that story. On the bright side Gaston Leroux didn't have to go back to his grave. It may be much worse. <br /> <br /> Phantom of the Mall has a futuristic scene that is too useless and there are scenes that are too boring to make it memorable. In addition, the script writer wants to make the story too much more than necessary. And even though there are many mysteries created about Eric's character ... the basic plot is normal and Deja Vu *** spoiler *** it's about the young couple being right Torn mercilessly because the boy was killed in the fire. The fire was set at his home because he and his parents refused to sell their home to make room for a large department store to be built. The boy survived the fire and he hid in the mall to avenge. At the same time, he defends his young girl who is now working in the mall and trying to forget her loss. **** END SPOILER *** This story is quite easy. While it should be an entertaining horror movie But it tries to be a smart thriller, and that's not what fans look for. There are a few innovative killings. But they are not satisfied enough for those who want to watch the horror movies that are relaxed and in addition, Phantom of the Mall may use a little bit of humor !! All of this production, including the actors, is too intense. <br /> <br /> I'll try to do good things ... like, for example, Ken Foree !! The deadly horror movie fan will definitely remember him as Peter for Dawn of the Dead! That is like a horror event that still needs to find an equal way. Although his role in this film is limited and completely unnecessary ... It is good to see him again. TV movie fans will recognize Morgan Fairchild as the mayor. She is a great actress and an elegant lady. Polly Shore is still here. But I can't ... my opinion about him may be a little biased And finally, it is an admiration from the leading actor Kari Whitman. She is a very beautiful woman and she has a little talent ... terrible that she never made it to the top. In fact, this movie is her greatest achievement and that is enough for her career ...
