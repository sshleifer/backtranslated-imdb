Since I was eight years old, I am an avid wrestling fan. No matter what I watch, WWE, WCW, USWA. For me, the action is all I have seen. <br /> <br /> May 23, 1999 That is my 19th birthday. I order Over the Edge and I Just hoping to receive compensation for watching again, but this time I was wrong. Instead of being one of the best wrestlers coming out of Canada, a real human being that was in his death. You can't change the situation a lot. But what happened from Owens' death caused me to be mad. <br /> <br /> But after that, he paid compensation for watching and doing the right thing as a human. WWE decided to protect what came. Before Paying to look as if Owens' death never happened. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you, Vince Mchmaon has made a foolish decision in his life. But this is the stupid decision he has ever made. <br /> <br /> And this shit by saying that Owen wants the pay-per-view perspective to continue. Let me take a break. When someone died in Penpay, watching the comon feeling to stop it, like a cop shooting a thief or a villain who ran and letting the man die so he could go home and call it a day as if life. <br /> <br /> No matter what happens Owen will miss and thank you for the memories you have given us.
