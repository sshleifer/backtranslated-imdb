CQ is the worst movie I saw this year. Almost every movie I choose to watch in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say. This movie looks like it's directed by his intro film student to the filmmaking class. His father created a great movie. His sister did well. But Roman brother? NO! One critic was brave enough to compare this movie with Godard's Le MÃ©pris (insulting). While Coppola Jr. used the same idea, the movie about the film he tried too hard to Make yourself look like Europeans, art and flair when everything is just a worthless art. The actors performed the same expression in the film, either as he was afraid or shocked by the film created around him. Schwartzman managed to pull out his role as director of the colorful Depardieu. There is a sense of humor in any movie, posing as a surprise, not a movie scene B, but a scene in Italy Editing the shots of many characters in a very small car, driving to pick up and send random people. This is the only thing that reminds me of a movie theater where I can guess whether he is trying to trick or tear out or both. The documentary that leads to talking to the camera and filming various things has been played at the end. Be tagged for the benefits of "twisting" or artistic value ... I think the most fun thing about this movie is movies. And not in the intended way It is not surprising that this film was returned after the festival screenings to be re-edited or filmed or whatever made me want to know how bad it was. I do not want to believe that it will be worse than this again. If you want to see a good parody of the movie, try Austin Powers movie. The opening of the third movie is more fun and intelligent than the whole movie, Lil 'Romy. Let the godfather go to father
