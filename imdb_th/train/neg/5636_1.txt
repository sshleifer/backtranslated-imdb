This movie is the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Looks like there's no plot. But when you know it's far beyond the beginning of the movie, so you have to watch the closure. For a long time to be aware of all the talents of director Akhaloth playing chick in the movie and we do not believe Willem Dafoe in this movie. And "boon docks" will not agree with this script. <br /> <br /> Duh (Da) wrote this bill off, along with his twenty years of removing the baby. The film begins with the credits of the two main characters, Dafoe and Colagrande, then the author of both the script Dafoe and Colagrande. Then the director Colagrande <br /> <br /> Bottomline (story); Widow meets a guy who's a widow, a widow, smashes the windshield with someone who bumps her. <br /> <br /> Topics in the Netherlands; Black Widow (different names, bullshit too) <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie !!! It's total time !!!
