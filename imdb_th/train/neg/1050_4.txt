Nathan Detroit ran illegal craps for players who played high in New York. But the heat remains and he can't find a safe place He bet on a chronic gambler, Sky Masterson, that Sky couldn't create the first missionary. Sarah Brown went out to dinner with him. Sky took the challenge. But the two men were surprised at the shop. <br /> <br /> This is one of the fifty years of expensive MGM music. Bright colors, big scenes, loud music and a bigger role than life. And performances to match; Broadway shooting for the big screen if you like something like that I don't like. My main problem with this type of film is music. I like all kinds of music from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but Broadway music is shown at the time of swinging along with the trumpet. pah-tah-tah-dah-dah That never ends at the end of every four bars, not my cup of tea This was written by the tag team of Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on the story of Damon Runyon, two) and while the story is rather delicate. For example, the two numbers of Blaine are the same, do not need to plot in advance and friction with the ear. (And still being a woman with obvious hatred if that bothering you) There are only two memorable songs: Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra as you expected) and Sit Down. Rockin 'The Boat (played by Kaye) but you have to sit for two hours to get to them. Trump card of this movie is a young brando that feels relaxed and efficient. He can sing quite well and even dance a little and still match Simmons that is always interesting. Their second escape to Havana tonight is a break from the noise, chaos and vowels of Nuo Hawk. Fans of the musical may dig this thing. But in my view, the drama has to do more than just performing on stage.
