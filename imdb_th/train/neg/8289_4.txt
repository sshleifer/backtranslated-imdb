I'm sorry, but this is a bad movie. It's very funny. Football thugs argue on the lodge trip? series? Shades?! Alan didn't know what he was talking about when he did this. It's far from the truth that you get <br /> <br /> Cruel actors ... Gary Oldman as a football connoisseur? He doesn't look scary, scary, or someone who likes football. And for Yeti? what's up? Suitable for shades and sat in the travels, mockingly each other "It's about when you have diapers." Please <br /> <br /> And the gang of Yeti spraying ICC's underwear? <br /> <br /> I don't see who can show. This movie can be serious! <br /> <br /> 4/10 It may be the most inaccurate image of the crisis in the late eighties that I have seen.
