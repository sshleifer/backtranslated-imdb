"They are among us" is the best science fiction. The performance in this movie is quite bad. Plot holes are many. An alien that came into the world either on a meteor and hid among us for over 100 years, but wanted a plastic surgeon to make them appear. In the form of aliens, they should have a skeleton outside (Which is why they need plastic surgery) And if you want to see the movie Alien Invasion, choose "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and see if it's correct or not
