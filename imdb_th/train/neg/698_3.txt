An unimaginable boost of the 'n slash' horror slash circuit in the 1980s. This was a filming as a prank but was released as The Dorm That Dripped Blood, which is a thief. Which is evident from the 1970 horror anthology The House, which drops the blood of Daphne Zuniga, a face that is only remembered by actors and this is her first horror movie (She appeared in The Initiation and The Fly II)
