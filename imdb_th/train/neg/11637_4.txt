Uwe Boll does things that are impossible: create a modified game that remains at least for the game. He transforms games that are full of anti-social content and aggressive content into movies that are full of anti-social content and aggressive content. So the adaptation is a success. Unfortunately, at Uwe Boll, we still keep in touch here, so don't expect this movie to be really good. While there is no time, "the post" wears his hospitality quickly and becomes a pain to sit through <br /> <br /> The key of the post office is the words in the United States as well as the twelve children. The year seems to be that Ball thinks that dissatisfaction is proportional to the values ​​of humor, even more nasty and fun. This resulted in a film that creates tastes at a new level while being hit hard. Yes, some jokes, but it is pure luck. High scores, including the director, taunting himself and the people severely affected by trucks and other vehicles. Low scores, including .. everything is quite good. <br /> <br /> After the surprise began Initially, the postage became tedious to watch. Yes, there are good jokes every ten minutes. But everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters to shoot and chase all over the place for what seems to be eternal. <br /> <br /> This may be working as a short film. But the content is not enough for some things that take more than 90 minutes (although it feels twice as long) with good ideas and good efforts But they strayed into action scenes and infinite and pointless, objectionable scenes just for the sake of it. 4/10
