I have nothing to say about this movie. It may be a great tour de force for Peter Sellers, but it is one of the most tragic mistakes in film history. The final film of the seller makes everything more painful. <br /> <br /> Scary movies, directions and performances made from wood are all terrifying to make this movie the most scary movie br /> I very much hoped that I would find even laughing or laughing, buried somewhere in the stumped dugong pile. But it was a lifeless disaster The truth is painful. <br /> <br /> Peter, why don't you stop there?
