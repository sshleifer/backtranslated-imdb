Umm .... Yes, it's a delightful story and all the unfortunate family members are certified by ABC / Sears and have their home. "Improved" That is what the sympathetic appeal ends. I like it at the beginning. But now this show is too disgusting. <br /> <br /> Ten poor families can get a luxurious home with lots of goodies for every family at each episode of this show. For mankind must shook his head unbelievably For example, whether or not a healthy sixteen-year-old child must have a jacuzzi in his bedroom or let his bed be deceived by the "Low Rider" hydraulic system. Want the old pick-up car that has been damaged and does not work, she has been revived and "pimped" by the best calender in California? New will work quite well and may be one third of the price. Do people want a sixty-five inch plasma screen in every room of the house? Then there is a problem that anyone paying more property taxes and utility bills, even after zaniacs that leave "Makeover". Someone is still earning a living. I wonder if the friendly people at Social Services will see humor in everything that is worth it. <br /> <br /> This show is nothing more than ABC ratings and commercial advertising for sponsors.
