"Fungus" may be the most shameful and pathetic film I have ever seen. The show is a criminal offense, there is no real way and special effects that can be combined by releasing monkeys that have problems learning on unprotected laptop computers. > <br /> I really believe that this thing shouldn't be done. I'm sure "movies" - manufacturers say yes. "Movies" are blocked by a low budget. (Absolutely nothing) - but in that case they just shouldn't pay attention They offered them something terrifying in the world, so the only attractive thing to be entertained from it. <br /> <br /> Getting Started "Movies" It's not like I did. As expected "Citizen Kane" or whatever I expect to have a little horror with little statements. There may be creativity, creative hints of fun and some energy. What I got is the equivalent of a handkerchief used in the theater. <br /> <br /> The anthropologist, Antigua, who stands in the basement of his parents, is seen with Enthusiastic, some people in the cup Obviously, such high-level science is the end result of research for many years. Then his parents sent him to a strange hotel in the countryside to relax. There are others who are too scary to write. However, scientists dropped his test tube on mushrooms and soon the mushrooms would grow and kill people. (Wow, I'm going to kill myself, just write a summary of the story.) Our hero helped the whole day by igniting the balsamic vinegar (by attaching the "fuse" - a real rope). Of small nuclear weapons, destroying all mushrooms, ending. (Thank God) <br /> <br /> The conclusion is as good as the "movie" received (and actually makes it sound more interesting than it actually is. ) It should not be See this development process. (By which I mean the plot plot is written on the back of a candle-colored envelope) someone should step in and let someone shake and say "no" <br /> < br /> and those "special" effects. They are "special". That's okay. This is CGI. It's crazy and made by people I believe only that the bike pump is the pinnacle of technology that modern And when the mushroom mushrooms were not in the form of computer graphics packages in the house in 1984, they were shown by actors who shuffled along the sheets of paper (I'm not a child) <br /> <br /> One of the most inexcusable things. About this movie is laziness. This can be concluded from the scene in which the hero revolves his gun (a la Clint Eastwood) and then fails miserably to put it in his bag. I mean, come a couple of times retakes and he'll get pulled out. But just to let it - really weak "The filmmakers" should hang their heads in shame and be banned from any filmmaking device within fifty meters. <br /> <br /> I still think it's wrong that the friends and family of the creators come in. Come on IMDB And posting deceptive reviews and surprisingly high user ratings that give all the wrong images of "movie" "Fungicide" as a true imitation of movie production Mr. Waskawaj is either a fool or another person.
