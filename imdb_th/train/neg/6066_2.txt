I am looking forward to seeing John Carpenter's episode in Season 2 because of his first cigarette. The fire is the best in Season 1 (and I am like other episodes in C. Sun) Oh, how disappointed I am. <br /> <br /> With justice to the carpenter, I think the main problem now is to write something very scary. The characters, in addition to the story, seem to behave and speak as though they were written for Walker's episode, Texas Ranger. The performance is not good and normal. I like Ron Pearlman very much. But I can blame them a lot because the writing is terrible. I will not try to guess what the writer is trying to do because it will be useless. But it seems that they are trying to mix horror (obviously) with social criticism in the form of abortion and religion In this case, it is not surprising that it seems that there is a chance to bash something or cult nuts, as well as resist frantic abortion. And I like both the aim But it was horribly done that I was embarrassed to see the characters performing and speaking with stupid disagreements. This thing completely failed to offer valuable comments about the subject and the horror element failed as well. Inappropriate writing <br /> <br /> While I don't think the carpenter will be blamed for the most badness here. He chose to control the telethon, so he had to take responsibility. There were a few small bits that I found so good. The 2 stars I gave <br /> <br /> Monster effect and F. The real effect is good, but the CGI Gore (two separate gun bullets) is clearly inferior to CGI. They should not be OK. In general, I am very important to CGI, but not because I have a problem in principle. I have a problem with its operation. The technology at that moment is amazing, in some respects, not good enough to match the "real" effect, whether they are miniatures or gore, especially when it should match something that Being organic and / or alive. CGI is able to use well in small amounts or clear that the whole movie is a scandal. <br /> <br /> I will use this opportunity to know the name of the Masters of Horror. Name The poor have a "horror" is not very true. Maybe two or three If the item is called "Tale of Horror" or something like that, it's okay. But since it is a guideline for directing one scene at the moment, so being criticized is not "The Lord of Horror" is that they have at least one horror movie in their career. And it doesn't have to be a good thing
