I saw "Paris Je T'Aime" because my friends really wanted to see, so I went with him. Going inside, I feel indifferent about this movie. But leaving the theater, I was really upset that I had to lose my life for 2 hours that I was sitting in this unkind production. The "story" was almost forgotten except that they were mostly scary. Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara were involved. With Paris The endless parade of most American actors certainly made this French film to feel remarkably non-French. Ancient ideas about Paris are endless. Yes, most of them play with ancient ideas about Paris. But by spending a lot of time creating fun for the ancient French people, they promoted them directly and again regretted Yes, Paris is a city of love. We understand. <br /> <br /> The worst group is: The group directed by Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); People with Nick Nolte; One mime (worst?); One hair product; One with Juliette Binoche (Willem Dafoe is a cowboy in the center of Paris?); One vampire (when I miss Paris, I miss Elijah Wood), someone with Natalie Portman who looks like an Mentos ad, and it's stupid. (The blind man should know that Portman is only a part when she calls him). It feels endless. <br /> <br /> I don't like Coen Bros one as well. It plays with real Parisien clich√©s but I Don't think it's funny Just annoying Gus Van Sant interesting one But it's a little (and the punchline is clear) that it's registered. <br /> <br /> There are only two "successes", and they are one of the mentors of immigrants. Leaving her child at a kindergarten to take care of a baby for a wealthy woman. Nice sarcastically there, and the parts about Africa that were stabbed. It's the best segment in all movies. But this segment is not related to Paris The story may happen in any city around the world. <br /> <br /> The last part with a middle-aged woman is also interesting. They want to celebrate her limited understanding of the French language. But that part came out like the rest. <br /> <br /> All projects felt forced and unaffected. Almost like the French government to support this film to promote tourism. In conclusion, with 10 to 15 minutes of interesting things, "Paris Je T'Aime" is an awesome movie experience.
