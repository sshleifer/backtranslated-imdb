Sometimes I don't know ... You try and try to make a charity for a B grade movie through Z all there. But sometimes, some movies will test your patience until you slap everyone involved. "Bat People" (which I saw under the name "It Lives By Night") is just this movie. You can't see this without thinking that it should be in the "Night Gallery" and not one of the best. <br /> <br /> This movie involves a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and starts. Changed to Were-Bat that drank human blood (Actually, you think that if he actually became a bat, he would eat mosquitoes with a gallon tank. But because this is a horror movie, cheap, scary, bloody, but) even though he is With severe seizures at the hat and dark episodes, almost every night, Dr. Mustache Aspen-Xt, a doctor and his friend, confirmed that he had just had an allergic reaction to rabies. At the same time, the most terrifying and illegal county sheriff in the world suspects that the documents of being responsible for the brutal murder and abolition of many local girls At the same time, the doctor's wife decided that he refused the river in Egypt and supported him and pulled him to distract. <br /> <br /> The performance is not good - you can tell that the actor is choosing a professional and Trying to bring fruit and life to the role, even those who play as a sheriff. (Okay, it's quite bad. It is just everything related to acting, scenes, costumes, conversations, screenplays and general stories that make you teeth and want to slap everyone involved. br /> <br /> I think this movie has a chance to get to love the tedious and boring little cult. BIT: <br /> <br /> 1) The director must overcome. Michael Pataki, actor who has experienced Until Pataki agreed to act and not just Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> 2) He also wanted to find a slightly more meaningful script about the whole situation. "Bat Bites Human Who then becomes a bat? <br /> <br /> 3) He also needs an actor who plays as a doctor to find a bit of a business on stage that is physically more reliable for his 'episode' episode. replace it Will turn to use the "Man Has A Seizure" page from the Little Golden Book of Clich√©d. Acting manners <br /> <br /> 4) He needs to improve all the characters 'wife' again, making her both less intelligent. And waaaaay more observant. <br /> <br /> I will not watch this movie voluntarily, except with the help of Mike and Bots. It's not good, but it's not bad in a foolish sense of humor or More interesting than "Battlefield Earth" or "Waterworld"
