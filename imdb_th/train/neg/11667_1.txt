This movie is very disappointing in terms of direction, intelligence and management of the subject of drawing. It's a movie that moves slowly like the Wonder Years, without the shocking depth. In addition, failing to send a message in a reliable manner. <br /> <br /> The method of drawing is a very wonderful story, limited to words that are ambiguous and subjective as "beauty" filmmakers. This story says that 'beauty' can be felt in Bob Ross's painting. The Kit-Ross style of fine art based on this film can be done using basic color theory. (Eg elementary level) and many confidence In some parts, movies are being violated, such as at the point specified. (Rather celebrated by dancing on the table) that mentally handicapped people cannot have emotions or show them through their work drawing, defined as 'ridiculous' (quote) <br /> <br /> me Do not understand how this film will get a high rating then again until there are not many people who give ratings and they only choose very high or very low grades
