Reasonable effort is a summary for this film. Good sixties movie But without success, Maggie Smith gave a good performance that was believed to be But not as good as you can get. Other actors are terrifying! Terrible depiction It is not very funny and it is not successful by its type because it is not particularly funny and it is not amazing. The only type that achieves a satisfactory level is love. The target group is not attacked and the movie sends a confused message. The plot is simple and the basic story is not pulled out or performed well and people are confused because the movie is not good and the target group is none. Never mind with a moment of talent <br /> <br /> 4
