Cross-regional efforts to attract those who do not appreciate the opera, take advantage of the reputation of one of the greatest opera singers of all time. Everything that is needed in this movie is opera and anyone can find Pavarotti's record, doing what he does best. The plot revolves around a love affair with a doctor who treats his throat, which soon becomes a problem. <br /> <br /> Just because it's been out for a long time, it's mostly forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a good actor and has a stage performance, in addition to his singing ability, and nothing he does in this film opposes that opinion. His fault lies in not refusing a scary chapter. Probably because the great opera can have a foolish story that he endured. <br /> <br /> Who knows, except those involved? Do we need to know? <br /> <br /> The story is weak and repetitive. This movie is like walking around through the cool mud to pick up a little bit of knowledge (opera music) hanging over the mud. We have other ways to appreciate the great Pavarotti and this is not one of them. Just pick up one of the opera or recordings of his great concerts and get to know the most suitable master age. <br /> <br /> It will be one of the 100 worst IMDb movies if someone Remember more and give some votes; It will fit perfectly in the program, including many attempts by singers, actors, models and athletes to take advantage of popularity through movies. Often everything is very wrong due to incompetent performances or scary scripts. Pavarotti will be a good actor if he doesn't show such a great voice. However, he is effective as an actor. (Opera wanted) even Jimmy Stewart could not save the life of this turkey. <br /> <br /> I am polite 3 in 10 because someone may be a fan of The singing and performances of Pavarotti due to this film
