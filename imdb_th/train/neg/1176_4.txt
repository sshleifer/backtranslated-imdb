The revolution offers opportunities for movies that are always amazing, because in reality, most revolutions are in dramatic events. Unfortunately, what this movie lacks in drama is compensated by excessive boredom. Who cares whether anyone wins, loses, dies or lives - just finish it as soon as possible. This is because of the large measure for what seems to me to use superficial background technology. The scene of Paris and the French countryside is about cardboard quality. They may do better on the empty stage and go out there. No one can expect the amazing results of "The House of the Flying Daggers" or "The Golden Compass", but after all this is a digital production of the year 2002, the characters seem to enter one scene to the point of stopping Count the number of times the character enters and leaves the room. In my view, this film changed the French Revolution in the 1790s to become a "paper" for the world revolution. "Press paper"
