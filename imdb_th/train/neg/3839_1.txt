Some movies are so bad that they are good. Obviously not one of them. This film is based on a true story. This is true, as Pinocchio's chance becomes a real boy. The performance is terrible, bad direction and it travels too fast. It's like the director wants to finish it and go home. <br /> <br /> Melissa and Joan Hart never attack me as a talented actor. But then everything she did was quite low - budget anyway As with most of her other films, she let her characters fall too far, speaking too fast, as if accelerating her words to make her look more dramatic. She shows the feeling that there is a crew in front of her and she is talking to the camera when she should make the audience participate in her character. It makes the movie both beautiful and the remaining legs are destroyed. <br /> <br /> May be the only good thing about this movie is when she was arrested at the end. But still not enough to make me hate bad movies. <br /> <br /> Look, if your taste in the movie is lighter than dry toast.
