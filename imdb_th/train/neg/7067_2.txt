Five passengers at the bus station told a horrifying dream while waiting for a car. But these nightmares are more than can be seen? <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I'm a five-story bad price movie. Each segment has the worst thing in showing special effects, makeup and music. And should these things be scary? Hmm .. I think I'm more strange in the episode of Teletubbies. I swear that you are sitting there, just as I am tired of tears waiting to be worthless. For interesting things to happen, do not bother. It has never been done. And the ending is the best solution Yes, this thing never actually happened. If you say the same, maybe the day I set my VCR to save this stone .. 2/10
