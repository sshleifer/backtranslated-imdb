They say that the deity makes you unsatisfied. I do not know whether Stella James (Sean Young) has qualified as a clinical therapist or not. But she certainly has sexual relations with men She continues to explore trying to find "More information" so that she can see what she wants from life and men in it. Although it seems that in her age she should have a good idea now. (I disagree with anyone who says that Young is too old to play. If you are all of us should be well aged) Most of this movie made me cold. The type you have seen and different from 'Eyes Wide Shut'. At least recently, something happened in this one.
