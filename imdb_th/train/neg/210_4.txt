Maybe you should not compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are traditional Hip Hop. Beat Street has many traditional artists of hip hop trees. But they clearly see that this may be their big break. Of course, for some people it is and good. But if you think that this is a traditional hip hop culture, you are wrong. It's too much and has Hollywood sauce. Looking for the first two movies I talk about They expressed dissatisfaction with life in the slums. Yes, the rating for this film is low. But most comments are positive or delirious Probably because even though the story of dialogue and direction is scary But music and dance are what people like. I i love dancing But at that time thought that electro was the death of hip hop (I'm very happy when the 86th year, the new classic hip hop artist now appears like Krs One, the Ultramagnetic Mc's Jungle Brothers public enemy, Bizmarkie gives a few names) and I still don't like to dance mostly in This movie and that is why it doesn't work for me I mean, Wild style. There are not many stories. But the music there is excellent and genuine Of course, different tastes and okay. But as far as I'm concerned, this movie is trash, except dance, brakes, and some music, and so I can't score more than 4 out of ten.
