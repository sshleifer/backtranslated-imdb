The acronym "F.P.1" stands for "Floating Platform # 1". The film aims to create "F.P.1" in the mid-Atlantic to serve as a "weather station" for transatlantic flights. Created from contemporary novels Curt Siodmark; It was filmed in German as "FP1 antwortet nicht" (1932) in French, "IF1 ne r√©pond plus" (1933) and in English as "FP1" (1933). The more popular non-stop sea <br /> <br /> Conrad Veidt (like Ellissen), Jill Esmond (like Droste) and Leslie Fenton (like Claire) find love for the Atlantic platform. Karl Hartl directed Mr. Veidt. The most to watch; But he does not believe in "love triangle" with Mrs Emmond and Mr. Fenton The young co-star is the spouse of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak, respectively. Both concepts and movies are not good. <br /> <br /> **** FP1 (4/3/33) Karl Hartl ~ Conrad Veidt , Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton
