This movie feels like one of the special activities after school has a lower budget and reduces everything. I guess it should be a movie that inspires some genres. But it didn't work for me, while preachy.it had a faint shade of Flash Dance, but there was nothing exciting in this movie. 80. The bad performance is less than the protagonist, although there are many things that are related to what the actor receives. (Or in this case not) to work with the top, that is, choosing a bad song with really bad lyrics, I feel embarrassed All actors involved, they are all But capable But you can't tell from this movie, that's just my opinion But I have to give Flying AKA Dream to believe 1/10
