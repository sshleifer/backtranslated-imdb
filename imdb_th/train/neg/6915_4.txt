This is one of the movies that I remember being in the cans for many years before anything happened to it. I don't think it's scary. But it is not good as well Alex Baldwin is quite good. But the plot is the most gentle The actors are quite good at what they get. But again you do as good as the script Baldwin directed this story, although I could swear that he didn't direct it all. Although his work on "30 Rock" does not have anything intelligent and should keep him busy for a moment. I just hope that the show will bend out gracefully as la Seinfeld, but maybe not so long for 9 years, so if you want to watch movies you won't get much. But don't hate either. This is for you. I do not remember the last time that the film was wrapped up long before it was released and on DVD only. It was good to see Alex Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins again because they were great. But not many people see "edge". Now accepting that great movie for true entertainment
