Every Christmas I make my children suffer again to show that it's a wonderful life. I am also very happy with Bad Santa. So I sued. I accept it. I like movies that are wonderful. I like people who are smart and smart as well. But like many things, diversity is a good thing. What will the Christmas season be without Santa's annual Ka-ching Ka-ching movie in all his styles from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton Fred Claus won't make anyone forget Bedford Falls? But I do not believe that Christmas movies must be highly successful. "Fred" is a holiday movie perfectly ok with enough humor for adults and enough charm for my children, my wife and I laugh a lot, although most humor. It is clear, and Vince is just Vince. Paul Giamatti is Santa's supreme help. Not very flick and is unlikely to become a must see for everyone's annual Christmas tradition. But my wife and daughter and I enjoy what it's schmaltz holiday with little spices. There's nothing wrong with that thing.
