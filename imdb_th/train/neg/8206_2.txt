With my favorite actor James Spader, I expect this movie to endure at the very least. It's not. After the first half hour, I watched the rest with a remote control in my hand. So repetitive, so one standard knows what will happen in each scene. Who can predict the conversation for words? This is one of the movies that scratched and said "How did this movie be created?" In an attempt to say something positive, I would add that there are special techniques that provide gentle entertainment. But overall, if you've watched 5 sci / fi movies or you're over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this story.
