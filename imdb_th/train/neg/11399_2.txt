I can't believe that I wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this horrible movie. I hope it gets better at the end. But the boy was wrong The story is terrible. The performance is terrible and the special technique is terrible. Not even the two beautiful women can restore my interest in this boring and bloody story. However, I can't lie. Some of the roles in this movie are quite memorable, such as when an Asian boy says, '' I lost purity to the mentor. Do not waste time with this mistake, if you are ready or want to laugh well .. may be the way you can see to tear this movie with some friends.
