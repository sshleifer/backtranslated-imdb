Director Ron Atkins is crazy. This ultra-low budget film records one life of Harry Russo (co-author John Giancaspro), a nut job that received a Rubberneck doll from his bad girlfriend. He began to receive orders from dolls to use a large number of drugs, raping and killing, not in that order. What started out as a exploitative movie like a meatball is still like that. But it turned out very quickly I leaned towards the madman It's hard to forget when you see it. It's quite like Tom Green had done horror movies. <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell is fully nude. Jasmine Putnam shows nipples and bushes. <br /> <br /> Ancient eye candy: See John naked again and again.
