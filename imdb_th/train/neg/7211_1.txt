I grew up watching the monitoring equipment. It is and still is one of my favorite cartoons, if not my favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from the Field Trip Gadget of the spin-off inspectors. I want to slip the banana peel and become the greatest detective of all time. <br /> <br /> But this film has destroyed the reputation of the great cartoon. <br /> <br /> Matthew Broderick, a potential actor Not the role of Inspector Gadget. Of course, the first thing in the movie Inspector Gadget is not that smart in the cartoon. In this film, gadgets solve most of the puzzles on their own. In the cartoon, it's usually a penny-brain and a great book. (I still need your book!) If the gadget solves that mystery, it's a coincidence. The equipment in the movie seems to be a capable detective. But in that cartoon it is rather stupid, which is where humor comes from <br /> <br /> The other thing is that it is "Good Guy v. Bad Guy". In addition, the gadget should not have a love story, but Disney Corporation is full of foolishness. <br /> <br /> I also miss the real gadgets that the gadget has, and especially the gadget cars in this movie. It is an open car. Chic In the cartoon, it is a sedan police car and can be converted into a van. In addition, there are almost no gadgets and most of them are there to take him from one place. <br /> <br /> But if there is one thing that is terrible about the movie, it is a movie. Gadget Inspector documentary is a silly Saturday morning cartoon. This movie is too serious, too large, too many plot, and not funny from a distance. <br /> <br /> Suggestions for those who have not seen: never seen. EVER Watch cartoons. It's classic. True
