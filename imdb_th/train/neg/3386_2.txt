Yes, I was lucky enough to watch the production of Michael Bennett's hit musicals for a long time. It was an amazing experience and I paid to watch the movie when it hit the cinema. Back in 1985, it was terrible, almost everything fell. First, Attenborough (good actor, good director with the right content) is a sad choice - almost as bad as when John Huston was hired to interfere with ANNIE. The camera was wrong. Always - they cut the music and casting !!! They are scary - the power of the drama is these dancers - these talented and starving actors need the opportunity to show what they can do and when they have a chance - you can't. Can take your eyes off them But this actor was just received by dancing acting "good", but no one would spark. In fact, finding actors in IMDb - no one can do anything. (Okay, Janet Jones is married to Gretzky-sheesh). Therefore, the train wreck that is shown in this movie theater cannot be used for magic in one second. All strikes! (But even though they tried to cover up the song - the great songs still occasionally increase and remind people that the score is great)
