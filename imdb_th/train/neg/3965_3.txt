I think I agree that many comments here must be fake. Although this movie is not always bad But certainly below average. "Dark Remains" is a ghost movie with evidence of your own ghost and bad mood haunting you. The movie begins with two layers that connect freely, which even later will not be tied together. The couple lost a child who was found slashed in the bed. They moved to a country house to escape from the past and guess ... What is the haunted house from here in Dark Remains? Started very slowly with some horrible moments. (The appearance of the first ghost is good and the torch sequence works well as well) OK. Then ... The woman sees a ghost, daughter, other ghosts of the accidental death or suicide appear. Men try to solve. The secret of the past house, the woman gets depressed, strange neighbor appears. It is all quite there. But its location is its own mood is good, so you wait for a twist There is no twist. You just get confused with the history of the haunted house. The strange neighbor, the creepy prison, totally pointless and the dead daughter is thrown away with the concept of a photo that reminds me of "shutter". Essentially, because when you start and finish this movie slowly and with piano music, it is quite difficult to incorporate a group of ghosts together. Immediately, which seems to flick the zombies, of course, to return to a slow rhythm. <br /> <br /> Speaking briefly ... Dark Remains can be a scary ghost story if the script doesn't try to go anywhere and arrive there. There are many stories that do not do anything. Feelings and conflicts in the basic atmosphere of the film and the side ... Please do not use the abandoned prison again. It deteriorates and in this case it is not reasonable. "Hey, there's this creepy prison to shoot there." I guess there are many ingredients in the Dark Remains that are thrown in such ingredients.
