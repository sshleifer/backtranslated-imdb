This is a weak sequel: Lack of attention and a soft touch of "Man Called Horse" that is beautiful in almost every aspect, and compared to others, they are hardly like the same genre. The Return is almost a parody of the first person and tries to cause different Indian rituals. But found that it was too hard to make the first magic bottle In this film, the tribe lost and abandoned by losing their homeland. Modern life has encroached into heaven and they live in miserable and poverty. Perhaps this is the point: the first movie takes us to the place where we want it to be an easier time. This makes us break the miserable Indians in the world and white men as heroes and savior who oppose the whole concept of movies. <br /> <br /> The first beauty of the fact that white people Learn and discover that true civilizations are located in values ​​rather than Western materialism. In the second movie, this is all. But lacking and therefore we ended up with a weak movie. <br /> <br /> Very disappointed.
