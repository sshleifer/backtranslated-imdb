I was stunned that the reviewer @ IMDb gave this TV movie a high rating as they did. It is a nonsense, boring and uncomplicated, ancient idea of ​​a movie with two big names coming from the past. (Both work well) but this movie is a low-budget work that we can see every day of the week. Less cable channels I like good romance like everyone. But as my wife and I are watching this - and before we see the ratings - we say "There are people who will rate the film too high just because there is nothing in it. In order to challenge their brain, faith, level of comfort or cultural preference, it is possible to create such a good movie (And away from her as an example) but this is an amateur hour, with some quite good movies More than this movie, actually another story in a holiday movie that is not good enough. See The Family Stone. It's far more than this Scalloc.
