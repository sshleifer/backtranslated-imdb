This film may be very good, but will come short, special effects, magic and so-so performances. I could see through that if the story didn't have lousy. If there is more story behind it, it would be better. The plot focuses on the druid witch linked to this woman who is a migraine. The movie dragged on and never clearly explained anything. Christopher Walken was involved, but it was completely unconscious like most of the movies. This film has potential. But it seems that some things are bad for TV movies I will avoid this movie.
