A few days ago I watched a documentary called FIFTY WORST MOVIES all the time, and this is the point where I first heard about the incredible melting people. As a schlocky movie lover, I made it a point of trying to find some movies from the documentary - not just including the incredible MELTING MAN. In fact, MELTING MAN is the first movie I have seen since then and I have to say that I'm quite disappointed. Although it is a bad movie But it is close enough to be included in this list. <br /> <br /> Now before seeing the documentary, I enjoy "The Bad Movie" Since I read the book "The Worst Films of All Time, Fifty Stories" by Harry Medved, despite having the same title, this book has long been released before feature films and filmmakers won't give credit. Medved with the ideas from the book Medved, I saw about 35 movies from a total of 50 stories, but came to a stalemate - the rest of the film was not available on VHS or DVD. I think I will try to use the same name. <br /> <br /> The reason I am most disappointed with THE MELTING MAN is incredible. There are some good elements in the movie. First of all, the special technique of the guy is generally cool and disgusting. Clearly, the professional (famous Baker) is involved in making this look a reality. However, I should point out that there are more than a few cheap and wonderful effects, such as floating plastic heads and the way the monsters run around after his left arm is cut - you can see. Clever "Under his clothes! For this, it's just stupid. A group of astronauts drastically penetrated Saturn's ring without being crushed. Then they commented on the beauty of the sun that we saw its closeup. This is a strange thing because Saturn is very far from it - should not look this way - it should be a big point. No matter how the scene will change immediately and we say that one of the surviving astronauts is in the hospital. What happened between the final scene and this scene? Yes, everyone guesses. Shortly thereafter, the survivors escaped and joined the feud of murder while his body melted. <br /> <br /> Now, considering that they have a psychotic running Pull all the stops to find and stop him, right ?! Invalid. Mr. Phol made an appointment with the doctor alone to find him !! No army, no police - just an idiot doctor Even after the body begins to overlap, doctors and the general public do nothing to organize meaningful searches or to be backed up. <br /> <br /> Now, due to the stupidity of the movie, you won't be strange. Heart To find the following: <br /> <br /> When my friends are running around the house of the doctor, the doctor will give a powerful anesthesia to his wife and leave her in the house. <br /> <br /> When a lovely old couple is driving late at night, they stop in the orchard to collect fruit and be killed. <br /> <br /> When a woman sees a friend melt, she blocks the door to protect herself. Own This is wise if you don't have a back door next to you! Instead of leaving home and fleeing, she just waits! <br /> <br /> When the photographer and his model are taking snapshots, the guy grabs his assistant and hurls to the top of her. Why? Good to let viewers be excited, cheap and make ratings Kill about half a dozen people. <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, this movie is full of stupid elements. It's a very bad movie, but with occasional special effects, it's not a horror movie as I expected. Of course it is good for laughs. But nowhere near the plan 9 from outer space in the worst and should not be included in everyone's worst movie list
