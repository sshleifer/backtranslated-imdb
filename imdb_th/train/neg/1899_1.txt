I watched this because I thought there would be a lot of car chases and cool cars looking to guess. I was lying. This movie is very boring. <br /> <br /> The film begins at Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi), which sits outside the Porsche dealer to check if they have the correct car. When they confirmed that it was the right thing, Kip took the brick from the trunk and threw it at the window, destroying it. He received a Porsche while his friend received the key. They start the car and take it out at night. They sent to the warehouse only to be tracked by the police. Therefore, all crew members drive all cars and separate Then we will see Memphis Rain. He is giving a few speeches to many children at the go-kart field. Then he confronted with Athit Jackson (Will Patton). Atlee told Memphis that his brother Kip was in a deep state. * Memphis is known as one of the famous car thieves. The most in Los Angeles Memphis headed to the garbage collection yard and met Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclesten). This man threatened to kill Kip if Memphis didn't deliver 50 cars within 72 hours. <br /> <br / > There is a little problem with this movie: <br /> <br /> 1.Story: 48 first time in the movie will happen when Cage and Duvall are looking for the team and plan everything. The last 12 hours in the movie are broken! <br /> <br /> 2 The Cars: You might see that there are 10 cars from 50 in the movie advertised, so where are the 40 other cars? Why don't we see them? <br /> <br /> 3 The Chase: The chase at the end of the movie is a joke. No doubt. <br /> <br /> 4 Dogs: Somewhere in the movie, dogs eat burgers and swallow three keys. It is impossible. The key is turned on. The keys will damage the dog's esophagus, stomach and large intestine. They recommended that the dog laxative to help him poop it This doesn't work. Dogs will have a lot of diarrhea. But without the key, it was stated in Jackass after Ryan Dunne caught his anal toy car Take a lot of diarrhea. But without cars In the same case, the dog <br /> <br /> 5 policemen during the chase: When Eleanor stopped for a moment, Nicolas Cage tried to start the car. You see a police cruiser behind him who doesn't look at his car. But when Nicholas Cage started the engine again, the police jerked to the right, saw the car and started chasing him immediately. It was so stupid when he heard the engine start and saw the car. He knew that it was the car he looked at. find How did he know that it was the right car? He saw only the back. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is boring. No action Very few cars This movie is stupid. I have never seen the original before. But I plan to <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 1 star out of 10 to get Fast and Furious instead.
