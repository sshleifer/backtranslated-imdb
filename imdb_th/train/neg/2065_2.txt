Renting the previous night, opening (2001) Running WAAAAAAAAAY for too long, the waving scene was not intended. Some games were delayed. I know that Chevy Chase has been activated for less than 2 minutes. No problem. This is the best part: <br /> <br /> KOKO, URANUS, commercial BABS, Curtis Mayfield <br /> <br /> All: 7 minutes from good material from the movie 75 minutes. <br /> <br /> Everything isn't stupid or stupid like hell. <br /> <br /> I suggest you: If you want movies, TV and Rude movies for rent "Kentucky Fried Movie" If you want movies, TV and movies that are rough Less than the rent, "AMAZON Man on the Moon" or "UHF" <br /> <br /> That does not worry about renting this movie. You will save 2-3 dollars. <br /> <br /> IMHO: Ken Shapiro's best movie is STILL "Modern Problems"
