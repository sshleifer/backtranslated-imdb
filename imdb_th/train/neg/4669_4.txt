It is interesting that novels without plot have become the basis for two movies, while The Heiress is good, but if not all right, Washington Square adaptation is a heavy and bad movie, except in Sl. Sloper, a movie that seems to be a lot better. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The director's effort to create a 'beautiful' scene is so clear that I feel uncomfortable. It is not as beautiful as simple and simple as a movie without any plot like Onegin. I agree with other comments about the portrayal of Leigh's Catherine as an idiot instead. Naive and shy; She makes me insult, she doesn't feel for you. <br /> <br /> Catherine's change from the innocence that is trusted to be an adult cynic, which is the whole point of the story being made But we didn't benefit from the narrative voice that told us in the movie! I think there are people who cross the level of adaptation at filmschool. <br /> <br /> I am grateful for the director's effort to create a beautiful and moving movie from a difficult message. But it didn't work
