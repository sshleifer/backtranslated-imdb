I went to watch this movie just to see what the ads were all about and I was surprised to be surprised about how it won the Oscar 6 (?) And ranked 7.9 in IMDb today. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Bigelow should be the luckiest director ever to receive an Oscar and the best movie for a terrible movie, and I wonder why. The story of a completely unrealistic 'cowboy' bombing meant to people I didn't see? Why did I get a mental picture that the film was an old western film that was rebuilt about a cowboy who was 'brave' in the Wild Wild West infected with the evil 'Redskins', but this time it was set in the background Is that different this time? Received an Oscar because the director was the former James Cameron and made it an underdog story (Gossip) good for daytime TV programs Or as a symptom of the Emperor's syndrome - most people realize that it is garbage But can't speak because others don't speak aloud. <br /> <br /> And finally, what happened to The sniper scene in which they show that the shell casing is placed in high-resolution - super-slow-mo-as ​​if to convey 'deep text' or something? There is something in the line of 'EOD people, causing a good sniper immediately and they will get dirty terrorists all the time'? Is it just me that feels like there are many fragments here and in movies that are compressed without a clear reason? And you can get an Oscar for editing and directing that movie. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this, don't waste money on tickets. Wait until they turn on the TV in the next few years. You will not miss much
