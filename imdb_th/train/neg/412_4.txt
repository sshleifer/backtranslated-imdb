Within the scope of science fiction, there are two issues that continue to attract attention, starting with the exploration of pre-movie literature, and since then, filmmakers and writers have periodically visited with different levels of success. The first theme of time travel has created a passion for movie fans, as well as the most recently written words on the screen with the classic version of HG Wells 'The Time Machine'. The second theme, which manages people Watching the excitement is the invisibility, which creates imagination with endless possibilities and possibilities. And this theme became the basis for another film adapted from HG Wells' classic 'The Invisible Man'. The perception here is' Hollow Man 'directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Ken (Bacon) and his colleagues have experimented with the United States government for a while to explore the possibilities and practicalities of the invisibility they have experienced. Success in number Of primates that they have tested their methods In fact, they progressed to the point of ensuring that the invisibility is effective. Their only problem now is to bring the story back to its original state. However, it was a problem that Ken, after trying diligently and spending too long in the laboratory, resolved - or so he thought. And when applying his theory to a successful story, he decided to present the findings to the committee in order to maintain the necessary funds for the next project. <br /> <br /> In minutes Finally, although Ken is provoked by the fear that the control of the project will be tested from him before they can go to the next level - human testing And he used it as his own to maintain the help of his research team by telling them that they were approved by the committee to do so But there was something wrong and Ken was stuck in an invisible robe And while he and his team struggled to find a solution to his dilemma before it was too late, everything began to think in Ken's heart And suddenly the fear of losing money and control became unimportant because he found himself facing a greater danger of losing Now, there is a very real chance that he may lose everything - including himself. <br /> <br /> Verhoeven invented something exciting at first. He built a good rhythm and used F / X at his disposal for great results, although he tends to give a distinctive image dominating character development. Anyone who is familiar with 'The Invisible Man', or anyone who can reasonably track the progress of the story, will know early on that Ken has not been destined for happiness. Yet, Verhoeven has a storytelling style that Certainly attract attention and attract his audience But he seemed to rush to the pinnacle and follow the path that he abandoned the difference that made his film successful until choosing to enter the final scene that was nothing more than blood and blood that Unconscious The festival that betrayed his audience and everything he had previously done in the movie Instead of searching for clever solutions to Ken's suffering and using imagination and creativity in bringing this film to an inevitable conclusion, Verhoeven uses a low path and even if it succeeds at the organ level. Within Melting like ash in the wind along with anything that makes this film a memorable movie And it is a shame because Verhoeven has a much higher level than that offered in this category and he permits to sink below the unnecessary one. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon works well. The creation of a character that can be believed if on the surface, which seems to perfectly fulfill the purpose of Verhoeven. Bacon's image has a little depth. But it relates to the director's agenda rather than his acting ability. Verhoeven doesn't allow Bacon to have time to develop Ken at all levels. Most of the characters are the ships that Verhoeven can create for his story and ultimately work. This film will receive better service. However, if Verhoeven and Bacon collaborate more closely, at least develop the relationship between Caine and the audience that will stimulate emotional participation in the audience. Instead of leaving at the door, as had been as a magnificent F / X observer, <br /> <br /> Elisabeth Vessel was a good friend of Linda Mac. Kay Destiny experiment But basically it is a part that does not see the value that is a little challenging, especially with the talented actor Shue Kim Dickens can say the same. (Very beautiful in the 2001 movie "Things Behind the Sun") Sarah Kennedy made her character more than just supporting actions and F / X. Both actors are more capable and deserve more than they can get from work. <br /> <br /> The supporting actors are Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grunberg (Carter), Joey Slotnick. (Frank), Mary Randle (Janice) and William Devane (Dr. Kramer) at one point and succeeding at a certain level (low) `Hollow Man 'is one of the movies that reminds you of what will happen. Like the annual fireworks display, it will give you a moment of excitement. But after a while, it will begin to blend in with the people you have seen, with nothing special to separate them from each other. And it is terrible because of the ability and ability of the people involved here. I rate this thing. 4/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
