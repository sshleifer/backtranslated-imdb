Wow. It's a beautiful story. This is just a few grips - the author of the two main characters from the book - the plot has been changed very gruesome - the voice seems to be raised from the direct writing (Which may read well But not the same when talking, especially the style of Chabon's writing) - the show is made of wood rather than a log (Esp. Bechstein) - this should be set in 1983 ??? Feel like 2003 ... <br /> <br /> For justice, I can't bring myself to watch this movie until the end, so it's possible to redeem myself ... I hope. The more that no one will pay to watch this thing, or at least someone who reads this book to hope for good things (a la Wonder Boys). I like Chabon as a writer. But he should be accepted by this modification. <br /> <br /> No stars.
