I always try to be professional and creative when I criticize movies. But my God !!! This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Bad performances, bad effects, bad scripts, everything is not good! <br /> <br /> Plot according to a group of adolescent boredom on their way to extremism. (Which occurred in broad daylight) at a remote island However, when the group arrived, what they found was an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party-goers. The group set out on a mission through a forest full of zombies. During the Crusades, they were assisted by chick, police and sea captain who had just the right amount of weapons for each child. They met Jonathan Cherry and the other survivors. In general, the rest of the movie is a series of bad action figures that include shooting too long outside. "House of Death", this battle comes with the greatest violence in Hollywood, redundant clips from the HOTD video game and the rotation of the matrix camera. One of the volunteer characters who sacrificed themselves to help others. Why? Not because he was a noble and brave man But since part of the face has acid scars, the zombie spits on him after he continues to defeat the creature for a long time after being disabled! Should I be sorry for this guy !? <br /> <br /> To summarize, there is no point to see this movie unless you want to see for yourself how scary it is. The theater that I live is more dead than zombies on the screen and I'm sure the money I lost when seeing the sh * t parts can cover the cost of creating it easily. Grade: F
