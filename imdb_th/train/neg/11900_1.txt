So wonderful Another movie about America, where people who have been here may be half a dozen times a day and believe themselves to be "Expert" in Sheesh country. Should I travel to Germany for a week, then come back to make a movie about Germany called "Nazi land" or something of a boy Wim IL. You should join Lars von Trier and create a ULTIMATE movie With Americans Of course, we all know that it requires the use of bias toward the left. "We are the world" of Europe in creating "real" movies about America. <br /> <br /> Yes, for a continent that doesn't start. Only World War II, Europe, sure that there are many opinions about America's "foreign policy" is wrong. <br /> <br /> P.S. Don't worry. Wim IL kids have many UC-Berkeley Americans who will love your movie. Of course, these people are the same people who think that George W. Bush is the worst person in Hitler and the drawing of canned soup is "True genius" !!
