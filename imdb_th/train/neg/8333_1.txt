This is the worst movie I've ever seen all my life. The performance is not good and the story is almost difficult to understand. Whether you like lightships or any ships for that matter For special effects, this movie has no All movie crews may be on a boat in the rough sea than in the studio and when some men are "stabbed" (if you can call it) their reactions are not true The gun is quieter than the mute. This film will have a prize of two awards, bringing serious questions to the human mind. It's about it This review is probably more enjoyable to read than this movie is to watch. If anyone is considering watching or buying it, I will advise you seriously for obvious reasons. I said that it has spoilers as well. If the fact that some people are stabbed and shot by a gun is a free gift I think it is because they are just a good part of this movie.
