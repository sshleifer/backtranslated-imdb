There are some elements that help this movie not to be completely disastrous. But was overshadowed by poor performances, pit plot, deus ex machina that were hurled in, interactive, silly dialogs, weak scripts and predictable clichés What we have here is a horror movie with a story that is nowhere all the time. A group of heroes that are unlikely to include blacks first (Yes, the cliché seems to be alive, even in Finland). It seems that there is a problem trying to leave the hospital in a mysterious way. There are ghosts, screaming (very imaginative), zombies. At least they didn't use zombies. But they came), and the Finnish rock band with demons make their way There is also a time-changing doodles presentation. But there is nothing more in the story Children with autism and hobo seem to have a deeper understanding of the situation. But they never spelled the audience or friends confused Their chapters consist of only profound life lessons such as: "What will happen ..." or "Light cannot be in darkness ..." or is a bad omen. "I want a red pencil ... red pencil" so all these characters (Including the worrisome father and the sweetest doctor in the suffering category) ended up running around them in the dark and from or against the devil Occasionally, there are ghosts or groups of zombies appearing, and if it seems that the keyboard demon can't see the six people who come to find it, waving the torch and chatting, it just pretends. And apparently this demon can penetrate the wall without much difficulty But opening the elevator door is beyond its ability. <br /> <br /> Finally we get "It's a dream" or maybe not Oh, I want this movie to be like that, and like that, making the time seem to move faster, so it shows up in just 10 minutes or more ...
