Priyadarshan's HERA PHERI movie is a good comedy, but it actually lacks stories. But quite funny but without reason. <br /> <br /> In fact, they are not appropriate. <br /> <br /> The first half has 2 funny scenes, like the scene in which Akshay and John invite Neha to have lunch and another scene when Paresh enters. <br /> < br /> The first half started to slow down But in the second half More fun, even if they don't have a script. <br /> <br /> Funny stories are funny. But wondering if they had never heard of each other's voices in the room? <br /> <br /> Climax's confusion is like a musical, but it's quite funny. But the movie ends suddenly <br /> <br /> John stumbles throughout and fails in the comedy Paresh Rawal. It's hilarious. Rajpal is ok. The girls ar sometimes loud and awkward as well. And Neetu (now only Neetu is seen), good, but screaming too often Manoj Joshi is ok
