This short film begins with a teenager trying to get a driver's license. It turned out to be a deviation quickly with every imaginable topic about cars. <br /> <br /> Things like cars, buggies, drag racing, custom paint work It always tries to be amused. But instead of a boring movie pulled out and even women sometimes No one can hear people in the movie. But everything is done in the narration and the voice. Sorry, but I can't. <br /> <br /> No education or interesting about "Father, can I borrow a car?" It's just another illogical fulfillment that takes time on their "Wonderful World Of Disney" program. 1/10
