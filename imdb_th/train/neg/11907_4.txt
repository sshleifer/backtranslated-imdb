I understand that the character Diehl was appointed as a comma of America - seeing the Arab terrorists under every stone only to discover at the end that it was always his own actions that led him into a siege state. Good practice for all men, everything is rainbow and lollipop. Sorry that you used to create an amazing movie in a political, historical, and good reason. The argument is your weakness, and they make this movie well filmed with ridiculous characters, conversations and planning. Good luck in your next round. Another thing that hurled my crank was the point that the homeless people in LA showed the cause of hunger. These people were not enough to eat. Indeed, these people do not eat food happily. But true hunger, these people are spiritual hunger, emotional hunger, mental hunger. They need self-respect, worth, dignity, which you can't give to men. Yes, those people are hungry and if they want it, they have it. If being the center of hunger in America, I want to say that it is the center of alcoholism, drug use, mental torture and economic destruction. Dealing with hunger, even though the noble effort will help the band to systematically human society and the human system is not as powerful as the system.
