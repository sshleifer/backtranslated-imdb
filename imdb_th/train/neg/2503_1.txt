It is a bad excuse for creating a new Zealnd movie. I am ashamed to call myself a New Zealander when this film exists and is playing on New Zealand's satellite TV (August 2006). The characters consist of local soap stars. lots of The real life boat is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and also the company logo (dolphins) still throughout the series, including on the ship's channel. The boat should be a cruise ship / ferry between the United States and Mexico. It has signs of rust and age that are clear throughout the place. But should be a luxury boat on its first trip One of the scenes showing the snow-capped peaks of New Zealand's southern island in the background for God's sake! Must be a very cold time in the US / Mexico area! Weak stories, weaker performances and New Zealand / American accents do not work. I expect the New Zealand tax payer to contribute to the cost of producing this film and that is a better waste of money in actual production. I know high school children in New Zealand who can make better movies with their mobile phones. Fools: There is a truck attached to them and they tag the Taco Company at the truck door. American But some markers are above tagging - do you think they will notice that in the props department before sticking to it? I like to continue But it is not worth the trouble in any way
