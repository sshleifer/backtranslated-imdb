Me and my girlfriend went to watch this movie as "Surprise Surprise", that is, we bought tickets to watch movie trailers before opening here in Denmark. We sat through 1 hour or so. Then we went out! The issue of the movie seems to be just a demonstration of the era (and the club 54), but it happens when there is no development of the character and the plot is low. <br /> <br /> I <br /> <br /> The song is good, so if you want to listen to good music and edit the mood for 70 years, I think it's ok. But don't expect to receive a reliable character. <br /> <br />
