This is the good news before. "Soul" is the most amazing animated movie on the current home theater. The artwork and effects have a new revolution and I suggest you watch this movie with just one picture. <br /> <br /> And now for the bad news. I really mean it when I say animation is the only thing this movie does for it. You may remember that "souls" were severely affected by "Lilo and Stitch" last summer. The first person who argued that because Disney had a better reputation and had better ads, could write a four-page essay titled "Why is the script 'Lilo and Stitch' not stinking?" Amazing new features on the display in the "Spirit" story is almost unbelievable. There are lessons here and (No need to speak) Not only used with animated movies. You can have the most incredible visual effects to impress the human eye. But if your story is boring and more important, we don't care about your character. As simple as Animation is still amazing. I can't wait to see who has more imagination to do with it.
