- The movie opens with the meteorite crashed into the lake. Unknown to local people, dinosaur eggs are on the bottom of the lake. The hot meteorite in the lake made it into a giant incubator. You guess, the hatching eggs release the dinosaurs that make money for the terrorist community. <br /> <br /> - What is rubbish? Not that I'm interested in stagnant dinosaurs. The performance is bad. The conversation is the most ridiculous. Comic Relief is nothing but cartoons. That logic does not exist. Similarities between "Scientists" in this movie and the real scientists are actually coincidental. I can go for eternity in the bad aspects of this movie. But you get the idea I feel it is quite safe to call this disaster "MST3K worthy"
