In summary, it is overlong and filled with subplots rather than Swiss cheese with holes! The director and co-author said that he wanted to blend the genre - in this drama and comedy. At least these two people mix vinegar and oil. In a funny movie boot, not a joke and a kid In addition, the movie is not realistic. Freedom has been used about the legal system to allow French citizens to resist their will and ease of evading drugs in French hospitals. I watched this movie on a big screen TV at home and found myself shouting in front of the movie. Finally, I quickly passed on the long last words, one of the main characters that made the son of his former lover. At that time, I was tired of the unusual confusion plans associated with dead lovers, marriage for comfort, and crazy old lovers. At times, the plot is transferred to the family of two main characters and turns back to one of them - either Ismael or Nora. To the detriment of the audience, the perspective that changed from Nora and Ismael, her former lover, was limited to his intentions in a psychiatric hospital. There may be two interesting movies here that are not well developed. The epilogue does not summarize many minor issues and seems to require viewers to believe that Nora will find happiness even though her real-life situation is likely to equal the chance of a snow ball in hell. The actors do their best and attract attention. But it is not enough to overcome all the obvious shortcomings of poorly edited writing and lack of concentration
