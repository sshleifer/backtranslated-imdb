When my children asked me to leave the film's debut, I knew it wasn't good. I want to withdraw my eyes. I want to reach the screen and slap Mike Myers for a sacrifice, tear the dignity the last time he has. This is one of the few things in life that I have watched and would like to "release" immediately if possible. Other films called 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both of which are better than the crying in the hat Good defamation in Seuss. <br /> <br /> For Mike Myers, I speak to Austin or even revive Wayne World. Just because it works with Jim Carrey doesn't mean that Seuss is successful for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
