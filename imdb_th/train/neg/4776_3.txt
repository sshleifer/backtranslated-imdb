I had to write a review of the film after reading the comment again, saying that this is Sidney's best movie. Poitier Poitier has just returned from a decade of acting in the movie, and he's clearly creaking here. 11 His stories are mentioned in Wikipedia and they do not include this. His 5 films are on the list of 100 popular films of AFI. This does not include the Berenger and Poitier, rube and city slicker out to hunt for a dangerous psychopath before he crossed the border to Canada. Some of the efforts of the comedy in this film clearly failed, and Burger and Poitier's bondage was great and awkward. Kirstie Alley (as hostage) was low and almost ignored. When she was on the screen Trying to suspect something happened. For example, when you intend to guess that five men in a fishing trip are murderers. (All of them are handsome villains) I understand that this is what attracts most fans out there. I can guess who it is and I didn't try hard. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Berenger, see Sniper (1993). You will still see Billy Zane. It's much better. Everything in everything. I want Shoot to Kill 3/10. It's not daring and it's too straightforward for me.
