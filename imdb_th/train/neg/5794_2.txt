All Germans stand out in the open and cut by machine guns. Good people never die unless it has an amazing purpose. "Plot" There are many ridiculous holes. (Where did the German soldiers go when they rolled the tank to the train? Erik Estrada please!) And all ideas by train robbery? Is a moronic way! The Germans know where you are going. It's not like you can leave the route and drive away! I want to shake my head with a hammer, hammer 10 times, then have to sit again. I mean seriously. It felt like it was created in the 60s, but it was produced in 88 !! 1988 !! A-Team can believe more than a terrible excuse for the movie Watch it only if you want a good laugh. This film is for Tele Sevalas, what Green Beret had for John Wayne.
