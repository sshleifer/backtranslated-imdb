Let me say that I am always a big fan of Steven Siegel and his movies are always excellent. But this is not the remaining measure In my opinion, this is very stupid. I don't like it all. The best reason I didn't like it was because it was very flawed and for me it was not reasonable. The performance was terrible. Even Steven Seagal did not do a good job. Other actors I could see because they were directed to the movie video. It doesn't follow the exact story, everything happens at the same time, so why isn't it reasonable? She almost didn't do anything, and in order to create a good action movie, you often have to act. The special technique is terrible and you can tell that it's fake. So all this must have the worst movie of all, so if you want to watch Steven Siegel's movie, don't rent this one, just pretend that it doesn't really exist So avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ** from ********** <br /> <br /> * from *****
