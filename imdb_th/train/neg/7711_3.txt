The heart of this film is in the correct position, no matter where the brain is located. <br /> <br /> "Attack" is generally tricked. "The plane!" (Two years before the truth - went well) of what happened when the vegetable or in this case is the fruit. Attack <br /> <br /> Through all kinds of magical movies. (Stop the movement of tomatoes, papier-mache on a skateboard, filming back movies, people watching tomatoes outside the screen, throwing tomatoes, basketball size at the actors on the screen) Tomatoes will attack everyone in their hands. They <br /> <br /> then depend on Mason Dixon (Miller) and the group of scouts I don't want the government to help. Of course, there was a reporter (Taylor) who appeared at the worst time, dancing and singing soldiers, Japanese scientists, with voice overs, some men donkeys, parachutes and samurai swords ... and oh yes, San Diego. Chicken Before he makes it big, <br /> <br /> The porch is not that great. In fact, you may make it better for yourself after watching these things. Some conversations are terrible. ("Please send ketchup" - not something to say in the presence of tomatoes) and as long as "Puberty Love" continues ... Okay, I can't blame the tomatoes because they wither. Hear it. <br /> <br /> There. What's good about it I like the theme music and the initial credits and there is one scene where there are four people on the phone at the same time being executed ... About it <br /> <br /> The three stars are not comedy "killer" but it Then tried <br /> <br /> top rock, peace
