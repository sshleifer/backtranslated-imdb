I have also heard read reviews and comments about the way this movie should have won the Academy Award for Best Film, so I went to watch today. It's a big disappointment! 1) If you read other reviews, you will learn from members of the US military who have served in Iraq, how difficult the events in this movie are. They reflect my own thoughts. While this film plays me - complete civilians - always think to myself that "Say anything, there is no way to happen like that .." 2) There is very little that actually happens in terms of planning. New bombs appeared to replace those killed. (Unexplained death) The new person receives excitement from his work. His attitude puts others at risk. That's it! 3) This movie is nowhere near to be suspected. If you want to wonder, try one Bourne movie if you want to watch an emotional war movie. Rent Go Tell The Spartans, which is about the Vietnam War and the Burt Lancaster star (who told me personally to find a supermarket. Coincidentally) is a movie that he is very proud of And one that he viewed as his best work and that he still upset has been largely ignored in the Apocalypse's revelation now) or the old classic World War II monochrome Sink The Bismark which in particular Especially for British movies are extremely incredible. Don't waste your time with Hurt Locker.
