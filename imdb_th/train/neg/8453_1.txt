This movie is a mish-mish mash of clich√©s from the latest movie. There are some interesting ideas in it. But while the director clearly pointed out that he would end up with an ambiguous movie like haunting what he ended up in confusion, the leading actor, Daniel Wu, worked fairly. But without the central theme, it seems that he doesn't have much work In addition, most movies are without fear. (Although in fairness there is a creepy moment in the midst of boredom) <br /> <br /> * MILD spoiler * <br /> <br /> We have a mysterious death. The pair of estranged librarians ruthlessly interesting love, confusion, identity, death by savage monkeys, Edipal conflict, inappropriate stepfather, homosexual men and crime gangs The only truth that these elements have in common seems to cause the protagonist to feel confused and displeased. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most frustrating thing for this film is that despite death Of the brother by being a monkey featured on the DVD cover But their actions were not directly demonstrated Director Julian Lee uses what appears to be a stock of monkeys - not scary. <br /> <br /> * Last spoiler * <br /> <br /> Avoid this one. For the horrific psychological horror film that is not clear, check out the Korean movie A Tale of Two Sisters (2003)
