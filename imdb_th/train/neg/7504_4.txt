I am afraid that I must disagree with most people. I found Spike Lee's latest boring little spike! Although he tried to do different things, such as not just recording the rise and fall of serial killers But I do not think it will work too well That is the local mafia type The story is good. But in the end, what you have - 2 or 3 stories with such an exciting killer, Lee may not have put in that side of the movie again?> <br /> <br /> There are some good points. Every scene with the killer 'Son of Sam' David Berkowitz looks very good (saturation, color, etc ...) and the performance is quite good. <br /> <br /> Overall, I feel that the stories are Good results by yourself or others without killing It's not strong enough at the end. <br /> <br />
