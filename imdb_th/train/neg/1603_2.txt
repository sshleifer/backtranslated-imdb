If not for the performances of Barry Diamond and Art Evans as an outcast, I would have no reason to introduce this to everyone. <br /> <br /> This plot center is reunited. 10 years at high school Occurred in a neglected high school (Seems to be like a pole from a low budget horror flick in 1950) and a crazy student in the class draws a shocking prank This student wishes to kill the whole class for revenge. <br /> <br /> John Hughes falls in love with his character too, as only one student is killed, just like a woman. Lunch. (Goonies' Anne Ramsey) We lead to believe that he was killed. But never saw anything damaged! This movie is a scary movie that continues to spin down throughout the 80s and 90s.
