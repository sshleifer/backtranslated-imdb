This movie is the worst story I've ever seen. Indeed, I had a sharp headache while watching this movie. CGI was so bad and the story wasted ink. Dean Cain's character is Mr-Super-Intuitive-I-can-figure-out-nothing. Except that he seems to be unable to use his own helicopter correctly The biggest problem is the split screen camera. I feel that I'm watching Brady Bunch or something. It doesn't have different people in the box, just close-ups and different views of the same thing. I can imagine that the actors want money because this movie is not worth the movie that was filmed.
