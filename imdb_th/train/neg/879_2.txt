Selecting an actor to choose: David Jansen, 38, plays the father of Robert Drephas, who was 31 years old. (Yes, I know he should leave college. But the clues in the script make him lazy and he may be 24 -25 in the script --- which still allows Jannsen to be in a junior high school class.) I think AMA wrote medical miracles in 1938 in This movie is still not good, and now it's the main attraction, just seeing the image of Sin City around 1969 and smoking continuously. Strange hair (Drivas has an atomic comb that makes him look the same - groomed hip Cousin It and trendy fashion that fits well with it If someone remembers that LV is not London, of course ... this city condemns the crowds and gamblers in those days.

(In sorrowful sorrow, the driver died of AIDS at the age of 47 years) and the conflict in the soap was caused by the gap between generations.

Is a scary thing and has a stupid story. In the 60s, a new era that faded from the map within a couple of years) Don Rickles was on the board as a blackjack dealer ... It seems that he is ready to play as a ground manager in Casinos that are much better in the next two decades Do not give anything But they have to deal with Mr. Rickles' character with power tools and holes in the desert at that time. The best curiosity is far from the usual ability of Joshua Logan Dos / Dias. Now go see the casino again ...
