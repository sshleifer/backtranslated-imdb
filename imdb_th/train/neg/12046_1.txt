I have high hopes for Troy and I am bitterly disappointed. This film is very poorly directed, it makes me upset. The conversation is ridiculous and the movie - apart from the good fight scenes between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest is shallow Fit Agamemnon's 'consumer approval' did not die in the war. The war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris outside the Troy wall with arrows pointing to the ankle! It bothered me that this classic story became soap. <br /> <br /> And don't even start me in the 'absence' of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She is a woman who is fighting war and it doesn't look like both people are very caring. No sparks, no emotions, no hope. <br /> <br /> I have to say that in the movie, Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O 'Toole performed very well with bad scripts. This scary movie <br /> <br /> Who can tell me where the 200 million pound budget goes? May be in every tree that they use for funerals - where do they get those trees? <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed that it hurts.
