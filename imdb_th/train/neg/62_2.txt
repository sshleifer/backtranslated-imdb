swing! Is a film that is important because it is one of the movies produced and performed since 1930. Many of these films deteriorate so hard that they cannot be overcome. But this movie is quite good It is also a good opportunity to see many talented black actors in the time after the wealth of the old cotton club - all the time but forget today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, While this film has historical significance And having a lovely show, it is a mess The main story is similar to the Hollywood musical of the era, including Prima Madonna, who will destroy the show and surprise surprise without appearing from where to save the day. However, writing is just a god that is a little scary and sometimes ridiculous - and shoots images of Black America that some people may find that there is a slight decline. This is because before the plot goes, you will be treated with no account that lives with his hard-working wife. (Is a popular stereotype) and when he is caught being an idiot this role) they have a fight that looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And a woman wants to cut another woman with a straight razor - definitely worthless! Later in the movie when Pre Madonna behaved ugly, her husband punched her face and everyone applauded him! It seems that movies sometimes want to attract the lowest participants in the audience, and they can't do well - with the worst performances I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br / > Still, if you can see the punch production in every area (with worthless characters, bad performances and directions and bad writing), this might be worth looking at, so you can sing and dance. Tap The good - including the culture of blacks who have been forgotten. Don't say I didn't warn you about acting - it's really bad!
