I have seen this movie at the theater many years ago and there is one thing that surprised me so badly that I could not see any merit in redemption. His two trademarks Danny Glover plays the bad guy, but - again - the imagination of most viewers can't go far enough to believe him in that role. In addition, Jared Leto did not believe as a former medical student. The tension was not there because the murderer knew very quickly. The ending is no longer exciting and tense, no one around me cares about what will happen next. All we can wait is the ending of the movie. In conclusion, unfortunately, it takes time in the cinema.
