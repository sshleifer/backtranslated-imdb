Every year I watch hundreds of movies, including nasty stories straight from many low-budget DVDs that don't have the right heart to see. I have seen thousands of movies during my time. Very wonderful and memorable. Zombie Nation I will remember forever as one of the most terrifying horror movies I've ever seen? In fact, I haven't recovered from the experience of watching it. <br /> <br /> The next day looks like a strange dream. Can I see what I really think? Why does the police work outside the warehouse? Voodoo priests really suggest that 'zombies' eat cheeseburgers? Safe? Safe? Safe. <br /> <br /> I won't recommend Zombie Nation if you want to watch the movie 'good' and I don't recommend it bad. However, if you are entertained by the expectation of watching, it is probably the most nasty movie that can not be denied? This is for you. Now, whenever someone asks me if the worst movie I have ever seen, I will say Zombie Nation <br /> <br /> Seriously ?? I think it is a much bigger crime than making a movie that is more boring than a bad movie and Ulli Lommel deserves the credit to make a movie that stuns you with incompetence He was a junior era in the digital age, and I couldn't help but see if he had created another movie that was ridiculous.
