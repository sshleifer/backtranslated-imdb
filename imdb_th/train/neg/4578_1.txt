Another cult again This is not a spoiler due to the fact that it happened after you researched a group of people who brought infomercial to science for a long time ... Ramtha Enlightenment School <br /> <br /> When religion / philosophy needs To hide behind the deceptive screen of OZ, I walked away. Thank you Ramtha. I watched a copy of this movie that was borrowed on the advice of "friends" ... in order to lose precious resources in this modern lobotomizer. Will be sad I just hope they "Truly believe that they can walk on water" enough to lead that direction to a "reasonable" conclusion ... In other words; Walk drowning ... or shut up :-) As a movie ... deserve a strong "1" value in entertainment, especially for creating the most nasty characters in film history. (Photographer's roommate ... eeeeeek!). If you have to watch this movie, borrow from a brainwashed person who introduced this movie.
