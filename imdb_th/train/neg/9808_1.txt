The worst performance I have ever seen A story about a group of teenagers who have some reason to have magical powers and when they use special equipment, they turn into strange sets that are poorly designed. The performance when they were not in a slow-looking suit was appropriate, of course not, but not the worst performance I have ever seen. However, when wearing a suit, the actors' performances are not as good. More than that A very lively idiot with many unnecessary movements. Even when they say they seem to have seizures The villain is more stupid than the Rangers. Every time, some weak and stupid villains plan to destroy the Rangers. Then, he / she sends the alien hyperion to attack the Rangers. Then the Rangers started the animation change for 10 hours. Then they destroyed the aliens. Then, a badly designed villain, who may be a villain, looks and acts evil against a ladybug-like creature that is shaped like a ladybug with a trumpet attached to the back. The villain becomes Godzilla, whether it's a rain cloud or a nuclear missile. (Yes, they shoot nuclear creatures and creatures become giants.) Power Rangers takes 5 minutes to perform a hyper animation and call their Zords, which are toys that the program makers use special techniques for. Make them look realistic Power Rangers win, the villains are angry at them all, teach "valuable" lessons and the performance ends. That's it. Twenty-five minutes of brainwashing, fighting with fake kung fu.
