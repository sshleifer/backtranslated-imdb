I have never seen this movie before. But can tell you one story about production While DJ jokes / oldies in 1988, I received a phone call from the manufacturer. They asked me if I could write and record a little, whether or not they would put in the soundtrack as the vocal sound. From TV (The TV screen doesn't appear.) I said that I wrote a parody of the 50s Sci-monster clich√©s rounding the sound effects and calling other DJs. Pam Landry came to play the female role while she was broadcasting Compose long songs, join me at the mic in the production room, and we cut the sound in one shot. Giggling. Then she returned to her performance while I mixed in the stupid sound effects. We never did if we knew that "Woodchipper Massacre" would be a turkey - but then again we Never get paid for our efforts as well! - Gary Theroux
