This is not art. But is the correct propaganda in the city and politics! Jinda's political tolerance was too far to forgive ... It was not seen as a person. But being a member of the category <br /> <br /> This is the most nasty Australian movie I have ever remembered. With a rather stiff competition!) This film has a weary topic that is the passion of the observer. There is a trend: Aboriginal people are victims; White people are violent or addicted to alcohol. White women are not that bad, especially if they are lesbians - but they tend to be depressed. <br /> <br /> Four men who go fishing for the body of a girl Killed (Aboriginal people naturally) and left her in the river for several days while they caught trout. It was a strange decision that was almost without controversy as a male animal. A man who briefly briefly is Good ... We know this because he lives with a bisexual woman - he likes to hold his child a lot - and eventually moves to a location with values. <br /> <br /> This is a movie created by modern city people living in awe of the Australian landscape and the evil-minded redneck who lives inside. It is an ignorance about the shocking rural life like insulting. This film was filmed with a remote view of the bush that was supported by mysterious music. It was very clear at the end that Aboriginal people were the only ones in this landscape. It concluded with an unbelievable bleak scene of black-white reconciliation. <br /> <br /> In Jindabyne, life in rural areas dropped to a slightly lesser backdrop for stories that implied the announcement Beyond the value of the leftist, enlightened Other residents of Australia <br /> <br /> This film is not caused by people who have real work. But received a grant from the Film Finance Corporation of the government (Which is separated from the real life as possible) as opposed to creating popular movies It doesn't matter if this movie is a foul smell, they still get money. <br /> <br /> Give yourself time to waste time. Social criticism is more boring than actual entertainment. This film deserves to be promoted!
