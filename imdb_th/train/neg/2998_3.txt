For dead Judy Garland fans, there are two (2) numbers that are really good - one that she made numbers with older cleaning women. (You've seen the picture) and good numbers at the end. There are a couple of scenes in the comedic scene. But in general, the script is terrible and the movie is outdated so hard to cringe horribly. But it's worth 2.50 for renting a movie - just prepare to fast forward
