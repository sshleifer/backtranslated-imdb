The cover of the box makes this movie look really good. Don't be fooled. The University splashed out in 1984, which is a good year for horror. But this movie is terrible The characters are very annoying. There are only cool teachers. There is no plot for this movie. Who will create this movie? <br /> <br /> Those who break up ahead <br /> > Master died on this issue and it was Females We all know that we have to have female survivors if you violate the rules. Do it like horror.
