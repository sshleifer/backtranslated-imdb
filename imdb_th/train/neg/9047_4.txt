This movie impressed me forever. I watched it for the first time in high school and stayed home alone that night. I think I lost respect to Robert Reed as an actor who is a big fan of "Brady Bunch". I think the role of Chuck Connor is scary and evil. However, this film has affected me so much that I am now a volunteer in the women's state prison, studying scripture and serving churches and trying to change women's lives each time. What makes me fascinated is that few people actually watch this movie. My friends didn't look and my family was unkind to this day when I talked about this movie because they didn't see it.
