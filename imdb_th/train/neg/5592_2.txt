It's hard to explain this movie and we want to try hard not to stop it too early because you have the feeling that this may be the perfect movie for a 12 year old girl ... <br /> <br /> This movie has a good concept - a modern version of Sleeping Beauty with a twist. It has a rather dreamy shot and a good sketch of a young boy's relationship with a single working mother and his roommate ... a good start you might say. But then it was a little greedy, very greedy. Trying to be a science fiction, drama, thriller, possible romantic love story, fairy tale, funny and everything under the sun. The result came to make the audience feel quite inadequate. For example, when the girl (played by Risa Goto) wakes up with a kiss (Yuki Kohara), instead of being a romantic person, it's scary to make us laugh after that ... It's a cheap trick. Because it destroys all the expectations and emotions that it tries to create in order to get half of the better movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't read the original story that this movie is based on. (A well-known work By the artist Osamu Tezuka's comic book is famous for his interesting and intricate stories) I wonder if all the problems exist in the original story or in the adaptation? It is quite irrational, even for people familiar with "Picky logic" of those Japanese comic books For example, how the character of Yuki Kohara managed to reach the hospital immediately. (When he had to take a bus for a long time) to escape Risa Goto's character in front of the television camera immediately after he saw her live interview <br /> <br /> There are also some scenes that are copied directly. (Not very creative!) From other movies and they all seem to be ridiculous, nonsense, like the scene "The famous lion's mouth makes my hand" scenes from "the" Roman Holiday "<br /> <br /> The movie tries to be everything. But ended with nothing ... it failed to be a fairy tale and it There is no joke enough to be a comedian ... and there are some scenes that seem to be a "ghost" movie unintentionally. However, we should give credit for dealing with the feelings of some Japanese teenagers. <br /> <br /> It is watching this movie, I have a feeling that there may be some movies that should have a warning label that "This movie may be suitable for people under the age of 18" It should be in the poster of this movie. <br /> <br />
