The evidence of this awaited sequel is very good and after the great success of the new remake, I sincerely hope <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this film is ridiculous and really useless. The situation is stupid and overreacting and the performance is really bad. <br /> <br /> This time there is no satisfactory character or violin that is different from the remake. In addition, the blood is not much, and when it happens, it is really bad. <br /> <br /> The violence is very little and is embarrassing because there are many arguments that make you think there is space for severe I mean, there is a SWAT team that is hunting down mutant species of human beings. You certainly expect something different! When I watched in a movie, I needed a refund. <br /> <br /> However, this is a clear example that the movie that came out in a hurry became messy and of poor quality in all aspects. Messy that makes the fans of the remake come back like me That is the reason that he never welcomed the sequel. At least this movie was not as bad as the sequel of 1985.
