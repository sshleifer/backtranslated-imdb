After reading other comments on this movie, I would like to share my own view that this is a movie that is very difficult to watch unless you are a total of me, not me. <br /> < br /> When viewed by real-world observers, this film is an unbalanced narrative that gives us the unconscious nerve rather than being absorbed in a single ride. Looks quite difficult Brooks character (Robert Cole) is not sympathetic and unpleasant, which is difficult to relate to him --- allowing him to take root as he stumbles from a situation that is obsessed with himself to another situation. And he should not make the scene naked and expected to be serious in a romantic context No one can have a leaf that can touch a lot and should turn to a baby like Kathryn Harold ---- except that he is Albert Brooke. Albert Brooke <br /> <br /> "Modern Romance" has a funny time ----- but they are broken and infrequent. More often than I felt as though I was traveling in limited places with people who didn't thoroughly like it and hopefully it will end. It confirms the problem that can be developed when there is too much control of the film in one person. Those who lack self-discipline will be able to get away from it and see what is happening clearly. <br /> <Most people know James L Brooks, who plays the director in this film, is the real thing he shows. Six years later, he played the role of Albert Brooks in the "Broadcast News" that was very successful. James shows us how Albert can create a reliable and fun cartoon show. Albert allowed us to see James. (Generally not acting as an actor) make surprisingly rare comics in a powerful way. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Modern Romance" by now have moved to comments Continue to praise About it. For you, I said ----- There is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a movie that is intended to be entertaining.
