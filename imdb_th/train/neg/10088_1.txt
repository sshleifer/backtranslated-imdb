I'm an actor, producer, director, and what I'm saying is facts. This project is the worst movie in film making history. From the producer to the director and editing of the movie called a joke, and I mean the great joke. Why is Blockbuster released shit? I worked very hard and this film insulted my career. Does the director try to create a bad movie? I do not think so I've seen bad zombie movies But it takes coffee cake and everything on the table. This film picked up !!! I hate to talk badly about other filmmakers because I am one. But please consider different occupations I respect the fact that you finished the movie. But I have to ask you "You smoke that wrong" I mean make-up to your women. Scary zombies. For the whole nation, if I can vote for Zero, I will get The worst movie in movie making history !!!
