This film has been ranked classic from the confidence that is not the quality of filmmaking. It turns out that it is not possible for unbelievable things to be unrealistic to horror. <br /> <br /> An unbelievable plot revolves around two British soldiers. And the Hindu gofer to help the third soldier in India in the background. We saw a full army of drums and clarinet walking into the ambush In the British army, the sergeant soldier did not command the rescue and if you passed away, he would not try with other soldiers and only one Indian soldier when he had a full infantryman. The Indian insurgents are unbelievably incompetent. It's ridiculous ... There are hundreds of people, but they are unable to capture the prisoners or kill two rescuers. At one point, we saw a British soldier throwing stones from a fight that the insurgents scattered around the mountains in an ambush ... Who would have an eggplant for the brain to think that this could damage? After Carrie Grant, as a prisoner, was shot, he lay on the floor, looking around the water boy ... hardly anyone's actions were shot in the back. The boy blew the trumpeter bravely. (Which comes from nowhere) to sound a warning ... this thing he did by standing up on the wall so he could see and shoot by the bad guys and we shed tears as he had kept Tried to send more sounds while he was repeatedly shot and the horn sounded to break ... instead of blowing the trumpet while hiding behind the cover like anyone with half the brain doing This scene deserves a parody in a funny sketch. If they want to make a comedy Buster Keaton, they should hire Keaton and do better.
