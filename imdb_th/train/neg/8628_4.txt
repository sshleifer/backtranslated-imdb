My 7 year old daughter likes it a lot because Disney thinks that she will do it very hard. That is the problem of "Air Buddies". It's a children's movie, especially the numbers that are full of cuteness that are carefully calculated, politically correct, politically correct and not enough humor to avoid scary G ratings As a parent, or even at the age of 10, you have seen before and done better than before. Think of "101 Dalmatians alone at home" and you will get a general idea. I think the story of a good child is a good story. "Air Buddies", which is original, like recycled paper, doesn't pass that standard. Not the worst video that your child can watch. But with better megabits
