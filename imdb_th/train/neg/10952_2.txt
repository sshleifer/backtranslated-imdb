I hate that this movie is definitely not creative. I know they are using realism. But honestly, I don't want the truth. Boring realism If I want to see everyday life, I can live. Tell an interesting story and we'll talk. I can handle low production costs. Hell, I am a sucker for low production value. But at least working in some good ideas The direction goes as far as grabbing a video camera and walking around, but obviously I should dig because it makes things more real. Hitchcock once said that drama is the main thing in living with boring parts being cut off. I can conclude that this is not a drama, not by shooting for a long time. We have seen Rosetta walk somewhere. Rosetta works in a Rosetta bakery, is eating a Rosetta waffle, carrying a bag far away. Rosetta goes home. The deeper meaning as well I am very bored. I began to look for reflection in this movie. But it is just plain realism, the most exaggerated quality in the business I guess I should love this thing. But then nothing in it
