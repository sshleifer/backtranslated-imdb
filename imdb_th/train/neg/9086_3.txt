I am aware of Rohmer's admiration for his final work, which he thinks is a great film and the general audience often thinks of artistic failure. (In the latest film of Renoir or Chaplin; Yes, "politique des auteurs" also has a dark side), but with "Les amours d'Astrée et de Céladon" as if he wanted Rohmer for what might be his last film to extend this tradition of the director. Excellent, which made the last film by adjusting the Urfé of "L'astrée" with a ridiculous aesthetic code, making the witch look like a parody of Rosselini's last film (the movie he created for the TV from Desc. <br /> <br /> In his "Perceval" version, Rohmer refuses to take real landscapes to paraphrase what might be a classic representation in The Middle Ages of things were evident that the director changed his mind when the XVII century was involved and the movie actors dressed like peasants in the 1600s. Read their funny messages surrounded by trees and contemporary landscapes. But everything looks ridiculous than Luchini and fake trees Not being a fool But the way Rohmer mixes with inventions seems like a child and amateur, it turns out to be a quick, involuntary joke. (And I'm not talking about the annoying pronunciation of the actors by Rodolphe Pauly, a ridiculously erotic soft voice, a poor musician or a strange passion for trasvestisment!) <br /> <br /> The intense beauty of the movie ultimately makes it look like a joke mixed with Mild erotic movies are made for TV with academic discussions, theology (sic!). At the beginning of the film, Rohmer taught us that the original French story is disfigured by modernity and that is why he Have to shoot the movie "L'Astrée" in other parts of the country. However, I'm sure that this movie will look more modern and interesting if Rohmer is still Do the same area code with a modern storyteller and the artistic decisions. This movie may interest a few historians. But most of this movie might laugh at Rohmer's movies, the last and sad story.
