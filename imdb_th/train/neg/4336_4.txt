I watched this movie and the original Carlitos way back and forth. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now I know that people are saying that the prequel was created in a small budget. But that has never been associated with a bad chapter May now be just me But I always thought that the prequel was created to set up other movies starring the main characters and might fill a little about the life we ​​don't know. A few of the original movies, the ending is not reasonable compared to the original. At the end of this movie, he retired with a sweet heart. But how can we get him out of jail in the next movie? And his woman is not the same woman he talks about in his original love I would say that this movie provides gentle entertainment in itself, with a bit appropriate. But it was pale when he was the eldest brother Do not wake up at night to wait and see this thing. See the original again if you want a real hit.
