The first mistake you make in this movie is to use "death" without having to budget for real FX zombies. Of course, this is a low-cost zombie, low-budget. I think it's a film school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects <br /> <br /> It's not bad when considering the above, and it offers an interesting zombie game. If you are going to get "R" for violence, you may give a good picture of the baby being attacked. Women are rarely used in this film, which is almost classified as "Gay interest" <br /> <br /> And I'm still away from Auckland. There are many fires and no police in sight!
