Beautiful about the B-standard movie. Seriously, everyone who watched "Dragon Fighter" with Dean Cain and many people who created their first movie should know better than to expect true quality or even moderate intelligence Movie B to use the popular formula again If you give them a token analysis, you will break up the movie yourself. (And may write critical and nasty reviews on IMDb) <br /> <br /> I like actress Kristine Byers. She's charming and I think she's attractive. It was a memorable movie B image. Unfortunately, I didn't see where she was doing the movie. I will watch you again
