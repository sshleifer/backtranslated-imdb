I received this movie because I worked at a movie store, so I rented it for free. It came in and the veil made it look fine. Hot chick carrying weapons. Okay, I'll try. <br /> <br /> Oh man, terrible. This is so scary. I spent half the time watching movies quickly to go to nudity, which is very small. I think MAYBE three scenes of partial nudity. <br /> <br /> A wonderful conversation, violence, pretense Bad I feel bad about bringing this movie down because I know that it was made at a cheap price but a "clerk" and it became a classic and franchise. <br /> <br /> 2 / 10
