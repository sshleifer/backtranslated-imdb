* Possible spoilers * <br /> <br /> 'Return to Cabin by the Lake' is a useless movie. The show is not good and the story is not interesting at a distance His character went over this matter. It seems that he is not interested in doing sequels. His performance is good. But should be better I do not want to comment on the rest of the actors, because in my opinion they are not worth talking about. But i will do it Alison's character was not shown in the first part of the movie. Suddenly, she was the center of attention next to Stanley Caldwell. The role was unreasonable and should be considered a little better. Dahlia Salem was absolutely terrible. Her performance is lower than expected and people in the selection should look for others. Director Mike is a confusing character. He seems to have the purpose of being there. But it seems unnecessary that he must die Acting in this role is good, nothing good But better than Salem. <br /> <br /> The story is true if you think about it. Stanley, presumably dead, heads to the 'Cabin by the Lake' scene, which is a movie made from his script. He stumbled on the director and in a short time, the director died and Stanley was on the show. Yes, no team will let the stranger come into the picture and finish the film without knowing anything about him. There are not many killings and the show is ridiculous. One actress on the set received electricity while filming one scene. Another character was chewed by a motor boat. And another one tangled in the tree before drowning These writers have to be more difficult for excitement. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that I'm not impressed with the filming. The way it changed from looking for a low budget back to normal began to cause annoyance quickly. In addition, the new cabin on the lake was not well built. We didn't show But there are only a few scenes and everything that has a chain in the basement is useless It works only in the first movie because we show more rooms. But it doesn't work in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many characters in this sequel. Everyone except some people has no reason to stay there. The performances of the shows that are showing less are really bad and ... they don't have the purpose in this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, 'Return to Cabin by the Lake' is a sequel. Up from the left spot before 'Cabin by the Lake' I can accept But this is not impressive Judd Nelson should avoid this and you should do that. It's not like the first time, and it's completely too slow. Nothing happened in the first hour and it continued for the second time. Not to mention that the writing is terrible. Put this only when you need help with sleep. <br /> <br /> So we see that Stanley challenges death and is alive and well. By the way, he said, it seems that there may be a possible third part for a good movie only. Out of throwing in the sequels and we may not be ok. <br /> <br /> (The filmmakers didn't realize that they showed us how they shot the lake scene from the first scene. They did it. In the tank Do not reveal the secret of filming) <br /> <br />
