After seeing the credit with the only name I remember and that was the preacher in this movie (Russ Conway) I didn't expect much from this movie and I was not disappointed. Men are planning to kill his new wife by convincing others to know that she is crazy and will use her own life. The husband did not know that it was the plastic skull that he used in the opposite way. The ghost of a woman clearly saw his first wife revenge on her mind and use a real skull. Simple plot with threaded ends at the end If you are tired one night and want to sleep, this will help you sleep.
