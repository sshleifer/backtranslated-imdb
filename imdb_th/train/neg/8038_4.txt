** Spoiler ** The slasher redicules film that doesn't make sense with the killer that runs in the black cloak and wears what looks like the Peter Lorre rubber mask that pulls up the story in the beginning of the film. This was almost the first scene that Beth Morgan was still in the rehab because of heavy drug use after her boyfriend was murdered in Tennyson Collage about a year ago. <br /> <br /> A FBI representative of Sacker's (Jeff Conaway), who is obsessed with capturing the murderer, daughter is killed in Tennyson at the same time In the movie "Do you want to know that the secret" has ended? It has never been explained that the two killings in Connecticute are related to the murder of Florida collage students, dozens of people per year or not. In the murder of Beth's girlfriend wearing a stupid Halloween costume. <br /> <br /> At spring in the state of Sunshine, six students take a vacation at a beach house and before you Know them Manufacturing has been the fall at once. By starting the computer, Brad Clyton, Chad Allen, killing six people into the city with a number of people who are not related to the target students, including police chief Gavin Jack McGee. <br /> <br /> The murderer is wearing. The mask helps Beth for the last time in this strange ceremony at a deserted church in a state that looks like Florida Everglades. He eventually reveals who he is and what he intends to make as much as the movie does. Trying to make the audience scared of all the movies is confusing and confusing with an incredibly slasher scene too. The most powerful person to be a victim of Oz Washington, Tom Jay Jones survives at least three times in his life and ends with Agent Sacker. The hero in the movie <br /> <br /> Oz has a fierce wound. Stay away from large pieces of glass that are almost halved and deformed. But later he was miraculously revived after being arrested for the murder he had not done. In fact, he went out twice with the murderer and him, not as much as a slight limp! It's not reasonable why Oz and Beth went by themselves to catch and catch the murderer instead of calling the police with a cell phone at Ozmi instead. <br /> <br /> Beth's girlfriend who lost her head in The movie Hank Ford, Joseph Lawrence, is unbelievable, just like the two girls at the beach house. They, along with Beth Oz, are the victims of the murderers and disappear from sight! For a moment, you don't know if they were actually killed or whether it's a hallucination of Oz or the local police. Until the last scene that fell out of the wall that they appeared in the church <br /> <br /> We also received insights about the previous relationship between Tina and Hank and her drunk and acting. Nasty behavior trying to make And Hank, while Beth approached without hangs and Tina even noticed her Seems to make Beth more sorry, then her boyfriend was killed at the beginning of the movie!
