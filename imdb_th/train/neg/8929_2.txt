Hodge Lodge, adapted from the novel Gore Vidal (In fact, one of the great American writers) made THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN and VALLEY OF THE DOLLS look like Fellini Raquel Welch's art that has an amazing body (and actually she is not very high) in the role. Bring (except KANSAS COM BOMBER when she is quite good) to play Rex (Bad Movie Critics); By dragging the queen (great chick), the western mother, John Huston, young and innocent Farrah Fawcett (pre-Lee Majors; Shame) and other shame to pretend pretend ways For it, except for old-fashioned movie clips (such as Widmark in KISS OF DEATH, Lena Horne) ... just so they can make everyone's life away. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 performance Best = ?. It's terrible. It's worth watching!
