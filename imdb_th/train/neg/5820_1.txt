This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I learned French at college and understood every conversation, so language barrier was not a problem. I must say that it's really hard to pay attention to the characters that appear in the movie. There is only one professional actor in this drama, and I guess there is no professional director or writer. <br /> <br /> Although I give 1 out of 10 points, it may not be ranked. That is not good This is just a useless attempt to reduce the overall score of 7.3 to be more realistic. Perhaps 4.3 may give you a more accurate score because this movie is not a real 100 minutes or more event that you will never Come back, <br /> <br /> The real shame is I'm sure some college students. Causing his bolts to make the movie twice as good and half length However, if you want to join the bandwagon which seems to spin around IMDb, you may also "Lost in Translation" 10 as well.
