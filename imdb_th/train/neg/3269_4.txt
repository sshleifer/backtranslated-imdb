Except Meryl Streep's performance, which is known as always, I avoid this movie because it has the date "Movie of the Week" about this. But it is worthwhile to see that you take into account many understandings: the couple will endure media checks and different ways of being treated. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film is Different reliability Australians are different from "us" (the rest of the world), so we (most of us) will come here automatically with "weirdness" about them. The couple involved is religion. (Different from most of the culture) and Adventists (different) that, therefore, their lives and their thoughts, wondering how to start with Dingos, are animals that are different from other dogs, so we face strange questions Again, then the real story is that society (and the world) treats how different people, who have different accents, different beliefs than we do and how we treat them What they say is a suspect. <br /> <br /> It's hard to listen to the phrase "Daigo, take my child!" Without having to laugh and have all the funny and sad articles on the web. But over the years, this story and movie have been discovered. (As you will find in web searches) that children who are larger than dingos. Research by experts in dingos shows that not only is possible but the most probable that the baby was taken By dingos (probably paired), extracted from expert clothing and eaten in a short time More than killing Why is it that women affect (express) women are so cold that they think they are guilty in and out? <br /> <br /> The question is haunted, whether with or without movies.
