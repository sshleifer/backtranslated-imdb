Attractive young Japanese people are stealing the curse again. This time it's related to mobile phones. Many people die until the unhappy spirit behind them is discovered. So if you see more than 2 Japanese horror films, you can plot this in the dark with your hands. <Br / > <br /> The main attraction here is the fact that Takashimi is behind the camera. Until now, I was very impressed with his low-key work, such as City of Lost Souls. But while One Missed Call was busy, I wished because of his famous envelope pushing Dead or Alive or a fake audition style. - Cronenberg, although his films are essentially empty But at least they have such advantages, or at least there are some things that will interest you, like Tadanobu Asano, which shines in a shiny set that mimics Johnny Depp. There is no such thing in One Missed Call; There is very little credit: the show is polite and on average there is very little. (Nothing in honesty) in a scary or suspicious way, and in a place that is extremely boring. <br /> <br /> However, there is a time when the humor of the glaciers like Mikei's glaciers penetrated. Through polite trading Most notably with the example of a television program that intends to shoot a scene of a curse and a television director worrying about his ratings over the lives of girls. But besides this, there is nothing to suggest that it is Miike that is behind the camera. In particular, his vision was lost without a trace. (And including his famous blood), although it is more likely that he is not enthusiastic about the project and I can understand why The missed calls either aren't bad. <br /> <br /> Miike likes to be directed by his great annual work, obviously he is not 100% concerned about all of his projects. But even with this in mind But the missed call still felt like he was paying the bill
