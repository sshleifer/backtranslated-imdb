I live in Ottawa, which is the location for filming this movie, and I hope it won't be like that. This is a terrifying flick of God. I tried to really support independent movies. But there is this shame attached to what the indie and the shame is: Indie film. This movie doesn't do anything to get rid of this curse. The actor, writer, director Brett Kelly did little things to participate in the genre, but he hash repeatedly the words bored from past movies. I am very tired of watching the villainous characters that lie in the shadows and are the victims of unsuspecting. It's too much. <br /> <br /> I can remember one scene, especially near the point. The end of the flick at the whole scene is bright with the headlights. Now some people may say that this is the effect that is used to create emotions and tension. But sadly, it was the show of the shoestring budget of this movie. Just like the movie that dares to call himself horror, viewers will find themselves being pressed hard to find true blood in addition to scenes with corn syrup and red food coloring. <br /> <br / > The greatest thing that makes this film worse is walking and the lack of character development. The basic plot is that the kidnapped children and parents must follow this friend Bonesetter. The exact time To give the child back Not that this idea made me psychotic. But I do not think that I can really believe that when the two main characters, both lost, can find time to do it. This was done in a short time that was unbelievable. My first priority was to bring my daughter back and at least get to know the woman before going out with her. <br /> <br / > The last point I have is .... and I won't hold this to Kelly. But this film was completely filmed with boring and emotionless videos that passed through a tense period that would have style oozed just on film Although if the film received a million-dollar makeover and repeated stories and performances that were boring and weak, everything could not make this movie soar. My only hope is something that has happened to prevent Brett Kelly from creating a sequel that has been reported on his website, which is a sequel written halfway in one sitting. <br /> <br /> God helps us all.
