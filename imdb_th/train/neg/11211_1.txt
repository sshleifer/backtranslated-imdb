There are many things wrong with this movie. But to summarize: The acting is terrible - very bad. It must have a purpose. The script is bad - they may have a good idea. But this is not the best way to present the story. The ending is ridiculously bad. In some cases, the ending is managed to save the movie, not in this case. If you manage to watch the entire movie, you have to kick yourself to the end because the ending is not worth waiting. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It was a complete torture in watching this movie. I would appreciate someone who warned me in advance. So yourself like Watch this movie only if you have nothing to do better. Even if you regret having to suffer with an indescribable torture
