For many months I heard the little story of this movie and now I see it. I find it cute and cute. Many experienced directors create movies that they combine the creativity of others to create one of their own in the comedy army, swing blade The parody of Blair, the millions of witches, comes to mind. If everything these directors want is a foot into the door of Hollywood, they're doing the right thing and should follow because the storyline is the way Hollywood created the movie How many times have you heard the word "It is the home of the animals back to the future"; "Wall Wall follows the society of Dead Poet"; Or "Shakespeare in Love Meet Star Wars"? I remember when independent movies meant original and brave, unsafe and predictable.
