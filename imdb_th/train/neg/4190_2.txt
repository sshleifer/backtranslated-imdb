I saw this movie a few months ago in the city that appeared as Greendale in the movie, which is the only reason I watched. Another local who was there just sent me an email informing me about the show because the first item was gone and people turned away. The comment from his editor is now a good conclusion: <br /> <br /> "Yuk" <br /> <br /> If you're not a Neil fan or live in / near "Grey "(If after you know the real name) skip this movie Most of them are ego-style journeys of filmmakers. There is no visible plot. The song is just ok and most lyrics don't understand, making it impossible to follow the small things that may exist. <br /> <br /> I don't. Need to be put in Warning to spoilers because there is nothing surprising to give <br /> <br /> I'll give 1.5 / 10, but that's just fun to see the place that is made into a movie. It's not worth the 6 dollars. I can rent a video camera and drive around "Greendale" and make a better movie by myself. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch movies, a message about good environment without Must go to rent Koyaanisqatsi
