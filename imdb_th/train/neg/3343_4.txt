An interesting story about a soldier in the war who thinks of rescuing a young girl from the enemy and being haunted by this incident, although he helps many captive children. This film screened the head and this soldier became a teacher in a high school that was managed by police, inspecting the corridor, toilet and even the classroom. In other words, a high school is a prison, and most children pay little attention to teachers and principals. Dolph Lundgren (Sam Decker) plays as a military / school teacher and decides that he will stop teaching and go to another branch. However, the principal asked him to have a quarantine class as the last duty as a teacher. It came to this point in this movie when hell broke and the story became completely exploded. Let's enjoy it if you decide to watch!
