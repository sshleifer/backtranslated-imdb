They use words like "Illegal Love", "Forbidden Stories" and "Unlimited Happiness" They Show Pictures of Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser, M.D.) Hold a Gun! <br /> <br /> The story is related to Krista, played by Anne Archer. She is married unhappy with the gentleman who owns his own business. Edward (Harris) is a company employee. Her husband Krista and Edward fall in love with each other br /> <br /> The "shocking" part of the movie is: Krista's husband knows about it and prohibits them from seeing each other again. Then they decided to do what. Krista ended up living in Edward's attic. Wow! Krista became very visible and Edward felt very jealous. <br /> <br /> "Man in the attic" doesn't cover the new territory.
