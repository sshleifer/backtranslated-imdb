Being a Buster Keaton fan is to break your heart regularly. Most of us first met with Keaton in one of the best documentary films from his wonderful independent production period: 'The General', 'The Navigator', 'Sherlock Jnr'. We realized that he was a person. The greatest comedy in film history and we want to see more of his movies. This was a heartbreak that began after the 'steamer Bill Jnr'. Keaton's brother-in-law, Joseph Schenck, forced him to sign a contract that allowed Keaton to be under MGM control. Keaton became another actor for employment Show other people's roles Then alcoholism worsened after 'Steamboat Bill Jnr' Keaton never made the first movie again. Two sources describe it as an interesting masterpiece that Keaton claimed he had to do at MGM, which is a joke of 'Grand Hotel'. Biographer Tom Dardis offers credible evidence that Keaton carries this story. > <br /> The heartbreak increased because of the long-term decline of Keaton. Over the years, he created a good movie ... as his short comedy 'Grand Slam Opera'. Picture Went to the scene of Keaton's drama with Spencer Tracy in 'It's Mad Mad World': the order in which police Tracy bitterly cheat the old phone (Keaton) and try to recruit help to steal Smiler Grogan's cash. That almost disappeared forever But I still watched <br /> <br /> 'Say it easy' alas, one of Keaton's movies from the beginning of his decline. MGM tried to create Jimmy Durante (who had been playing Smiler Grogan for three decades Later) as a new comedian Unfortunately, MGM tried to create Durante by working with Keaton, which is a comedy film that is not compatible with Durante (I'm a big fan of both). Throughout his career, Durante is a merciless gangster: praising him. Knowing that he was created at the expense of Keaton and Keaton, the only co-star that Durante never tried to stage. <br /> <br /> Keaton is often used as a victim of brutal violence in ' Talk 'He played the role of a professor in the Western Midwestern College who had no sense of humor and received a letter stating that he had inherited $ 750,000, which he had to travel to New York to receive privileges. Did he call the phone to confirm this? Did he check the seal? No, he brought life savings out of the bank and rushed to New York. As soon as he left, the confessor of the post confessed that he wrote a letter (fake) to relegate the professor to the post from his path! <br /> <br /> The post that thinks he is a 3/4-cross Dodge (Durante) millionaire who is trying to produce a musical, but without money, the characters that the two great comedians are playing on the face. The screen couldn't be prevented. Keaton is playing one of those eggheads (like Mister Logic in 'Viz') who is the creator of everything. Durant plays one of those annoying bats that can't say anything honestly because the script always wants him to speak slang. The painful, unsightly dialogue scene that Durante is trying to talk to Keaton about money, but - instead of having to come straight out - Durante must use more inventive slang words like 'kale', 'cartwheels', etc. At Keaton, of course, there is no idea about Durante. I will give credit to Keaton: the sound of his dry and dusty pasture, Kansas's flat accent is perfect for the characters he plays here. <br /> <br /> Sidn ey Toler looks more slim and handsome than here Will be just a year later, as impressive as the director of the provocative series that has been examined by Professor Post Henry Armetta that I have never met, even less funny than usual here by Gag running with stupid pay Thelma Todd impresses me here in the evil role that she plays in 'Horse Feathers' (the more fun movie) Edward Brophy, one of the actors in which my favorite character wasted. <br /> < br /> Part of the problem of 'speaking simply' is that the supporting characters have completely inappropriate behavior. Keaton's lawyer appeared at Durant's theater with a quick message for Keaton ... but he wasn't there, so the lawyer would reveal Keaton's personal business to the first stranger he had. Find (Shoot that lawyer, Blockbuster!) In another scene, Professor Post-who is seen as the conductor of this music - mistakes go into the chorus room of the chorus girl and all the chorus girls sing loudly immediately. I know for the fact that * modern * singers will not respond in this way, and I seriously suspect that the singer in 1932 behaved like that ... certainly not responding to 'angel' that controls Their performances <br /> <br /> Spoilers are coming. About half an hour into the 'easy talk', the great Jimmy Durante sat himself at the piano, smiled into the camera and shook his head a little when he started playing music. This is the moment that I finally think that this movie will end with the purpose of our entertainment. Alas, not the most annoying thing is the ending of this film, which uses the most boring words and not Convincing in all jokes: one movie in which the madman is utterly incompetent, becoming a comedian through his own incompetence (Keaton is forced to repeat this boredom in the episode '1955 of Screen Director Playhouse'. Chaplin used it in 'The Circus'. <br /> <br /> I almost cried - too. Anger and sadness - when losing opportunities in 'Speak easily'. Most do not respect the work that Keaton, Durante, Toler, Brophy and Miss Todd have done elsewhere. I will rate this movie 2 points out of 10. <br /> <br />
