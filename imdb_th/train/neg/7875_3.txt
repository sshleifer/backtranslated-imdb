Les Visiteurs, the first film about medieval time travelers, is really funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor. But more Strange situations and absolute nonsense that will remind you of Louis de Funes a little. <br /> <br /> Now, this sequel has the same characters, same actors, and the same part of the journey. Now the character is probably an experienced time traveler. So they jump up and down in history without paying attention to the fact that it will have depression while you step into the movie. Duke Jean Reno tries to keep everything along with his play. But his character is empty, so there is nothing he can do to help this movie. <br /> <br /> Now, the Duke's slave / assistant has all the attention. This film is about him and he is clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever he is supposed to be true is; This character tries to create laughter from the audience. But he was not successful As if someone had told you a terrible joke for you, but he insisted on telling the joke until the end, adding more details to make your suffering longer. <br /> <br /> If you like Les Visiteurs Destroy the taste in your mouth with the sequel. If you don't like Les Visiteurs, you'll never see a sequel. If you like the sequel of this story ... well, I think you still have to watch many movies.
