Not Corman's door knocking, as he jokes on Carol Burnett. He is good at playing secondary characters in Mel Brooks ("High anxiety"). However, he is not the one who can show movies. In the fight role, not less This is basically a "Gremlins" as the movie tradition, such as "Critters" and "Ghoulies". It's not a good thing as well, with "Ghoulies" but with a much lighter tone because it's not near Darkness as the movie received In fact, this one is too light and too bubbly, and unfortunately most of the jokes end up being flat. Even though I gave 3 points, but because of the worse movie "Gremlin" knockoff, if you watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000, do you know that I'm talking about ... "This shameful Hobgoblins has a man Found with little critter in the underground place (I saw this movie for a long time, so I don't remember everything clearly) and it started to be friendly enough. However, this creature became unfriendly, fast, and certainly would happen again, and that was the movie. Missed more than a hit story in the comedy department and it was also crippled when he saw Corman as an evil brother. Best to cross this one But then you might try to watch it for kicking
