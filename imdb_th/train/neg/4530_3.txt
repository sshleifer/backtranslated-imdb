Split two may be a good movie. Stories about murder "Fury" has a very young Clive Owen, good work, but ... but .... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the filmmakers cut their own movies too. A camera that works well and truly great editing. The camera skips creativity in an unsuccessful attempt (I think) to reflect Owen's stress from business, family and traffic. This is done for the headaches audience. <br /> <br /> Because filmmakers don't care about making good movies. But impressing each other by shooting stupid images.
