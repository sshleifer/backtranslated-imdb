Wow! This movie is really scary. I can't imagine anyone reading this poorly written script and giving it a green light. The performer has a second rate regularly, along with a truly awesome performance from every actor. The story is separated, scattered and incoherent. Introduction and predictability Without wit, no charm, no humor Not sexy for a short time. The characters remain at the same level as the proverbial pancakes. In addition, there is a steady stream of hateful women who are more difficult to conceive when the film continues. When your lead actor (Karel) isn't offensive and uninteresting, it's up the hill from there. Even if it is a fake at the end, where love prevails over sexual desire But I felt sick in the stomach If this is something that is sent through humor and social opinions, we will be doomed.
