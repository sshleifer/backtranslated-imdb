East Palace, West Palace reminds me of The Detective and Frank Sinatra in the police role and William Windom is a boy. I think it's a Chinese progressive movie. But it still extends the belief about the femininity of gay men: mostly made from Chinese myths that men use in female roles This movie focuses on the weak men who want to be overwhelmed and attacked by men who are men. He fearlessly sailed in the park - he hoped to be brought into the station by the authorities. And actually happened He then told the staff about his entire life while being slightly tortured: causing him to squat for a period of time. This is what gay men want and implicitly, gay men are challenging the image of police as men as men. Stories about the lives of gay men (Including events that happened in the past) is acceptable But when he began to explain the ancient Chinese legends and theatrical productions, this film could not be tolerated. It became a path of poverty for Chinese gays who wanted to fulfill their traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can't relate.
