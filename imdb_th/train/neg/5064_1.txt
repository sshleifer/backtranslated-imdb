I don't believe they made this movie. Totally unnecessary The first movie is ok. But there is no need for a sequel. Of course, not after the TV drama that is the sequel of the first movie. This film feels like an opera. Writing is terrible. It's the easiest. The funniest jokes did not go through the show quite flat, like shooting a soap without any direction. The first film has a backbone in a good mood behind. Every character has a slight arc. It's very easy, but it works and I see the advantages of this movie. But at this time there are no identical stories The characters are boring and nothing interesting happens. One good thing: The Brazilian boy, who plays Axel Daeseleire's son, is quite handsome. That was one of the moments when they achieved creative success in this film I heard that they filmed the second series as a sequel to 'Team Spirit 2', but please don't let them create the third scene ...
