Writers have reasonably good ideas for the story. But many flaws in the plot are far from the movie. Basic elements such as character development are best selected. Inconsistencies also feed their ugly heads. A large mansion located in the middle of the Irish countryside? The character just "appeared" in the garden during the stormy night. (At a very convenient time, I may add) In conclusion, it is not "bad". I give the fourth score, which is mainly based on Alison Elliott's story and abilities
