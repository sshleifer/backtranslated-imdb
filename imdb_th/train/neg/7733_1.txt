It's really embarrassing! I am investigating this story, hoping that it will be a James Garner gem that has not been discovered and that it is so wonderful! Good production quality But the plot is weak, undeniably, and I can honestly say that I am now more than a couple of hours and very stupid now. This film has no qualification for redemption, and if this type of content continues to be published, it will make Hallmark a bad name. For those of you who insist on knowing what it's about, what it's about, and in this case it's not a good thing. We have to be watched by an old woman who is one of the most stupid creatures in the world to marry a true lover who may be the only person who is still alive. She dragged him through the messy things, causing him to be in another embarrassing situation and be proud of himself all the time. Then the movie will end. What a relief! Not worth the time it takes to watch, so please act like and skip this thing. You will be glad if you know it's bad.
