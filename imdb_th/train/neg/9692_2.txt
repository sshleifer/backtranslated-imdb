Bonjour Tristesse covers similar ground as 'Members of marriage' for the ingenuity of the daughter who owns, trying to prevent the relationship from happening among the beloved family members. While critics love 'Members of the wedding' I found that Julie Harris was a jumbo-drag and adenoidal scenery scene in everything she had received - portrays portrays this annoying. It's a travel book. <br /> <br / > In this movie sequence, Preminger developed, but the character couldn't do it. In the first 30 minutes, he was happy to blur the father-daughter relationship between Seberg and Niven. When a conflict arises, Seberg cannot deliver the desired depth. Kerr pulled the rank and changed this movie to 'Endless Love'. Seberg's nonsense narrative is like something from Strange Interlude - it's not good. I want people other than Niven to be in their role. He spent a lot of time adjusting to the usual English behavior in all his films. He never approached the characters. <br /> <br /> In the most memorable scenes, evening dance became free for all. Bertolucci stole the entire scene for his empty exercise. "The Conformist" Kerr is on the board to hold her hand and show great pain again (eg in Black Narcissu s, Night of the Iguana, King and I, Heaven knows that Allyson, Tea and Sympathy, etc.) Kerr is a really scary actor. I hope that every movie that you may end up in a serious car accident or better than starting with one. <br /> <br /> People who are uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this.
