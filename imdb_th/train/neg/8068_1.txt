I didn't expect much for this movie when renting at $ 1 at the video store. But the box at least shows a little contract with the "killer" of "more blood! Sex a lot! "Can't go wrong there! Hmm ... There's no need to say that this box is fake. How do the actors and actresses of the hides in this movie have such a low ability? <br /> <br /> Everything opens with a drunken college girl who is walking out of a twin house or Other buildings like that are useless shit to her boyfriend (?) As a poor stockton camera, follow her. Then she was chased by some friends in a clear plastic mask and grabbed another person. They slit her wrists without a real reason and you can see when they "cut" her that someone has drawn the wound with what looks like a candle. <br /> <br /> From there, repeat the theme. The same girl who was chased / mercilessly killed two people for about 84 minutes in one shot, Soul Survivors Deceive me to rent a flick If I rent a bad movie that claims to have more violence and sex .... I want more violence and sex! Shoot one full forehead in an 85-minute period from a clear and penetrating chick, and a gore that doesn't make children afraid to cut. If this is a Killer Cut, What is theatrical cut! Of course, I wonder if this garbage was imported to the cinema from the beginning. Embarrassed by the actors in this movie I saw them making a screen launch here because they didn't do anything before. But all of them were established before the launch I don't know if it was filmed before they were all created or not, and the studio sat on film until they were semi-big names or not. But what I want to know is .... They spend 14 million dollars on this movie!
