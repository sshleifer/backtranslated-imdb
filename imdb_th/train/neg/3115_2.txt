I rarely write negative reviews for this website. But this time, I felt like the Night Listener. No doubt it was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There's nothing going on in this movie - I don't care about any characters. So did not buy For all mysterious plot types, do not care how it ends ... Nothing <br /> <br /> No jokes, no actions, no excitement, no suspense, nothing. Highlights include ( No spoilers - nothing to lose): A man climbing through the dog's barking window outside the hotel room, a car that runs through rough terrain and a truck beeping horns. That there will be a role Surprisingly similar to Williams. But alas, it was greatly reduced The more frustrating thing is that I'm sure there are good movies in it - the idea is interesting and I should feel sympathetic to the characters. But it didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> I might give it 1/10, but the score is reserved for the remake of The Producers.
