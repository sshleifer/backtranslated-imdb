I like general monster movies. Although they are unbelievable and ridiculous But it is difficult to like this movie when it is impossible and ridiculous and trying to act seriously at the same time Just like the really luxurious way. <br /> <br /> While the idea is quite true, like Orcas, it is well known to kill the Great White Sharks. It's hard to find. Angry, destroying things In particular, one scene where some buildings explode, the reason for doing Orca ... and as it explodes things that jump out of the water and it feels like I'm watching the show at Sea World with fireworks. Kill many horrifying moments before they say that they are going to happen. Also, using a few jabs at JAWS is like "Hey, look, we are real people and we can find better reasons why Orca was attacked." <br /> <br /> Yes, you don't care about evil Your in logic. But JAWS has one thing that your movie doesn't have. It's awesome. Yes, it's unbelievable. Yes, it's quite outrageous. But quite frankly, is it true that the shark killer is not close to the horror like Great White and the bad efforts in character development and writing make it more painful. Even JAWS the Revenge is scary. More than this
