Recently, I watched the movie Guinea Pig, The Devil's Experiment and I have to admit that I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie is included in the movie list. "The most disgusting" is always, and maybe I expect more because of the hype. The truth is that I don't vote. <br /> <br /> If I watch it, believe that the opening message is true ("I found this tape ...") I may have been slightly disturbed by thinking that it is real. Although I don't benefit from knowing that it's not true. But I think I have already worked that it didn't happen. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the reaction of the girl to what she did. Not what it should be She should be screaming like having Chibi in pain. The fact that she does not mean is not true. I don't want to watch it if it's true. But if you have to believe in your performance more, this movie should be more disturbing. <br /> <br /> There is a famous scene: nothing affects me. As well as a scalpel in his hand Hot oil, worms and organs are not bothering me. I'm not saying that I'm "hard"; Just that I could not suppress my unbelief, partly because of the inertia of the girl. <br /> <br /> The surgical knife made me a little startled. But the hammer that the hand made is just a tire to see the hand And the final scene with the eyes is a bit more wincing, but nothing more I don't want to look out, and I don't feel nauseous. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because this movie is twenty years old or maybe it's because I'm bored. The truth is that I didn't find this movie annoying. <br /> <br /> It's what you expect to see playing as a modern, off-the-ground installation and exercise. In stripping out characters, stories, etc. and just getting out of torture, it works at some level Although it is an annoying movie But it didn't work for me at least. <br /> <br /> I watched Guinea Pig with my wife which was "It's just a movie" and she wondered what it all was. The fuss is about We have to talk about why I watch these movies and my reasons are many. But including the desire to be affected by movies She said she didn't think that any movie would be reliable and disturbed her and challenged me to do that. I played her fire scene with Irreversible and she was definitely disturbed. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I have a spot other than that. We both were more disturbed in the horror scene. Movie types rather than any movies that cause interference
