This movie has a weak story, a weak character, and a very weak special technique that I ask why I died so valuable by watching it. It has a random character that doesn't add anything to the story and seems to be an excuse for the director to get his girlfriend in this movie. The sad robot and the "hero" bots. The main body is opened with a large knife. If this movie wasn't that bad, it would be funny. But there was nothing funny about it. The main enemy is one of the redeemed characters only and he is killed. It is sad when you look at the bad guys because they are the best people to support. When everyone spoke and made this movie better than the rest on the cutting floor or did not receive a scholarship at all.
