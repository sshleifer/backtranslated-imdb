As a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse book, I found this series to be a completely cruel agent. I found that they created amazingly colorful characters that seemed good and rude. One thing I like about this book is that despite all the scandals she has to go through, Sookie is always a woman But in the TV series, she is not like that. Not only that But the prejudice shown on the TV series didn't spread in the book I did not expect an exact replica But at least I expect their feelings to be applied to the series.
