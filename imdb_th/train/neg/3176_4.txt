The cute Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who died after an ice angel crushed her before "I do's" with his fiancee Henry Rudd. After two years, Henry has not continued. Go and Chloe, his sister (Lindsey Sloan) was very worried. Chloe arranged for Henry to talk to Ashley's charming heart (Lake Bell). Ashley is contacting Kate's spirit in the hope that he can help Henry. Can continue to live When the mind starts to attract Henry, the ghost of Kate appears to be romantic in the eye. There are some funny situations. But if you've seen an example, you see the content of the movie. In addition to the performances: Stephen Ruth, Jason Biggs, William Morgan, Sheppard and Wendy McCain-Don, personally I think Bell stole the show. From parker And Biggs as usual. Pain in the buttocks This movie is still beyond expectations.
