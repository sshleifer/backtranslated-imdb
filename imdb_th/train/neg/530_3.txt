I saw this in a sneak peek two days before the official launch and I must say I was very disappointed. And I have to put most of these problems in the decision to send Claire Dennes into the lead. Depending on what you think about Danes She is not completely the same. Other great actresses perform well. But of course not making the screen brighter From the best actress in this film, I will say that the best person is Natasha Richardson. That stream is almost not shown in the picture and will appear near the end only. <br /> <br /> Scary movie script as well. It comes out more when they read the lines rather than being truly "characters".
