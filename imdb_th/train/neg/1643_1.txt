"Whipping" is one of the most scary movies of all time. It was a nasty garbage that made me to be in the theater more than any other movie in 2000, in addition to "The Grinch". That would be a small movie called "High Fidelity", while the film is honest and sympathetic. "Whipping" is a terrible enemy. Avoid this, like many disasters, unless you want to see how "funny" is bad.
