I was amazed about the many female voters who rated this film better. My idea about this film is that the target group is adults and men. Women who are tortured and tortured, merciless vengeance and high body numbers are common ingredients presented in film history by spaghetti. The opening and hit by the hand is DJANGO THE SHOOTER but lacking style like DJANGO. The performances and movies score is the most common But if you look for the ingredients mentioned above, you will come to the right place. And actors do not have an Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10
