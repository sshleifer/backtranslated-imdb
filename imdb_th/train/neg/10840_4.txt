I love acting that grows with millions of other people, so I adapted to this movie, thinking that if not good, it may be interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> Wrong. ! I just have to wonder if at the end of this story, Charlie's fairy is really boring. I don't seem to remember this like this. But this movie is not as good as this type of movie can be a little bored, similar to the excitement of that time and performance. I see everything, despite being negative. But not absolute But it was very gentle, which I was not wrong with the actors, especially women who played the angels because they really looked like them. This movie is not interesting. It tries to make each fairy as a "character" (an angel is a feisty one, a "good boy". One person enters her husband ....) Every character has an image that has one important characteristic Define them and the depth is less than the pattern. The excitement of the show disappeared and the dialog box was .... The dialog box was so beautiful. <br /> <br /> Not scary, not the worst TV movie but missed.
