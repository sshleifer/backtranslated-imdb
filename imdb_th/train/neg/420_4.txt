For those who want to watch this movie? I will say: Go! It may be a very good movie / documentary. But some songs, subtitles and stories that have been used make it difficult to see people who have doubts like me. Track many animals, their lives. In many seasons, one gets the feeling that it is the animal soap we are watching. But the same view doesn't cut me. Finally, if the hunters catch the bait (With one exception) the camera zooms out or skips to another scene I asked myself why it happened if they had to show reality, why cut the remaining fairytale scenes? I think morality is important for the crowd. Cause: It will be wasteful to destroy this beautiful world.
