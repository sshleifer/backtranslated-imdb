Not sure why this movie received a critically acclaimed review. <br /> <br /> While watching "Bang" one night on TV, I found myself bored with ridiculous stories. This film seems to be nothing more than an artistic exercise that is indulgent in the mind of the filmmakers. The fact that the director / nickname writer has only one name that reinforces the feelings of deceit Better and dare to say that it's more fun than wasting time.
