This is one of the worst movies ever created. I think myself to be a big fan of large-scale zombie movies and often tolerate bad performances, "special effects" are stupid and anything you might find in the second rate movie AS LONG. With the atmosphere / story / rhythm or whatever This one generally doesn't have a positive side to it and the third or fourth rate may be worse. Some of my friends and myself made a small movie during the weekends and performed better. (Of course, there are no zombies.) <br /> <br /> This flick isn't funny, even can't say anything else. Poor special effects and redundant zombies that look like normal people. (Except the white skin that was pulled up on their faces), very fake blood (I like very realism, the combination of realism and zombies movies is debatable. The blood offered is just plain stupid.) The camera is quite long with the feeding scene. It's boring and you can't help but wondering why zombies use WEAPONS (!) To kill their victims. I will not go into the details of the copy. (Others do that) Even though I am from Germany and at least want to know about the original version, I won't waste time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Keep away from it as much as you can.
