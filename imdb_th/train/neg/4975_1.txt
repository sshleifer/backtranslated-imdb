After seeing the production of "Beowulf & Grendel" in Canada / Iceland / England in 2004, which I thought was fantastic and amazing, I approached this - a new movie from Beowulf's first 3 films released this year As soon as I heard "Viking" and saw a hat with him, I wailed. These are the era of Swedish migration and the Danish people are not Vikings. (They came later) and even the Vikings never wear helmets. (He made it easy for your enemy to knock the helmet and your brain). Then there was Hrolfgar's palace, which looked like a scene for a film about Greece or Rome, not Denmark. There are scenes left from previous movies that are located in many historical eras. I saw the weapons that Teacher Soder might use in "The Kingdom of Heaven" and one character uses the movie sword of the Windlass Steelcrafts to reproduce from "Beowulf & Grendel"! In addition to the basic plot of the original epic poems, the writing is somber and the performances are totally wooden and unreliable. The biggest thing is the crossbow, a secret weapon, with a range of sightings and explosive missiles that seem to buy things from Iraqi insurgents. A monster with special effects and his mother is a steroid that Beowulf can't tear his arms like he did in the poem. Thank God for bazooka! I can go on But i won't do
