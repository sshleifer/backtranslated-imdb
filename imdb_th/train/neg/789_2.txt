Five minutes after watching this, I log on to IMDb to remind all of you that you are not interested in this movie ... Genre: Horror? It had a moment of little skepticism and throughout the movie I thought to myself that "Things that must happen shortly" It's not ... When the movie ends, I'm embarrassed for the writer / director. I've never been a big fan of Patrick, this person didn't know how to create a movie and after watching this excuse, the horror flick I'm not a big fan of not seeing his work .. <br /> <br /> I was summarizing by Pl Please do not make mistakes as well. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 2 stories for the actors .. They are not bad at all. Bad direction ...
