After buying a DVD in the trash, bargain because of the impressive features listed on the cover, I pop up in the DVD player and everything looks good Good animations and many special features ... but when I play the movie myself, it's great. It's the worst thing I've ever seen and I've watched bad movies in my time. The comments that praised the movie here at IMDB are from people who make movies. So don't believe it if you don't want to lose money!
