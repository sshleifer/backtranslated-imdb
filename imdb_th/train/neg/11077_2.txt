The only reason I chose to flick this image was due to the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borkine. All I can say is that it is the greatest loss of a good actor ever filmed. As far as I can tell, Borgnine is the only actor in there. Other performances are terrible. I was surprised that the studio would pay "actors" to appear at this level of talent in the acting department. With the story, so stubborn and uninteresting that I think my eyes will start to bleed when the credits are accumulated Obviously, this film was created to attract young audiences and its credit is better than most traditional programming on the Disney Channel and networks that focus on similar children. But actually it doesn't say much
