It was one of the first movies about MTV dance, and I didn't see where these 'bad' junk came from. The performance was terrible. scary! The name should scream, not watch. 'How did you move?' When did the movie name be able to ignore the grammar? At least some dance movies have half the interesting dance scenes. These movies do not deserve to watch. I gave 1 out of 10 just because there was no center. I ask anyone who has more than 60 IQs seriously. Don't watch and don't have to pay 1.6 / 10. Should tell everything. This film should not be created even.
