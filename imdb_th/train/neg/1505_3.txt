Italo-Western That is full of ordinary garbage filled with stupid stories and lack of logic, some ordinary actors, dirty settings, many punches, and people are shooting in a wide range. <br /> <br / > This thing has nothing to do with Django - at least not in my German translation. This German DVD is called "Adios Companeros" and Macho Callaghan battled with Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because of their gang. Kill his people (He is the only survivor) Then you have Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fighting each other because they quarrel and separate gangs and you have Ironhead to fight with everyone because he is the biggest and most greedy bastard. Yes, there is no intelligence in the story again. Hehe. <br /> <br /> Klaus Kinski's small role as Reverend Cotton is a remarkable story. (That's why I bought this DVD) In ​​one scene, he tried to separate the two men fighting by hitting them and screaming that "I say love!" 'AMATO or Aristide Massaccesi made the movie - I love the master of the incompetent exploitation, so it is "aahhh" for me.
