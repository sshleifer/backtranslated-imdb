Doris Day never let a bad script disappoint her. Even in the most trying situations, the day is 100% and usually not injured. This comedy may have been inspired by real life in New York in 1965, but in reality, adapted from the late 1950s French drama Claude Magnier makes Doris do little. But deceived the image of good people and good people In the second half will be made funny (Which is amusing because the day turns to make the situation) here are some funny lines But the ferocity of the content has been used clearly from playing ... and instead of describing the amusing events in the Big Apple, we are stuck in the suburbs. Doris's co-star (Patrick O'Neill, Robert Morse and Terry-Thomas) did not suit her and the hairstyle that didn't have that shape didn't wear. Still, it's not scary. It has a few big laughs and for Day-buffs must see ** from ****
