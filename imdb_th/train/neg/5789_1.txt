My wife and I have very high hopes for this movie. But it was a major disappointment It is a Native American version of Mr. Magoo, the pathetic father who failed in everything he tried. Fishing. Hunting in a way that is clearly defined by his family to the imagination in the wild. His "vision" is not only ridiculous but in the process that he lied to his son many times about things Various clear words can not tell how bad this movie is. Children and wives have a lot of truth, which makes this movie even sad. I don't get a joke ... unless you like to laugh at others who make yourself stupid. I do not understand how this will happen for the reward. Save your money. It's not worth the rental.
