I regret that I bought this series. I expect to do more, make the image clearer and more consistent. This is just a pure propaganda that is very dark, charming and seductive. It is boredom. I found that the actors worked quite weak as well. O'Donnell might look as charming as Robin (with Batman), but in this picture he has no charm. It may be that while he was older he would lose the charm of the child. But didn't get the charm of growing up It is no surprise that it is not shown in many countries and is sold in the UK at a price of 40% of the recommended price and not yet released in the Netherlands.
