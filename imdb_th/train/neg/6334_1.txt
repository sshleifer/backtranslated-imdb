I saw this film in 1979. I was 17 or 18 years old when released. The theater may be full 1/4 when the movie begins. Ten minutes in the movie, I and my friends who went with me to watch movies are only two people in the cinema. This movie is really strange and there is no plot or reason for writing the script and people need a refund. We decided to stay for the whole movie .... Why have to suffer with such torture ?? ... This is the reason we want to be a true movie critic ... Having all the standards for making other movies That is difficult to prove that you have seen the best movie (10) But it is easy to be able to separate all other movies from the worst movies ever created (and this is ... 1 best story). There may be other movies that qualify as 1, but I haven't See them Now I seize every movie that I see at the worst level .... I am a true movie critic ... He's him.
