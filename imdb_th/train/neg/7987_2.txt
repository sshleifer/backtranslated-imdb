I'm sure this is one of the "WOAH!" Attractions in 1982 when Epcot opened, but now it's stupid. The text of this film has an ancient idea. Circle-Vision is confused and scary music at the end is satirical. And I hope they will install seats After walking a lot, all you have to do is sit down for a moment. And when you hear there is a movie to watch, it sounds very charming! You are entertained while sitting down, right? Not right! You stood there for 18+ minutes, leaning against a short railing. Disney should create a new version of Maelstrom as a tourist attraction to enliven and replace boring and lackluster movies. Fun. It's true across Canada, unless you're eating there.
