This movie is not really good. It may be severe, but it is true. The script is not good, with all the ancient vampires in this book and there is no sympathy for the origin of the main characters ... like Dracula. There has been a great movie Dracula / vampire before. But this didn't make it into a box "Dire" <br /> <br /> Choose a person who seems to come out of a teenager-teenager. Add the cuteness of Dracula Lore and mix in a religious tonic and daydream ... and you Get the confusion of the movie - Dracula 2000 <br /> <br /> I really can't find a good thing to say about this movie, as if it's not bad enough to be built at first. Seems to make Johnny Lee Miller cause Young English ... you cry ... well, he was an Englishman. But he sounds like an American who tries to emphasize the English accent. <br /> <br /> All you say is your money. (If you're thinking of buying it) or rent out and see for yourself why it's scary like Tellytubbies. <br /> <br /> PS Although La La is quite scary!
