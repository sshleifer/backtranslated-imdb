RUN ... Don't walk from this movie !!!!! Aiming at young children, this movie will give you tears. If Gamera's ending of the 90s is elevated, this movie is downgraded. It's slow and the battle with the monster is good. But rarely seen This film makes me feel rippled in the cat box. Just a terrible offer after the 90s series. <br /> <br /> Spoiler apart from this point !!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top 10 reasons that Gamera fans in the 90 series will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> 10 This movie is a drama that tracks children who are trying to cope with the death of their mother. Afraid of losing the son of Gamera into the fight after knowing that his father saw that the adult Gamera was dead. <br /> <br /> 9 You saw Gamera an adult for a minute at the beginning of the movie. He gets his butt kicked by a few Gyaos and destroys himself? He looks old and lethargic. Moreover, he seems like nothing like the game you've seen. His suit looks cheap and hasty. <br /> <br /> 8 The young Gamera you see through the rest of the movie looks like Pokemon. Big and cute eyes ... It will remind you of Godzilla's children from Godzilla and MechaGodzilla 2 Gamera. Now too cute. <br /> <br /> 7 The movie has a footstep in watching the NASCAR race. During the rain 3 hours, I watched this movie with 2 other Gamera fans and no one was happy with this slow-moving movie. I saw an SUV filled with fat people that ran up the mountain road. <br /> <br /> 6 Like Godzilla: Final Wars, this movie has very little chi chu on the screen. The final war is really more than this, and can be fought better, even though it is short. <br /> <br /> 5 Children get the role of friends of children themes and bad writing, killing the original Gamera series in 1970 and History repeats itself in the 2000s. The most successful Gamera movie left the Sesame Street feeling and went to the dark. Why go back to the failed formula? This is a new trilogy and bad ticket sales have destroyed this hope in order to continue. (Thank God) <br /> <br /> 4 Kamera lost his symbolic roar. Now he sounds like a strep neck. <br /> <br /> 3 This movie may create a new Olympic Games ..... Imagine the relay race that involves sending young children to danger. You must see the end to understand this point. Where are the parents? Oh, yes ... send their children to the Kaiju battle area. <br /> <br /> 2 Special effects are good. But the sub-section for Gamera Legion and Iris films has a better effect. The best result is to show that Gamera has a very small body size. Not too impressive. <br /> <br /> 1 This movie is not something that the fans of Kaeju adults expect. The director is involved in Power Rangers and it shows. It came out like the cross between ET, Always: Sunset on Third Street and TMNT. Glory. If you know all 3 references, <br /> <br /> Rent best or watch only once if you buy a DVD set. Come
