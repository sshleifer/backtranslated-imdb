This is not just a bad movie. But is one of the worst movies ever It's terrible that I find it very fun. Acting Oh God. Chapter. You must be a kiddin. 'You imagine the writer coming out with things like: - Children who make fireworks in the school, powerful fireworks, when someone hits it, they fly one hundred yards and Bomb - The girl is locked in the cell. The killer tries to open the door. She was trained But the wire is not long enough First of all, she made a call. Oh, horror. Once she finished, she drilled through the door and drilled the head of the killer WOW - and there are many more examples like that. Oh yes, what happened to George Kennedy? He used to be a great person (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool hand look)
