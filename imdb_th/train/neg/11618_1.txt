The acting in the movie is very good in good faith. But the film is slow and boring as soon as it gets all the attention, slows down to a halt I'm glad to see Sam Rockwell on this issue. He works well. Other actors as I talk about men ... This is one of the worst traction movies. Now probably in the form of a short film, this movie should be good. But at least it should be avoided This movie has a lot of fillers. It makes jealous Twinkie cakes. <br /> <br /> I never walked out of the movie. But watching here with my family walking away Yes it is boring Obviously, my comment has not enough lines to post, so here are some more additions. I guess I was inspired by the movie I just watched.
