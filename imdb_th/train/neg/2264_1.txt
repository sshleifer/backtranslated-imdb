To preface this review, I must say that I am a little curious about this movie .. Anyway, I may not see it if I don't have my arms twisted a little. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie shows how low-human beings can be. In my eyes, the worst thing about all of this Springer phenomenon is not that type of person in "Jerry Springer Show" that they do (which in itself is noticeable), but many people want to know. Want to see and be excited And heard about their lives (Yes, I think, including me .. regardless of whether it is true) If not honoring that behavior (As some people say) At the very least, we may destroy our minds and / or make ourselves unsuitable for this type of behavior. <br /> <br /> But there is enough soap (in order). This is skinny: the movie This has R ratings and while it may only be appropriate (I didn't watch some scenes, so I'm not completely sure). I feel that the NC-17 (the tip of the hat to other reviewers) may be more suitable for a slightly more sexual content. (Critics may comment that the movie is just a big excuse to show sex on the big screen.) The plot of this story is very strange, tied the story of an incomplete family together and a group of black people. The stereotypical stereotypes that will appear in different Springer programs At the end of this movie, one story has some edits and rhetoric about the need for us to see the real world. (Obviously seen through his performance) I agree with him. It is important to know how the world is so that we can make positive changes. Having said that, let me tell you - a bad world quickly - in a new report or news to see if But don't spend good money to support the type of excitement and inquiry that Springer tries for us.
