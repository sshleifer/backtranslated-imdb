Should change the name of the movie, it should be "The Jackasses of Hazzard". In conclusion, this movie has nothing but 88 minutes from two immature countries. The 1968 Dodge Charger is famous throughout the city and in the country. Escape the law. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of "Duke" and the thing that makes the film derogatory is that the characters are not important. The stubbornness of vulgarity, sexual references and drug use make the name of "Duke" become a trailer trash. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Beside from the comparison with the list television The only actor who made it right was the 1969 Dodge Charger, another famous General Lee, exaggerating the role of the character that tarnished this movie. <br /> <br /> "Duke" gets damaged again. From the tragedy of changing images from television to Hollywood television in the 21st century, crossing this film and just buying a television series <br /> <br /> My grade: F
