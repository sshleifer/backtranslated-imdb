Blank Check is a movie I saw on TV one day and I like to watch most movies that they broadcast on TV. It's not that good. First of all, no one has ever seen blank checks and that includes those who grew up in the 1990s. Blank checks will not be remembered in the 1900s just because of the fact that it will be obscured by Pixar's movies I will not call Blank Check as a bad movie. But it wasn't fun too (Or at least not for everyone who is over 6 years old). Blank checks are not entertainment movies because there is nothing about it. Everything makes you go "I have never seen this before." Check it out. Tear off and try to cash in everything from Richie to the house alone. (Which oddly enough, both have Macaulay Culkin in it), naked checks, not a bad movie
