Avoid the USA version. It comes with added US videos and the worst voice dubbing you've ever heard, probably done by New York amateurs. The voice overs are so bad that it looks like the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think the black man from Bronx made Chiba's voice. I can't see all the movies that it's so bad. Instead of being an American version like this, see Chiba's other good things, such as The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
