This movie is the longest movie and the record-breaking movie, of course, there are 30 actors after JAANI DUSHMAN (2002). I guess no one has the courage to do something like this. <br /> <br /> Follow movies title Depends on the Kargil war, but the problem is that there are too many characters and romantic subplots and songs of many characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> Even if there is too much freedom in the movie, such as killing someone. There is a knife wondering <br /> <br /> Guided by JP Dutta, BORDER Music's pale face is ok. <br /> <br /> Among the big actors like Ajay Devgan, who stands tall, Saif is very good in his part. His first movie with kareena, Abhishek was pleasant. Manoj Bajpai There was a time when he was Sanju who was destroyed in Suneil. Okay. Akshaye Khanna did the rest well.
