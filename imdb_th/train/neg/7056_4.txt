This movie is a good example of how some jokes may go wrong. I expect at least something from this movie after seeing things that add funny, like hell. But this movie is not good. <br /> <br /> The strange part is really funny jokes. No smoking, Jo Bole ... etc. It's a really good joke, but I don't know who blames the movie. This story failed. <br /> <br /> The most important candidate may be: - 1) Hammer (actor) and hammeresses (actress) and not a joke 2) Director 3) A guy, an actor And / or director. However, if you are really tired and I mean watching Whether this is true or receive copies. Every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh at you because these people are more fun than movies. <br /> <br /> ps The only thing that saves the movie is mahesh manjrekar and chappu bhai.
