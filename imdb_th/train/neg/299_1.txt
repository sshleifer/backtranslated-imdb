This is the third remake of sleeping with enemies after YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996). AGNISAKSHI is the only one that can be effective and a better movie. <br /> <br /> DARAAR is directed by Abbas Mustan, who is sad. Failing their efforts here. <br /> <br /> The story is good. But the management is not good and the heroine shows too bad feelings and disappointing points. <br /> <br /> Bad direction. Good song. <br /> <br /> Rit ishi Ya Na (strange, which is a newly created song of SWTE) and looks too fat for the lead actor and okay. Juhi is too good. In his debut and managed in many scenes to make the audience cool But his voice is too bad Johny is too loud
