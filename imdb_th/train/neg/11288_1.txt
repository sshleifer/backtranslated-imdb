In recent times I have been subjected to this movie and "King Arthur" on DVDs that others choose for "entertainment" in the evening and they do nothing more than the idea. increase Lack of discrimination and content as long as they receive "action". Both films are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> What will happen to character development? What happened to meaningful conversations? What happened to the show And when looking at something that claims to be "History", what happens to trying to measure certain precision, realistic ideas about "Political map" of the time, even the slightest tastes of the era, especially in social attitudes. Why do they have to show America's values ​​set in the 21st century? "Little people who know" in the dark age, otherwise, the number of people who know a lot, with many scholarships in this era But these con artists cannot be disturbed in their homework. <br /> <br /> I wish I could vote 0/10.
