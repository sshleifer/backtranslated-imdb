This performance is not wise. That is something that boils down. "Original humor" that these writers try to pull out to avoid being completely bitten in the rest of the world. Bush bash is just not nasty. In other opinions, people are talking about hilarious lines. The prominence for me is George H. Bush. Tell the children that they shouldn't watch any TV other than Fox News. Wow. I think when I see it badly. The fact that this line is a high point for a pathetic series. <br /> <br /> My problem with magic, like the sad excuse for political satire, is that these people are about to enter. To the second season I am a liberal republic and I know that Bush is not a good president. We all do, but there is no excuse to make the poop waste time. I put these writers at the same level as the genius behind their 'Meet the Spartans' formula, biting funny jokes as never before as much as possible and throwing the original content worse than that for Can write credit really. <br /> <br /> Again, just bad, normal. Unfunny and it makes me more happy that this kind of shit has been renewed. But the amazing and original program, such as Arrested Development, cans after the season three seasons. Please don't watch this shit unless you are one of the green liberal hippies who think that any sentence with Bush and dumb is funny. <br /> <br /> Oh, then Bush's voice is bad. All he did was mimic the slight Texas accent and exhale heavily at the end of his sentence. At least South Park admitted that the sound was wrong. If you want political satire, joke, watch the Daily Show / Colbert, or look for any political figure in Robot Chicken, which is fun to watch because the stop-action animation stop-motion is well done. Look for George Bush as a Jedi on youtube. No fees.
