The previous part of the movie was quite fun. But in the end, it became a tedious story, although Turturro would be the actor I liked, but his Luzhin was similar to Rain Man's impression that was not good. Overall, it seems that this movie will try hard and end Down with a pompous look, even with the most good performances
