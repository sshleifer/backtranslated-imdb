I do not like this movie because it does not present the messages and ideas that L'Engle brought in her novel. We read novels in our English class, and I like it a lot. I'm afraid that I won't say the same for this movie. There is a huge difference between the novel and the modified version, and it is not credited to the genius in the imagination of Madeleine L'Engle! This is the reason I give a bad rating. Do not watch this movie if you are a big fan of L'Engle's texts because you will be very disappointed. However, if you are watching movies for entertainment (Or study like my case) then it's a good movie!
