Vovochka is your hooligan movie in everyday life. The main character Vovochka is branded as a bad influence on children in the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom from two adults, he met all the way. He found that changing his mischievous methods heavily. But should be done Personally, I found that the actor who played Vovochka was too annoying to be sympathetic. However, changing the tone of this movie would make most people feel the emotional struggle that Vovochka had when he wanted to be good. This battle makes the movie a little different from other types of movies. That's a little taste that I mean. Overall, I didn't really care about this, even though it was most likely for younger audiences.
