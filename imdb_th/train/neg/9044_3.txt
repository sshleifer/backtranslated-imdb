I want to like this movie a lot. But it was stolen / borrowed from other jobs - some painfully obvious borrowing A review of The New York Times suggests that their singing frogs are reminiscent of one of the famous Warner Brothers cartoons. ('Hello, my baby, Hello, my dear,' Hello, my girl, ragtime ... ') But I challenge everyone to see the Fox animation feature / Blue Sky Robots (2005) and don't find the laughing similarities. In: Stories - Young inventors grow up and the only innovative company that distributes all the great inventions. <br /> <br /> The cityscape - a very similar camera angle, captures a similar future city environment. /> <br /> I spoke to a lot of ... robots ... <br - robot servant in the household Robinson has a design very similar to the robots and the two films. <br /> <br /> All of this seems to contradict the disgusting words from Disney at the end, which means the company is a solid innovator who never looks back. Also contradicts all their movie catalogs in the 90s that have clones of each other with little tweaks and stories and ethnicities) <br /> <br /> Filmmakers seem to be unable to give stories to speak on their own. And send signals and objects flying in our direction instead Although we didn't care about anything at all, <br /> <br /> The villains are well designed and lively, and they are happy to watch. The rest of the film seems to be thrown together. Some scenery looks like a CGI from the mid-90s. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a classic Mickey Mouse. At the end of this cartoon, we have been warned that Disney has never had any interest in creation or good storytelling. They think that making something on the big screen is enough for them. he
