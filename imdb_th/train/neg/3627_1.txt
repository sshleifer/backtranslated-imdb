I've never been so much for classic movies. Films like Patton, Going My Way, How Green are My Valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Lost with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Citizen Kane gave birth to me. However, I would rather watch one movie 3,469 times at the time. Tied on a chair rather than watching the Americans in Paris once in the most luxurious suites ever If I do the latter, I may sleep all the time. <br /> <br /> Art direction, color and music are not interested in Gershwin or not. Gershwin dancing and singing helps to sleep. The conversation doesn't match Singin 'in the Rain. In general, this movie is boring. The only movie I slept while watching is Butch Cassidy and Sundance. But you can't blame me. I sleep only 5 minutes last night. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (very bad that we can't give it to the center)
