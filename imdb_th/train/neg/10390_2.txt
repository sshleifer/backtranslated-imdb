I just rented and watched this movie to see what all the fuss is. So this is what I respond to. It's easy to see that this is an economical movie with bad performers. The main story of this movie is about women who have been revenge from rapists. This concept, if done correctly, can easily become a provocative movie. However, the movie didn't scare or annoy me at all. It makes me bored This movie can be shortened to no more than 45 minutes. Most scenes are often filled with scenes like those scenery and some scenes that I described below. <br /> <br /> ***** ******* There is a spoiler ***** ******* I found that the rape scene is quite tame. I do not know if I have watched the cut or uncut version. If there is such a version, I still find many vulnerabilities within the plot that is already badly written. This is the item in my heart. <br /> <br /> Why did the rapist not rape Jennifer at night when she walked out of her house to find out what those voices were? That will be a good time. <br /> <br /> Why don't they just rape her instead of slowing some rape for happiness and prolonging Jennifer's test longer? It may be more shocking and disturbing. <br /> <br /> I found it really stupid that the rapist left her in the forest and headed back to her home. May show that these rapists are really stupid people <br /> <br /> These rapists should know at least that if you want to do the right job, they shouldn't send cowards to work. /> <br /> Why did Jennifer finally call the police when the gangster raped? Which should be the first thing that appears in the hearts of most people, especially for those who are writers. <br /> <br /> Why do people rape so they don't get dangerous miles when they see Jennifer still there <br /> <br /> I think it's really amazing that a woman with a slender figure like Camille can pull a guy up. Tree and hang him ************************ Spoiler ends ************ <br /> <br /> But Wait a minute The movie didn't do anything. Camille Keaton was beautiful and I heard one of the funniest lines I had heard when Matthew protested back into the house and killed Jennifer. c ^ m !!! '
