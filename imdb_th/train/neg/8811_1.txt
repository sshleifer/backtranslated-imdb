Spoiler !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched the movie. <br /> <br /> The first reason: boring. Almost nothing happens. Women sit around and talk about how bad their lives are and no hope. They smoke. Weed read magazines, take care of their sick friends and cut the dead bodies from time to time. Boring !!!! <br /> <br /> Second reason: There are many things left without explain Many scenes are devoted to the zombie hunters who kidnapped men, randomly picking them up on a chair and asking. Who are these men? What do they know about illegal activities about people with diseased areas? Why did he kill one person and release another one? <br /> <br /> There is also this guy at first. I think there are still diseases that eat meat. But he put his fist through a wall with superhuman strength What we think at first - never explained! How disappointing? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I found an annoying woman, an amazing story, a boring couple and a non-existent act. The cover image is also misleading because it makes you believe that this movie is cool when it's not clear. I rented this movie from some reviews that others have done on this website and even though I respect the fact that some people might be happy with this flick. But I will make sure I read more than two reviews in the movie. To avoid renting another movie, a story that I regret to see
