The most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is that it is thought that if anyone becomes a saint, he or she and his or her family and others will live forever. We forget that in order to be a saint, the saint must die and the saint will not have any other important people. Nick is an elves Elf to the Scrooge of Fred who has never been mentioned! Let Nick learn how to make toys. Then Fred learns how to use Nick numbers for a sick Dolly kid. Fred has possessed Dolly and his family farm! After another morph episode of the second episode of the third episode, Fred drains his spleen to the brothers, not revealing himself as a nod to his friends. There, I just wrote a story that is stronger than this foolishness. <br /> <br /> This Santa who is "Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho" is away from the large coronary artery, Queen of the Harpies, direct surgery from Mega-Mall Hell and answers the board (huh?), Which just gave Easter Bunny his pink egg. Oh and his right hand is a bitter blonde in mini dresses and shoes. Gokho ... Ho ... Ho ... Ho ... Ho ... Ho! <br /> <br /> But in fact, what I send to the edge is Slam # 1 in the mischievous list. Shouldn't I book Naughty List for Hitlers and Stalins in the future? The child is the true embodiment of evil? Nope, with Old Sausage-Fingers, a good boy who is frantic because he doesn't want and no one loves Demon Seed! <br /> <br /> The nimrods behind Fred Claus should boil in their own pudding! Bah!
