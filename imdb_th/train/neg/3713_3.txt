Down to earth / (2001) * (from the fourth) <br /> <br /> By Blake France: <br /> <br /> "Down to earth" is a misleading comedy. hope The sofas that watch the action of Kris Rock funny on TV seem like heaven. When talking about paradise, this film was made from the 1978 movie "Heaven Can Wait". It is a good movie and is good to show how a group of screenwriters who want to be able to use good materials and turn them into garbage. Director Chris and Paul Weitz missed almost every goal. From the concept of "to the world" narrative fails miserably. This is an incredibly bad production. Chris Rock is a great comedian both in his role in this film and in real life. He plays the role of Lance Barton, his manager (Frankie Faison), feeling sorry for him when he was booed from the stage during the night. Amateur at a local theater. Shortly after the script created his ability, the character would be killed by a speeding truck. Death, played by Eugene Levy, is wrong. Lance before his number goes up. The Lord's assistant (Chazz Palminteri) is very angry and decides to let Lance spend the rest of the world as long as he uses the body of the white millionaire only 60 years old. <br /> <br /> Name The old man is Mr. Wellington, whose life has his own problems. His wife (Jennifer Coolidge) has a relationship with his assistant. (Gregg Mann), who robbed his money But it's okay because Lance in Mr. Wellington falls in love with a black woman named Sontee (Regina King). At the same time, plans to kill Wellington, Lance, try to make the body better and Sontee is confused by the situation of the hospital related to finance. Your Wellington <br /> <br /> "To the world" has some good ideas. But they are in a story that is pointless and unbelievable love that is full of artifacts and recycled materials. The biggest problem found is the way we look at Lance as Mr. Wellington. Chris Rock is a famous actor and publisher, so he won't go away from this movie. Every character sees a new Lance as Mr. Wellington. But we see him as Chris Rock Convenient for love stories We believe that a girl will fall in love with Lance. But actually he is an old man with gray hair <br /> <br /> The situation of a funny cartoon that should be watched by an old man makes a joke that blacks do. But what inspired Laughter was that when the characters ran into the conflict without them knowing, just looking at "Something about Mary" in the comedy scene, the characters would experience a pleasant experience. Embarrassed and did not meet their wishes Lance knew he was in the body of an old man and did things that the old man wouldn't do. If Lance does not know that his body is in it, there may be potential. <br /> <br /> Another problem of the concept: We have never known you Wellington since the beginning, so how do we compare Lance with him? The body when we don't know what he is. At first, Chris Rock must be the center of attention here and make the character like rock too. He recited a simple routine that was boring and painful. His conversation is clear and straightforward. I hate the humor of this movie. There are many jokes and many horrifying cartoon situations. It's like watching Chris Rock as Chris Rock, not a movie character. <br /> <br /> We focus on being positive in "Down to Earth". Mark Addy doesn't do anything worse than he did in " The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas "Eugene Levy and Chazz Palmentari are good actors. But they were at the mercy of the script that scalped All of this is a great feature that I can talk about at this time, and if you give me a week to remember it is unlikely that
