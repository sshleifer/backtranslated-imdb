Almost as boring as when reading a book in the evening is a magnificent failure ... until Meryl Streep approached and showed her other members quietly how to do this. Vanessa Redgrave was shocked in her role when Ann died and Claire Denes was zero. Maybe if Vanessa and Claire change the role, we may see the vibrations in Ann that makes her enter the rare world of the story and we may imagine that Ann, who is dying <br /> <br /> I hope that adding Michael Cunningham to writing credits will make the storytelling even more scary. It makes my head ache
