May be the worst new movie ever created. <br /> <br /> Funny stories, they're not funny. Used from other movies and simple but with bad performances, even though there are great actors. <br /> <br /> The story is not interesting and boring. There are more cheese and then pizza people in the cottage People like 1,000 times before cheese. <br /> <br /> I watched this when it came out on TV. But it is very boring to stand for only 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie sucks <br /> <br /> Don't watch it. <br /> <br /> Look at the color dry instead.
