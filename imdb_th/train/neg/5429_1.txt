The movie begins with a good song, looks like a thriller with Arbaaz Khan walking around suspiciously. But suddenly we were forced to perform comedy with stupid stupid genders such as GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal acting like an older child Their scenes are quite funny first and then bored with the boring subplot of Tanushree's brother who was killed in the end. The movie tries to take seriously the villains to kidnap our heroes. But here it's even more perplexed by HERA PHERI and waiting. There is also a long chase in Payal's house. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring, causing you to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> The direction by which Priyan is a terrible song (Pritam) is a daily routine, except for the first song. <br /> <br /> The bad movies, the movies are cheap. <br /> <br /> Rajpal Yadav is good in the first scene. He he paid for rent And I was happy that the actors were not as loud and superior as any other movie, but neither did he become his normal character and was mostly irritated. Tusshar should not speak in the movie, delivering the telephone line of He is terrible. Sharman is a saving grace. He is the only actor who has performed very well in this film. Kunal Khemmu, an animated film as an adult. But not very impressive. Tanushree is bad. As always, Arbaaz Khan has less scope and is usually Payal as a non-Murli Sharma actor.
