Feeding The Masses is just another movie that is trying to make money from the zombie craze that arises mainly from the popularity of movies such as Land Of The Dead and Resident Evil. <br /> <br /> Beginning at a television station protected by the military and reported that The Lazarus Virus (zombies) are close to the detention center and the city will soon have the freedom to do their business again. The problem is that this is all wrong. Zombies are working rampantly and only a few people are aware. Among them is Torch (William Garberina), camera man, Sherry (Rachael Morris), young woman anchor. (There are some reasons that play Shelly on this website) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), their escort soldiers (Or other government agencies) and they were heavily censored. <br /> <br /> This film makes himself slap behind. The cover box says "We hold a mass feed at a higher level than the three movies. 'The Death' by George A. Rombero "The source of the speech loses all my credibility I don't mean the worse I expected (I clearly see that.) But I mean the badness that I can't find the redemption feature in any movies. The performances in that part are either finished or made of wood too. Has anyone remembered their line or they read out the queue card? I can't think of what the best part of this movie is or the best actor / actor. No one really If I had to nod to someone, I would say Roger military escort might be the most interesting character. But that didn't say much. <br /> <br /> I would have to suggest passing this movie. Even with a box cover that looks quite good (It's what makes me watch movies) 3/10
