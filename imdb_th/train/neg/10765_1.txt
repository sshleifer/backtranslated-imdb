A wonderful example of how Hollywood can (And still do) bring the masterpiece of literature to compose and do shocking things <br /> <br /> In the case of "Big Sky" writer Dudley Nichols and the company can improve from the novel The classic pioneer by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Guthrie. In doing so, they eliminate the spirit of the story and any consequences that may arise from the film adaptation. <br /> <br /> Great nature The Great Book of Guthrie and The evolution of the main character, Boone Caudill, from innocent children, Kentucky State, is a strong and talented mountain survivor / man, replaced by a comedy cruise on a downsizing river that is similar to Author's intent In the movie version, the presence of Boone is nothing more than a surprise. <br /> <br /> An interesting and shocking element that has the effect and excitement in Guthrie's novel. Was removed without any reason. The most confusing thing was to focus on the character of Zeb Calloway, a small character in the book, just occupying a number of pages. On the other hand, the important and interesting characters like the veteran pioneer Summ Summers are gone !!! Obviously, the director of the Hawks decided the character Zeb in the movie, played by actor Hunnicutt, was not annoying enough, so Zeb / Hunnicutt received a lot of time in describing the narrative voice that was a shortcut to Horowitz. Hollywood for screen writing, incompetence, editing and direction. <br /> <br /> Some movies are actually updated. Reference book (William Willer "Ben Hur" is a great example) but this thing is scary and dreadful. But is a modification of the novel <br /> <br /> The story is boring and lamenting and the characters - at least the unedited characters of the script - are just a shallow and boring shadow of the literary vision. Guthrie's And unfortunately, the appeal of Kirk Douglas, which should help raise the film, has been given the role of the milktoast he received. <br /> <br /> If you can believe, Puluth's movie has won the pool. Littler from Guthrie, the sequel "The West West" starring Kirk is getting worse. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Big Sky" makes Howard Hawks' place stronger. Cinema history
