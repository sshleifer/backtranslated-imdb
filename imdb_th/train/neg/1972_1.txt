This is not true for justice. It started out badly with images from explorers around the world, and Blind Willie McTell (or blind Jeff Jeff Jefferson, the next blind person) clearly explained the story from space. Monotonous, which may be the most interesting part of this documentary After that, the only thing that was seen as a performer who played mercilessly classical music, filmed in the 20s, disguised between black and white with people like Beck and Shemia Copeland, the same song This is a great device to show us why the old blues are really good. But it doesn't make the look interesting There is nothing in this place that can hardly prove to be a movie and not a radio program. No one should be forced to see these bad reactions. It's a shame for Wanderers Scorsese and especially with the blues. Avoid all costs.
