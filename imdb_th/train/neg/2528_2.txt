The van is a movie that feels good about a guy trying to seduce a woman into his new van to seduce them. The only thing that this movie did not fail was to paint the van in the United States precisely in the late 1970s. It is trash But I really like it! I must admit that I am a fan of the 70s trash! Hope this will make it at the lowest level of IMDB 100! <br /> <br /> 2
