Usually I am a kind-hearted critic. But in the case of this movie, I have to say that it's terrible. I'm shocked by the best criticism that seems to be possible. <br /> <br /> There are some beautiful pictures. But it was too bad that they lost to this movie It may be used if "Dagger" is a flick, action and not love. Unfortunately, this film was built around a love triangle. There is no chemical between any couples. The thing that exists between Mei and her people seems to have more desires than love and most conversations are stupid. This may be just a problem with translation. But the use of the word "buck" often reminds me of grade 8, not the heel-to-heel combination, forever worth it to die for love. I felt that we were beaten by the wind parable. The audience will receive very little about the characters that are really interested, and therefore the emotional investment in the movie as a whole is very small. I want the remote to control quickly. I was knocked in my seat ready to snore. But mostly I just cringed a lot. <br /> <br /> ******* Spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Now Icing on the cake. Or add insult to injury The ending is one of the most scary and laughing things I've ever seen. The boys are fighting stag and screaming, shouting and hacking each other. Oh, then the snow started randomly. Oh, then Mei (the dagger in my heart) suddenly appeared from the weeds. Then she threw a dagger that seemed to take about 5 minutes to reach the destination. Wow, cool. <br /> <br /> Okay, then Mei finally dies. In her chest Jin sings a sobbing, holding her near the screen is empty. Me and the people around me are chuckling. It's not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Can see, but eventually it is a failure.
