I happened to this flick on a rainy Sunday and intended to compose other songs. From curiosity, I read the comments here and found myself watching it until the end. I didn't intend to do it - this is one of the movies you "fascinated" and watched it for. "For a few minutes" until you see it until the end And the indictment of it in most of these comments makes it more interesting The only opinion that people really like seems to be the result of Ladd and Spano's passion and their previous role. But the good cannot be found anywhere here - stories, performances and especially the ridiculous courtroom We all know that Perry Mason (Before Raymond Numbers passed the 300 pound mark) and Benmotlock was allowed to sail around the courtroom instead of being bored with the teacher. And especially Matlock has the privilege to visit the exhibition frequently, just go to the jury and show them before the judge and prosecutor are notified or shown to them. There are no judges or prosecutors in real life who will stand for this. <br /> <br /> Both Perry and Ben almost end the prosecution by confessing to be a true murderer. In fact, Perry did this almost all the time. But often Matt Lock will show clear evidence that he is the real culprit. "Reasonably suspicious" then let the police and prosecutors prosecute the guilty party - sometimes on the camera At the end of the show, <br /> <br /> But that said the movement of Holland Taylor and the amount of distance paid to her in the courtroom of this story made Matlock / Mason's actions similar. With slow and boring details, as seen on TV Court and in the courtroom in real life. <br /> <br /> Not all characters in this presentation are boring Nasty, boring or boring? As impossible Of these things, <br /> <br /> The ending is the most boring, ridiculous and ridiculous conclusion possible - but again, fascinating because of this Ladd and Spano are attractive people and t.v movies will appear as the best right hand - probably the best in Chapter 2, leading (probably better if there are "3 -") even in this place. Taylor can play the role of aunt or mother of one of them. Give 1 star for this story / show and 3 more for charming factors.
