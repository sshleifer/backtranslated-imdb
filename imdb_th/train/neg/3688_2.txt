As usual, I watched this movie for A.R.Rahman. Otherwise, this movie is not good. Rajni wants to finish his film career with this movie that it will be successful. But luckily, or unfortunately, this movie failed After that, he forwarded with Chandramukhi. I was eager to wait for Shivaji to arrive. <br /> <br /> I read the opinions of other users about Rajni. I found it interesting because users came from. TN too. I think Rajni is one of the actors who acted from his heart, not from his thoughts. He is not an actor like Kamal Hasan. I think we have to thank Rajni for his strength as his age. <br /> <br /> In any way, I have to fill 10 lines for this comment .. . .....
