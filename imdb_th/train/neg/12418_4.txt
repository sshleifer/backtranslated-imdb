I saw this movie now, not when it was released and regarded as the best image of the year in Israel. And to summarize everything, I will now say: This is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is Dror Shaul's second feature film and I have to admit that the first movie and the story he did earlier. this This picture is much better. Moreover, this is his first attempt to direct the drama. Early works are comedies and funny and effective. <br /> <br /> The first thing you need to know is that you will see a movie. This story or not: Israel in the 21st century hated Kibbutz and the values ​​shown. Formation of the State of Israel The true situation of the Israelites is very bad and some people disappear one by one. The Hebrew Hebrews for the public are the only village for members, whose values ​​of equality and socialism are principles for everyday life. By changing social values ​​over time, it seems that Israel is now the place where the souls of human beings are trapped in the laws of faith without tickets. The entrance of capitalist values ​​and way of life in the 90s and made it very difficult to survive in Israel. The crazy mother in this movie is the main metaphor for that. <br /> <br /> But I think this movie is not related to the nostalgia for the good yesterday of the Israelites. At one time it was the dream of every young couple to live in Kibbutz and raise their children in this beautiful and beautiful environment. But this movie shows the opposite That Israelis and socialism are places like madmen with crazy ideas that undermine individual freedom within the group This is the central philosophy of modern capitalism: your differences are the most important. You have to put your body in the center and there is no one other than you. This is the philosophy that this film holds and that is just the first sin. <br /> <br /> If you don't agree with me in politics, I'm sure you'll agree with the sound of the movie. It is a script and the direction is the four sins that follow. This film has no real message and no shock what is to be remembered. It is also "Delicate" is a delicacy that is no more than an artistic effort that will cause emotions that do not appear in the movie and not to the audience. It brings boredom. <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain? Why this movie won many awards? Probably because it shows that Israel is aligned with the rest of the world. Hate socialism and human values? Or maybe it shows that Israel is the place "Delicate" does not give up on behaviorism Essentially, we are human beings and good people with emotional abilities, especially when they are counterfeits, as well as capitalism that we expect to be? Or perhaps because it is one of the greatest lies of Israeli movies in recent years, a lie that destroys the legitimacy of the existence of a Jewish state? No matter what the answer is, it's not good at all. Not for the world, not for human values, and not for Jews
