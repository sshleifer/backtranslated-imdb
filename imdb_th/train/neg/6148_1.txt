First of all, this movie is not true with facts. I just saw a documentary a few days ago and this movie is not like that. First of all, Nash is a mathematical genius, and this is what this movie should not be about the story of a lost man and find love at the end. There are also many unusual scenes - the scenes that he rode around with the bike that the university happened in the early years of the university, not later. In my opinion, Russell Crowe does not fit this part because he doesn't look smart / individual, so he can't play at all. It would be good if it focused more on mathematics (similar to Pi) and not a true love. At this level, ABM is Hollywood-ish and is too shallow to be great. Personally, I think he is not crazy or paranoid, and he enters something from someone who has the ability to know more than us "little man" 5/10
