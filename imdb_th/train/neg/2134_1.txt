With this actor and budget, you will expect more. <br /> <br /> John Cusack created a number of movies that surrounded the strange story but still works. Both he, his sister, and Sirben could not do anything to save the parody of badly written junk. <br /> <br /> The film is nothing more than a joke and the poor at that time. Where does the plot go? Writing has no conscious planning and some paper characters. If you think that the movie is three-dimensional, the story and the characters bring the depth of the image, this scent is flattened like Mickey Steamboat. <br /> <br /> Dan Akroyd's presence in This story makes other people's memories a truly scary movie, nothing in 1991, but a straightforward problem. This movie is a type of project that kills a career and gets a shooting agent.
