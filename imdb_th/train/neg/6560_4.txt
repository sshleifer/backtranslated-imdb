"Shadrach" is not the type of movie I like. I found that emotions were too sensitive and the performances were substandard. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell did well but some other actors didn't believe I still do not believe that Paul's parents will leave and leave him with the Dabney family, especially when they have housewives living in the house. Their social classes are too far to consider this belief. It seems that Dabney's way of life is beyond reality. There is one scene in the beginning of the movie that shows that Andie MacDowell leaves the car after having sex with someone. Who is it? Her son? What scenes should show us? Why is it included? It has no relation to the rest of the movie, and in fact, never talking about it anymore. It looks worthless and is not suitable for the story. There are too many inconsistencies in the movie for me. The story about Shadrach is good, but I don't believe that Dabneys will be kind and generous as they show.
