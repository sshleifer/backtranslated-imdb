Why am I always doing this for myself? I mean, it's really there in the name - "The Incredible Melting Man". What else do I expect? I have to admit that I am a person who likes to suck everything I find in Monster HD, but the only feature of this picture is the truly extraordinary makeup by Rick Baker. The head and the old man with his old pair sucked the lemon before igniting the fire. Now they are really scary. <br /> <br /> What I can't understand in horror is that the victim of a monster doesn't just run away when faced with virtual destruction. Like chicks in the cabin Did you know that there is a door that can be seen completely in the kitchen, where she can run out all the time? Steve-O is incredibly unable to gather more than a fast walk, so why not just blow him? I don't know. I might miss something. <br /> <br /> This flick has some sense of 'Tales From The Crypt', but 'Tales' usually has a cool or bizarre appearance that often you don't. See This is an image that you can't manage. For example, in the first scene, you can clearly distinguish between Melting Man's eyes from his head, so how can he handle the rest of the story? I guess we shouldn't ask <br /> <br /> At eighty-four minutes, this picture takes about an hour and a half too long. When it ended, I was ready to accept General Perry's previous proposal - "I can use the drink now."
