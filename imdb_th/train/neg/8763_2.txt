I think I read somewhere that this is the last production of a monogram, but whether it's true or not, it's not important because if it's not, it should be. It is a tedious tale starring John Carradine with some gray hair to make himself look like an old scientist who is experimenting with the help of his young pupil. Every time they revive the subjects, they seem to have a marble-like white face as they are tied to the experiment table (big story). Carradine manages to return his faithful dog to life after it. Dead and mutt received unusual ability to walk through walls in a spooky way (wooooooooohohhhh) That's all she wrote. <br /> <br /> For the cheap monk Ganesha, at least this thing actually uses a more fancy laboratory setting. The most funny joke in the movie is Dr. Carradine, "older than" said continuously, "Young assistant" Shane, as "m'boy". In fact, Carradine is 40 and Shane is 45
