I saw this film at the Rotterdam Film Festival (Jan 06) and followed the conversation between director and public after that. Many responded with shock and protest. He will receive a lot of negative criticism, but: The world is cruel like this and it's not a joke. People don't like it. That doesn't mean that this movie is bad. I see that difference. Don't shoot the messenger that shows us the outside world of our 'Hubble'! However, I think this is a bad movie. Technically film, it is good. Shock and good script, the most suitable songs, excellent actors. The director pretended to be a psychology-psychological movie with poor quality. Explaining the powerful violence is not art. Art is a powerful explanation of the psychological process behind violence. How can a shy boy come to this cruelty? The director pretended to explain that - but not that good. <br /> <br /> The director uses the word 'Selfishness' of people many times only: This teacher is not self-centered - just someone in many ways, taking care of his students and worrying about his script. I think it's easy to call him selfish. The atmosphere in the village is creepy and the mother makes a terrible mistake. ('You make me worse') but it's unbelievable for me that it causes a lot of pain. Such terrible things In fact, the truth is too complex to explain. And need a much better explanation What is interesting is how it works. Explain that process to me so that we can understand <br /> <br /> with a written phrase at the end. The director said that pointing to alternative ways of life. It's another extremity and confirmed for me that the director and playwright are bad psychologists, promoting black / white thinking. The connection between violence in movies and in society has been proven. The use of such violence will make the responsibility of using it right. There are enough black / white thinkers in the world causing many wars and misery. I hope this film will not succeed.
