To be honest, I heard that it was quite bad before I decided to watch. But I never let others influence my view. In fact, I tend to watch something out of resistance! Bullwhip has one thing that will make me look before. The fact that Rhonda Fleming and those beautiful eyes were in it, I was immediately interested. The picture is not very good, and in fact, morally dubious, every character is damaged and has a unique shape. Every image is inspired by greed or auspicious victory. This is good and good. All around can do justice to a group of people who are disgusting and create great vibrations. Sadly, it's not possible, and at the last moment you add sugar to your eyes, you can't help you being cheated in watching bad movies. No one in the group of actors comes along with any credit. > <br /> Not even cute Rhonda can make me recommend this to everyone. 3/10
