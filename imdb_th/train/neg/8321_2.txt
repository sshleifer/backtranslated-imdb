Hayden Christianson and Jessica Alba, two of my least favorite actors in this century team, in what may be a flattering effort to create terrifying effects. The Butterfly Effect The alertness is boring and unattractive. You can sleep better. Terrance Howard is still recovering from the brutal August August causing a proper fight as a sadistic doctor who looks like hell to kill Christianson and after watching his performance, I /> <br /> good to help, Alba still recovering <br after Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer. Is a natural and unstable disaster as she had been She had only once been in the hands of safe director Robert Rodriguez in the city of Xin. It is possible that Jessica Alba is not as poor as the actors as much as giving her credit, and it may be that her acting ability looks worse by a poor chapter. If so, it will be explained Something that has an embarrassing script of plan 9 from outside the world. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba, Hayden Christensen and Terence Howard are the stars in the director. / The first screenwriter Those who suffer with the horrific general surgical phenomenon known as "Aesthetics Awareness", which is placed on the surgical table, remains aware of what is happening around him, even when completely paralyzed and unable to request help. When a successful young man (Christensen) had to fall under the knife and realized that anesthesia did not do his job at all, the horror began when his wife (Alba) waited. Enthusiasm and terrifying drama <br /> <br /> Hope to make an action schedule in the final destination with the plane. The first attempt from director Joby Harold pivots on the coldness of blood. The first credit order tells us one of 700 people suffer from a phenomenon called 'Anesthetic awareness' in which the patient remains conscious But was paralyzed during surgery This unfortunate person is Clayton Beresford Jr (Hayden Christensen) who finds himself awake during heart transplantation ... and he can feel every single piece. <br /> <br /> Invent periodically according to His torture The mind is awake, failing to inject real fear in an exotic place. Spinning from the cold simplicity to the ridiculous conspiracy, it is interrupted by the flattering turns from Christensen and Jessica Alba. You hope you will pose a sedative before watching. <br /> < br /> Verdict: Waking up is the best that you don't want. Films with no piercing holes that look no doubt better on paper. As a movie, though, it's very common and has been very much received. Awakening, unable to inject fear into a new place The result is a real punch. Alba and Christian are your least concerned, because the main flaw of the movie is in the absence of fearing the audience. Awake is a movie that you often sleep.
