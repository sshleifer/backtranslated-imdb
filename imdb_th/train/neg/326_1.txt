The first Adam Sandler movie can be compared to his life as a cartoon at the same time. In 1989, his character was constantly recognized for his genius comedy. This film has nothing compared to his documentary films, such as Big Daddy or even Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler has not found a way to express himself in a consistent and successful manner when the film is built like His drama Most of the movie "Comedy" comes from Sandler, who has a conversation with himself, often beyond the ability of an unknown cartoon and dancing himself because he's too ugly and can't get a woman. This movie also seems difficult because it doesn't treat itself like a real movie. Sandler spoke to cameras and audiences throughout the film, which often cited low budget or suspicious content. Finally, this film is awkward and appealing. I wanted to forget once I watched this movie after it ended because I feared that if I knew more about this, it would destroy Sandler's career. Go through this one at the video store. I rent it for free and it's still a waste of time.
