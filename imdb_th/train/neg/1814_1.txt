All these inspectors are the point. I've seen bad movies many years ago. Believe me and this beats a lot! <br /> <br /> This is not just "bad. It's good." The exploit is a waste of time. But is genuine, hilarious The cruelty of the movie <br /> <br /> Check out the white furry creatures! <br /> <br /> Soak yourself at the performance of "Christopher-weaving" of Thom Christopher <br /> <br /> Space in SHEER A ** E-CLENCHING DISBELIEF! At threadbare set! <br /> <br /> This is one of the "European co-production" is not surprising that we have many wars. I swear some people who are involved in 'The Wizard of the Lost Kingdom' doesn't really know that they will appear in the movie! <br /> <br /> Truth! Originally I watched this movie at HTV Wales one night while suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation. I have to follow the copy a few weeks later to make sure that it is really bad. It is more than Lee Major in the movie The Norman. It's more ridiculous than John Derek's movie. This is Citizen Kane of Trash. Truly
