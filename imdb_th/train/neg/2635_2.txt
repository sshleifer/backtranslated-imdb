I am happy to endure many things from action movies in the late spring / summer, but in general it is due to the fact that most of them have a reasonable payment. (Such as excellent special effects, Steve Buscemi, etc.). However, this movie does not have this thing. All we get is the cheap excitement for many minutes of the breakup of Eva Longoria (Maxim's problem is cheaper than movie tickets). There is a lack of embarrassing planning, suspense, story, reverse, character development, continuity, etc. I Will be specific But quite frankly, I can - forget most movies. <br /> <br /> Throughout my time in the theater, I'm kicking myself, not just spending the afternoon watching 24 seasons DVDs, saving your money. With this person Unless you really like the cleavage of Eva Longoria
