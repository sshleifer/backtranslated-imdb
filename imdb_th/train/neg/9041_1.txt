I like this movie a lot, even if it's crazy. But I do not appreciate the opinion that Canada was called Montana North. It is certainly not Montana North and will never be possible. Americans wonder why they are regarded as arrogant in the rest of the world and that is one reason to stop teaching children in the United States to think they are the world owners. This world-centered view has not become one of the great countries of the world. Even in jokes I will not refer to the United States as 'Alberta South'. Walt will not disappoint us, so why start now? In addition, this movie looks ridiculous and good luck next time.
