The Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedy I've ever seen. They have a way to produce the easiest comedy they can do for the oldest and easily violated audience. For CBC, it means 85-year-old farmer in Saskatchewan. The joke is all predictable and is lame. I can't believe it. The show is very messy and has already acted. But I do not blame the actors because those three-dimensional characters are probably what CBC requested and demanded. Very funny performances that are not good. They try to present a "controversial". Well, it is less controversial than other boring CBC comedies such as the 22-minute hour, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's Report.
