At the beginning of the movie, shooting beautiful pictures and scenes of foxes is amazing. However, the story is very slow and boring. Then the little girl started raising foxes which led to the tragedy. We live in the forest and often see foxes. One thing everyone should know is that you let the wild animals be wild and enjoy it from a distance. This film is a terrifying example for children to watch in trying to make wild animals become pets. I do not know what the subject matter should be. Even after the terrible incident with the main fox, the little girl still wants to play with the set. Did she ever learn her lesson? And there are other scenes that contain predators in foxes, which add to the trauma to children who watch this movie only What is this movie disappointing? And it is very scary The last conversation that was described was very stupid when it came to my wife and I screaming at the TV! I absolutely hate this movie and will not recommend anyone to know!
