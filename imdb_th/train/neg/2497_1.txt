The only problem with this website is that you cannot give negative points. In addition, friends voted that this is a grade D movie. I said he was too good. A piece of wood can show more emotions than the actors in this film and the money used to create this movie should be a better fire. This is certainly a terrible thing in the 2-hour life that everyone who has endured bloodshed is not going to return after 5 minutes. Is this fun anymore? Half of the carto and 151 bottles later, finally I found that this G grade serves funny from a distance. It is an insult to the whole world that the director thinks that more people can find things that are useful from this thing. And for the actors in this flick, I hope you get a good return on this joke because I wonder if you will work again. In summary, I upgraded everyone in this movie to 100 grand and 12 demerit points from your acting license.
