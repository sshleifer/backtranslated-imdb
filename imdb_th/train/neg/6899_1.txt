Ever wondered why Pacific Islanders seem to have automatic humor of black Americans? Regardless of their origin This movie will not have an answer to the question that is often contemplated. But it will give you a wonderful case study. <br /> <br /> From the attack of this film, it acts as "Old School" for Pacific Islanders of New Zealand Which immediately raises the question of what is the point of the work Is it meant to extend the time of the plan of the New Zealand Pacific Island? Or it intends to take advantage of this potential market The story is weak, funny, without humor and is expected to end. This film doesn't do anything for New Zealand's theaters because it's just a romantic comedy movie that doesn't do anything.
