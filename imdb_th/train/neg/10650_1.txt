No doubt that this movie is the worst horror movie I've ever seen. And that is a very talkative story considering that I have seen stinkers such as Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane and Bloody Murder (which is the last second). My username Sometimes there is nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slap. For this film, the opening scene in which a woman is cast in a tanning booth does not seem to have any effect on the movie, especially because the movie can't tell you that this event occurred 2 years before the rest of the movie. The show does not exist, and most of the photography is about women who contract in spandex. The police is the only actor who has faced the most rock I've ever seen. However, the best / worst part of this movie must be a murder weapon. Giant safety pins! What are they thinking? Who is the killer? "Huggies" employees who are not satisfied? I have to give this movie as a center as a whole. But damn if i don't have a bomb
