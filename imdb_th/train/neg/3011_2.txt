I am very excited to see this film, anticipating a field trip about the beauty of art and nature that consists of wisdom similar to "Rivers and currents" However, that's not what I received. But I get an unfair movie about the human industry that is bad for nature. Which is clearly an unorthodox claim And frankly, the image that is not impressive and according to the "artist" scale is the basis of what makes something beautiful. For those who want to feel better about their environmental consciousness ... but not for those who want to think about the complexity of the problems around.
