This movie really shows the age of it. The print I saw was terrible due to age. But it is possible to have a better print job However, this is not the main problem of the movie. The problem is that although this film was created in 1933, it was a silent movie with only scattered dialogue. (Only a few sentences) in the movie in the most amateur form Sometimes the back of the character is flipped, or they are talking with their hands on their faces - all in a poor attempt to hide their lips and "split" (?) Hide the truth. That this movie was dubbed It is true that this Czech film must be dubbed in many languages, but doing this is stupid and clear. It really looks cheap. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film looks cheap and nonsense Although it is really embarrassing because there is a good story - a girl who is married to an old man who is gay and / or doesn't care about women. But in the 21st century, only a handful of people were willing to do this outdated thing. Although there are only a few glitteres of nakedness (And rather fat) Hedy Lamarr. It's not worth all the difficulties that came with the movie when debuting, even in 1933. The standard of this movie is a fool who doesn't do well. About the only interesting thing about this film is to see how Lamarr was different in 1933 compared to the image that Hollywood created when she came to America - she looked like two people. Totally different Movies that are technically incomplete and inferior. I don't see how critically acclaimed it is. For technical problems alone, movies can't rate 10 or anything near
