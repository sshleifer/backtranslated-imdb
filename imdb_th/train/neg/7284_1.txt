Wow. I read about this movie and it sounds so scary that I have to watch it and gosh. I can smell in St. Louis. Where do I start? Lamphun National tried to follow up 5 years later from the success of Animal House, but they missed the important point entirely. I will go in chronological order with these short flicks. <br /> <br /> Short film # 1 <br /> <br /> Poor Peter Riegert (merit from Animal House) Obviously he didn't return. Came to work again, so the children in the National Lampoons called the name and said "Hey, we're making a movie about ppy. Wanna be in there?" Peter is like. "Well, I didn't do much today, why not?" He is a great character on Animal House, but he can't carry this tragic short flop for 5 minutes. <br /> < br /> possible spoilers Leaving him, she must find herself It's too strange that they are happily married. So he chased her out there. She went and Cooper cared for the children. This route led him to burn down the house, causing many children to lose and sleep with bimbos in New York (including Diane Lane) from The wife returned to need children and the movie ended by turning the coin to decide the fate of the children. The idea was quite clever. But the director stopped still Every character looks like they are sleeping. They get the drug. Sorry. Boon, your inheritance tarnished when you failed. <br /> <br /> Short film # 2 <br /> <br /> Spoiler More <br /> <br /> Enter Dominique Corsaire. Pretty, young, just finished college, not sure what to do with her life. So she became a slut, began to lie around with many rich people, received their money when they died, and she didn't stop until she was the most powerful man in the world, Fred Willard, US). It's a joke again, and even though I am happy at Corsaire (Ann Durderbury in real life), I am not afraid to show everything. But her performance is terrible <br /> <br /> The short film # 3 <br /> <br /> I can't believe how far I do. This is a rookie police officer (Robby Benson) with Stan Nagurski veteran (Richard Widmark). Falcone is an innocent child, thinking that he can help people, even if he is abused after being fired thousands Nagurski actually just stopped interested. He watched the assault, assault, your name and did not intervene. He thought the world was a mess and he might be sued if he did anything. Even Christopher Lloyd (At the end of the taxi's run) also proceeded to allow the police to call him to commit a crime. But there are his lawyers there to protect him May God protect America !! <br /> <br /> Again, it may be a joke. But there is no energy at all. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi are ashamed of the name of this schlock. I think the writing is not bad. The idea is there. But the operation was pulled out as well as the rescue efforts in the Iranian hostage crisis If I had been part of this movie, I would want to delete my name. It's scary. Then again, that's why I watched it. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this garbage is Dr. John scored the movie. For over an hour and a half Show this in the movie class with topics "What you shouldn't do in creating a movie" This script should be placed on the shelves, because yes, it's terrible.
