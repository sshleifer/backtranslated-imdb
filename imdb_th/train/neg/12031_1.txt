First of all, this movie is not a joke. If you don't really force yourself, you can't almost laugh. Secondly, the movie is slow and boring. The show is not bad, but not special. There is a Lucky Luke cartoon about two families. (One with a big nose and another big ear) fighting each other in a small town ... you'll laugh more if you read this instead of wasting time with movies, religion and dogmas. Well and this film doesn't do much more than confirm this rule. There is a similar joke, '' Teacher of the house ''; This is a good time. My final comment is: Don't waste your time and money on watching this movie that is not boring and boring.
