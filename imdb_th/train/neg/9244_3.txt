One can deal with historical inaccuracies. But this movie is too much In practice, there is nothing close to the truth, and even in those days it was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> To protect Ford, it was revealed in an old talk show. Told him by his true-to-life Wyatt Earp, who had already shown himself in his own style How do other historians claim that Wyat himself claimed that it was premeditated? <br /> <br /> This film Man and his brothers as well History does not say whether they are or not. Most people like to insert deception and disorder into their characters. But that is not new The truth seems to be closer to them because the law is something that is practiced in a wrong way. Men who see it as a career and believe me in the old west, you don't have time to think too much. The arrest that did not make this movie weak It was weakened by adults who did not create reliable documents. He may be the worst choice for Doc, but at the same time we have to remember that the older movies came closer to the era and closer to the feeling of truth. In the end, Ford received information directly from Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> In addition, it was reduced by all predictable events related to Mexican girls. Hollywood is a Nazi professional in those days, and is ready to kill women with brown hair in a very predictable way to show support for Hitler's idealism. This happened in most movies until the age of eighty. It doesn't have excuses and makes art worse. <br /> <br /> Actors playing Earps do well and Brennan is always excited. In fact, adults may be the only disadvantage of this flick show. Still, it is the weakest point of the old OK Corral movie.
