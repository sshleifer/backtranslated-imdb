I will keep this short, because this kind of movie does not deserve a full review. <br /> <br /> From the setting, this movie may be really special, maybe "28 days later". Or even "Blair Witch Project" <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes of the movie that I am really excited about, the director acts well with movies and suspicion. Although I do not think he can handle the real madness of the empty London Underground, <br /> <br /> The characters are terrible. Our "heroine" in this movie is nonsense and You don't care whether she will die or not. As many have said before, I am deeply rooted for the homeless and the black people who manage me to laugh or two (whether or not the intent of the writer) is kept in Darkness in the first half of the movie But when he revealed, I was really disappointed. I will not spoil But just saying that my 10-year-old sister might beat him in a wrestling match. <br /> <br /> All of this is just a horror movie that falls into the trap of tracking. Simple Hollywood formula. This movie has many potentials. <br /> <br /> Just to emphasize how weak the film is, the characters in this movie have at least five times to finish and kill the main villain.
