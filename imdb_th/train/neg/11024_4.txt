I saw this movie for the first time in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were resolved by the Audit Committee. But in Poland in 2000, how do I see it in complete form? This plot is not incredibly smart - 2 men survived a genetic disaster and found themselves on a world full of strong women, basic and violent women. Now the men try to fight it, followed by a group of stupid clich√©s that follow - sex - drives the constant desire of male males for women to show like a complete fool. (You may agree with them or not) and so on. Jerzy Stuhr's performance is bizarre and bizarre. He just pulls a strange face and speaks a sentence like "I was in the elevator with a naked chick and I didn't do anything to you!" This is the purpose to be a joke. But turns into a joke filled with predictable jokes and things below the waist Don't waste time on it - it's terrible.
