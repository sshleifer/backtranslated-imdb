I like the images of the 30s and 40s in the movie. I love Salma Hayek. I'm more than ready to love this picture, but .. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! <br /> <br /> No No, there is nothing good about this. The only entertainment for me is the character of Colin Farrell, an insecure writer and screenplay. Despite the mismanagement of racism No, it seems that he "is acting" is Sutherland and his minutes are a little <br /> <br /> The old-fashioned way of getting tired.
