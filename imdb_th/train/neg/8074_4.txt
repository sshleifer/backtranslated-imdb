Like relatives who give you bad gifts. Soul Survivors have a heart in the right place. But traveling with a bad execution Stephen Carpenter's writing / directing effort is borrowed from independent films such as Jacob's Ladder and Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) for those who have never seen these movies before me. Will not leave evidence When he was able to tell that it was not managed here better than in the two great movies, <br /> <br /> Melissa Sagemiller starring Cassie is going to college. Her current girlfriend, Sean (Ben Affleck) and former boyfriend Matt (West Bentley) Both friends and Annabel (Eliza Dushku gymnast) are in a car accident after two murderers. She survived the sabotage. But while studying in college, there was a vision of testing in the hospital and the dead appeared and disappeared, leaving her in a state of confusion: who died? Who lives Is there anything real? <br /> <br /> The survivors of the spirits have a bad look, doing that, full of blood, splashing, slander, exploiting teenagers. True, it has a share of killer scenes stalked by (Abundant, redundant and mind-numbing), but at least trying to create doubts through ideas rather than cliches. Unfortunately, quite successfully It caused more confusion than the combination of stories that became chaotic and incoherent, close to the key points of mystery. (Predictable as it is). Horror fans who receive copies will have no idea. They are in movies related to the building of a reality building that is more uncomfortable than sending bodies. Credit to Carpenter to try to create something other than a teen horror flick. Terrible that he created a psychological thriller. Sagemiller also deserves the glory for showing strength in a central performance, developing her character and causing emotions as a feelingless Cassie. It's great that filmmakers try different things. But this movie became a mixed bag and a failed experiment. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
