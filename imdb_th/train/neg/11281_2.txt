I rated this movie with a higher level of 2 stars, since I appeared myself in the 42nd and 43rd minutes of this movie ... The roadside bar scene in Russia. In this scene, the film director offers the immortal line - "50 dollars .. you drink and talk" but I feel that my Polish partner can speak with a more convincing Russian accent than I can, so I refused. To receive this, the part that speaks in me is quite starred because this is the first experience in my movie .... and who knows ... These chapters may end with chapters like "I will come back" and "quite frankly, dear, I'm not giving condemnation" If I say one line, then my name will appear on Rancid Aluminum's credit as 'heavy 1' instead of Ryszard Janikowski <br /> <br /> Over time, I count myself, luckily my name is not connected to this movie. <br /> <br /> Even though I spend the day in the scene Barry Island, South Wales hotspot, no one can tell me what the true story is. The organizers and women in the closet agreed that it had sworn and naked in them ..... Things could be worse than if I ended up being naked in the most horrible movie in Now .... <br /> <br /> Still ..... On the positive side .... I talked to Rhys Ifans during the break. I don't know who he is as "Notting Hill" that has not been released and is not an idea that he may be a Welshman. Commenting on the inappropriate things about the terrifying thing became Barry Island. Since my childhood there in the 70s and 80s, it was only when Keith Allen appeared that I knew I was in Quality production ........
