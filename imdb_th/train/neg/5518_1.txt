I did not see this and did not plan to watch this movie or any other story with Lindsay ...... unless and until "Little poor little girl" extended her life for a period of 2 years, starting with her the most. The recent arrest in July 2007 <br /> <br /> Actually, I don't know who had seen Lindsay's latest movie. I would rather think that the year 2007 will be an important sign in making her movie until she cleans her performance. All recent publicity has hindered her filmmaking career only if she had more inspiration to create a movie. <br /> <br /> At this time, movie makers have sought Lindsay to receive. Upcoming production role At this time, Lindsay may have to be selected and compete for any role. Her current reputation is "toxic" and is very likely to adversely affect box office ticket sales in movies. Any matter she has. <br /> <br /> Sooooo .... Now Lindsay is going to have to deal with "not wanting" ..... can you handle this? <Br /> <br /> I wonder if even Jay Leno wants to let Lin. Back to show on his TV show <br /> <br /> All of the above is just my opinion. I don't have inside information.
