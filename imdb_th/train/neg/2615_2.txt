I do not know why But for some reason, I think that since I am in the sequel to Disney, I decided to move forward to see 102 Dalles, the first movie created from Disney's classic cartoons, starring Glenn. Close to Clara de Ville seems to be popular. But it was just a bomb I think the reason that these movies are not working is because the original 101 Dalmations is a cartoon. It works better and attracts more children and adults. This is not really fun because as an adult trying to act like a cartoon instead of a real human being, I understand that they are trying to make sure that it attracts the attention of children, but it is a laugh to see how these actors behave. The movie and the story of 102 Dalmations is not that good. <br /> <br /> Cruella De Vil has been in prison for a while, but things changed when Proves that she loves animals and is a satisfying human being But now her reputation has been damaged as a puppy But she bought a shelter for a male dog and everyone immediately loved her and it seemed that she had changed But when she saw Dalmatian's staff proving the evidence, she was mad and began to see the point and she lost it. She returned to take revenge on the puppy and is still determined to receive the Dalmation shirt that she always wants. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is an amazing actress under a huge ranking. But come, this movie makes people more fun than crazy cases. Besides being cute like a puppy, it works better with animation. It sounds silly. But it's unbelievable if there are no cartoons and their personalities are in the mix. I don't really recommend 102 Dalmations, but if you accept that the first movie is a waste of time, this is the same thing. <br /> <br /> 2 / 10
