Reviews for this film, the warmest while sky high expectations: large budgets, popular faces, a lot of funny ideas and the main actors that everyone likes. The result is disastrous. Alice Tremblay's humorous journey in the fantasy world has failed in every way to entertain the audience. (I've never heard a single laugh throughout the entire presentation) through a story with some lines. The symbol of magic that it desires. The 90-minute movie here is sterilized with a clumsy direction and some good actors try to do their best as a professional in the qualification that certainly can't think of a good idea in the 'L' scene. Odyss√©e d'Alice Tremblay 'is a collection of cartoon sketches that are linked to some good ideas. Avoid or be bored to haunt you.
