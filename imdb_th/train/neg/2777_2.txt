Unfortunately this movie was released in Thailand last week. It's a complete garbage show. As other members said, this movie is a good example of 'What shouldn't be done?' I have not seen a movie that has done bad things for a long time. Actors (you call them 'actors'?) Flatten and send their chapters with a passion for dead dogs. I will say that in order to truly understand how bad the performance is, you have to watch the movie ... but that is similar to torture. <br /> <br /> I flatter because women show off her role. And the rest of the actors with their accent (Fake or artificial) is equally evil Other actors with fake English accents are cute. Yes. But a good boss is a bad accent. Mixed with her acting (absent) and you have a disaster She shouldn't say anything and I accepted her as a beautiful girl. Oh, I just arrived at the scene that the leading woman's lover said "Am I really?" After the forced crying scene from her is not laughable, I just laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> The scene and the art director gave elegance to this film. Some scenes are colorful and some scenes are quite good. (Minus actor) <br /> <br /> A charming old lady? What?! Other members talk about the 'modern' love songs that are in the movie. Not entirely suitable for a period of time that was set 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I understand that this movie is considered 'Big Budget' in Thailand during the production period I will be seriously upset if I am the producer of this film. Just go to show that money doesn't have to make good movies. (Or even mediocre) <br /> <br /> I will give King Maker 1 in 10, but the set and the scene make the movie from scoring 2 out of 10.
