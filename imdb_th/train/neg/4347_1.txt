Wow ... what I can say ... First of all, IMDb said that this was the late 60s ... which means that Carlito would be very close to prison. He went out 75 and said he was in 5 years He used many actors and unreasonable stories. They brought only one actor, Guzman and he played a completely different person. Why did he end up with him and this Puerto Rican chick? Gail Gale? He told Kleinfeld that he had loved her before, where he said he knew him forever ... Do you think he will be in this place? And if so, where is Rocco and the black friends in the first place? It's so stupid ... This is an insult to Pacino and the first movie.
