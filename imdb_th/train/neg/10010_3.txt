The plot is not worth mentioning, even though it is a talk of corruption, murder, power and topics related to thriller Interesting characters, though sometimes Not true, but interesting. <br /> <br /> Slow development like a tea ceremony. The picture is not amazing. But good enough to relieve eye pain A good movie for watching after dinner before going to bed - nothing too shocking, nothing too exciting. The sitcom style of the movie <br /> <br /> I like Woody - great performance. Have to fight with a bad plot and do a good job The rest can be received, even if predictable. All can be viewed and better than most TV programs.
