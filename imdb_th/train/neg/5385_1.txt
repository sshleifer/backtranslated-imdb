I don't know where to start. The actor is full of people who have never done anything before or after that. Debralee Scott is on the cover list. But did not appear in the movie at all Writing is quite bad, even with college movies. Obviously, it was a very low budget, with one scene in which the women's club had changed very quickly. <br /> <br /> The characters are normal for college movies - shy, stupid people, skin people The gentle black, the tough guy, the man with the mustache, the attractive girl, the small town, etc. The outstanding teacher is about what you expect ... A middle-aged man with a serious problem at Will go /> <br /> How come you do not want <br go to college. Flick clearly from this one. It's terrible. It's not funny.
