Others commented on the "rejection" of director Tobe Hooper. But what about Brad Dourif? He can choose a good project perfectly. (As he was proved by the actor in the same year as "Sorcerer III"), so why did he agree to appear in this story? Of course, he has an unusual performance, and this movie is not bad. It is just not interesting, not interesting and not interesting. That is three "un-" too much (* 2/1).
