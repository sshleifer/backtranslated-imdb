I noticed that the film received a lot of violence from insulting. May receive some But not that bad I will not go to see this movie again. It's a bad movie. But I didn't hate this movie. But tried to tell the story As an actor, this film can be used really well. I just think that filmmakers mistakenly believe which path to take when they do this. With repeated writing, it may be a great movie. But as satirical, it does not work in its current form - various scenes do not correspond to the context of the plot: for example, the robbery scene is difficult to understand Still, it's not the worst independent film ever created - it's in the top 10 worst? That is debatable
