Even though he was able to separate himself, Thomas was strong as an actor. <br /> <br /> This film has been inscribed in my memory as one of the most wonderful and incomparable movies. The ability that I have ever seen, I really like it. <br /> <br /> Still, the only reason for having more stars is that Thomas has a good shape and it's fun to see his small body with muscle showing. Various gymnastics skills Rocks and poles with strange shapes about the eastern European country (including the ugly Pomeranian horse) in the middle of the village square that Thomas used to put feet on the faces of the villagers. But letting the poor open his mouth and trying to utter the sound and any illusion that he may have in the movie actor's career, then rushing towards the bit immediately. <br /> <br /> Thomas, at least there is Excuses that He's not other actors in the movie - actors, editors, cameras, etc. At least bad or worse, and most of them are professionals. So Kurt isn't quite as bad as you think. <br /> <br /> I hope the poor Kurt has taken the money. If anyone who asks him to perform in the martial arts movie again, I'll bet that Thomas kicked the person in front.
