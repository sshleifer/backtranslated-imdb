This is what happened: <br /> <br /> 1) The leader of BBC3 must create a program aimed at audiences of BBC1 and BBC2 to maintain licenses and work. <br /> <br /> 2) Lenny Henry offers friends that are not fun. <br /> <br /> 3) The BBC3's leader caught them, ignoring the fact that they are not funny people. <br /> <br /> The worst of all is it. All racist classes The character plays poorly on the map. If there are white people doing this thing, there will be chaos! <br /> <br /> Trash
