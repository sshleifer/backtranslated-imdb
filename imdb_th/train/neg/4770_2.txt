I want to like this movie. Yes, it's a blah blah blah ripoff saw, but I like those movies. If done well, this is the whole mixture of being a good person, not a good person. But it's a good movie .... Unfortunately, those ingredients are gone! The performance was terrible and this was the first time that they were introduced to their arresters one by one. (The hat was removed) The words and one of the airlines were terrible. Yes, I knew that writing was bad .... more than that, it was a bad writing along with a bad performance. The two prisoners have a relationship with each other and never accept this until there is much more in the movie ..... <br /> <br /> Sorry, I still wonder why I have to review this movie. /> <br /> I'll finish with holes, holes, holes, holes and holes. Another plot! Deplorable!
