I would feel bad about seeing the first version of 1973 with Michael Jayston and the Sorcha Cusack. So the adaptation in 1983 was disappointing I didn't get any chemistry between the two main stars. The staring and theatrical performances didn't do much for me and things about bringing Tim to play Rochester Did the casting director read this book? That's very strange! He is a good actor. But Mr. Rochester, he certainly isn't! And Zelah is just a strange partner. In favor of the supporting actors is quite good and the scene of Lowood for me is the best of the adaptations. But overall, it doesn't capture the magic of the novel. Of course, don't ask anyone to see it as a real adjustment of the novel!
