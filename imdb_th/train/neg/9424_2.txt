This is not fun to watch. Frank made all his dreams in the back burner and received normal (boring!) Work. Just his stepson could go to the movie school. But his stepson decided that he would make an embarrassing documentary about that man instead. Documentary filmmaker should aim the camera and take pictures without having to manage and comment with the caption. The bitterness and resentment of filmmakers towards his stepfather was clear and sad. The goal seemed to make Frank look dumb and pathetic. But he found that he was the most important person in three people. <br /> <br /> In general, all smear campaigns are cleverly decorated and happier than it really is. It makes me hate. Very much for filmmakers
