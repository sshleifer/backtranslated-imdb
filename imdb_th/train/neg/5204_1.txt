"Trigger Man" is the most dull and stupid movie I've ever seen in my life. My aunt's holiday video is more interesting. <br /> <br /> Actors seem to be selected at uglypeople.com They have no ability to express themselves reliably. <br /> <br /> They walk and walk and walk through the forest. There are more walks in all three parts of "The Lord of the Rings" together. After the first hour, I started reading the pamphlets of Porsche while watching "Trigger Man" during the terrible way. <br /> <br /> Wasting time and money overall. I will give that movie 0 stars out of 10 because it is impossible. I have to give 1 star.
