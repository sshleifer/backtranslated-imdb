What happened to Robert "Pretentious" Altman? Does he save energy? Everything is very dark in this boring movie, which is ridiculous. I mean, have you ever seen a lawyer's office where everyone works with candlelight? <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time in reality. Don't waste your time on everything Altman does. That's all a pretense Of movies
