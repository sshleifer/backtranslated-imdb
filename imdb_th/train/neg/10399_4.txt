One of the major shortcomings in this film is that while ridiculing the cocky yuppies is unsatisfactory, it does not realize that the film makers themselves are guilty of being one of those who deserve ridicule. One of the characteristics of these types of misfortunes is the profound misunderstanding that they (the yappies) are the only ones that are complex enough to understand art. While the movie ignores this feature and focuses on the misunderstanding of my diet, I think it is ridiculous that only people who enjoy this movie have the same taste in the movie when Drama, choose dinner If the pompous character that is in this movie has a video library at home, I'll bet that American Psycho will be one of those movies.
