I downloaded this movie yesterday via a very good quality internet site! I watched this movie with high expectations. (Although I know it's a failure) especially when the movie has a famous actor Amitabh Bachchan as a villain But at least the actors like him should do some work Unfortunately, Mr. Bachchan failed to make an impression while the villain proved that nobody could compete in the trial of RJV's magic of AMJAD KHAN in order to light the glorious past! Sholay, an old man, is a major event in an Indian cinema that has actors, dialogue, cult, stylish movies and a great soundtrack that is still popular with the current generation as well. Ajay Devgan On average, the new king doesn't know what the show is. Nisha Kothari proves that she is one of the worst actresses we have. I don't know if she's still. The team of RGV Urmila & Abhishek in music, excitement and passion Mohanlal try our best and work Susmitha Sen's work on this film, it was the murder of the original Sholay.
