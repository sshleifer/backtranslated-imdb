This is probably the most boring movie in history. I am looking forward to seeing this movie really because the actor / director Roman Polanski. I think I want to see Three Amigos more than ever before watching this movie again. It goes from the DVD player into the trash immediately. I apologize to those who like this movie. But you might like New Coke as well. I'm losing to see why everyone is happy with this movie. It's slow, boring and without a real plan. You wait for 105 minutes to start the movie. I understand this happened in 1976, but this is the era of bad television around me. Thanksgiving, disco, and three companies that disappeared with stop glasses and Bay Bay Rollers. Oh, just my opinion.
