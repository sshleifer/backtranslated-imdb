This movie is probably the worst I have ever seen. The show is not good, the script is not good, everything is not good. Comparisons with the two most movies of the same genre and from similar times are interesting. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and stronger in both story and governance Also the director of Albert Pyun. <br /> <br /> The story is not original. The world has become a scary place, probably due to environmental disasters or nuclear wars and people living under medieval circumstances. Special breed robots (Cyborg) live in human blood and have a story ... Cyborg needs a lot of humans to achieve "prophecy" and humans need someone to stop them. it A girl with a robot (Kris Kristofferson) created by the creator of cyborgs was appointed by fate to save humanity. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director tries to fight Hong Kong's stylish style. With participants Fly high and jump long This film failed miserably in this effort. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for the same reason that most people will get a movie. "Worst ever" came to be involved and for fans of the genre, I would suggest "Cyborg" because I think it is a movie that is very insulting and has a high entertainment factor. And if you can't stand it with Van Damme, see "Nemesis" <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 1/10
