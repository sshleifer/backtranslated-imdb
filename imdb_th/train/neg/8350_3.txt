I just came back from "El Otro" playing here in Buenos Aires and I have to say I am very disappointed. This movie moves very slowly. (Don't understand me wrong, I like slow-moving movies!) Slowly to the point of making you crazy. What you hear is Julio Chavez breathing heavily throughout the story. This is a movie that is poorly constructed. But more importantly, the film is without inspiration. I do not feel that there is a story or character. <br /> <br /> "El Otro" was created for the benefit of making movies ... causing forgetfulness. Suggest that you forward this story if you want to watch a good Argentinian movie. Look for Sorin's movie.
