Who would have predicted that Robert Osborne had a contractual obligation to congratulate even the least appealing movie in the TCM library, because this would explain to him the "virtue" of this "charming" movie in During his introduction When I saw that the old movies in IMDb were given a 'classic' status from the amateur examiner who waged the tail, I thought it was absolutely necessary to review the movie honestly. <br /> <br /> This is not your father's 'shop around the corner' for all my nonsense words with 'You Be Got Mail'. It also places importance on this in the form of a new creation in every way possible. possible For those who have seen the original defects only more clearly <br /> <br /> From one of the sequences found to be extremely cute, I can remember seeing that. (Painful, sad trying to 'humor') This movie fell out of the wrong foot and never really came back. This 'music' has only one qualification in terms of words. There was a sudden scattering of musical numbers and then there was a singing of Judy "I Don't Care" while hugging her arms as if it were a seizure. Christmas songs that she sings in the store may be one of the better numbers of her here. Miss Garland is great in many music movies. But here she seems to be horribly mad Originally, the role was filled with June Allison and Judy could not fill the shoes of the old part of Margaret Sullavan. Van Johnson changed in a rather polite way compared to Jimmy Stewart, the second type. The lead actor has never had the chemical success of Stewart / Sullavan or even Hanks / Ryan. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that knows (part) notes, but not music. Seemed to not understand why the original was effective and felt the need to add a possible love for Van Johnson's character that would make things unnecessarily difficult. The replacement of the remake for the original infidelity subplot was a device Lot that has been hacked in relation to the precious violin It's embarrassing to look at and feels as if it were raised from one of the three companies by people with DeLorean and flux capacitors. It is just an excuse for the pratfall Keaton. Even the big resolution scene between romantic leads is wrong. You will understand why they called it 'the Lubitsch Touch' and not 'Robert Z. Leonard Touch'. <br /> <br /> Avoid this and watch the original movie or one of Judy Garland. Previous movies, unless you are a destroyer who likes to see the great stars once falling into the world
