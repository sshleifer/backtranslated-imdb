I ended up watching this movie before passing any reviews on the request of women. Just from curiosity, I think let me see if there are people who recommend others to watch this movie or not. I am quite shocked to find a long and positive review on this website, which makes me conclude that it is a scam. <br /> <br /> As far as my opinions go, I have to ask. "Are these filmmakers retarded? Do they think that the audience is retarded? "This movie is bad in many levels and I'm not talking about the story or presentation. <br /> <br /> So these people, plus a woman (lead actor), create a band. Guessing from the existence of the guitar, it should be a rock band. Hell, when the dancers start to be part of the rock band ??? Okay, I would like to accept it as a rock band version of Bollywood. But when all the scores with these two guitarists make a great "rock" song and I think they play The guitar sound instrument is totally gone !!! I can't understand the stupidity here .... <br /> <br /> I'll end up here because it's not worth pointing out the shortcomings of this movie. Bollywood directors don't seem to be ashamed anymore !!!!!!!!
