I have seen about one horror movie. (The type I like) This movie is one of the worst. For me, the idea is to drive movies. Therefore, even the poorly made movies can do well. There are some strange things that happen. However, there is little to say. I still don't understand how karate scenes initially relate to movies. There are some strange things to offer to help yourself. Pain!
