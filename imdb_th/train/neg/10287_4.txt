Available in "Drive In Double Feature" from Dark Sky Films and when I just finished "Barracuda", I watched this too. This is a movie that proves to be incredibly ambitious and incompetent at the same time. <br /> <br /> We started with two young women walking down the streets of some foreign cities. They stopped watching the necklace from some Chinese sellers and tried wearing Chinese style clothes at the store. But after that, can we see the Aztec dancers? And while these girls are followed by two men who eventually drop whatever they do not need to chase, the children run away, even in the city and eventually they catch them. > <br /> Looks like a girl has a coin on the rope around her neck and they want to find a gift and where did she get it? So in the past, we went back to And how do they know that she has this coin Difficult to say. <br /> <br /> Now, back in the day when these two women were 10 years old, they went out with the sisters and sisters on the boat and after the broadcast. In their tank, they dragged this young man back to the port at his home just to let his grandfather come out and invite "young" uns up for herbal tea with grandma. But not everyone who had tea, Todd returned to the boat to check the girl, and when they were away from it, the ship exploded and when they returned to their home, their friends disappeared mysteriously. "Kind people" These are raising their own vegetables. But they wait for the meat to drop and serve herbal tea. <br /> <br /> But the girls and Todd leave the island, but now they are back by their captors and they are there for Find the treasure, despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls that it was before. It seems that there are other people on the island and the gangsters begin to die one by one, and because there are only three people, it doesn't take long. And there is also a happy ending scene that will make the audience feel as bewildered as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Two gangsters seem to be crazy about the speed of anger. Not capable of acting The hillbilly family is not capable of acting, despite the fact that Grandfather Hank Worden appeared in many movies and TV shows. That action causes confusion. The places are even more confusing and the island looks like Southern California. <br /> <br /> What is this? I'm not sure, but it's worth seeing once, so you can think (or say), right? 4 out of 10. Very strange.
