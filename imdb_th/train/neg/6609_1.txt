I can't say that Aag is the worst Bollywood movie ever created because I have never seen Bollywood movies before. But my imagination tells me that it may be possible. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be an artistic effort. Suicide on behalf of the director and I believe he succeeded in his mission. There are no actors outside of this film, there is a risk of sharing the same bill with him for all the humiliation that the film is bound to have to do with it. <br /> <br /> But no. Just blaming the director here Filming a movie that looks like he's practicing for an amateur filmmaker at home of the year Has more points than the drama that hopes to take you to the next scene The light man, who had to hold a cigarette in one hand and another lamp on the other side, and hoped that the burning flame from the cigarette would increase the need for that light in every scene. And of course the actors! Some people have never been new, and all others can be forgiven here. Aag's group of actors gathered to promote the beginning and the new dimension of creating the most beloved movie of India forever. 'Sholay' We must not forget that these actors are not forced to participate in This movie, they are an A-list and participants who are willing to do something that we must face, of course, have high expectations. So it was the question Amitabh (now). Other actors believe that their performance is trying to be better than the original? Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believed that people would remember his dialogue in this nasty movie? Of course, he doesn't do this as a public demonstration of the amount of money that will make the actor walk. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone involved will be satisfied with what is true. Rude attempts to create a new classic movie that has succeeded in creating pollution for everyone's mind when watching the original.
