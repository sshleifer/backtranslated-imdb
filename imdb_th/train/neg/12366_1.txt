"Loonatics Unleashed" is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters created by Chuck Jones "Loony Tunes". There are many different versions of the spin. That is the worst. This concept is stupid and the derivative of the program "The Power Rangers" and "Teen Titans". There are no similarities with the original characters and the stories are boring and poor. New design, ugly and pathetic animation This program is not working. The result of losing this horrible animation is a complete failure and this shouldn't be a bad joke! Star center
