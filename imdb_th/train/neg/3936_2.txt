Wow. I think this may not be interesting. But even worse than I imagined! Sometimes I like watching a movie "car-crash". Good: The movie is so bad that you can't look out because you want to see how bad it is. This is the only reason that made me go out on TV. It is not a show that is only moderate or worse than expected from this actor alone. But the evidence and plot that should not have seen the light of the day The script is also lamenting In the movie, others noticed that they used the "drawing curtain" accessory like in the 50s television program ... but without irony? At first I thought they had to be joking. But the movie is too serious to use this in a tongue-like manner. Don't even ask me about the score ... The only top spot is the last song by Morcheeba. I think they want to let someone with something for their $ 8 ... glad me. Saw it on TV !!!!! Just stupid! I wonder if this is the reason why Timothy Hutton had trouble finding a lot of jobs recently? I guess if you don't expect much and want to see an irrational thriller, it's better to spend the evening cutting your toenails, which is the reason why it's suitable for 2.
