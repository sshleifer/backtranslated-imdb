This film relates to Eddie's story as mentioned in his name and his return to an old friend in the seaside community. The story relates to a group of friends when he sees that Eddie is left as a way to deal with the death of a friend he feels is responsible. But this is not important because the production options are terrible and not fully realized. The script doesn't always have to be 'talkative', but at least they should help develop the story. Here, one line tries like "He just took it out" or "I know you don't have love in the heart". Just do something that is fully worth the time of the audience. In addition, whenever the author feels that he has to lose the place, he cuts the montage of the protagonists who walk through the fields to indie mood songs. Talking about trying hard If you are interested in a good movie that provides quality and content rather than just style, this is not the movie for you.
