I rent this idea may be interesting and may be interesting, except that it is told in an unattractive manner. Difficult to keep up with the strange changes. The characters are muttered with terrible time. I can't go and don't care what happens to the characters - even Ian Holm can't help the movie. If you don't want to treat insomnia, I'll skip it 3/10 and that's kind.
