This is the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. But in fairness it can be seen and funny I don't think the filmmakers intend to have Hollywood blockbuster quality. It's just a stupid movie about a serial killer who is topped with toxic waste causing reactions to him and the snow. (Because it was mid-winter) then he became a killer snowman, enough to make you laugh by yourself This movie is really stupid, but it's funny. The killing is hilarious. I won't recommend you to buy it. (As I do - the cover looks good!) But if it happens on TV one night and you're ready to laugh then
