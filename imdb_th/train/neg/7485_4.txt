Actually, this is a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese in Neil Simon's comedy. Where are you going to go wrong? Watch the movie and you'll know that <br /> <br /> In fact, the leading actor Martin is wrong. He did not do a great injury that he knew from a movie like "The Jerk" but played as a character between the characters that didn't work. The hawk that no one can play is a very scary thing. Cleese is just some funny member. <br /> <br /> To close it I can't tell how much it might change. But the characters seem to lack a little common sense They mistakenly passed through New York, not doing anything right and bad luck. Nothing funny, not only all evidence, completely unbelievable. But it seems that the message that people who do not live in New York is not bright. But the theme is repeated throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, from watching this, rent a traditional "odd couple" again.
