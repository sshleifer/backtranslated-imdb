The golden age of Disney cartoons is dying in the late 1990s. The Quack Pack show should not even be considered DuckTales because the program has almost nothing to do with DuckTales. It's about Huey, Dewey and Louie. As a teenager while they create problems for Donald's uncle and speak in hip hop terms I like nephews who like little adventures from DuckTales. There are humans in Duckburg and ducks are the only animals that live in Duckburg. There is no reference of Scrooge McDuck. The story has to repeat the boring plot. But good animation If you want humor, slap me, introduce you to If you want a better Disney show, see "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
