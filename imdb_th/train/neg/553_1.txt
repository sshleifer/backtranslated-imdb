After waiting for the best, I must say that I hope I will not participate in the series all from the beginning. The last episode is everything seven years ago. It destroys everything. This trip is 23 years, but Captain Janeway has the power to reduce ... Please tell only seven years. Why do you need seven, why not just try one? Why not avoid all the adventures? The crew is dying throughout the journey. Why do you want to save seventy-nine only? Others don't count or anything The most ridiculous part when the crew said that going home is not the most important thing for them. As said "The journey is more important than the destination." Incredible. And in the final scene, the final scene is surrounded by other ships and the world is in the eyes Nothing about landing back to normal life. <br /> <br /> The worst that has ever been.
