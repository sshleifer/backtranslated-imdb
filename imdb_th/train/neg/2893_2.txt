What should this be? A remake of Fisher King? Why are we interested in Sandler's character? It's a slow movie, boring, boring, dying with these things !!! Just painful, just sit through me, close it before it ends. Obviously, Cheadle needs as much help as Sandler. As I said: Can you say "Fisher King"? And how does the character in this mental state act in his daily life? We shouldn't think so. I guess. Why does Cheadle still give Sandler the opportunity to change violence with him? If they are good friends, how are they separated? If Cheadle can control well, why is he still looking for further advice on shrinking the road? We never told. That's why Fisher King is a better movie on many levels and why this story is almost 8 out of 10 points? I do not agree at all. Even the leading movies are still lucky to get a high rating and this crap doesn't deserve to be in the same universe.
