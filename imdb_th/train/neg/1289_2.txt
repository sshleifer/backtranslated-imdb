This is the lowest time among Westerners. The writing is not good, the eyes barely off, the characters are impossible to be important and disgusting or impolite. Violence is a scary thing. And Toby Maguire shows us the flip side of his ability, sleepwalking through his part with his emotionless and raspy eyes. 'Ride With the Devil' is one of the five worst movie experiences. Most of my former Westerners have never been overcome in a negative way.
