The problem with this movie is that it was taken in the worst camera possible. Maybe it's the fact that anyone who holds the camera can't stop because they have seizures or something. In this film there is too much poop and vomiting. Someone is vomiting every twenty minutes and it makes me think that this is caused by doing something or bulimic. It's disgusting. Then there was an annoying high-pitched scream that never happened and didn't stop until the credit rolled. I don't like when her friends are shot (or don't know) and she goes into the van and helps the band. That is really stupid in movies. How many people can pump gas in the van? There must be a lot because they do not use all the gas in other films. It's a terrible movie and I highly recommend that you never see it all your life.
