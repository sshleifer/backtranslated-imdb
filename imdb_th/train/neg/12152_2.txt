Some reporters and escort soldiers try to tell the truth about the zombie outbreak, despite 'The government controls the media' The salary of this film does not understand that the movie George Romero Zombies only works because he maintains his politics thoroughly in the background of most of his films. ("Land of the Dead" patiently) This phrase about a delicate brick-like face or bullet to the head is an additional matter for this situation. What is subversive or subtle about seeing soldiers, soldiers contemplating death and destruction? Is there anything new about advertising that is cut with movies? Nope, moreover, the performance is scary as well. The characters are ugly and the story is ridiculous. Add this together and you will have the worst and most incompetent zombie movie ever since "C.H.U.D. 2" Raise it as an awesome head. <br /> <br /> My score: D
