I was very excited when I saw an advertisement for this movie because I just read the book and really enjoyed it. However, this movie did not go as I expected. Recently, reading this book has prepared me for a big story that often happens when the story is translated into movies The characters don't look very much with the book. The direction is weak. I have trouble getting into the characters. There is no real connection with the audience about what happened. The dialog box did not explain adequately what happened. Seems to be slapping together and passing In conclusion, I was very disappointed with the movie. I think if you haven't read the book, it may be possible by yourself. At the very least, it may attract you to read this book, which you may enjoy more. <br /> <br />
