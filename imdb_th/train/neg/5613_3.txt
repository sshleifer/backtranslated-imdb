In my opinion, this movie progresses without new ideas. Looks like I will take the spear to the spear without looking at the side! The director seems to have an agenda! Like! I found that his reason was lacking. There seems to be no room for an alternative perspective. I tend to be the person beside the director. But this movie lacks credibility because it really depends on the excellent observations of men / women on the road. Now, if you want to cr5eate a reliable alternative to faith held for over 2,000 years You have to spend more effort to let the other party express their beliefs. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the movie it feels like an attack on faith. I am a Christian who does not believe. But giving the beliefs of others and not wanting to mock them But try to understand and tolerate
