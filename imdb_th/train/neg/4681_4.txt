We laughed our heads away. This script is so incredible that you will clash with CNN or go to sleep. <br /> <br /> My father is a captain for 30 years. He can't believe his eyes when he sees a movie. <br /> <br >> He has experience as an officer. He once claimed control of 3 bottles of Captain Whiskey drunk per day and apologized on his table. Of course, this is not on a nuclear mission. <br /> <br /> For example, fire in the kitchen is the most important thing for a nuclear boat? The practice at that time was just a Hollywood movie. When the captain is arrested, he is arrested. You use all his keys and open the safe that holds the gun. This will be stored within a few minutes in a well-protected room. He can't escape. It's like being in prison. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that my father has a dog on board. However, we see how hacking allows him to pee in the control room. This is not finished yet. My father cleans everything that the dog does wherever he goes. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington create three stars in this movie, giving all the remaining credits as bulls. ** t <br <br /> <br /> When we know that there are 23 people still living on Koersk, this movie will have more dimensions. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the real thriller about renting a black boat Water: Thas Boat <br /> <br />
