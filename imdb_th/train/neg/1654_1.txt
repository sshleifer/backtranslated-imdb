Final score: 0 (from 10) <br /> <br /> *** It is possible that the spoiler only in the scene (But who is interested in hell) *** <br /> <br /> Yes, right: Zero and I don't give 1 of even the best movies. I look for things like music, movies, fantasy. But it is a joke, even a good rhythm to score as much as possible. Look inside yourself, sub-species or But there is absolutely nothing to exchange. I can't remember again that this movie sent me to walk up and down the room when it was over. The only reason I made it to the end because I couldn't change the channel - I was sitting there horribly. See what the insulting bit would happen next. It's like watching a sub snake. <br /> <br /> But have fun and separate this child from each other. First of all, there is no technique for "whipping" that can be used in all sitcom styles. The cut scene is just a picture of road traffic that occurs over night and over and over again. Music and score not only But didn't help anything in the movie - it's terrifying No need to talk about it, nothing can help anyway. The performance is cardboard, as it happens everywhere, and for Amanda Peet (apparently "the star" that makes the wreck of this train bright green) as well, good friends who predict no chemistry or The purpose anymore. If director Peter M. Cohen rounds up at the bus station before shooting, <br /> <br /> In creativity. Traditional bone in the body It has no imagination It shows us that we have never seen a thousand times. All the evidence or "twists" of this movie are based on bashing men and "ideas" that powerful women can play men. "Just like they play" Anyone who thinks this is a twist or something in the original, never open the TV clearly before. Shallow women are common. Men's bashing is the norm. It didn't steal from anything, especially it was worse: it stole from ancient ideas. I can't imagine that a woman would create a movie that depicts other women based on patterns and with insulting feelings. Make me want to rent "in the company of men" - or better yet "Something about Mary" This movie wants to be "edgier". The version of "There Something About Mary" is so bad that you see sweat. <br /> <br /> This film has no insights about Women, men, dating, sex or whatever. Cohen is only content to echo the myths that he has been implanted from other films. On the other hand, the film does not work as a word either, because even if it is ripe, one can actually see it. "Taunting" it doesn't have the ground in reality that requires satires. It doesn't even know that it's ridicule Then there was a dialogue, which was more than the character, screaming and rude each other. Example: Character 1: "F ** k you" Character 2: "Oh, right, f ** k you" (Repeat) <br /> < br /> and the bottom line, things that can be solved entirely discretions: there are a lot of movies that have no plans, no good performances, morally abusive characters and rude conversations that are funny and good things "whipped" Not a joke Not for seconds It has no skill or timing. The situation is totally fake, not based on any truth, especially enough to squeeze out laughs from us. Every character pulls out so broad that they SEEM relate to the lowest point of the lowest common denominator. Just look at the "marquee scene", "classic cult", the gel hair scene, one of our brave heroes, open the medicine cabinet and see the Mena vibrator (Peet) for some reason. That he had found the Holy Grail Why Cohen thinks that men respond like this to the vibrators I don't know? As he rubbed himself, he put it in the bathroom and tried to catch the fish with his bare hands. When I Oh, Mena came in to him. Oh, my side. <br /> <br /> But it's strange that people like it. This movie really Of course, people like "friends" and acting on real dating, so I shouldn't be surprised. All of this has a general thread. However, "whipping" is an important evidence for me that there are many people in America who laugh at jokes because of sex. They will like any show or movie (or think they like it) just because it's about dating or relationships. It lacks any quality that does not discourage these people. Just like people who are cultivated to need more white teeth and a slimmer body to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they will instill in the blind to find out what the relationship is related to cheap TV sales. And various products <br /> <br /> The only gathering is when I die because I watch this movie. I get credit for 80 minutes in my life. <br /> < br />
