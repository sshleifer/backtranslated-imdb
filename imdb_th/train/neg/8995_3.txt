I missed the beginning But I see most Friends took it on a DVD in a cheap room at FYE. <br /> <br /> The play is very short and most are too long. Most of them, they seem to have forgotten that there is something funny! There is racism / gender discrimination / "homophobic" humor in that there is a play based on patterns or racial games for people. <br /> <br /> I try to remember anything And I'm having problems .... The logo for the Tunnel Vision network is the mouth that has lipstick and an eyeball. The mouth will open and close like the eyelids. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the actors go on for the better and luckily this explosion doesn't hold them.
