This movie has something to do with bats. Having Dani Filth as the lead actor will make some people like this movie automatically. Recognized that I love the Cradle of Filth and listened to the soundtrack of this movie long before I watched. Dani Filth is a well-known character and created for a great leader The independent filming style of the movie is excellent for the creepy factors. There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this movie. For a low budget, special techniques are not bad as well. The way in which people die is creative and nightmares. <br /> <br /> Now it's a disadvantage. There is very little talk in this movie, so it is a little character development. It's hard to be afraid for the life of the characters that are soft and still. When there was a little talk, the bomb exploded. F became abundant. Appears in different places. Yes, I understand people swear. But it seems that the thirteen boys wrote this script and considered themselves cool for all language combinations. The story of what I can do from it is pretty good, even though many parts are left to hang around and lack the conversation, often wondering what happened Porn for people who love sex and violence But like a porn that tries to pull the story, it doesn't work too well Try to rent it if you are a scary person who wants your blood and appetite.
