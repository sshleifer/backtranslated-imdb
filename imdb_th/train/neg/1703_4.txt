Vietnamese veterinarians decided to occupy a quiet city, run rampant and everyone who walked in his path would be eliminated. (Including women) before launching in the movie theater "A Star Is Born", which changed his career. The drama action movie starring Chris Kristofferson looks fierce, filmed in Simi Valley, CA. The results are not truly effective, with rednecks, narrow-mindedness, and unreasonable violence making it a big part of the director George Armitage. For his films, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters and Loni Anderson. However, the center of all things is Kristofferson Who is rude and rude at all It deserves a score that I think is a compassionate driving thriller. But the feeling is bad * 1/2 from ****
