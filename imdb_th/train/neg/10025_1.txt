If this is the product of 2008 from one of the biggest producers of the Indian film industry (Yash Raj), I am afraid that it will be a very long time for us to achieve the right standards. <br /> <br /> If you Can go wrong with this length, with great actors like Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena. Then everyone involved in the making of this movie still needs to study harder This film is absent in almost every department, except for movies and Akshay Kumar. He has a good dialogue to show. But not only can you enjoy the expectations. <br /> <br /> The first scene of the cars that go down the river from the mountains is that the graphics are very cheap. Cartoon movie That is a clear indicator of the director's vision. Every actor who is an asset to the movie will be wasted. Anil Kapoor's trick in trying good English is almost always depressed, and Saif will definitely hit himself. Why do he sign the movie? br /> <br /> In short, it is the biggest resource of resources. After "JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM" I would say that even "Aaja Nachle" is a movie that is more fun than this. <br /> <br / > We can't understand Why this and why this script has been written and approved. The most unpleasant thing is the sequel of Akshay's love story. After the script is wrong, the weakest point of the movie is its music. Vishal Shekhar delivers the songs for each song. The song started very well, and suddenly the song dropped dramatically. There is only one song "Falak Tak Chal" that is very good. The opportunity lost by Vishal Shekhar. <br /> <br /> About the manufacturer's intelligence, just this example: Akshay and Saif are on the road in the area. The hills of foreign countries In the next scene, they are searching for Carina in Haridwar and then back up the hill with Carina in their car. I still think who wrote this story. <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit until the end You can see all the heroes walking through the storm. The bullets don't hurt as if they were gods. Do we still see the 2008 film that has all the technical heights? So there are no more words about this pathetic and downgrade movie. But it is a sincere request to senior actors from their fans. <br /> <br /> Dear Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar, If possible, please request a preview of your movie after the first copy. As an artist With such proportions, you are responsible for your fans and viewers People still clap to you as you enter the screen in your first scene, respectively. I think this type of movie should not be viewed during the day because it makes everyone's reputation related to movies, actors and production houses both.
