Wow! I watched an example for this, and although this 'nah was not for me', I watched my husband and our friend's face at the end of the trailer and knew that this was 'Child movie' I mean Hello! A group of chicken girls, bars that dance - undress again. <br /> <br /> Then I started to look. It didn't look so bad. So I looked further. I watched it until the end. It was a great movie. If anything, this is a chicken flick. These women have an attitude. It's a movie that feels good and is a love story. Make you feel really good. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the story of a young woman in a small town that makes it big in the city after passing through the big city that is normal. There are a few things like this. It's almost a new city legend. But it makes you miss your life and what you accomplish Well i already I think it's because all the work in the bar situation is familiar, not just for me. But for many people I know Do not trust the trailer for this car - it is intended to bring them in.
