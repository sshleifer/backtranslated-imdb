Clearly, Hollywood is sending money to everyone with a camera and the ability to speak. This movie is so bad. The selection of the actors is terrible, the performances that cannot be described, and the stories are filled with script holes? Who needs a script? I was surprised that this movie was not rude, as I thought it would be. But I have enough T&A images to be with me for life. The movie is like listening to a 19-year-old street racer with ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) telling the story. I think the two brothers in this movie are lovers from the beginning. The scene in the racetrack, along with the main actresses in the movie, reminds me of Herbie: fully loaded. This is a type of movie that Grindhouse acted as a model after ... only the authors thought they were serious
