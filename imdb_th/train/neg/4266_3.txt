Of course, NOMAD has the best horse riding scenes, fencing and shooting amazing scenery that you might see. But this is not what makes a movie good. It can help, but the story must shine through these things. And that is where the nomad wanders. <br /> <br /> The story arrogant makes it feel that it was thrown together just to create a "cool" movie that looks "great". Not to mention that many of the main characters. People do not come from regions where this story happened. (And it's very clear with names like Lee and Hernandez). If the filmmakers want to make us obsessed with cultures like Jugars and Kazaks, they should use actors / actors who look part. <Br <br /> <br /> Fight tribes, prophecies, love and respect for brothers. Interesting love that separates our "heroes" is all affected, but with little impact and time on the screen that most viewers will flick it out in the next battle sequence. Go or the amazing beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> It's worth mentioning that there are some important changes that have happened to Nomad during the filming, especially the director and filmmaker Ivan.Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov and Ueli Steiger (filming) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. On the one hand, Laustsen seemed to have better eyes because his vision in the land made the last cut we saw here. Is absolutely good However, changing to Bodrov as a director may not be the smartest choice. From what I see here, the focus is fighting, not the people I touch from the eyes of Bodrov, not the passer. True imitation <br /> <br /> The most embarrassing aspect is that this movie may be a great movie, both characters and action oriented. Unfortunately, high-ranking people decide that the action is needed and find the right solution (intelligence) in the right way. <br /> <br /> Although I can't give a positive rating to this movie For an amazing movie But that's all
