Eyes that are wide and cheerful beyond the 50s that give new meaning to anti-social and pathological behavior. Danza and Grayson will make you plead for mercy. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that everyone involved in The creation of this movie is dead. (Or in a nursing home) I thought to sue them for torture While this film began to unleash unscrupulous sewage attacks on the drums that could not protect me, I immediately felt that there was severe pain throughout my life. The vibrato with the muscle of the damn. That can make the Soviet tank break into small pieces. Never mind. <br /> <br /> "Why don't you change the channel if you don't like it?" You may ask in anger. Fair point, fair point ... The answer is I want But the pain was sudden and excruciating until I fell to the ground, twisted with pain With the power of my last ounce, I try to reach far away, but I can't. <br /> <br /> A small, stupid fisherman with a suspicious ability to sing with an annoying opera sound. Discovered by Niven "Pigmalionize" Lanza falls in love with Asymmetrical Grayson. But she expected that he would treat him with disrespect until they finally asked This may seem like a relatively thin matter. But the movies that are so loud are filled with singing and music that is almost without any dialogue A little conversation would be something of a stupid adult who bothered the strange 1950s music world. It was about children - as if they were 6 year olds who disguised themselves as givers. Big I can only envy those who search for movies like this. It must be good to make it easier: the world of magic will open my heart if only But I can enjoy the old funny jokes. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> But check out this phenomenon in the 50s. My best guess is the 50s musical drama. We in the utopian or heavenly eye (Depending on whether you are going to church or Lenin - go to the cemetery) or at least imagine this - the place that has been inspired by TTONO is similar to the representation of hell. But that's just me I don't seem to "get" the musical. People say that there is a story - but then everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes. After that, they suddenly calm down and pretend that nothing is wrong! When you think about it, the musical is more strange than any science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> Worse, TTONO (my favorite pizza btw) is not just a 50s musical but a story. Opera Opera is proof that there are things like sound training to the point that it becomes a weapon that pierces the ear instead of a way to make the listener happy. The most obvious example of this imitation is when Lanza and Grayson combine their dark side energy for a truly unbearable partner. I tried to reduce the volume. I reduced it from 18 to 14, then to 14 to 10. Then 8 I ended up being 1, which is usually low until heard by specially trained dogs and some bottle masks. Heard the two voices waving like a donkey! <br /> <br /> Take the scene in a small boat in the Danza River. Start with one of the songs that are deaf and kill his brain ... Nothing. No animals to see. Even the most deaf crocodiles are still left. If you look carefully, you may see trees changing color from green to yellow in a matter of minutes. No, this is not a continuous error. It is a torture to plants. And those trees are just glazed paintings! Imagine how the tree actually reacted. <br /> <br /> The reason that the glass broke when the C was separated from the overweight area of ​​the opera astrologer was not caused by the laws of physics related to waves and frequencies. Kaew is just a human being - so he can suffer a lot before he can commit suicide through the explosion himself. I can listen to the most loud and friendly heavy metal band for many hours. But gave me one minute from the soprano and I was a separate headache
