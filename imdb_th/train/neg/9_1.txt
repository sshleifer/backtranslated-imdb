This is one of the most stupid movies I've ever seen. It tore the type of thriller and managed to get messy. <br /> <br /> There is no single line or character that is good. If there is a plot, it is an idea and as long as the performance goes, there is nothing good to say so I don't say anything. I can't understand how this kind of nonsense has been produced and come out. Actually, some people who are not in the process of thinking that 'Oh God, this is really disgusting' and calling it day Shit, it's like this that someone illegally downloaded. Movie trailers seem completely different. At least, if you download, you don't waste time or money.
