Those who write, direct, and stare at this shocking trash should consider the changes of the caregiver. Yes, Rob Stefaniuk. I mean you! Seriously, who gave money to support this shit? There are many talented writers out there that the money may be better than spending on I think the idea is great. But the acting and the director are really scary! The joke is not a joke. I understand that they should take Mickey. But doing it in style, this movie screams live games on Saturday night of 1995. Why do I say again why the studio gave money to hacking like Rob Stefaniuk - never had a comedian the opportunity to write directly and The actor in his own movie DUH!
