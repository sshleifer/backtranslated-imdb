Unfortunately, one of the best efforts that are still made in the area of ​​special effects has been made completely pointless by placing alongside the homeless and equally absurd plot and screenplay. Not enough clichéd. Hollow Man is a rather useless movie. <br /> <br /> Everything that is seen here is made to death - characters, thoughts and actions. (Especially the lift axles!) - with truly interesting elements only This film is an impressive special technique. However, it is the same special technique that has been repeated and at the end of the movie that was made to die as well. I hope before watching Hollow Man that the original Invisible Man theme, which is hardly in itself, will be the basis of something new and more interesting. Not so Shortly before the film became a familiar blood basin and a mass of ineffective Baptists - the clichés piled up so quickly that he was almost impressed. Bacon worked in vain and the supporting actors tried their best. A good score may be the score that Jerry Goldsmith has passed (but there is no competition for his better endeavors), the use of thermal images and interesting special techniques. I was tempted to make this film three out of ten. But the effect pushed the value of Hollow Man up. <br /> <br /> 4/10
