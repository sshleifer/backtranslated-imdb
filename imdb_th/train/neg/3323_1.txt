I watch a lot of cartoons or animated movies because I have girls who like to watch TV. I started watching this movie to see if I wanted my little boy to watch it or not. At first I thought it was a cute movie like Bambi. But everything is a curse that the beloved prince is gay The information says that they make him fun because he doesn't play sports well. But that is not the case It looks like a movie created for children to learn to be gay. It is very sad, like the father and everyone. I don't know. I guess you are gay you like. But i don't think i will watch again with my little baby
