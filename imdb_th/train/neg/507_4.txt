In contrast to my fellow examiners, I always try to find things that are exchanged in any film that I see. Yes, the quality of the copying and the light is exemplified. The show is a wood and a misleading opening scene with vampires. Lesbian woman With blood drops, something must disappear in the translation "Bloodsucker" from Italy in the title; As if the original producer had filmed the movie Gothic Vampire and changed their minds But was unable to give up on the opening scenes of their drama, so he pinned it on to the next film. <br /> <br /> The film, created in 1975, has been released on DVD and comes With my own movie trailer, which is sometimes more courageous than it has ever been seen in a movie. Now, anyone who bought this movie may read the summary and know what to expect - Italian softporn from mid-year 1970 Buy because I am interested in Christa Nelli (most often credited as "Krista Nell"). The lack of character character I find most disappointing in the Eurosleaze movie from the 60s and 70sI. Hopefully Imdb will show the character while hearing the name of They in the movie But without the list, it is difficult to connect them with related actors. I think Krista Nell plays "Cora" but under that big hairstyle. Dressing and makeup is difficult. <br /> <br /> Most of them have two-dimensional images by the actors on their part and nobody really stands out. There may be something missing in the scrubbing process. What is positive? The music is atmospheric and of course if you are a lesbian soft porn it has a good external location and I want to know that they filmed the castle on its island. It claims to be located in "Ireland" ( North or Republic?) In the year 1902, so everyone dressed in some sportswear scenes that I found unintentionally funny, especially those sex scenes !!
