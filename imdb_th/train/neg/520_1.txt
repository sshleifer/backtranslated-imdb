After we counted the use of the word f, oh, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes of the movie, listening to the really bad actors that were about women and horses and acting like a 12-year-old child. Free use of vulgarity and humor is a sure sign of the Hollywood movie The Loser, which is the work of an illiterate and incompetent writer. <br /> <br /> We give a second chance by Thinking it would be better, no dice. Later, my girlfriend crossed over the rest of the movie in case it was still updated without dice. <br /> <br /> The main character doesn't have a great motorcycle. <Br/> <br /> I do not recommend this to anyone except the underage teenager or young boy.
