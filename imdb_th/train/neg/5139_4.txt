Many horror fans seem to love Scarecrows, so I won't be very popular in saying that I find it quite boring. The idea behind it is interesting. But seems to drag a lot I think the main problem is that it's in the dark. Sometimes horror movies that are set in the dark can work (like Humongous), but Scarecrows are in the dark for the entire movie. Many times it is difficult to understand what actually happened, and even if some of the scarecrows are creepy But most are hard to see If using more light, maybe it would be better. <br /> <br /> There are not many movies related to the killer scarecrow on my knowledge. I would recommend that more than a scarecrow every day.
