The exorcist of the boring and drab shaman, featuring Doberman with red eyes - that is the extent of the special effects in the drama that was made for the TV. The set and music of the 70's only increase the torture. Should make you sleep as fast as "The Corpse Vanishes" or "The Blue Hand". Worthless. MooCow says that eaghhh is a mew dog! = 8P
