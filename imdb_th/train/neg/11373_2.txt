Not clear from watching this movie (Therefore, I suggest that viewers research the people who present their stories in the movie) but this presentation is about the reality of Islam and the encouragement of violence and intolerance to all non-Muslims. Completely failed to factor in human condition It is one of the documents that the Quran says about many things about how Muslim believers must interact with non-Muslims. But any truth can be realized that not every human being who feels that he is a follower of Islam Agree and follow all doctrines of faith and such systems. There is a reason to ask the presenters thoroughly, such as whether the audience needs to watch the presentation with good health concerns. Do not swallow everything, hook, and machine to cool down without thinking of yourself. <br /> <br /> One specific example is researching people at Walid Shoebat; Those claiming to be past Muslims who have committed terrorism in Bethlehem have many wise people in the world who do not believe in these assertions. I am not or used to be a Muslim. I have never read the Qur'an. I am not a Christian or a member of _any_ Faith, but I am intelligent and intelligent. While this film is quite annoying to present that some Muslims look at their obligations to Islam. I remind you that there is more Islam than the fundamentalist viewpoint.

One tablet is not enough. You will need more. Please use your thoughts and think by yourself, research what is presented and evaluate the state of the world and how Islam suits it more than what is said in the 98-minute video.
