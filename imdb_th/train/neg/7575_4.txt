A retired diplomat, played by Michael York, traveled to Russia to avenge the Russian gangster who killed the police son of a diplomat. There, diplomats found a strong and quality Russian police that helped him lead the Russian gangster into justice. <br /> <br /> I remember the old-fashioned actions of the 80s flicks that often Will show that Russia is bad Rightful US government It is interesting to see this time. Russian men as heroes. <br /> <br /> Not a great flick. In general, it's a "B" action. Michael York lends some classes to movies. In this way, Alexander Nevsky, a Russian police player, was "blah" but surprisingly there was a chemistry with Michael York in front of him, Michael York is a good actor who has a chemical relationship with everyone he Also made the scene The handsome Adrian Paul was frustratingly killed within the first 15 minutes of the movie. Now, if Adrian Paul is in this movie longer than this, it would be an action flick "B" that is above average. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he is really good to watch the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain played by Richard Tyson is your bad guy. He is blonde and very insidious in this movie. <br /> <br /> Rent this flick if there is nothing on the TV that will look okay. Not too bad to suck. The action scenes are good. The performance may be improved, the plot may move much faster. But wait, you'll see that Russia looks like today!
