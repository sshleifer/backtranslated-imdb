I felt the need to watch this movie ever since I found it in the trash, bargained and bought it myself. But I came close many times to close it and just write the money I paid. If you are a fan of blood and sadism, this movie is ok. If there is one thing that the creator of this film knows is the use of creativity in using fake blood and body parts to get nasty results. If that doesn't make you excited, stay away. <br /> <br /> This film was filmed by a home video camera with school props and scary actors. It was dubbed from German. But allowed to do so. This film is about the budget according to the budget that is exempted from the above special techniques. If they spend money with actors and real scripts instead of blood and courage, this movie might be a little more fun. <br /> <br /> Stories about three men on the island. By an army of sadists wearing a tin mask They were arrested and the rest of the movie is about trying to escape. I call it a story in a loose sense because it is a scene of torture and a fight together with rude dialogue. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to exchange about this movie Like blood that is unconscious Consider yourself a reminder
