Truly shows that hype is not everything Illustrated by and what crappy actors abhishek and is just getting a movie because his father and wife Amitabh, as always, is solid. Ajay Devgan, as always, is shy and useless and a new guy is a joke A female lead is a bad actor. This pathetic movie from a respected director and from a large industry like this With movies like this, I have reduced the number of Bollywood movies I watch. <br /> <br /> RGV has created movies that look awful for a while. Spend time getting different actors, is there anyone else? Bollywood wants Madhuri and Kajol to come back. All other top women want to be half-naked. Pffffft
