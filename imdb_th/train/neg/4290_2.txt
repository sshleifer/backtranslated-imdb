I will give this movie with two stars because it is full of beautiful photography. Otherwise, it is often filled with ancient ideas and patterns: mountain people are white trash that is religiously religious, or is a renegade or wise white Indian class. Indians are magical people who move without sound, can disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals and read minds in long distances and so on. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, I still wonder. That the issue of this film is (In addition to showing me the beautiful pictures of mountains, wood huts, various free animals - mountain dwellers and brave people in the church) brave <br /> <br /> Plots Experience a variety of problems But did not explore them in depth This is not a story about growth during the economic downturn or about being an orphan or fighting for identity. It tries to do everything more, which makes it look superficial and satisfying. <br /> <br /> Although this movie should be about Little Tree's education, we don't learn anything. He received a brief summary of the history of his people. (Brave and patient) and refined demonstrations. Try using chopped wood (which he failed) and use whiskey (literally); Learn how to read (And probably wrote) with the help of Grandma and her dictionary - and that is clearly he didn't learn much while studying in a boarding school because he was trapped in the attic. <br /> <br /> However, Grandma and Grandfather and Graham Greene's characters make sure that the end of Little Tree becomes a lot. The spiritual person who has the main goal as an adult - the latter and I paraphrase here "Ride with Navajos" and "Drown in the war a few times" - is "catch up" with Grandma, Grandpa and Graham Green in heaven. (Instead of speaking with a married woman, having children, or other nonsense) <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I must say that I found that the grandfather's trade was disgusting. Why does everything have to be a whiskey? To resist the stereotype of "Drunken India"?
