I think I've seen this before: College graduates don't know that they are all bad, complaining that their lives suck. <br /> <br /> This movie is a derivative of The Big Chill. And bite the truth from what I can do: they have the same plot. <br /> <br /> If there is anything good from snoring this time, it is a song <br /> < br /> As far as I'm concerned, I'm not impressed ... but then again, I never What's even less hope The film is directed by the same person who directed Batman and Robin; Another movie that should be watched with blindfolds. <br /> <br /> Now for judgment: It's 1 in 10.
