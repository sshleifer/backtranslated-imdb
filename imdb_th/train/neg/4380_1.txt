Synopsis: Loving couples decide to participate in a sudden car marriage. They were stuck in a compromise position while the car spoke aimlessly about the countryside until the unfortunate couples were rescued by the staff. <br /> <br /> That's the whole movie. There may be some conversations here and there. But nothing to think of It should now be clear that this movie is not useless, but actually physically painful. The fact that it's starring two of the best actors in the UK (One of them is now a sad person.) Add horror only. <br /> <br /> Ian Charleston stands out in the Oscar winning 'Chariots of Fire'. Think about him in that role and try Hard to pretend that this abomination of celluloid has never happened
