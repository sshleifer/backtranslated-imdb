The main reason for writing this review is that I found that "modifications" of great play and 1972 movies are worth the horrific movie experience. If I can help someone from watching it, I will do good. <br /> <br /> This "new" version is full of talent and everything is wrong. Kenneth Branagh agrees. And sterile He performs filming from every corner, arty, distracting and self-centered. We saw the reflection of the actors in stainless steel on the security screen, shocking their heads from 200 feet above the eyes, close-ups, eyes, chin, and more. Was introduced to the disrespect of gay men who were unhappy with both sides pretending .... I thought ?? Let the character "twist" how do I know? The character of his own, which was drawn up abundantly in the manuscript, was rude and sympathetic. Working hours are cut for an hour, which is the real problem or what the director has done for us. Actors perform effectively But nothing they say or do is believe in the distance Jude Law is superior to Ken. But as a highly regarded producer, there must be a blessing of Branagh. <br /> <br /> All in all, I find it ugly to watch. Why is it done ??? Public who pay spending less than $ 4M worldwide to see it! Vanity work pieces that fail all around
