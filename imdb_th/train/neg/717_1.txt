It's a parody on LOTR-Trilogy, but this is one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. The performance is not good, the screenplay is not good, everything is not good. This is my personal opinion. I do not doubt that there are people who like "humor", but there is a parody of movies from famous directors like Mel Brooks or Zucker Brothers. Two aspects: in the movie it was a great success. (But not large) during the first two weeks But when comments In those who have seen that it is not too good, this movie quickly fell. In the sale of DVDs, it was great for a short period of time, but no one asked again. In the last ten years, the two worst films I've seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I can't decide which one is worse. But I'm glad that there are many good movies. I don't have to think much about this question.
