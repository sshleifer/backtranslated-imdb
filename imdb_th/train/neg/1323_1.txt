It's a simpler time (seventh generation). Simple place. (San Francisco), where men can create simple films about drugs, psychosis, psychotic mania - the crucifixion of Jesus Christ as a woman in acid Events that occur while having multiple nationalities between sexes, regardless of financial responsibility or moral consequences. <br /> <br /> This film is boring, slow, slow, boring, is the worst example of The ruins of an art school Passing into the art in the mid 70s and I love it! When the train collapses at the endless slow zoom and the guitar reflects the acid that is reflected back hard, you won't be able to take your eyes off until it ends in vain and ridiculous. It is a cross between the superstars of Jesus Christ above the Valley of the Dolls and the journey to find acid with your parents on the water bed. It was a train wreck at the same time, which was especially interesting and still a good snapshot of the worst elements. (Or the best) of the seventy-year-old phychadelic type B. Grade <br /> <br /> Plot <br /> <br /> I'll tell you about the plot because you can hardly Can tell what has happened because of past events that have been continually modified that may occur or may not occur with characters that may or may not themselves have nicks cavorting about the repetitive sequences of art drama mime like Street Theater <br /> <br /> "Logan" is the creator The really annoying iconoclast movie that shouts at a lot of people and is surrounded by a silent movie crew. Always drop the acid and have things that look like the penis is not really good. Richard Dreyfus has an additional role as what looks like an accountant. The film crew seemed to hate him for some reason and split into crazy laughter, perhaps even tormenting him. "Suzanne", a character with a blonde willow girl who stepped into space completely and Solace the character "Artist" that is crazy "Artist" is totally crazy. Whether it comes from taking on too many roles or his incredibly terrifying drawings Of course, Susan's sister is all scary. There are other chomping characters that show random cigars. The character "Man", who is still hot for Susan, I guess he has only one person. I never thought he would do anything about it unless everyone had to hate. "That man" at that time and you couldn't make a movie without anyone There are also dumb women. Finally, the girl who is dumb and trusts in me is very stupid.
