If not reading the novel, I can't tell how honest this movie is. This story is a typical mystery: the killer is the target of the newlyweds; A female researcher fell in love with her spouse and was diagnosed with a serious illness. Yes, it looks like a TV series and that's what it plays. The first 2/3 is boring. Save for murder and 1/3. Finally make some return when getting speed to a distorted conclusion. <br /> <br / > The show is quite inferior. Blame the only actor: the screenplay is evil in the last 1/3. You stop to notice because this movie is really interesting. But that is only 1/3 final The director Russell Mulcahy is very much in his composition. But there is only one thing that he can do with the TV budget and network sensors on his back. He is quite limited with fast cutting and distortion of the lens, although he squeezes the "under the floor" pair of images during the murder in the club's bathroom. Unfortunately, this was made for the TV, the great literary details that he used very well with the wider picture, so there was no place to be found. Note to the manufacturer: Give this man a budget and anamorphic lens when you hire him. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This movie is not as good as movie theater standards and mediocre according to TV standards (see CSI instead). In the mood of this film, I recommend: choose a copy of "Deep Red" of Dario Argento (my highest recommendation; Great movies), "Opera" or even "Tenebre". They are stronger in all categories.
