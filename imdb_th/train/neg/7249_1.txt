This movie is a rival "Plan 9" which is one of the most stupid movies ever created. Often worried when the same person is: <br /> <br /> 1 level 2 Director 3. Producer 4. Author 5. Stuntman and 6. Editors Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink can do all 6 jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father are 'Daredevil man', Western style. Maybe that is the problem. <br /> <br /> Here is one example from the movie: In the film, the sheriff must testify to other cities for protection. Of course, criminals search and are waiting for them. But what will happen The good people were riding together and shot and hit the trees near them. When the camera showed us that the bad guys, all of them were sitting on the logs talking. What happened to this picture <br /> <br /> I can go. Maybe this movie is a joke. If so, it doesn't do well as well.
