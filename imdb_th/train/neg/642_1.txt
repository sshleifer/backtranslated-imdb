First of all, if you are a big fan of cartoons, you will be very disappointed. I'm sure! Low budget movies !!! Largo should be a Serbian comic book, now he became a Croatian pfff! The chicken producer gives the spice and courage to the cartoon. (By the way in the movie, his father speaks Serbian and he speaks Croatian ... lol) The remarkable NY Winch building became a typical small yacht in HK Largo that looks good to become. Is the person looking for Tzigan / Turkish that doesn't shave Freddie. The pilot who is 'strenuous' is becoming a big, sad fat and has an average Simon. Good friend of Largo. No! He gave pepper! Largo didn't throw a knife at all. But only the snake stared ... The whole story is confusing and seems to be a pretentious television movie. French director and producer If you do not have the money, ability or technology to properly modify cartoons, please adhere to the romance filmed in Paris. Very bad movie. Good thing I just rented. Don't rely on me to see the sequels (if any).
