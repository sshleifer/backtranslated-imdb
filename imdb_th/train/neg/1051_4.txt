The dramatic performances and the unimaginable presentation when it ended almost felt like you were watching a musical. It seems that Mankiewicz would not know how to present challenging melodies and How can Loesser's melodic work for maximum effect: one example of the best numbers, the introduction of 'Adelaide's Lament', summarized by Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) in the final episode, the carriage lounge; And the spiritual etiquette of Stubby Kaye `Sit down, you are Rockin 'The Boat'. There is a support group of his singers sitting on a folding chair while he is standing there. Mankiewicz captures all the fun from everything by allowing The still scene continued for too long and his conversation (Adapted from Abe Burrows' stage book) There is no idea what his movie, like 'All About Eve', part of the offense must go into leadership, just about everyone who is wrong: Marlon Brando. Looked bewildered as to why he was a musician. Frank Sinatra played the character too well and had no edge which made him necessary.

Only Blaine, an actress who loves Adelaide, has received orders from us like a professional. The colorful artistic direction is by Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol creating a flashy scene.
