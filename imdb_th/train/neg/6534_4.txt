This sci-fi adventure is not the best and not the worst. I agree with the message that sci-fi is not that funny. The strange pink staining and unusual special effects make this a favorite for late and slow audiences. Space explorers on the Martian planet fight monsters, giant amoeba and other pretty monsters. <br /> <br /> Actors include Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Comfortable and enjoyable. Don't feel bad if you nod a moment. I agree to add this to the classic cult list that shouldn't be missed.
