Jeez only in the 70s ... Antonio Marguerite brought us the western spaghetti species and flicked kung fu that developed around the treasure hunt. The spice of worthless co-production between Shaw Brothers and an outside Italian company, including telling comedic stories, out-of-the-box events and the very tame and T&A. Presented by Lee Van Clef's terrifying wig, Yancey Hobbitt, an assaulted gunner with a frightening and cute movie. A witty dialogue, hilarious background music and a completely ridiculous effect, along with a small incident (especially the jump of Lo Lieh). <br /> <br /> While small actions It's great to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen and you can't deny the charm of this pair. Don't expect too much and you will get many benefits. <br /> <br /> This is my truth. what's yours
