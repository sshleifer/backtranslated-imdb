Many years ago I saw The Godfather and it made a lasting impression on me. The atmosphere of this movie is a first-class movie, a memorable performance and a classic storyline. Recently, I bought Trilogy and after watching episode 1 Once again, I was eager to watch Episode 2 ...... I was very glad to know from the beginning in Part 2 that this is the right track for the great Godfather movie. Everything again It's perfect and I can't wait to meet Godfather III ........ wrong! I hope I will stop at II. The story is not good. It seems to me to be a story created to have a story, a weak character, especially a daughter. Pacino's adopted son is a weak character who will be eaten dead in Godfather 1 or 2. Then scenes such as Corleone that were invested with the jewelry of the Catholic Church with a choir full of killer on horseback are not visible. The helicopter firing machine of the meeting (the 'goodies' went out and everyone was shot), daughter and cousin rolled the 1st of the pasta across the board, the pathetic shooting in the process ..... Corleone stuffed the candy down. with Orange juice for diabetics (A man with intelligence and trickery isn't ready for an emergency?) ... No, it's not good and with the best intentions in the world, I won't be able to see it again, but I'll watch 1 & 2 many times during many years ago
