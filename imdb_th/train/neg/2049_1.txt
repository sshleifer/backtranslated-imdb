At least I was able to enjoy the movie parody that was surprising since I could hardly sit and watch. From all truth, I guess the DVD box cover is more expensive than all movies. And said that it was the same director as The Boogeyman. When the new version that just came out ... the cute man made it misleading enough to tie me up, the only thing that made me more disappointed than the unreliable performances Imitating his hairstyle Usually you will see me like that in a ten year old boy and the character acts like it. The movie looks like it was shot by a D + student who graduated from a movie school, some of which were excited to use all movie techniques that he had studied while attending school ... sometimes less than more friends. All the time I will get lost by twisting the plot randomly, leading to where or not explained. All this creates a bad movie. But when the ending didn't come close to pulling it together, it made it a particularly bad movie. There is no doubt that this is the worst movie I have ever seen and that includes the final video of France for my friends in the middle of last year. But maybe I am biased. I mean, I have played specially. PS I don't think this should be a star ... not even half. No for you !!
