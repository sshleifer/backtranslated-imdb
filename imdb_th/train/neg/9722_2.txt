I don't really like this movie .... mostly because of the main character! They are both selfish and selfish young people. They hurt everyone around them. They play silly games. Visual effects are good. But the good thing is that they do not have the characters you connect to or have interesting stories. Should I be happy when the two psychopaths finally come to their love? <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I thought "Is this probably the number 1 from France?" ........ <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> For the ending: Good driving ! They both deserve it! <br /> <br />
