good! One thing that can be said? Firstly, this adjustment is too long in 4 hours for complexity. (Or lacking this) of the plot, the actors try hard to create something of this movie But there was too little content for the time. Swayzee was not a character in the Quatermain group after seeing Sean Connery's interpretation of the great man in "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen". Swayzee didn't give a rating. The chanting with this Winchester rifle has no strength, height, subtlety or humor that is necessary for this chapter, and everyone, including the witch doctor, seems to have more confidence as an actor. The rest of the cast Some scenery is my favorite. But there are errors in the movie For example. When a happy team arrives in a deserted pit, their path will appear as an oasis, just waiting for them to come in. Climbing out of the mine leads to the exit (in the next match). There's nothing like the exit that can be seen from the pathway that they climbed and so on. I waited for Doug McClure to appear at any time. In some ways, I hope he will have <br /> <br /> The leader of the Russian people who follow Quatermain is a formidable character that shot everything. <br /> <br /> Swayzee can do quite Well, like a sad father who returned to London, unable to take care of his son, Swayzee should stick to that. He was unable to take part of the brave gentleman with a strong heart, life experience and a sense of fair play. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
