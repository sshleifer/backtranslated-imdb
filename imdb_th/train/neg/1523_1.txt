This movie must be the largest steaming division C * ^ p that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> What can I say other than BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD? Nothing to help. This 'movie' and I pray that they never talk about creating a sequel. If you are thinking of watching this, you should know that the story is two men dragged in to save the world. Movies like Men in Black were torn into pieces and brought together to create this 'Comedy' but failed completely. Please avoid this film. (Help yourself too)
