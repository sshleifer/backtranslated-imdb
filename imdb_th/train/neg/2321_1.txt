I can't believe that this show still ranks 9th out of 10. Can I see if those votes are in the first 2 seasons? But will someone give you a high score after that? I am a big fan of Season 1. I was hooked - mysterious events, suspicions, all unexplained events. You never know what will happen next. At the second season, I still looked honestly. But was a little disappointed that some basic things still could not be explained And instead of giving you more answers, it seems to have more questions. I love to be anxious But you have to throw people into bones every time and let them watch. <br /> <br /> Now I can't remember that I finally closed enough. - and you shouldn't miss a clear episode to keep track of what's going on So it's not worth my efforts anymore. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that they can't be clever anymore. I agree with some posters that show that ABC has just coveted and decided to see how long they can stretch their expression. Did they not know that in the end they would have lost more fans than they would have received?
