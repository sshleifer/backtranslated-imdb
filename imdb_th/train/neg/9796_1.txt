Okay, I can't think of anything worse than the PR series seriously. There are many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers has a GOT at the bottom of this list. You think of something stupid than five to six teenagers. (Not acting like a normal teenager) Dancing around in different colored suits so that you can tell them that your fans have met with real people who rise up against the mental walls and rise almost immediately. And continue to fight without injury? Power Rangers is a five-year-old boy and believes me. I never liked this item even though I was five years old. <br /> <br /> I guess you can say that Dino Thunder is an exception. Teens act like teenagers, and Tommy Oliver acts like a mentor or a teacher. It's a joke for teenagers even though the fight is weak. But I didn't hate Dino Thunder. <br /> <br /> Many people say that Power Rangers are disgusting. But I refuse It would be an insult to shit. So have to face it. The five year old boy, Power Rangers, is rubbish.
