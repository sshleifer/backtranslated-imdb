This is a terrible movie. It hurt me a lot. Almost every action will not be stimulated in the context of the movie. The performance is terrible. (P.Diddy is the best actor. Some links to the way of Carlito are ok. For example, his dream of one day moving to the Caribbean But overall they are weak Love, interest in my thoughts, was banned out wrong. But hey that is debatable However, I didn't expect much before watching the movie and I think you can say even if those expectations aren't met. I feel bad with J. Hernandez because he is actually a good actor (Friday Night Lights). He's lucky because I'm sure there won't be too many people watching this movie In general, I rate a good movie if they spark my interest. I will go ahead and give these two stars. Good luck next time And yes i enjoy the way of Carlito
