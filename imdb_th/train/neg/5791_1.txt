As a native film instructor, I can honestly say that this may be one of the worst movies with native content that I have ever seen. I want to get Root Canal more than watching this movie again. Using an unconventional attempt to use some of the traditional coyote stories and bad camera work is worse than the original, non-creative story. Writers and directors have shown the worst part of colonial methods to show that indigenous people and communities If this person is a native, they have to go home and apologize to everyone who knows that it is an apple and for internal racism and bad humor that they developed. If this person is not a native, they must seriously check their white rights again and ask themselves if they show racism that is not unintentionally examined or does not know that they are intend My only hope is that the native actors in this movie had a good time and at least received money for their efforts. If you want to watch good native movies, try: Christmas in the clouds, dance, I am off the river, Ya Ya, Paw wow road, highway signs, smoke ... give a few names.
