Another great film from Costa-Gavras. It is an excellent presentation of the situation: Latin America and the United States participate in Latin American politics. Facts may be true or may not be accurate. But it is true that the United States is heavily involved in the coup and supporting dictators in Latin America. <br /> <br /> Despite this, though, the spirit of the movie follows. The propaganda of the Cold War era, Costa-Gavras is a famous communist sympathizer and his films are always biased. For example, he shows the actions of the United States as cruel and inhumane while showing Tupamaros' radical activities as good. <br /> <br /> When it comes out, it's a blessing for Uruguay and The rest of Latin America, where the United States is involved, Europe is full of poor Eastern European prostitutes. I have never heard about poor Uruguayan or Chilean women for prostitution as it happened in most Eastern European countries. The United States is fighting a dirty war and God bless all of us who defeated the Soviet Communists. Unfortunately, the United States must do in Latin America (and elsewhere), but sometimes you have to play dirty. This is not the ideal world that Costa-Gavras and Matamoros like to believe. If Matamoros came to power in Uruguay, we will get Ukraine again in Latin America. <br /> <br /> All in this movie is based. Leftist ideology and bankruptcy of the past and trying to pass it on ideals and morals corrected.
