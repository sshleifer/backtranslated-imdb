Here I go with the movie industry B, another story. It's very sad to see movies that do not work well. But I do not care whether the industry B or C industry produces this film or not. Show your work effort The character is really bad. The show didn't have a problem with this (surprise), but the plot was that a tight team would witness how to mediate their two fellow soldiers and continue as if nothing had happened The thing that made me sick was that the writer threw the remaining scenes for the members whom they joke about the doctor's leave. Let me take a break.
