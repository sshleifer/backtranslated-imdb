The evidence of this movie has been explained and if you have come this far, you don't have to pretend that I am a movie critic. When talking about my opinion in this movie is quite low. I am a fan of Takashi Miike, but it goes down in the category of bad work, along with DOA 2 and 3 and so on. (Much) <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be free. Passed because it was a Takashi movie and nothing Takashi did wrong. This is how the cinema in high school. For the rest of us, we will meet with the children for an hour and a half, with a screaming without real reason, completely annoying. (And yes, this thing is taken out of the movie) The pace of this film almost reaches the level of rigomortis and serves ... Well ... Um. <br /> <br /> If anyone is a fan of Takashi You will see it regardless of your interest. It doesn't have any originality (see endless stories) or any character development from the lead characters when facing conflict. <br /> <br /> As pointed out, this is the first movie. Where Miike is credited with co-writing But that doesn't mean that we hope to be Miike's personality into the screen. All we get is the Miike Token image that the director <br /> <br /> The film has the potential to be a great thing. The evidence is not difficult to run away with. But this one seems to be running on the floor. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is if you just go into Miike with some standards like Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then watch the movie in his work Such as Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Blue Bird of China
