With that kind of title, it surpasses my understanding of how this movie will not attract me. Get there, decently unbelievable moments and a little gore. But the way this film was shot and the story overall just struck me as an idiotic and lazy effort that used many "shock" tactics .. . A man who raped and killed a woman caught on the side of the road He and his supportive brother were held in custody until the brothers broke up and managed to meet his girlfriend in the forest. He forced her into the house where they were screwed and later showed him a group of people kidnapped in the basement. The prisoners who use heavy drugs include her ex-boyfriend who raped her as a neighbor "Grabby" and her sexual abrasion leader. He explained to her that he would kill them all. She stopped killing him and turned her attention to the man (or pig) that she tortured and killed herself ... Most of the violence and humiliation involves the penalty and the destruction of the entire genitals. far From interference and tenderness The best scene is obsessed with the broomstick. The graphic is followed by the pain of being raped ... Of course, "I spit in your body. IP! Ss on your grave." Based on the majority of the titles and references that the main character gave - suggesting her mother is Camille Keaton. I consider it private to insist on insulting! This movie is boring and is an amateur that is trying to scare. But without success ...
