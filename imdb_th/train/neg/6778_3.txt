Oh dear ... dear <br /> <br /> For fans, JM is a nail in the coffin as much as she has in Hollywood Hollywood career. After the girl couldn't help. Wayward Bus, The Burglar and Rock Hunter. It seems that Jayne would become one of Tinsel Town's hottest stars. This relegated to Mansfield, saying that the cheap euro loans made Fox able to make her contract faster. Wasting everyone's time, except Suzy Parker, which is the only thing in this movie that is not good enough for the content. Many people blame Jay for being pathetic and her horrible performances for the film's bad return at the box office, and while she is hurt in this film, she does the best with the content Finally, Carrie barely sets the scene on fire? After picking up a good number of drama and comedy, it turned out that she spent 10 steps as a serious actress by accepting (Just to appear with Grant) to show a frantic threat Alice's characters are complete cartoons and although she looks good enough to eat in a boiler set But her presence in this film makes your nerves chaotic. We all know that Jay can do better than this waste, and here she is marching around like a rewarding pudding. True shame. <br /> <br /> Steer clear of this funny story. It's more depressing than funny.
