Dahmer, a confused young man, Dahmer is a movie that creates confusion. True, I have a few beers while watching movies. But that didn't explain why I was bored with this flick. <br /> <br /> The event didn't happen. But confusing and annoying The beginning and the end, the only thing that can be understood in the movie is the explanatory text at the beginning and the end of the movie. Between things that will be a movie is just a boring and time-consuming picture. <br /> <br /> We have never seen the actual murder. Sometimes you feel that Dahmer dreams about all things. But you know that he is not because it is true and that this happened at least But what happened It's not easy to tell <br /> <br /> I don't encourage people to waste time on this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't like it a bit and I feel cheated when it ends. Immediately down <br /> <br /> * / *****
