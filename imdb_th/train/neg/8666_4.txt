The thriller made from this TV is all about the little action. It works hard to set up a complex outline. But the writing is confusing, so the exhibition is still the most cloudy. At the end, I didn't know anything about these characters more than the first episode. It has a virtual situation "Little Ten Indians", but it flows through the middle of the path to see Sally Field's interest and the revelation of the killer. The field is doing too much here, with the insolence that I rarely see from her. The early introduction was good, but writing fast, off-course and ultimately was a must. Many hysteria and constant thunder and lightning effects (Which does not add anything) The failure caused by producer Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg. With all these abilities, they could not give anything more than a script full of red birds and Sally Field hidden in the cabinet Clothes or not?
