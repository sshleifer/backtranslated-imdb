This film plays a role in social criticism when in reality it is nonsense, like racism that is condemned. The location of this film: African-American = Strong ... Other races = weak The worst part is when Rapaport pulls the gun at Omar Epps and the Jewish male, stereotypical Jewish man falls in fear. And began pleading for his life ... but Omar Epps, the strong, strong and strong, stood without fear In addition, we have been condemned by all sibling members as drunken priests or rapists. Of course, the white girl who was raped began to consider femininity because she was a weak white woman. When a stupid white man was rejected by a fraternal member, he certainly had to fall into the head of the skinhead, an incredibly coward. Especially the big muscle men that were hit quickly by a strong black man ... BUSTA RHYMES won his double size ??? Yeah, <br /> <br /> Of course, black people never refused their people and Omar Epp easily moved in with them. The scene where the Ice Cube threatened a white roommate. Of course, he was a guardian while a weak white roommate sat in his fear and eventually moved out. This movie is terrible and the ending makes me laugh out loud. The slow movement is too long between Epps and Banks. Make a hilarious face with the faces they make - it's like watching my nephew and cousin face (And they are under 5) do yourself a favor and cross this crapfest
