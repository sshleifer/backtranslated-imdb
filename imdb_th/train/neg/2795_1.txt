Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts the gun in her mouth that blows behind her head and goes out with his girlfriend Neil (Jason Dibler). Cassidy is a rock band singer. "Demons and Death" that cannot shake the sad feelings of her abandoned girlfriend (You know that I can find other ways to solve this problem rather than put a bullet into your head.)

In the vocals so that the group could finish the album, stopped by Cassidy, died premature But Cassidy made a deal with the darkness and the spirit was collected .. He was overwhelmed by anger towards Neil. But the band members or anyone in the music studio will die when they fall victim to which they believe to be Rather dizzy. Dora .. No, Cassidy returned to payback. <br /> <br /> Lousy's small budget horror movie looks cheap. There are cheap actors who should plan on other lines and have a cheap killing scene. Didn't happen Not even effective at all
