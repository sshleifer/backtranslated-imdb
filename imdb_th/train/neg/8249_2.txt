Hiya people <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is really bad. Think of "true love". On the contrary, there is nothing that is properly properly. There is nothing that is connected and of course there is nothing to make you laugh Love is rare in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's all a failure. However, as stated, there are three points to exchange for the potential of this film. <br /> <br /> A) With the bill of Jennifer Love Hewitt, there will be hordes of people who Will succumb to watching Just to see Hewitt's glittering petite body with matching clothes To tell you now .... there are scenes that promise ... "possibility" here is watered down Anyway, I have seen all the things that are tempted by your next scene that know ..... vibration! <br /> <br /> B) The ending is romantic and positive. That is the opposite and "north" is related ..... but for me still a positive point <br /> <br /> C) Dougray Scott plays a friendly person who is cute ... ..... Refresh! Thank You! <br /> <br /> 2/5 Not worth your 10 dollars. <br /> <br /> 2/3 In passing, I believe Jennifer Love Hewitt becomes a softcore legend. next Even if I take it back now ..... It hinges heavily on her next movie. <br /> <br /> Oh and your sister is very stupid. Her husband is stupid ... and what the hell is she a fool? <br /> The next time, can't wait for the next love. JLH!
