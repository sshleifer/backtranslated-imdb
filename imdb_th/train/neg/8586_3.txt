Really disappointing ... The best story of Prequel. But the story is weak, the storyline is hasty and the result is a set of parts. There are many continuous errors that contradict the original film and the occurrence of Darth Vader has been horribly manipulated that what might be a legendary moment in modern movies has become a joke to be ridiculed. many year I will not complain about the deep conversation, because this is the Star Wars ... Three movies, original, stylish, religious feelings and broken stories, and exotic conversations have added to the prequels. Make more money and this lack of love is shown in the hoe. Most frustrating
