Tatie Danielle is about a gruesome old witch who tortured her beloved family and forgotten. There is a small subtitle that may be related to the French colonial past. But mostly only Daniel who did things (such as deliberately leaving small children in the park), which soon a man would hold his teeth with a broken finger Sadly, it didn't happen here. It looks good and the performance is good and there is nothing wrong with the concept, but it's just SMUG. God made this movie. Love yourself. Unfortunately it's not smart or funny as you think. The only impulse in the show - sorry, the movie - came from Daniel, more disgusting and nasty, and the only surprise came from watching the more improbable way she did. Correct, just like Sitcom, which is this with a 'bonus', more from the delusion of greatness and time spent 110 minutes.
