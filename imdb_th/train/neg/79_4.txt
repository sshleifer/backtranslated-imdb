The original book of this book was created in 1950, but that was not done for the TV series because most people watched the style of 1930. Surprisingly, the subway near the end was a 1950's train painted Looks like a train in 1930, so the subway can play this game as well Hanging the story on the plot about Jarrow March is weak, but the 50th generation has students starting to think about the world around them. So I think that making them think about the poverty of travelers is the same. Everything about Japp that has to respond to himself is also weak. But they have to put something to fill the time This should be a good half-hour show, or they can shoot a book and make it a longer show. Apparently now is a victim of style rather than content.
