Lamphun National was once a funny magazine. Whether you like hippie days at stoners in the late sixties or days, the head, coke, and gratefulness of the seventies (When the joke is added with many empty babies) depends on your birth date. But everyone agreed In the early eighties, the middle age had killed what was left of the spark, anarchy, humor, drugs that didn't, and the presentation, like this movie, and the record spun off more horrific, shot the next hole in the boat. In addition to the well-known title sequence, there is nothing to suggest this surprisingly depressing stinkbug. If you do it through the messy open part 'Growing Myself', hope that everything will improve and good luck - they can't. Anyone who thinks that the idea of ​​a woman raped brutally with a butter stick is a joke that deserves from his head. If there is a shortage of guitars around the world, the objection of this tour, the lack of continuity of bad ideas and horrible performances may serve some purposes.
