I am a big fan of the Western, but this one .... Wow, what is it! I think things are off. I almost get off the bat as a crazy dialog box. I think I should be able to write conversations better than when I was in the eighth grade. And poor actors! From this terrifying conversation, no one is looking for anything but really ridiculous. I'm not kidding. Here are some of the better things you'll get in the Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. He may be a "big" star in this film, which if you call it B-Western, you will be overwhelmingly praised. This is what should be called B-minus the west, maybe Pity Stirling Hayden, who appeared at other times, along with Joan Crawford, Betty Davis, Frank Sinatra and other important talents for him to appear in the vehicles This pity must be something that he is trying to overlook throughout his life. <br /> <br /> One of the annoying things about this movie is that every man looks like they don't shave A week and their faces are all greasy. I know that in the ancient Western people did not care well. But for men, this is a movie that makes you want to go 'EWWWW!' Really, this is a formidable western food. Denver Pyle has to live like this, especially after appearing in many great westerns. Bad movies
