Do not understand me wrong, this movie has beautiful, amazing images and the content is amazing. However, it was a big disappointment, and actually I was very angry with what Disney did. <br /> <br /> BBC's Planet Earth is all about it. It's subtle. It has an overall sense of balance. And shows the circle of life and death With tragedy and victory, loss and gain It's balanced. <br /> <br /> Disney's Earth correction isn't this thing. They tried to make a movie that Americans talked about. They made it DRAMATIC. They placed popular musical scores there to make us scared. They make evil hunters They do bad things They found that every encounter was negative. It tries to be suspicious and successful. But with the cost of the lesson of balance This film takes one and a half hours to show negative and positive results in just 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Everybody prevents me from warning the world. <br /> That's another story. It's on the big screen But disappointed in the image quality It looks better on TV at home. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something like this and take all the pictures out to buy, rent or borrow the BBC Planet Earth series, it's a better lesson. Sounds better and (if You have Blu-Ray.) Better image quality.
