The movie is very bad. Nuff said that <br /> <br /> These lines are just a fill. This movie is not good. Why do I have to expand without knowing it? This is a waste of my time. I just want to remind others Avoid this film The performance is terrible and the writing is not boring at all This film is a bad and completely unbelievable garbage. <br /> <br /> Ok, now I just want to use IMDb for stupid rules with 10 lines of minimum text. First of all, I wasted time watching this device. Then I felt compelled to warn others. I created an account with IMDb just to discover that I had to write Friggen on the film to show how bad I thought it was. Totally unnecessary
