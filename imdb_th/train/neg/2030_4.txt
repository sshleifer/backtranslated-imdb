Comments by "eliz7212-1" percussion "nail on the head" that is a proverb for the turkey of this program. But it was honking to watch William Shatner "cavort" and "dancing" (yes, the sign "" in the dance, the word is necessary for what the bill did). This performance is a great panic On SNL or MAD TV - and give a few stars for viewing once or more to see the Shatner that seems to take "camp" to a new peak - whether it's a role or a character. But men A funny person <br /> <br /> women In the small area where the game is promoted, it is rather unfortunate when this turkey is canceled - unless there is a revival of the whiska-go-go type that needs resurrection for a shapely girl to dance. In a high cage again, <br /> <br /> I watched the first contestant who is annoying and truly "stupid: post" still through luck, walking out a quarter of a mile or more. The second contestant is more intelligent. But the lucky winner who received $ 1,000 from Jeopardy !, got a zonked card that had to answer a special question that he didn't know and left with zilch. <br /> <br /> This game is shown for some time with many prizes To the general public is an overall effort to try to seek audiences Although the host is well compensated and they give six numbers on average, I think the revenue and cost should be good - because you don't have a sitcom that has many stars getting six or seven figures. Continue with a lot of deals as well. <br /> <br /> But I think that even the better ones will be thin. This is up to this point. I think his proposal, especially with James Spader and others about "Boston Legal", should provide a satisfactory amount for Bill Shatner's proposal. <br /> <br /> Again, scoring next. The tree is suitable for viewing the Bill hoot and perhaps once; That should be enough
