PROM NIGHT (2008) <br /> <br /> Directed by: Nelson McCormick <br /> <br /> Starring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis <br /> <br /> Story: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) saw the death of her entire family at the hands of the Master (Jonathan Schaech), who had faintness. Now she is preparing a senior prom with her annoying friend. They started to die one by one because the murderer had escaped from the prison and nobody cared for Donna's warning because it was clear that her promise was too important to interrupt. <br /> <br /> Pros: I laughed badly. Because the conversation is terrible and the dumb character moves. <br /> <br /> Example: <br /> <br /> Everyone decided not to tell Donna that the man who was obsessed with her was strange. (She wasn't that big) escaped from prison. Their reason: They don't want to shame her in front of all of her friends. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Let's start by saying that I'm a big fan. I usually enjoy even the bad guys. I also like horror movies PG-13 TOURIST TRAP (1979). One of my favorites has been rated PG. I also enjoy POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that this is a dumb movie that PG-13 has no relation to me that doesn't enjoy movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, I have a big problem with the story. I like movies without stories. At least they can have fun. This is about a teacher who fell in love with his students, so he killed all of her family. A few years later he tried to make her up by destroying Brahma and killing all of her friends ...? Then there is a sub-plan that I suspect is interested in. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend. She is cramping and I don't care. This should be a lifelong feature, not a remake of the NIGHT PROM. <br /> <br /> ... This is a slasher movie that has a horrible death scene. I do not even care that it is not filled with blood. Slash I like some people. (Halloween, the original prom night curtain) is not full of blood. Here we have half of the characters who are dying in the room outside the same room. The woman is stabbed many times without stabbing and the close-up of the actor's face is bad as he screams with the jet. Pain I'm sure the 10-year-old girl is scared, but not me. <br /> <br /> I hate the character. There is a girlfriend Bobby (Scott Port) with Donna's unrealistic feelings and I almost Will guarantee that you will never meet a sensitive girlfriend in your life unless you are a gay man Then we have an annoying friend of Donna Clare (Starbucks) and Lisa (Dana Davis) and Token referring to the Chrissy girl (Brian Davis). If you think That the characters in DEATH PROOF are annoying. Try watching this movie And don't let me start with Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and DJ (Jay Phillips) who give my past and the performance of SHE'S Usher ALL that <br /> <br /> soundtrack and lack of Great respect for original content and you have a very bad smell.
