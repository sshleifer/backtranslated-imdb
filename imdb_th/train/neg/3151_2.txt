"Must be you" is another sign that Hollywood lacks ideas. This picture about Charlie Hudson, a former police officer turned the author. When Charlie's fiance goes out of town, he is stuck with all the wedding planning. He spent a week at a fancy hotel and met Anna Penn, a newly married teacher. The two quickly became friends and planned to organize a wedding separately. This is when the story is boring. Charlie falls in love with Anna and she has to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie shows off all the romantic jokes that were made and you wait to finish the movie so you can do something else. Micahel Vartan And Natasha Henstridge provide extraordinary performances that make this movie even more appealing.
