When I adjusted the news this morning for the first time, I thought "Wow, finally, some entertainment." It's a little amusing for a week or more ... but we have to face it. These news reporters (If anyone can call them) there is a way to "play around" too. <br /> <br /> At first I think Jillian is a fresh breath. But seriously, this woman is not the least reporter in her. She is very professional. She still interrupted Steve when he began to inform the audience about some news reports. It's really annoying until the moment I can't see anymore. <br /> <br /> Jillian is not a good journalist. She is more famous than being a celebrity. So she changed to celebrities around the celebrities that she should interview immediately. She is not very professional and may understand her relationship with celebrities more important than being an insatiable journalist and that's all I can say about you. <br /> <br /> In addition ( Disappointed) This program has more entertainment news Report the necessary news about the world, the United States government, or something that will be useful and / or provide services for the best of the public. They are focusing on the excitement that everything they talk about is a commercial product. On the other hand, their field journalists have interesting patience ... <br /> <br /> I believe "Good Day LA" for teenagers and celebrities and certainly not for people who are interested in news. < br /> <br /> Note: (I really want to see KTLA, but they try hard to have fun. Sometimes they are still boring. Okay, I'll stick with NBC "Today" ABC. "Good Morning America" ​​is also available ... as long as Diane Sawyer is not too serious
