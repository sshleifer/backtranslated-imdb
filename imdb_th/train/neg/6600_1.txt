Yowza! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you are a better person than me! This film, while making a lot of effort to 'imitate' Laurel and Hardy through the appearance, sound and routine, is too short to honor them or even be a movie. Anyway, I blame Larry Harmon. The dialogue was torn from the old L + H movie and planted in an unrealistic way. The plot is confused with the useless characteristics of the co-star that is no longer necessary. Pinchot's accent is strange for Stan and while That Sartain works great Difficult to create a wonderful mixture that is Mr. Hardy. Where is the musical number (good)? Editing is absent, the performance is stiff, horrid lines, that physics - unbelievable - (although they He might try to make it feel cheap.?) And overall, it's a very scary thing. It was more painful to watch than ATOLL K, the legendary partner, filmed their latest film in the 1950s of horror writing and photography. Make yourself a favorite and watch the movie Laurel and Ha. As much as I can and learn how things happen. You know what MAGNATE is, right? Stan Laurel did not respond with a cool sentence in every sentence. <br /> <br /> I pity anyone who thinks this is an improvement / honor for a good child. Where is the classic theme song! ? Why is it causing damage? 'This is another mess.' Why skip any 'smart', why are there so many stars? Why did you experience the Wizard of Oz? Why LARRY HARMON must be in there? Why BOZO !? Learning channels and funding help this? <br /> <br /> I mean really. Fart jokes for God's sake. <br /> <br /> Fart jokes.
