Weak plot, unusual cars, unlikely and helpless characters At first I thought that this movie was created during the seventies because of the quality of the picture, including the story and the drama that looked from the old Kojac episode when I checked and found that it was actually created until the end of the year-97. Surprisingly, this is one of the worst and least movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If you read this, it is recommended if you see that you waste your time doing something very exciting. More than this Like watching dry colors
