Someone wants to send this Uli Lommel man back to MOVIE SCHOOL. Who ever told him he knew how to make a movie? Can anyone create a movie? In the past, it was always necessary to have a talent before filmmakers. After watching this weak BTK movie and other things that he had created, it seems blatantly obvious that the poor had a lot of movies. Actually, I think even though I could make a better movie than Uli. LAME-ALL This movie has nothing to do with BTK Killer, apart from the names of victims and murderers. That's it. Where is this guy in the big idea that BTK killed those? People with rats and other nasty shit that is in the movie? This is a classic example of someone trying to trick people into watching their movie, according to the word "BTK" because of the reputation gained. Absolutely pathetic The serial killer movie that I will consider WORSE is a weak DAHMER movie. The child smokes so much that I feel nauseous. Anyone who does that must be shot.
