Misty Ayers has a body that is smoking and that's all this film is about. Flick, pure exploitation I started playing the game myself, counting the number of times they circled the orchestra. And of course, music is not completely related to the scene.

What I learned from this movie: Women's flat pants were in 1954. I'm talking about Sigourney Weaver in the real alien movie underwear at least 20 in the first 30 minutes. Her clothes are laid out comfortably (except for bra and trunks) and scary copies that lead to "Be careful! Godzirra! "
