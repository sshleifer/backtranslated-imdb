When my friend gave me a set of "12 Amazing Scifi / Horror Movies", I was quite careful. But because this piece is a gift, I don't really care about my common sense. After all .... Free movies! So if they are a little ropey after being considered hard, Alien Intruder is the first film. It is the first choice because it looks best in the group. Everything I can say is that if this is the best of them, I will tremble when I think of the rest. <br /> <br /> On the surface, there are good things. Four actors. People (count 'em!) That I am familiar with Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conaway. I told myself ... "Billy and Tracy are in good condition. (Star Wars and Babylon 5, respectively) So they won't apply to be a turkey. Max is a professional actor who never broke into the movie .... but don't act too low. ... Well ... He's doing well and not as good as the movies and TV will go. "I soon discovered that Jeff decided to add. "Ugliness" in his movie <br /> <br /> The first clue is in the opening scene. Jeff Glass, with gusto through the scene "I'm crazy" before finally killing himself A really fun pendant Unfortunately, this is the highlight of the movie. It's down from there. <br /> <br /> To the top, we have the commander of the mission (Williams) who is being sent out to see what happened to Jeff and his team. Being busy with choosing new friends from the group Criminal element But this classification is not much. Dirty Dozen - more like Unconvincing Foursome. In addition, one of the hacker computer criminals appeared in his cell using a laptop computer. Isn't it like letting the killer run a gun shop in a cage? If so, then you ask me for a moment. <br /> <br /> Finally, they really took out the effect. It seems that the spacecraft model will be hit in the afternoon with 8-year-old people who are tired of the rest of his Airfix series. <br /> <br /> But the horror doesn't stop there. While traveling to the area where Jeff's ship is missing, the criminals will receive a reward for good behavior by receiving a virtual reality weekend, in which they immerse themselves in the imagination of men. Everything is good and good, and the use of scenes from their imagination serves as an introduction to "Alien Menace", which began to appear there. But they have to drag it out to see some Alien invaders? Alien Boring too. <br /> <br /> Finally, they make the G-Sector and the alien presence make them fight for showing her love until only the old Max left. are Truly ending in the veins of optimism, hinting at the sequel - as if! The appearance in this film is the character that I will nickname "Sweatdroid". He should be a robot. But clearly the truth has disappeared with the makeup team, which makes him sweat whenever But don't worry, he is there to count the body at the end. <br /> <br /> Williams and Scott Jin are real people. They just woke up almost without doing anything. And as I have said before, Jeff traveled to the shower so fast, so his madness was not allowed to clarify the film. Max tries his best as well as other actors, but this movie is completely cruel for honesty. <br /> <br /> One and only one thing that is imagined in the half-way that this film offers Is Ship naming convention They are named after musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of this movie looks polite and uninspiring. <br /> <br /> I think in the first look, it's one of the 80's for the job Per video It seems that they are still making shit movies in the 90's. It looks like <br /> <br /> It's the best avoidance. Even when the movie, beer and chips, this film is a foul odor. But at least you can fast forward, I think
