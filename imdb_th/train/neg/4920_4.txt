Simple, modern (Make hip modern) improve Dracula story (Although it is based on the traditional tradition) with interesting stories, if not fully understand the story of the dark prince The first time I tried to watch it, I could only do half way before losing interest. Again it started well. (Especially the scene with the bandits and Dracula) but for me it is less relevant when it hits New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. But never take advantage of its location (Despite the carving of heaven in the curse that Dracula can grow) produced by Wes Carven (and yes, they cast that name) but wrote / directed by Patrick Lussier. Like a few dreams But some kinetic modifications and cheap jolts do not help. The messy script looks very stupid. Lussier runs a polished finish that still looks quite glassy and inserts a lot of blood. (Makeup can be done properly) and many "Virgin" advertisements. No, I don't mean virgins because it's a music company because there are many appointments and Helsing's daughter works there as well. Oh, that's not an obvious plantation. The soundtrack is an interesting choice of rock music. Now the show is all over the shop. But there are a few familiar faces (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick, Thomas, Nathan Full, Shane West and Lochlin Munroe) Gerard Butler as Dracula Didn't come out He is an elegant woman at night. Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan are Dracula's brides. The likes of Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are fine. Christopher Plummer turns gray while Van Helsing and Omar Epps enjoy his role.
