Josh Hartnett's dead eyes, its thickness and Harrison Ford is a comedian! This is the 3 reasons why you don't like to avoid and spend 116 minutes in your life. <br /> <br /> Buddy Police Movie is fun. However, their true golden age came back in the 1980s and 1990s. Making things that try to combine action and humor through Hollywood police is definitely a good idea. But the end result of that thing turned out that at least was a scam of sub-categories But the reason for God to be merciful to everyone The movie of the same type, while their worst is all over (Hollywood Homicide). <br /> <br /> What really happens with this entertainment formula! Since the past decade, things have never been the same. You will have stubbornness as a close friend. I will make you happy with the title to deal with disasters well: (I Spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starsky & Hutch - 2004) and the worst.
