A good idea to bring a lot of stars in one movie is great, but .... The story is too short and too lacking. No connection between scenes There are 3-4 great stories ... but these things come from the age of 18. The frame reminds me of "Invisible child" - a movie that I like very much However, when compared to "Paris Je T'Aime", lack of interesting short stories developed - started and ended. And it still lacks a topic that is linked to children. I can't find enough topics to link 18 short sketches together. Otherwise I won't recommend it ...
