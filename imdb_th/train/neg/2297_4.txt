I opened the club 700 times in a while and agreed with only some messages - I was one of many believers who considered most Christians to be liberal and conservative by non-Christians. I vote in my mind and it is usually not representative or dem - I don't believe. 700 clubs tell people what to believe. But it means many older Christians who grew up in a very conservative background I think many people misunderstand what is said in the 700 clubs. It made me go out and hear the name in both directions. I think 700 people in the club really love Jesus but are very busy trying to make people vote conservatively that they forget to show love to some people and promote peace as Jesus did. Please do not judge Jesus from stupid people who believe in him and do not be ignorant of our opinions about them. Why do people have the same meaning?
