I watched this movie last night. Actually, and if it comes late, I will forgive the movie. Even if i try But I can't stand it with this movie. It's even worse as the movie continues. Although I know it's funny. But I don't think it's very funny It is a particularly unrealistic image and makes the image of rural life boring. In this case, it's what you think that rural life is like that. It's definitely not. I have to admit that some of the actors are cute. But the French man is really fake I have to admit that it tries to have a good lesson on the subject. But overall, my advice is that no one over 8 looks. It's too annoying.
