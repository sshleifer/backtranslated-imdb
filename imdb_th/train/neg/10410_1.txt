This is a confusing and disordered mess of the endless scenes of dialogue and boring script. That is not an exaggeration: You have to make a lot of effort in trying to get involved. <br /> <br /> I think sincerely that Fassbinder will do interesting things to tell why Erwin's suicide. / Elvira at the end but instead of this in every scene, some people try to explain: "When he was young, this thing happened ..." and "He just returned from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything that That ... "etc. br /> <br /> Soon in my life Aero Erwin / Elvira in slaughterhouses talk with a prostitute friend. (Of course, the slaughterhouse is the best place for a pleasant little conversation) and while telling the story of Elvira Fassbinder's life, showing the slaughter of one cow respectively It is difficult to choose between paying attention to the disturbed image or what the imitator says. Of course, we came to the forced and rough symbols of "I suffered a lot in my life and I was dying." <br /> <br /> At the time of the scattering of what actually happened, Erwin faced a former lover after acting. Gay dance with two other men (Like going to the level of homosexuality that is needed) is that he knows Elvira. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting pictures and ideas. I have to admit (Eg when the nun tells the story of Irwin) but everything in this movie is lost because of Fassbinder's release
