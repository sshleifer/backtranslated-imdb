How can a large German television station broadcast this? It was amazing that the main actors avoided being able to perform everything - even John John Friedman, well known, acted very badly - especially in the double murder scene. The screen plan extends considerably - may add 2 parts of the movie. Be careful not to sleep while watching! Obviously, the series is usually a blue screen, such as Scenes on the ship with unreal sea in the background ...! In the German version, the voice and the dub are terrible - probably the reason: the language of the actors - but: other foreign productions deal with more professionalism. Advice: Do not look - it's a story Waste a lot of time!
