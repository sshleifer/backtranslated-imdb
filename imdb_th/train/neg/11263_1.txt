For shame for the shame that good actors like Joseph Finn will allow themselves to be cast in this piece of disgust. This movie is not only bad. But extremely scary and without the quality of redemption, the plot (is there?) Doesn't seem to go anywhere The Russians played stupidly killed or killed games, and the remaining actors should declare that it was not void for a pathetic performance. I gave up about 3/4 of the passage and closed it. A "1" For the mighty just because nothing is lower. Don't waste time with this, you won't miss anything.
