With large advertisements, this is happening with Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. and that family. My son ordered us to see it between the DVD and the theater. I've seen everything since the remarkable episode. (Incredibles, Shrek) To the really bad things (Wall-E, Brother Bear) But this is the worst movie I've ever seen a child or has never had. It's "When this stupid thing ends?" Which one OK, it's aimed at toddlers. (Or is it better - it is an insult to the brilliance of everyone who is over 3 years old) but I have never seen anything that can be predictable, repetitive and slow-moving Then you finally get bored. But was relieved that the movie ended and there was a strange thing at the end that you thought was a joke for setting, but no one - it was serious They are trying to accomplish 3D effects ... Yes. If you have never seen the Viewmaster, they are a big deal, otherwise. (If you look at the screen without glasses, it seems to be the same process). Even my son got bored at the end. Both my wife and I looked at each other and said "Wow" at the end. Not good in all respects.
