This review also has a spoiler of the first movie, so if you haven't seen a movie and want But do not want spoilers. Please do not read this review. <br /> <br /> At this time, the movie should be about Christian and Kathryn meetings for the first time. This movie is a poor copy of Cruel Intentions For the first time, the actors they showed on Christian images of Ryan Phillippe and Sarah Michelle Gellar of Kathryn are very poor backups, unable to pull the bad attitude of drunken and drunken drunken Am Can do the original show It was absolutely shocking that some conversations were words - not much between Christians and Kathryn. But if you listen enough, you will remember There is also inconsistency in the story - if this was the first meeting of Christians and Kathryn, why did Christians fall in love with a woman at the end of the movie? He should have love for the first time in the original movie. (With the character of Reese Witherspoon) <br /> <br /> In addition, the relationship with photography / "You may be a model" at the end, lame and didn't add anything. Overall, this movie is a waste of time. I can't believe that they do cruel things 3
