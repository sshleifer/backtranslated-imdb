Now I have never seen bad movies all year. But what is with the music in the film that has physiological meaning Wow, how strange Pok√©mon appears and how many of them I can get from this thing. Animie has no point. The creators are pointless. It's a huge marketing model, just reduce the music and they will get Good score. I think this movie should be good. If they send a message, you have to watch the entire Pokemon episode. Understand what has happened and it's not a movie It's just an animation that should be in the video. <br /> <br /> PS: I'll give 1 because I just got 5 bucks. I can't give half because I don't have half.
