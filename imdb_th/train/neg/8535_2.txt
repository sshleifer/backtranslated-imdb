As I said, this book is quite good and this may be a good movie if Melissa Gilbert is not scary and unbelievable. What kind of accent should be? It sounded like a terrible Russian accent in another movie that I saw her every time she opened her mouth. It took 3 times before I could watch all the movies. Brad Johnson is a good person like everyone else. <br /> <br /> I like the beach scene. They add some necessary light to bring your thoughts out of Melissa Gilberts who pressured the depiction. I think they can use San Francisco's perspective more for their benefit. It seems that the night scene is really SF. But I think wrong. I can't remember the characters in this book being depressing. <br /> <br /> Please get rid of Melissa Gilbert from the future movie that needs an accent!
