I watched this movie last night (about 102 minutes) and didn't know what had put me in the seat. I guess I'm just expecting movies with Gere to have some value in the end. But nothing is worth on the screen This is a stupid excuse that was taken after the slaves were tortured and tortured. There are no characters in the movie that do anything like real life. Cutting "style" is based on reducing jumping, small backlit and overprinting to give weight to this sadistic group without reason Obviously running for free is a year. I do not see how Gere, a Buddhist, took part in the trash, put this kind of violence.
