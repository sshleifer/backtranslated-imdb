Damn, I think I see a bad Western person. Can't do this I think I should open my eyes to the Trinity Triple feature to cry out loud. I don't think I can see Ben Hur again without making me laugh so badly. Really <br /> <br /> But wait, if you like the stupid westerners and the stars that are accepted in this story, look at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck.
