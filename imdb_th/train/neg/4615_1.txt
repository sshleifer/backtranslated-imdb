I may not have used the most attention. But this is the second movie that I refuse to look through and I bought it on a DVD because of its "classic" status. <br /> <br /> At first I thought the director was playing a joke. Big time, so I waited to fix something to laugh, something that made me interested. Rather, writing as an amateur is ridiculous. Movies that drag and feel disjointed like someone cutting the TV drama. Long story. The institution must stay with drugs when they nominate this film for at least eight Oscars. <br /> <br /> I repeat myself again. This is the second movie that I refuse to watch all the time. The first thing is "devastator". I hope this will help you know how bad it is. 1/10
