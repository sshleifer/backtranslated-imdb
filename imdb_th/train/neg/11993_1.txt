After seeing only half of the movie at the school in November today, I saw it as a Flix channel and decided to watch it to see the rest of it and write a new review about it. <br /> < br /> Books created from the movie Hatchet are available. This is a terrible adaptation. <br /> <br /> Scary (and I mean terrible) showing bad conversations and movies by Creating a terrifying modification of Hatchet. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Brian, who is a lamentation of teenagers in the late 1980s (wearing bulletproof guns with cheap 80s rock music) and His mother drove onto the plane to get him on the plane to see his father. His parents divorced ... now a temporary stop.) Now, Bryan says goodbye to his mother and dog and flew to meet his father. The pilot is an ugly, rude person. (Unlike in the book) after 2 minutes in the air, there was a heart attack and died In this book, explaining more details to pilots with more pain and it seems that they were in the air longer than before the pilot had a heart attack. <br /> <br /> The plane (within two minutes) runs out. fuel (Leave us the audience to think that he was there for many hours, even if the sun doesn't change its position and the scenery is exactly the same). Now, he's hit the ground. <br /> This is the point in the movie where everything Very different then it is in the book In the book, it is said that his jacket was torn into pieces. But in this film it is perfect without tears or tearing (It seems that he had just bought it) It never said that he climbed a mountain, saw a wolf and slept there. On the mountain, it was never said that he was attacked by a bear. (It is said to be a moose It was never said that he had eaten many insects he had made, never talking about a second tornado or he learned to take a sparrow. Their skin and eat them or traps, a small fish farm that he made (destroyed by a tornado) and it didn't mention that he attacked his ribs from a tornado. <br /> <br / > I don't even think you can call what appeared in the tornado movie. It's all just a hurricane that causes his things to fall. <br /> <br /> The part that I like in this festival is Brian's past. (Which was never mentioned in the book) especially Brian Clich√©'s scene waking up to the window and seeing his father (Everything is full of things that can fit behind his truck), go out and shout. "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD !!!!!" (Of course, his father didn't hear him even though he was outside) and he punched through the window (wtf?) <br /> <br /> The ending is the only thing nearby. for the thing Happened in the book (I said it closed) In the book, I think one of the important things that the rescue pilot spoke to Brian when he landed is "You are the child they are looking for! They stopped several months ago. "But they let the line be in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a pathetic epilogue with Brian. (Without consulting or treatment) returned to normal with his family I think we should think that they come together to thank God. (Because they have turkeys at the counter) then show their temporary home (For what in the movie looks like three days But in this book is for many months) and his ax remains in the tree he left (Did not happen in the book) shows that he has carved the text so that he can do perfectly: "home" (we should believe Which is perfect with just that ax?) <br /> <br /> There is no reference to this film's ability to summarize better when Enid from Ghost World says "This is terrible. Perfect explanation. Of this movie <br /> <br /> I will not recommend anyone. (Who have not read the book) and are watching a movie and do not want anyone who has read this book (because they will be disappointed and bored to death <br /> <br /> For those who read the book and let What your imagination creates is this awesome movie and will put your thoughts into the book. </> <br /> 1/10
