This is an interesting treatment of a somewhat controversial subject. (Just read other comments on this film) Obviously you may love or hate it and it seems that most people make that difference based on whether they believe that suffering and the end times will happen. <br /> <br /> In general, movies - and sequels - were created about $ 1.30 per person. The production value is there too. "Plan 9 from the outside world" and the performance is at the level. About "Glen or Glenda" (sorry for Edwood) In addition to religious messages, the story is very scary. Add even the slightest idea that the story may be close to something that might happen in the future and it will be even more terrifying. <br /> <br /> This film and the sequel of the story didn't try to bring. The reason that adversity occurs when it is done "Left behind" and "Omega code" trying to get into everything that "steals" to do, and to explain the politics and the elimination in the Middle East that leads to the net result is "robbers" work much better. In the frightening part of the movie, instead of spreading itself too thin, trying to explain what happened in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget about politics and watch this movie and the sequel to the horror movie. Morale So that they may be a horror story indirectly told by God to make them even more terrifying If it makes you think about it, it will do its job - even if you don't believe it.
