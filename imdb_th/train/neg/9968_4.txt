As a former teacher (!), I have to confess to cringe through various scenes - 'Although I still watch until the end. I wonder why?! (Bored?) :-) <br /> <br /> The first opening scene made me feel crushed and unbelievably unraveled. The plot as well, even though there is a good idea - the fate of the relief teacher - is not strong enough in one direction for three-dimensional development. <br /> <br /> Not one of Mr. Nor's finer. Lete, time for a young child, Mr. Macchio. Did he say that in every movie? <br /> <br /> Plot and make a complaint. The only hairstyle is a nostalgic journey. ) <br />
