Oh, if I would give this garbage less than one star! There are two funny parts in the whole movie and that is! One is at one or two lines from the song. Don't worry. Happy was sung by slugs and the other is that Roddy dropped from the toilet roll and landed with his feet and legs apart so that everything else he landed on. How to hit him in the groin That is nothing more amusing than at least not for me! Doctornappy2 is not correct to say that the "fan of" Shrek "completely scary may be enjoyable, but" Wallace & Gromit "fans may turn back in disgust. While I love Shrek 1 2 and 3 and I love Wallace and Growth. You see things that boil down, if the animation is very good, it is definitely worth watching. But this is far more than you can do! There are too many continuous errors. Some people pointed out by the manufacturers of this website, others cannot. I will not point out to others. But a few more things to see: when the little daughter leaves the beginning of the movie, the capture of the cage door will fall and the hook of it is on the right Clearly, back to the back of the round knob effectively makes sure that Roddy can't go out and he can do it by just kicking it. At one point, Ruby fell to the back of Roddy and was pushed into the air by Rita all the time while the ship moved forward. In the next scene, Roddy caught it again. It is impossible. Seeing how the ship was moving forward when Ruby was fired from behind Roddy's shirt, the only place he could land was in the water that was not in Roddy's hand. There was one third I wanted to point out. But now I forgot it. <br /> <br /> Too much for the needs of words better than 'gags'. Repeat in any way. There is enough time to connect with any character. The character looks hollow, shallow and empty and the whole movie makes you want .... Want to see 85 minutes from other things! Dry paint or grass planting are two great options!
