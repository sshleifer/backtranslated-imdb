Users who rate this movie very much will not be able to watch movies well enough to compare. Are they all brainwashed? I'm not very disappointed with the movie, and some of that has to do with the laughing ads around the movie. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, BU is just a chase movie. We picked it up at the end of the chase once and went another way. And again. And again. And again. Do you see a new pattern? There is almost no time to waste on the plot, character development or boring old reality. <br /> <br /> If you haven't watched two other Bourne movies, if you have - you just Hope you get lost - far from the cinema. <br /> <br /> Paul Greengrass's quiet style works exceptionally well in United 93, which is a situation that exceeds expectations. And his endless misery There was a negative effect on the audience from being involved with the characters. He ran. He jumped, he punched him, blown away. He washed the tall buildings. Yada Yada Yada above all else - he survived. Is like the action man plastic has survived, which requires him to spend more time showing ability and tension So he drove out of the building? And what? He will survive. <br /> <br /> There was a woman thrown into the mixture because Bond's love and love had died in the previous nation. But she is just a decoration I saw the depth of the character and the quicker dialogue in the episode of Captain Scarlet. <br /> <br /> Bond's self-discovery journey is boring and lacking and tells us that we don't know anything. From the first movie He became a big killing machine. He discovered his true self. What? There is no emotional resonance when it comes. <br /> <br /> The end of the 'twist' has been sent. Telegram and weak Oh dear, the more I miss this movie, the more I hate it! I reduced my score to 4 during writing this comment! I should end before the slide continues. <br /> <br /> I like to flick the good action and I like the thriller. The Bourne Ultimatum is not a loud and pleasant series. Tired of editing sound effects, ridiculousness and violence of cartoons. <br /> <br /> The idea that 'Shows' to the Bond franchise is the most ridiculous story. Casino Royale blows it from the water.
