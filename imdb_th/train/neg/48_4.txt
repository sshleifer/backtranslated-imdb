There is a good photograph in this movie, it captures the scenery with such beautiful light. In fact, shooting movies is probably the best asset. <br /> <br /> But in general, it's made from TV movies. over And although it has twists and turns in the plot which makes it look interesting But without the description and development, the main storyline was revealed in Spanish, so non-Spanish speakers would disappear a bit. <br /> <br> I received it as a Christmas gift because it was a family style that worked through the film The show that we find talented and Matthew Mconaughey is great in "A Time to kill" and "The Newton Boys", so I show that I want to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> However, even It's simple to say that it is a movie in the DVD box Matthew Mconaughey and use this as a marketing ploy and he had a few lines on the screen. For the end of the movie for a few minutes, he was a special person and he didn't shine on the screen while he was on. So the fans died hard. The partner is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Movie stars, but Patrick McGaw is great and easy in his eyes and his character is good and kind and caring. It's a true saint. He will be well written in ROM com. <br /> <br /> So for the true Mcconaughey that shows the intelligence of the people I have seen, I recommend "A Time to kill" The Newton Boys "" Frailty " , "How to make men in 10 days", "Edtv" and "Amistad" and avoid "bigger than life" and "Angels in the Outfield" unless you feel like being a movie boy or a child without these things. Tells of his ability But it's an amusing movie for children again. MM doesn't have much more than just a few artists. <br /> <br /> For Scorpion Springit is not a bad movie. But it did not steal the screen as well
