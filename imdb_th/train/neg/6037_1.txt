Mental retardation and girlfriends perform some rituals to revive the dead in an attempt to prove that the dead cannot bring back to life. It is not surprising that they resurrected dead spirits that started cutting them with an ax, and the next day a number of college-age people were telling the story around the fire. The man in the ax appeared and began hacking the silly narrator that told the story. The group that called the police, the police saw the blood splashing around and thought it was a mountain lion (!) /> Moronic, the little water splash movie that was filmed in the daytime. But there are many characters holding a flashlight and saying as if it were in the middle of the night and wanted to send a flame signal to attract attention A man had a gun in one hand and a bullet on the other side. But don't worry about loading, after that he finally loads it, he has many opportunities to shoot the killer But don't worry because that will make the movie end too soon. Then he throws the gun away! Also dangerous is the character that does not show emotion and does not have to worry about their friends very much after being shuffled in pieces and punch effects. (The human heart looks like a chicken piece, a car that blown at the end, apparently a model car) and a terrifying dialogue and nudity. A really ugly woman doesn't help anything. And in the end it tried to escape from inconsistency by saying that it was the invention of the same age who told the campfire about the beginning of this movie. <br /> <br /> Then the killer Will actually appear in the final scene, causing them to be pieces again. <br /> <br /> It's quite good for unintended laughter. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 from ****
