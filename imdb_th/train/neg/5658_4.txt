"Laugh, Clown Laugh", launched in 1928, is the legendary star of Lon Chaney as a clown in the circus group Tito Tito. Raises orphans. (Beautiful child and Loretta Young) to become an adult and named her Simonetta. Tito raised a young woman in the life of a circus and she became a successful ballerina while Chaney gave a great performance His usual visit, I could not overcome the fact that Tito, which is now in middle age, was excellent for young Simonetta, although he was not the biological father. But she raised her like a daughter. The "ick" factor penetrates throughout the movie. Counterattack to show Simonetta's love with young and handsome 'Count' Luigi (Nils Asther) Simonetta falls in love with the young man clearly. But feeling guilty of leaving Tito (from loyalty, not romance) This film is important just because Loretta Young has a great career. While I liked Chaney's ability as an actor, this movie seemed to come out of me and completely creepy.
