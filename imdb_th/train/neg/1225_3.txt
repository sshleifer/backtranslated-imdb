Let me start by saying how much the film has meant. I can't protect myself from laughing at its stupidity. Do not understand me wrong, it works well, especially with Bassinger, but the script is good with a truly confusing mind Through the movie, the protagonist pulls out her toolbox and, of course, instead of going to the head of a man, he decides to pull the screwdriver, car jack, and finally fire <br /> <br /> Then there is the last line that I promise. If it doesn't have you sew the wound, I'll eat my left foot. <br /> < br /> I would like to recommend this movie. For those who just want to laugh at the beauty of the old, scary movies. I suggest you watch out for the scene in the scrap yard and people falling from one foot of the board, which I get every time.
