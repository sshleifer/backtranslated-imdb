First thing first In this type of movie, the first thing you want is good music and that's what Mr. Shankar and his party fail. <br /> <br /> The song is pale and ineffective. On the other hand, there is AJAY DEVGAN, who removes the letter 'A' from his spell. Works well. But it is not useful for movies that have such bad performers. <br /> <br /> ASIN is like a doll that Even though she looks good But the role of her film is dance. Actually, she is dancing with rock band members and I don't think rock bands have dancers as members. <br /> <br /> In the nut shell This film is a piece of shit. A piece of *** t watch it if you want to be tricked.
