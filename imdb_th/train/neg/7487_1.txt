Unfortunately, this movie is terrible. The original outside of the city is crazy and very funny. Of course, they use a script written by Neil Simon for some reason. Neil Simons script is not used in this film, so it has to be banned repeatedly. Even the audience I live with never laughs. The direction is slow and boring, and when there is a joke, it is dealt out, so the jokes will die, like the couple having sex in the park. They announced that it was a lighting ceremony for New York. We all know that the fire is coming and we will see the cuteness and loveliness of Goldie and Steve who slapped. This movie ends like this ... It's a joke that's set up and given to me why Goldies' hair isn't sloppy in the movie. You will also notice every close-up of Goldie (they use a very soft soft lens). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis. That is if you want to laugh.
