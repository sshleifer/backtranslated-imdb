I can't explain the life of popular TV programs for children. I never understood why the Power Rangers were all about. <br /> <br /> I never understood why children who didn't. I doubt this item from the beginning Silly and not worth any care. <br /> <br /> The costumes look completely ruthless, like the colorful spandex that people wear to exercise. <br /> <br / > What is the purpose of this show anyway, but for children to learn how to fight to solve their problems? What's up with awesome haircuts and clothes on this list? No need to talk about this program, still playing on cable TV just to raise money to teach children how to fight each other when they disagree with some problems. <br /> <br /> Have better entertainment. For children today, not as stupid as the children of the 1990s who watched this show. <br /> <br /> Oh, and what will happen to the sex tension between Red and Green Rangers?
