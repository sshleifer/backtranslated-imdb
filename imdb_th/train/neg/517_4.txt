"The Return of Chandu" is remarkable if anyone can say that for the selection of Belo Lugosi as a hero instead of a villain Why is he accepting young women? <br /> <br /> This story is related to Ubasti's black magic, trying to capture the last Egyptian princess, Nadji (delicious Baha Maria) and use her as a sacrifice. From the revival of their ancient leaders who had just happened to Nadji Lugosi, while Jandu, who has magical powers, tries to block the villains. <br /> <br /> Ray Taylor's director does the best with limited resources and extensive stock images. King Kong's fans (1933) will remember the giant gates that had been kept in the bay. In many scenes, the performances were mostly scary. For example, the actor who plays the high priest (I believe Lucien Prival) uses the acting coach to inspire pronunciation, which is common in the early speakers. <br /> <br /> It is a mystery that Lugosi received in various parts of the freelance during this time in his career because he was still a star. That is trustworthy in Universal at this time, probably because in this case he must play the hero and get the girl who knows When his career began to ease in the late 30s, this type of fare would become the norm for Lugosi rather than the exception. <br /> <br />
