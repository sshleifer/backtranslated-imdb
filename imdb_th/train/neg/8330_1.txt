I saw "gold coins" on DVD. While I watched, I thought "This is a very bad porn movie without porn." I thought, "Anyone who writes this thing has real problems." Then I watched the director / writer Carlson describe his process. In a special way Yes, it's really special. <br /> <br /> The importance of this film lies on two alcoholic losers who attack each other. They are a little interesting. There is a naked front and full. These factors are likely to cause the film to be seen. <br /> <br /> The most annoying element of this film is the bashing of gay men and the subsequent gay beatings of the same victim. Both drunken losers are not only unreasonable and poorly managed from a technical perspective. But the performance is not terribly good. <br /> <br /> Then there is a boxer theme. This is really crazy, not nonsense. This brave boxer is bruised with the unwavering determination of a fat mother boy working in the gymnasium parking lot. This is in LA, the heart of the boxer is bruised until he appears at Stalker's house at In front of him and excited in the process. <br /> <br /> Okay, what I can say is why the boxer at heart. Exhibitionists must feel pain because of the interest of Stalker? It's not reasonable. And I am afraid that some psychic powers will make sense if you spend time reading it However, the bad script doesn't have a reason at all. <br /> <br /> The director / writer seems to think that this film represents a large number of minorities in the gay community. He may be right. I think We may never know, because the minority groups are unusual. They are hardly able to organize enough to go to a gay film festival or only two vague DVD stores where they can find this turkey. Thank God for that.
