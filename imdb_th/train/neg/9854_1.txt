This documentary (Or should I say mockumentary) is a perfect example of how ridiculous people are when they are fully enthusiastic about something like that. Honestly i hate Cryptozoology It's a scientific fault. It's just destroying it. However, the positive thing about this is the visual effects. (The dragon is beautiful) But some of the information in this mockumentary is all fake, and that's really disappointing. 10 and not 0. Examples of false information are thoughts. belly But it is impossible to happen in that proportion You need a good explanation of what happened in the dragon's stomach. There are many substances that have little hydrogen in nature. But it is not necessary to pronounce such animals to fly and hydrogen will not appear from anything, so it is impossible However, there is something worse than the original idea of ​​platinum: this element is harder to find than gold, and I can't explain how the dragon can survive. It's ridiculous. They present dragons like animals that are less likely to conquer the world. But at least explain why they are extinct Encrypted scientists may call themselves scientists. But they are not People like them say lying in this model and the worst thing is that some people buy them. But I don't think that science-conscious people will believe in dragons after watching this thing. Those fake scientists wasted time.
