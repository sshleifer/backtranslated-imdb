Satan Little Helper is one of the better B Horror movies I've ever seen. When I speak better, I mean the story. This film is a new plot, something that is not boring in the horror genre - there is something new, but there are laughable questions that come with it too. Questions that you will ask yourself throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> This film attracted my attention for the first time while I was sailing in the horror section of HMV. I was tired of Hollywood movies. Lee, a frightening story called "scary" and needs something different. Satan's Little Helper's cover immediately attracted my attention. As you see that image attracts you - it's chilling! I know it matches the DVD release - but I have a chance. I mean, I just saw "Boogey Man" the night before, so it's no worse than this! After I watched the movie, I was half satisfied. I like the movie story. It's really creepy that the killer pretends to be a little boy, so he can kill. He thought he and his little boy would become a partner - a pair of fear. It's a good idea to create a movie on Halloween night. In this way, no one thinks about a masked man beside a child. They will think that he is his guardian. But this is where the "hole" begins to appear. <br /> <br /> If your son comes back with a "friend", he finds a trick or treat - that's normal. You won't think of anything - if he is 9 years old or about the same age as him. However, if he appears with a strange man in the mask, you will be shocked and protect your child. You will ask the man to remove the mask and identify himself. You will ask why he is with your son. He doesn't know him. You will tell him to leave, please. He is not a family friend. He is a stranger. We should now teach our children not to speak to strangers. In this case, the mother works well with it? It seems that they don't think it's strange that people "don't speak" - they think it's a daughter's boyfriend. But after not talking about 10 minutes, you have to remove the mask and ask him why he didn't say anything. <br /> <br /> The film fell. What makes me the most is that all mothers say "Do you want cider?" I can't count on how many times you talk about it in the movie. It's like Oh, you're dying - we have cider even though it's all good !! The movie begins to contract and cannot be delivered. It is more horror / funny and even if it fails I guess you might call it "Dud", "Flop" etc. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the cover. Even if something tells me it's not worth the money, 12 dollars!
