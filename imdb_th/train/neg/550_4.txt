After the excellent AANKHEN (2002), which is a play remake of Gujarati, he comes with WAQT, which looks like playing on stage. <br /> <br /> In the musical, we have characters that shout. The first half shows that Amitabh is almost kidding. 40+ Akshay Kumar, who is too funny like a small person. <br /> <br /> This film has a good message that won't make your son lose. Amitabh wants Akki. The responsibility is fake. <br /> <br /> Despite the reasons Way to conceal his illness, his dribbling from the hospital and melodious words by Akki would be the same. Don't touch you But mostly on top <br /> <br /> Rajpal's comedy is hilarious but too stretched in the second half. <br /> <br /> Directions by Vipul Shah too. Although some scenes are good songs, ok. <br /> <br /> Amitabh is more than the first half of the actors. But excellent in the emotional scene, Akshay Kumar did his job well. The py scene of his chemistry with Bachchan is incomparable. Rajpal is highlighted. He makes you laugh without showing too much and just his presence and the stupid behavior of He and the humor that made him dead There is nothing to do. This is her last movie with Akki. Until now, Shefali is great, even if she looks too young for Bachchan.
