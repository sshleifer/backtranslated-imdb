I am now a lover of the movie B, but this garbage makes me insulting. First of all, this film starring Lizzie McGuire's younger brother as an annoying little boy looking for his missing three-legged dog. Now, please, what kind of stupid ass is the three-legged dog for a disgusting mutant crocodile? And this is another point of contemplation. Why do they show Dinocroc on the back of a huge movie box and really in the water? I believe that if the memory of the thing takes about 2.6 minutes in water and only 6 feet high, that is the heart grinder. But the qualification in exchange for this movie is that it is so bad that he almost died because of laughing because he believed that bad performances made me want to die But the fact remains that again, this was created by another military test site to train the ultimate crocodile for military or something like that from the source of all evil EVIL Corporation and don't Forget the characters, see that we have the 1st rank of pilgrimage as a formidable male and chick performer. The only thing that is worse, acting is the end of the hero who takes about 2 hours to talk and plan to kill the dino rock thoroughly in order to fail and kill it in a normal way. It takes about 15 hours to come up with Overall, this movie is more than gay, with random opera music behind the scenes and the fact that it may be the most gay of all CGI monsters ever done with the fact that it certainly cannot be bulleted and Can explode Was created for DUH soldiers!) The best scene was when Lizzy's brother McGuire ran into the hut and Dinocrok ate, causing his head to emerge with a loud sound. I believe that you should shoot yourself between the eyes to see Dinocroc and for the director, I believe we should get a lot of people to hang him with a snare and take turns kicking him in the target because he wasted an hour and a half in his life. Us until he finally dies and then I can go Living.
