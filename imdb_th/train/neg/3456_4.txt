Everyone in this movie tells Raffy Carruthers how good she is. One day, the great director, she will become another person. I think they are cute. Even the director Kimble Rendall still shows more talent. She is "Jane the next person" They called her; And apart from the fact that they both received too many ratings, both are very similar. They are both direct movies. They are both women. They are both Australians (give or receive). <br /> <br /> Oh: It's one of the movies that this character is great and we have to swallow heavily and accept it. But I will say this with Carruthers: She's cute - and really fascinating. No, here are some ideas about her lack of ability: <br /> <br /> (1) Part of talent The director is in contact with the people. Why did Carruthers get a bad impact when taking her crew to notice her? To make it easier for everyone to walk out of the scene and be killed, I expect. <br /> (2) Why is one of the most unreliable images of movies I've ever seen? In the end, it must be shot in the REAL movie. How will they be mistaken? If Randall's scene is half of the chaos that is not on the team, it is surprising that he has completed his movie. <br /> <br /> (3) Carruthers - The director wore the 80s role, a horror flick, a fat chance. I wonder if it can be done today. I wonder if Rendall - the true and more talented director - set himself up for the same job. Judge Mocking things instead (sighing) Of course, it's not enough for a parody to work as a parody. As soon as the actors and the team walked into a separate mansion, this movie spends most of the time doing what the 80s horror movies do ... not bad. <br /> <br /> ( 4) And yet, and yet ... This film opens without parody, but is a faithful pastiche to the goodness of the 80s horror starring. (This is too good to be true) Molly Ringwald pastiche is better than everything that follows. (It's a bad sign when you think you want you to watch movies in movies rather than movies.) But it was also filmed in the late 1990s. Maybe it was possible to make horror 1980s. Throw away the parody of what you know means. <br /> <br /> (5) I never wondered what the teen horror movie of 1980 would be if all the characters had an Australian accent. But now i know And I'm glad to know The needs that I had never known before that I had been fulfilled
