Jamie Foxx is fun, but this movie has been done before. Bad guy plays the character "malkovichian" from "In the Line of Fire", the police will do everything to find the bad guy - and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one police suit after him - while he is trying to flip a new one.
