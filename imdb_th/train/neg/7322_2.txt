I will give you credit in the event that the credit is due and says that Linda Fiorentino has performed well as an actress who likes to do what she wants. She is sassy, ​​fringe, and very sexy; She is much better than this movie. <br /> <br /> But that's IT. This film is a tedious movie that tries to break out into a thriller, a suicide thriller, a story of loyalty and betrayal and a hot erotic erotic thriller. This movie, my friend didn't get excited at all. <br /> <br /> For example, who would think of casting C. Thomas Howell as a preferred actor? He's not ugly. But for crying out loud, Fiorentino's toughest goddess cookie is working with a kindergarten teacher. Howell does not have the power or appearance of the screen to fill the leading male role. <br /> <br /> The script is the worst thing in the movie. There is no tension when Fiorentino's character receives an eerie phone call. There is no mystery about her fault in the murder that is the focus of this film without feeling free while Fiona Rentino <br /> Look for interesting pendants. But not well done by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes and the really good sex scenes between Howell and Fiorentino
