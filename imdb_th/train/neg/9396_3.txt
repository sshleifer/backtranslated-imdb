The Radar Men from the Moon is a typical fare in the 1950s. The special effects are quite cheap and the lunar riders are the jeeps of the Second World War with painted plywood The performance is fairly good. It inspires the imagination of the children, which I believe this is taken. According to today's standards, it's boring, cheap and bad. There are also many stock videos in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters.
