In Alec Guinness's latest biography, I can't find To Paris With Love too. I'm sure Guinness made this movie to travel to Paris without charge. This movie has no other reason to have it. <br /> <br /> Of course, Paris took a great picture with Guinness's debut and his son drove down the road to Champ Ely. With the Arc De Triomphe, it is a pity that it has fallen from there. <br /> <br /> Nothing happened between Guinness and the woman he flew for a moment in Paris. According to Guinness's recent history by Piers Paul Read, Guinness does not like that woman positively, finding that her behavior is not professional. For what Odile Vernois thought was her co-star, there was no record. They have the same chemical qualities as the two cats that were sterilized. <br /> <br /> Guinness had a great time in this film, which was delivered directly from one of his comedies in As he climbed a tree trying to pull a badminton shuttlecock But I won't wait to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> At least Alex has left Paris to make an agreement.
