I rate this movie 1 because the storyline is incredibly unbelievable. Judge for yourself Receive the following warning not only But will give the plot But also destroys your appetite for watching movies. <br /> <br /> Computer viruses that are designed by stupid people are frustrated by sending passwords to television screens and Computer monitor When the code - in the form of light - into the eye, it can access the 'electrical system' of your body. Forcing cells in the body to release calcium Within a few seconds after the patient's infection arrived at his neck, the development saw in the tunnel, his skin turned into white calcium. After that he fell and his hand and the gondolier broke into a chalk cloud. <br /> <br /> This virus is very smart. When the blind computer experts are trying to separate the code with a braille signal device - hand-operated, the device is set up with a very high voltage which causes severe burns on the skin of the expert head. The virus also has an aggressive sense of remote control and an ATM keyboard. Fortunately, it can be stopped by throwing an outdated desktop computer on the rack and letting the electric power to the fool with the back on the broken computer and the foot He in the spilled water <br /> <br /> Oh dear ...
