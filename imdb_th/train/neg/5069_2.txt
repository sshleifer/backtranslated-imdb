I have many serious problems with this performance. A simple list will suffice. Now I will go into more depth later: superficial characters, laughing, tracking and boring humor. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to see the rest of this Review and read it only to make you feel better. (As if you saw anything on this list, I didn't do it) with a teenager with a problem from Canada. I will summarize: Friends suck not only because it's not funny. But because of destruction TV viewers for good new shows (Catching development, Dexter and others) Friends are guilty as well as "Two And A Half Men" and "The King Of Queens" as television executives. Now, when reading the reviews, <br /> <br /> These characters do not have the same spirit in them all. (Outside sex and hair color) They respond as well in boring and completely safe situations in their own bodies. Where is the conflict and the humor that comes with it? Why did Rachel not attack Monica after Monica began to travel with Rachel's enemies? Why did Joey not think of committing suicide because nobody thought he would be serious about him? Oh yes, because he is a fool and he is comfortable. This is the curse of having a perfect character: long conflict and personality. (God forbid) becomes impossible. <br /> <br /> The laughing path is one thing that should die immediately after it happens. Any item that has that item is almost the opposite of a joke. How do I make it a common feature? When the show claims to be "funny", having to laugh from someone during the hearing must mean that the audience will not laugh without it. Laughtracks destroy the humor by preventing a quick return. Humor becomes a building instead of an independent organization. (See the captured development office.) <br /> <br /> This leads to my next point: boring humor. There is no way to create a perfect character than a little humor. (Without laughter) Just because humor in our daily lives comes from remembering our shortcomings. What if Monica dated 17 years old? She immediately realized that what she did was wrong and broke up with him. There must be some conflict over the immediate solution. Maybe her mother might know, or one of her friends tried to get rid of him and make him addicted. It will be great. It's like fighting in custody! So now I have provided evidence for my position. Many of my friends like this show because they have never heard your enthusiasm or suspended development. Many of my friends hate this show because they just started watching your enthusiasm or control. Arrested arrest <br /> <br /> I have seen very few "friends" in my life. But I've watched enough to see a big flaw that makes acting in my mind completely unbeatable. If you read this far, thank you and I hope you at least start watching the programs that I mentioned.
