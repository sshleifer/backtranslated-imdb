Although Flying Guillotines are part of the title of this film But not related to Flying Guillotines (1975) and the sequel of Flying Guillotines II (1978). The original two pieces are masterpieces of Kung Fu movies and still stand out in the classic style. This is a much inferior copy of the original, and even if it is a typical kung fu movie, it is below average. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie doesn't have much acting. It was another meaningless fight scene and flying guillotine didn't play a major role in that. A story about the Shaolin monks who are pursuing some villains that take the sacred books and the evil prince who owns part of this book as part of the plot. The same evil prince plans to lure the king and use guillotines flying with them. <br /> <br /> There are four movies with Flying Guillotine as part of the title. In my opinion, the quality is the least. The design of the Guillotine Boeing in this movie differs from the other three, which indicates that the film was produced by an entity that is different from the other three. <br /> <br /> This movie No chemistry, bad production. <br /> <br /> The best. Skip this and see both manuscripts.
