This may not be the worst movie that Peter Sellers used to do (I think Laurel went to "The Prisoner of Zenda") but it was the most depressing. The seller, especially the makeup of Nayland Smith, looks like he has just undergone chemotherapy. As a Fu Manchu, he doesn't look good and takes most of the movie. (Except for the annoying scene in which he received electricity) while falling under the weight of all makeup Supporting players seem tired and worn-out and Sid Caeser's appearance is a nasty thing, even without reference to "Chinks!" ... or for that matter, it's not an Asian star!) This movie seems to be surprisingly cheap by shooting and boring scenes, even numbers A. Lewis, who sounds loud at the end, has a lower rate. Only the amazing Helen Mirren and the towering thin man who made his pants soak up the sparkle of life for this sad story Overall, this movie gives an eerie premonition of the great cartoons and documents that are even more terrifying than his dying.
