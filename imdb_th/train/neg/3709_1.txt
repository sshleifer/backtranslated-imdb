First of all, I want to say that I'm a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other movies. But this movie is like my conclusion. The biggest Sack of Crap ever. In the first episode, Chris Rock, the comedian who wants to be scared on the stage at a funny building called Apollo On the way home from Kik while riding a bicycle, he saw this woman he liked and was hit by a truck. Moments later, he chose the body of an old white millionaire and selfish. Then he dressed like an Outkast music group while trying to play scenes from the manuscript he had released as a Jockey. Secondly, he returned to Apollo and tried to be a comedian that he had tried in his previous body And began to reject white skin and try to black Do you get my drift? This movie is terrible. It tries too hard to be like the real thing and in the process comes out like a garbage bag. Just follow my advice. Don't even watch this movie.
