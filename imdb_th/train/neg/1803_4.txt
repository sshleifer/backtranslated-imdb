This is one of the short educational movies created to learn people who do not know about the facts of life. When the target audience is the thirteen girls, the truth of life is menstruation. This animated film was created by Walt Disney Pictures with some sponsors from Kotex. <br /> <br /> Begin by explaining how hormones make you grow and develop. With the help of animators and female narratives, it shows us how the body, especially the ovaries, uterus and vagina work, and why this leads to menstruation. It's almost amazing, becoming a cartoon note here, how to avoid sex. Even words that never spoke even though "furtilized" would pass one time I don't really know why I saw this. But since it is one of the rare short films that can make a lasting impression on you, you may want to try it out.
