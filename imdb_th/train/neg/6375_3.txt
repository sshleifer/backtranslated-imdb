Jennifer's Shadow is located in Argentina and started when Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips) arrived there after her sister Johanna died. Jennifer is left in the big house of Johanna. Jennifer decides to sell the house & head back to Los Angeles, although her grandmother Mary Ellen (Faye Dunaway) is Granny. The strange thing began to happen. Jennifer began a nightmare about her Gagikik. She began to feel bad. After receiving a hospital examination, it seems that one of her kidneys disappeared mysteriously. What happened to Jennifer? Is it a curse of an ancient family? Jennifer will be the next person to give up ... <br /> <br /> The American production in Argentina is co-written and directed by Daniel de la Vega and Pablo. Parés & a very boring story, strange minutes, modern ghost stories, boring and predictable that I imagine will make a lot of people sleep faster to make them afraid of the script by Vega, Parés & PJ Pettiette is quite slow and boring, which is not what People want me, meaning I am sure that most people do not want to sit down and bored with their skulls. Every character is unattractive and motivating with little or no motivation for what they do. For example, who cares for the cemetery? How did he know about the devil? What is his interest and motivation for participation? I don't see it Jennifer is a cute and gentle leading woman. Her grandmother, Mary Allen, is smart when they come and it's surprising that she is clearly a villain. I mean, horror / ghost stories that are arranged in this genre. It can be surprisingly predictable and routine. There are gaps in both logic and story, which include a horrible ending that doesn't twist much. I don't like Jennifer's Shadow one iota. <br /> <br /> Director Vega & Parés went down. Almost all bleach from the image, which often makes it not far from black and white. I wonder if they want to give it a gothic moment. But it has been done many times more often It doesn't do much for me & makes this movie look insipid and lifeless. There are definitely 40s, from costumes to the interior of the big house. But again, it looks quite halfway and the price is cheap. Jennifer's Shadow is made out well, but it's quite forgotten, not scary or creepy and quite predictable. If that is not enough, it is not boring as well. There are some scenes of the Ravens staring at people & hearts that are dancing But nothing else. <br /> <br /> With a budget that should be around $ 1,000,000 and recorded in The Chronicles The Raven for DVDs in the United States and abroad, it is well made. But millions of people will not buy you too much. Today's Jennifer & Shadow prove that the theory There are many scenes in which the actors speak with an Argentine accent as well, even if it's true. But I want to understand what people are saying The performance is ok, even though Dunway has too much money and obviously has money. <br /> <br /> Jennifer's Shadow is a junk movie that I think is very boring from start to finish. See The Incredibly Strange, a creature that stops life and becomes a zombie. Mix it up !! (1964) Again instead of wasting all time.
