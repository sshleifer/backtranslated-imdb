After seeing the low-budget "Universal Soldier" franchise, I hoped and prayed that Van Damme took his role as Luc Devoreaux in the movie Unisol. The second story seems like this answer will be answered. But not the way I expected. The Universial Soldier 2 is as intense as reading a poem at your local library. No, even that is more interesting. The fight sequence is the ultimate quality of Bruce Lee, which is the only factor in all pathetic excuses for the movie. That and having a former WCW legend, a strong man named "Goldberg" plays the villain. However, putting Goldberg as a lieutenant, Seth's best friend is better It's like some film school students slapped it together. The plot hole is bigger than Kanye West's ego is what is done in this movie. For example, Luc Hillary's daughter looks like she is 11-13 years old and the first film was filmed seven years ago. How is it possible? Tell me! As Luc's partner is killed and becomes Unisol, that is ridiculous again! You mean, tell me that there is an unisol experiment that is naked in the basement of the research center at the beginning of the movie. C'mon. The director may spend more time with this movie like the first movie and sew all the holes off. ! <br /> <br /> Talk about the plot of IT! Compared to the first movie, Universal Soldier 2, causing flooding and worthless Unisol's terrifying thrill that becomes even more intense when thinking of a desert storm or something? This is the dawn of the millennium. You will attract more audiences if it happens in the Zespri / Oranian future. Corny is the correct adjective to describe the tragic, sad and sad sequel. This <br /> <br /> from what I saw: Double Impact, under Siege 2, Robocop 3, and Hell, even a cheap terminal / no class connector "Class of 1999" More fun!
