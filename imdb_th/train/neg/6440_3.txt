This is one of the worst Wrestlemania I've ever seen. It's not really outstanding. I think it should be good. But every match seems to be shortened. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit and MVP, one of the better matches Benoit carried it. I don't think MVP is great. But Benoit saved this game. <br /> <br /> Kane and Khali Wow. These two people are not ashamed. Or maybe Khali and others who live not mixed <br /> <br /> Melina and Ashley, I'm not a female wrestling fan. <br /> <br /> ECW Original and new breed I'm excited about this competition until I see it. <br /> <br /> Edge vs. CM Punk vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy and Mr. Kennedy vs. Finlay vs. Randy Orton is the worst MITB game right now. It is important that many people in the band at the same time It doesn't live. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley and Umaga O.K are not very impressive. But not the worst night. <br /> <br /> Batista and Undertaker may be the best match of the night. Very good. Very good to see good things for change. <br /> <br /> John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels I feel that this match deserves to be received. People create stories for Batista and The Undertaker. But this game did well I became tired of seeing Zena win every match. It started a bit old. Now I have to say that I feel that this competition is the best night. But I'm a big fan of Shawn Michaels, so I'm slightly biased. Batista vs. 'Taker might be better. But I have prejudices. So ... the last two apologies are undoubtedly the best competition of the night and everything is mostly short.
