I bought this DVD set I couldn't see and hopefully I won't. The script needs serious rewriting, since it seems to be completely free of feelings and pale compared to this book. Light is a very horrible thing. But if it is like that, I can overlook it. The script does not focus on the character enough ... There are various characters introduced, difficult to distinguish who is who. (Especially in the plane - don't know who will die when) <br /> <br >> I feel that the key to a good movie is to make the audience interested in the character. If you don't have that, you have nothing at all. Not important to the characters at all - you never know them - who they are, what they like ... which makes them do what they do. This series has a length of 5 hours and is divided into 6 parts ... I think you are wondering what they have done all this time if they do not have the character details - they fill the fillers. Much I would say that at least an hour spent watching them land and go into their plane. LOL (I mean, we have to see it over and over again ???) I will give a much higher rating if They just improved their knowledge about our characters.
