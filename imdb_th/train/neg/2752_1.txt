No matter what his name is (Writers and directors) should be locked up in the hope that garbage will not be created again. This movie is in the fight with the most horrible movies of all time. Sometimes movies are bad in a good way. Not this one. It's terrible that I'm angry. Seriously. A drunken 10-year-old boy may have a better chapter than anything. All the actors are not affected at all. The CGI is almost unacceptable. The scene of that scene is completely cluttered and hurt the little story caused It's like he just decided. But I don't care if we can get there, just shoot it and put it in whatever I'm going back to the trailer to pick up my nose. If anyone calls me, you are embarrassed by you.
