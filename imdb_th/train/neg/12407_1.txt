Alicia (Laurel Barnett) becomes a babysitter for a girl, Rosalie Nord. (Rosalie Cole), who has just lost her mother, but Rosalie misses her dead mother and continues to visit her grave. (Located in the cemetery in the back of the house) late at night ... where she still meets "friends" ... <br /> <br /> This thing starts with a really creepy sequence in the cemetery .. then separated The story is light and there are many tons of space, making this movie up to 85 minutes. The performance is terrible. (By Cole being the worst) directed badly with the worst edit I've ever seen in the movie. The scenes (and sounds) were just cut off without touching or reasoning. In addition, this movie has a very bad (and clear) post-production post. <br /> <br /> For blood and violence - forget it! There are very few and things that seem incredibly fake. I have never seen blood that looks like fake - like tomato sauce! Boring, pointless - a forgotten drive-in movie. You can skip this one.
