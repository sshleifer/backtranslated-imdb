I do not think that this movie was rated correctly. I copied my score and refuted the PG score and wrote R. I will not recommend this to anyone under the age of 17 or 18, regardless of what R restrictions are. <br /> Why? <br /> Why? It has one scene in the forest along with many nude Indian women. I do not know anything about you But that is not what children will actually see. It may be the traditional "clothing style" of Indians (?) Indians. But ... I think some nude pictures should rate movies. R <br /> <br / > I haven't watched the movie recently, but I think that otherwise it's okay.
