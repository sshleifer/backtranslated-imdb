Annie's wig doesn't look good. She's not cute and beautiful enough to play with Annie. Annie is shown in the movie because her outfit looks like a Halloween costume. Scary performances and terrible plans This movie changed from version 1982. I think younger girls should have a leading role. Ashley Johnson plays as a child Annie. Not interesting at all At least the director of casting was suitable for Daddy Warbucks. Miss Hannigan is also someone else. Camilla Bell plays Molly okay. "Warning" This movie may insult your IQ, so you may want to show children 8 and younger Some plots have too many characters and may be difficult in the real world.
