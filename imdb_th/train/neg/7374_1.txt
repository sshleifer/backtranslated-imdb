There is no doubt that the worst movie that Steven Seagal had created and that said a lot. Don't be fooled by rating it as a good way too. This abomination is not worthy of a score of 0/10 if that happens. <br /> <br /> - No plot. <br /> <br /> - Bad action scenes. Worst and not too much. <br /> <br /> - Seagal doesn't do everything himself, including fighting, talking. (Mass copying) and others like ever. <br /> <br /> - Seagal is fat, lazy and doesn't care about this movie. Something that is obvious all the time. <br /> <br /> Take the DTV garbage that Seagal has created multiply together in multiples of thousands and billions and all the badness you get doesn't explain 1% of this absolute crapfest.
