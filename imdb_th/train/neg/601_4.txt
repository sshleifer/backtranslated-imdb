!!!!! Of course there are spoilers !!!!! I'm sure this project started from a screen writing workshop about avoiding clichés in horror movies: female protagonist - examining the bad things that happened to the drug-addicted. Heorine knocked out the villain - Check the heroine In order, we saw the villain resurrected behind the heroine - check. Unfortunately, people sent this ancient name to the movie studio instead of using it as a classroom. Dear, if only transport in London is normal, as before happened here. In fact, there are many cliché and see it before no one thinks about the details about this creep or how long he killed people on the ground. I believe that it is the result of human trials, and perhaps it wasn't until that night that he decided to avenge humanity. But all this is so vague that it is meaningless Producers think that they will create a movie that will sweep the Oscars that year and have a market for horror. In the same way, I suspect that it is too expensive and has one eye on the DVD market rather than the movie distribution, and I will say it is slightly better than DEATH LINE of 1972, which is featured like a cannibal that hides in the London underground. It's just that when you think that all the clichés have been used in this movie, other ancient ideas come along to raise an ugly head.
