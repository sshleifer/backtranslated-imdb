No, it's not a horror movie ... This is actually a love story. <br /> <br /> The ring is a silent movie from 1927 that shows two boxers and women coming between them. She loves boxers known as "One Round". She loves him until the champion arrives. Although she was married to One Round, but she started to flirt with the champion until the end of the final boxing fight between One Round and Champion. Will win the fight and win his wife's love back and forth astonishingly the stand Although there are some special techniques in movies and comedy shows But this film didn't depend on his work later It must have been very seduced at times, even with unscrupulous unorthodox wives. That may have been the beginning of 1927. While watching all the old movies, it was amazing that I thought they could repeat on the screen today and come out really. Maybe I should be this person .... <br /> <br /> Skip this movie if you don't plan to watch all of Hitchcock's movies. You may sleep in the middle.
