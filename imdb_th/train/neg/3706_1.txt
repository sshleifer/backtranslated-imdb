I think all the jokes of this movie is to see the rich white people like Chris Rock and see Chris Rock reacting to people's reactions. But you just saw that Chris Rock is himself and others don't understand him. There may be 2 scenes in all the movies that they use their mechanisms. This thing should be much better.
