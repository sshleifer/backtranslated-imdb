I give Timecop with 10 perfect I give. 1 <br /> <br /> It is very boring and only a little to do with the original Timecop. Many things from Timecop are left and they put new things at Stupid instead. This story happened in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason, now the scheduling is more dangerous: confusion: <br /> <br /> Nothing and action scenes. Will be the most happy, no ... only the first scene That is wonderful ... and there are not many action scenes and all of them are quite short. <br /> <br /> At one point in the main story The character travels about 5 times in a matter of minutes ... don't wait to make it twice ... <br /> <br /> In the short term: Don't waste your time watching this movie. It's not worth it.
