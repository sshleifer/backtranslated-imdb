Cameron Diaz is a woman who married a judge, played by Harvey Kate, who had a good life until the past appeared and things were a little complicated while I watched this movie many times. Do that .. because this film is ridiculous and boring and has a bad script without confidence No matter how the audience feels about what actually happened .. Even the lovely Cameron can't record this one to ten. 2
