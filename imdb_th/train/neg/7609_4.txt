Being a big fan of Corman's horror film, I expect from his west more than I received. I really enjoyed it I almost laughed as I watched the Blazing Saddles of Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> Look at the tracks of the moving tires on the old western pastures. You can kill time by counting if there are boring scenes happening. And the horse looks like a gear Look at the swinging bar room as the queen of the traditional western wild saloon car made to remind the memories of the dance of the 1920s. Here for decades before the style was invented. Hope that the sedans around them will not be demolished. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the main actors' assault, they perform well. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are really good. Special for them for doing the best thing they can do with the material that seems like most have been lifted out. But there is nothing wrong with the ridiculous westerners like this Like the horror movie that is terrible, it may fail one way. But succeeded in giving happiness anyway That is one of the reasons that Corman's work attracted me and that is why I dare to suggest you experience this movie if you have the opportunity.
