(Some possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Dreamworks is thinking about when they decide to spend $ 80 million on animation. fatigue They may think that the beautiful animation would be more than enough to make the audience. (Mostly family) saw it as a group It looks like it will work on weekends. It made about 26 million dollars, and made $ 38.1 million in total (an assessment for this weekend), but I think the audience coming on weekends. Will see the same things I do when I see and they spread the word This is one of the very weak films, in addition to all the animations, most of the script seems to be done by the age of three. <br /> <br /> The film takes only 80 minutes, long but it feels. Like an epic three hours A few anchor points for me is an annoying storytelling that is one of them and it is clearly written. At one point, he escaped from some of the captors, and even if you saw that the horse was clearly scared, the narrator (Matt Damon's voice is capable) to clear misunderstandings (which would easily happen <Br /> <br /> Another song is Brian Adams' pop song. Now I'm a fan of him. I think he's good. But DreamWorks thinks the audience will be able to manage his 8-9 songs throughout the short film. I can't do it eventually, and this is a horse spoiler being shot at close range by members of Calvary. She (the horse) then fell into a crazy river. The spirit (the focus of the movie) tried to help her. But they both crossed the waterfall that had to drop at least 50 feet. After that, in the film near the end, we saw that this horse is still alive and well. I know this is a movie for children. But even if the realism is unacceptable, <br /> <br /> If you want to conclude, this is a bad image. Vie I'm not saying that children will not enjoy it. But anyone who will check their watches just wait for this rag to end. Of course, the top 10 worst list of this year - ** from 4 stars. <br /> <br />
