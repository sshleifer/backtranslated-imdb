I must say that there are many who argue that some of us have to get in the moment that the new "Duke" movie is a modern version. Oh, please. If this is what you think is modern, Hollywood can keep it Many people on the MSN website also said that (And I bid) "You have to face the old fog and except as it is" Let me tell you something. I'm 24, so I'm far from the old and the old FOGIE and I won't understand it. Everybody's wrong is dangerous. The only thing that is correct in the movie name is "HAZZARD". Profanity, smoking and drinking are really necessary. The actors are terrible. Jessica has been screened several times in the morning to talk about this movie and frankly, I believe it's gone. She is not Daisy Duke, perhaps a coincidence. But it is not dukes. I love Sean Williams Scott but not Bo. They should include at least the original characters. But even Hollywood knows that they won't approve the script. I mean, people who come with even the current actors and actors express negative opinions, so why are some of you talking in a positive light?
