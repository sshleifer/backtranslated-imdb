I have never commented on IMDb before, but I felt I had to do it after watching the animated movie The Batman. It was definitely rubbish! Warner Brothers has a complete animated series in Batman in the early 1990s, so they try to do with the winning formula. I felt like writing a complaint letter to WB. The original animation was dark and thoughtful as the military intended to be. WB had to deal with Batman, the rag of the future. Now they produce this drift. The Joker, unlike Joker from DC DC comics, should sue. I ask everyone who agrees with me to email or write to the WB and use the manpower to return to the original formula.
