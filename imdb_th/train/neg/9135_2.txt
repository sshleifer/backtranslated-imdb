Oh Sam Mraovich, we know you tried hard. This is your masterpiece, which is an impressive example for the rest of us, which you should be nominated in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Alas better than being quiet and thinking of being a person. More stupid to say and eliminate all doubts with Ben & Arthur. You do that. <br /> <br /> It seems that lack of teaching or study of the script in this movie will guide us into strange scenes Challenges in each new scene This is a crazy excuse for the story that may be the best partner of this film. Ben and Arthur try to marry in gratitude, beginning innocently until flying across the country, doing in the shadow of Vermont's best palm trees. But all of these gestures are just bringing in blood. The blood will increase and the blood will increase. I mean there must be at least $ 20 in fake blood in the last three steps of this movie. <br /> <br /> All the movies, it's technical etiquette. From sound to music editing, which consists of a single fuzzy bass note that is held on the keyboard, it's surprising that this film will gather in the media you watch. It's so shameful to show some good amateurs here. <br /> <br /> Regardless, Sam, I'm sure you have created five numbers in this movie for rent or whatever drives the soul. Bad (Like myself) to watch this movie Sadly, we didn't laugh with you.
