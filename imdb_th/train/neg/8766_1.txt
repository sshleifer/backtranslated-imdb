I should be alert all over by saying that I shouldn't watch this movie. It failed to deliver a proper tribute in a beautiful manner that was almost an insult to the memories of those brave men. The special technique is terrible. I didn't expect all the failures in the director who admired the military technology. How can a machine gun fire at a speed of 600 shots per minute in a 1 / 10th speed shot? How can the soldiers fall forward when the grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive when the bullets fall near the nearest 20 feet away. The bullets fall on one side of the road, not themselves. <br /> <br /> This thing is not just But showing respect for only weapons that shocked me. It was an obsolete situation and the inconsistency of dialogue. Have me screaming for murder There are standard conversations such as Ye bhi kisi ka bhai Hai, ise laath mat maro and Pakistani se jyaada musalmaan to Hindustaan ​​me hai and LOC across the mat karo you mera hukum hai stupid to say little <br /> <br /> things That Shobha De wrote is true The director works without using the script and it shows. No movie flow There is no gradual progression from one battle to another. It was just the next gunfight, without any involvement in the whole war plan. Scary scenes Chief of Staff of the Army looks unreliable. In order to make matters worse, people in the theater cut the picture to fit the movie for four hours in 3 hours.
