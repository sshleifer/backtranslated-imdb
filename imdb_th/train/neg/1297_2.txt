In general, I picked up this movie because I saw the wonderful Zatoichi remake of Kitano Takashi and was in the mood of the samurai story that was updated again. These two films are separated. Zatoichi adds humor and depth to the characters and retains the samurai movie clich√©s. Gojoe out into the depths on the other side. <br /> <br /> First of all, I hate movies with characters Other dramas let the audience know how the main character is, instead of having the character develop throughout the movie's path. "You can't decide whether you are a priest or a warrior," said the character. Almost all in the presence of Ben few. But this inner turmoil is hardly conveyed within the character itself Rather than developing the character, we get a bloated and bloody fighting scene filled with blood. Asano's character was not developed and even he seemed to be bored and didn't know what he was doing there. I know that he always looks distant and cool, and that is part of Asano's charm, but this movie doesn't serve him. <br /> <br /> Many camera movements are boring. There are scenes that happen forever, which the camera rotates around the main character until my wife and I feel like vomiting. The ending is ridiculous and quite anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> It's terrible that the really good samurai movie isn't produced in Japan today with this budget. Great colors, scenery and costumes But the rest is just a waste of time I would like to see one of this Kabuki legend.
