At first, we will see the beginning of some secret councils. Everything looks very promising from going. With the supernatural elements thrown into it, the mystery is more interesting in no time. The main character that looks like a good bloke will suffer because he claims he is eligible to receive money. You really sympathize the guy and you want to know what happened. Usually, the person in his situation will have many options. Somehow, he doesn't have those options. In this film, it seems to be the only solution, even though it is clear that it's not his fault. He met the characters who spoke of the church, prayer and God from the blue. And they give answers to his problems It should be obvious at one point in the movie that what this solution is. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Because it is always useful But is it really necessary to conceal this message? This religious element destroys my viewing experience. Although the message is good But simplicity cannot avoid the fact that in real life the need arises to solve problems The mystery presented to us has never been solved. You must be forced to deal with other topics that are not related to PTSD. Don't be fooled by Malcolm Mcdowell, one of the great actors. But if you look closely, you will see that he is not serious at all. He must despair of money. Otherwise, what will be his talented actor who will perform in this movie?
