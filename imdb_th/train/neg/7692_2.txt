There are a few previous comments here, which have opinions about the various ancient ideas of this film and I completely agree both in terms of characters and dialogue. <br /> <br /> I read about With the terrifying Elizabeth Berkly, performing in the equally terrifying "Showgirls" that I had never seen before, and her performance here, while not terrible, was up to the standard of fare that worsened. Lifetime Her character doesn't have depth. But may not receive If so, it will make this film unbalanced due to lack of depth or special abilities - not traces - in any character, actor or drawing. <br /> <br /> Headmaster of management Liz's initial complaint after her teacher kissed her in the hall. The reaction and initial advice of her husband is the same. (Forest Gamp attacks Jenny's girlfriend in his car, giving him a clever, realistic and hell action. He is challenged by the mind.) <br /> <br /> The unclean lawyer (Excuse redundancy) The father of the student who actually lied and did something worthy of praise for his performance: he was both laughing and annoying at the same time. Her lawyer is a sober person. <br /> <br /> Finally (and frankly, I like it now more) Police are a group of people who don't feel like you are a person. Rather depend on Barney Fife without Andy to deal with law enforcement and investigation in your community. I know that most realistic police lack sharpness, intelligence and attention at the level represented by most characters in the series "Law and Order" and similar things - but dolphins at this level seem to be Bookbinding "Lifetime" <br /> <br /> Finally I found "Stories" that are attracted by Josh's mix of being the "victim" of his teacher. The script performance in this story is even worse than his overall performance in the main story. This is a success, such as going from "F" to "F-minus". <br /> <br /> All this crippling situation should be fixed - in real life - in about 15 minutes after the actual meeting. Between the teacher and the school staff and the husband involved But after that, will cut off the planned drama and leave the film empty for an hour on the camera. <br /> <br /> But the writer (s) here prove with their endings, they can do worse. up When the situation has been "corrected" and "correct" in the end, it can be done in about 45 seconds without any indication of what measures are taking place in the context. Any "real world" for the offender and his guardian May be able to find a path to redemption. <br /> <br /> This 2 * person presentation "*" is the second because it has a soft "charm".
