(Unfortunately, my copy was fixed with eyes) <br /> <br /> Hoff, starring Gary, the photographer who accompanied Leslie's girlfriend (Leslie Cumming) His beautiful girlfriend goes to a dilapidated hotel on a deserted island that seems to have been abandoned to take pictures of her latest project. Books about witches; While there, Gary disappointed, hoping to try and treat the bad case of the blue ball by Leslie's relief of her innocence. <br /> <br /> His plans for the nookie were scuppered but by The unexpected arrival of real estate developer Freddie Rosenberg (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross) their daughter, Jane (Blair), son of Tommy (Michael Manche Munster) natural cute architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hic kland) and real estate agents The island's hotel <br /> <br /> After explaining their unexpected appearance on the island, Gary and Leslie were greeted by the new owner of the hotel and when the storm suddenly grew, everyone returned.
