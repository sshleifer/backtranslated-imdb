Obviously I didn't care about Things to Come (known as "The shape of things that will come") as much as most viewers That means there is a chance that you will enjoy it more than I do. You may find it useful to listen to movies described from other perspectives. <br /> <br /> Directed by William Cameron Menzies, who has much experience as a production designer and even more as a director. art This is a film adaptation by HG Wells of his novel of the same name. In my eyes, it helps to show why a great novelist might not have to become a great screenwriter. <br /> <br /> The film opened in May. In 1940, in "Everytown" in London, the war was going on, and the citizens of Everytown were concerned that they might reach them. It made and became a decade-long story that destroyed civilization. Wales and Menzies continue to show us the scenes related to the war and the consequences. We saw two pilots, one of whom agreed to the outcome of the fight. We found the post-apocalyptic community that is ruled by the warlords that need it. We found a man from a growing future society. We see how technology is changing. And finally we were led to the full awareness of the future society in the year 2036, where the leaders were discussing the advantages of sending men to the moon. <br /> <br /> That might sound Looks very exciting Just not working as a movie The movie structure is a scene that is too far, with very little binding. By the third part, I lost interest in trying to follow the character completely. I can hardly sort them into the first two groups. There is a continuous new page parade. We didn't learn anything about them. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help each group with a few exceptions that are often guided and slowed. They have also been misappropriated from time to time - it almost started to feel like a propaganda movie. But may be conflicting. The segment is quite cool and dry. Emotion. <br /> <br /> In fact, the one that is too long is similar to music videos / videos promoting the industry. If there is a picture of building a city of the future, along with many large machines, a lot of welding, and so on, at one point, the guy who looks like a wave of astronauts on the camera through the future glass The songs in this section are between military scores and excessive horror scores. I can't say that Things to Come contains interesting content in terms of drama. <br /> <br /> But the general vocals that support Things to Come are "movies about ideas" that may be true. But there are a few problems if looking at it One is still not able to use it as a movie. That is, as a visual arts drama and a second, there are many ideas presented here. <br /> <br /> The main idea is Of war and things to civilization That's a good story about making movies about It was a very surprising story about World War II, because Things To To was scripted and filmed in 1935 (launched in 1936). Wales has something to do with the war, some of which conflict with the interpretation As usual of the movie For example, the ending seems to suggest that another war is forming or will occur at any time. The overall message seems to be pessimistic. Wales seems to show that war is only a part of human nature that cannot be excerpted even if it is not interrupted. "Progress" But in fact, maybe it could be fueled at least indirectly. <br /> <br /> That would be enough for a movie. However, there are many other ideas here. The scene between the two pilots is one of the more painful scenes of the movie. It involves a complex dilemma. One pilot shot another But now is coming to help him But the pilot who was shot was considered a toxic gas, which now has waves across the field They both could not breathe gas without harm. Women come in They have only two gas-operated protective masks. The pilot who was shot was presented his mask while he said he was dying. What to do? Not that this scene will stretch along the length of the feature. But the bizarre complex ideas of both helping and trying to harm each other in the midst of the war are enough to create a movie.> <br /> Another example In the scene where the warlords are in a bad environment, there is a disgusting infectious disease called "nomadic disease". Walking around, it turns the victim into a drunken zombie. The normal procedure is to shoot the victim on the website in an attempt to prevent the disease. This content is handled as if it were content later. It is a good idea and deserves to have his own movie. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Wells presents a future society that has a controversial socialist concept. That is enough for the movie itself as well. It is impossible to handle things effectively within 100 minutes, especially when it should be the beginning of the movie instead of attracting a lot of attention. <br /> <br /> Still there. Reason to give at least one thing to see If you are a sci-fi movie player, this is a movie that has historical significance. From the background of Menzies, the production and design of the scene is interesting, although the movie looks very old. It is also interesting to see that Wales is a person who likes to think or have a sense of humor in his "predictions". I am extremely happy with the way to drive to the moon, which makes me very remember. Of George Méliès' 1902 A Trip to the Moon (aka Le Voyage and Lalun) Do not expect anything more to follow.
