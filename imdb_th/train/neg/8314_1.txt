I saw Chan Is Missing when it first came out, about four years after moving from San Francisco to New York. Maybe it was the view of the next few years. But this movie seems to capture the essence of the city and people better than anything else I have ever seen (still). It focuses on one particular community - China - but it's okay because of the spirit of the city. Big refracted through the face and voice settings that may be superior to the characters. <br /> <br /> This is not a San Francisco tourist. The setting is humble and every day: taxis, taxis, Chinese restaurant kitchens, neighborhoods, Richmond neighborhoods, small Chinatown apartments and small business offices, harbor docks, Filipino elderly centers. This is what the city looks and feels like on a daily basis with the people who live there - even in the era of Silicon Gulch's urban development, which is different from Dirty Harry. Visiting San Francisco as well) Everything was filmed at the street level: We came to understand the character's perspective from their point of view. <br /> <br /> The palace was filmed in B&W. Clearly because he had no money to do Other snacks But one of the strongest visual elements of the film is the natural light that he achieved. The quality of the intense and frequent sunshine is one of my closest relationships with San Francisco: it seems to reveal all things, bringing buildings, mountains, other important places down to funny levels. And make people pass On the road looks more individual and closer to you than you think elsewhere. Wang's photography perfectly illustrates this and also helps stories from various points. <br /> <br /> Wang can speak words and other Chinese and San Francisco conversations. Better than you think If there is a true "accent" of San Francisco, it's what you hear from a broker, a bald coin, a taxi (I think) that appears to talk on the phone in one scene. Ya dingaling! "). <br /> <br /> The story is harsh and even with a few minor mistakes. But gave a beautiful score about the desire to attract people living in the old immigrant community - including the political, religious and ethnic dissatisfaction and a little ironic comedy that helped fuel them. All of this has been finely communicated - perhaps why some respondents think that this movie is crooked. It is not to say that the pursuit of Chan's two taxi drivers became a more personal mission. <br /> <br /> Chan Is Missing ended with the support of Chinatown's journey. By strange songs from the 1930s (I guess) about San Francisco and the crazy variety American caricature, yes But not entirely marked
