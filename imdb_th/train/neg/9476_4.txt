A crazy mad detective with all black actors trying to figure out who is a betrayal trumpet player who is going to Hollywood to make it big. Is it his wife? His girlfriend? Will be his girlfriend? Her father? His Butler? People, newspapers? Who knows? And who cares? The result of this story is a little downhill and the actors here do not make me emotionally interested in one way or another. Why are poisonous snakes armed? Who knows? Who cares? This song is okay. But there are few and most are beautiful "Come and listen." This is not worth your time. There are movies that show all blacks.
