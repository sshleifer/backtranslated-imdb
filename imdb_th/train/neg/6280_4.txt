Have you ever had a cool image in your heart that you thought it would be good if you were in a movie: like seeing a detective look through the cracks of a broken fence of an abandoned house? Or seeing a woman walking down the road that looks cold and intense and very alert? Yes. Imagine stretching that image into a whole movie. You have the idea of ​​Broken, but there is no detective in this movie. I just use it as a visual example. But women who look harsh are here and she replenishes 99% of the time on the screen. I have nothing to complain about this woman. She is the perfect choice for this role. <br /> <br /> I think I am an open person and can enjoy all kinds of artistic expressions. Something really annoying It would be really cool if I could set one of the scenes from this movie and hang it on the wall. Let's come here. The performance is great. Some expressions on the actor's face are what makes me look. <br /> <br /> Now the problem of this movie Above all, nothing else here again. The director generally uses obsession and runs far beyond what it is worth. I don't think it's a spoiler. If I say that the obsession is "mirror", let's see. This singular idea exists throughout the bloody place and that's what the director must work together True, there are only a few twists and turns here and there. If you pay attention, nothing will surprise you. In the end, the plot is clear beside. <br /> <br /> Now I don't keep bones with this kind of art because I enjoy them as a part. Large. I still believe that we should judge the art base on the media used to show what the artist wants to express. The movie is not a piece of music or a picture or drawing, or even a poem, and not just a cool image in mind. It is all that includes good stories and character development. I consider Lynch's movie style that is cheating. It is responsible and cheap and waste of the middle. We gave 2 hours of movie screenings for good reason. Therefore, we should judge it differently from judging a single picture frame, such as a photo or drawing. <br /> <br /> This film is not a complete Lynch style. Thank you very much. It has linear development and finally comes to a conclusion. It doesn't have much story or character development. It presents itself quite seriously with characters that consist of the average person, so distance yourself from other fantasy things, at least from the surface. It does not give any explanation about the fantasy elements and never tries to create a consistent world around it. Where is the strangeness coming from and seems rather isolated and unintentional? Perhaps the connection remains in the director's head. But from what I saw, he didn't use much effort to realize it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Where is he trying? It seems that he made a lot of effort to create emotions and strengthen with music. Music often creates tension, which eventually becomes tease. Only in the back of the film that shocked and tense. <br /> <br /> Finally, I felt: Okay, I know what you're trying to say here. But that is the point that you are trying to do Do it take two hours to create all these tensions? It is quite irrelevant to the character that is and what they live. And we will get very little about the character that is What we have is a situation that just happened to be disappointing, but I think the director has not enough content to work with and it shows.
