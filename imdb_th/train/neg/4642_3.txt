I saw "Rachel's attic roof" by thinking that I would be inside to enjoy. However, it wasn't like that. About the internal organs. Yes, but fun. That would be a big thing. No fat! In fact, the only reason I gave "3" was because of the fact that Gunnar Hansen appeared (for a moment) as one of the offensive characters. They used to deceive Mr. Hansen in this work ... How do I not know? This concept is interesting. But not performing well The direction is pedestrian and the show is normal. The only worse thing is special techniques. YIKES !!! I've seen better effects in playing at school level. Surrender to Mr. W. It's time for a career change ... I heard that they're hiring at Mel's Diner! There are very few indie movies made out of Michigan ... and "Rachel's Attic" is not one of them.
