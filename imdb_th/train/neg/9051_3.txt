I was so excited when I discovered that this thing was available! I can't wait to see it. It's a waste of energy! It's like the rarities CD that your favorite band found on the back of the shelf at your local music store. Being a hardcore fanatic, you are sure that this is a valuable discovery. But when you hear it clear why these dogs have never actually made an album This DVD is suitable for "Graduation" which requires everything Lynch has done. "Six Men Getting Sick" is quite interesting. But short and redundant It lacks the power of Lynch's work later. "The Grandmother" is an immature job. It's boring and looks like a student movie. But it's 70s ... It's interesting when you hope to analyze the director. But you can see briefly the seeds of the picture and sound. His trademark "The Alpahabet" is memorable (not true! I do not remember!) "The Amputee" is pointless. "Cowboy and French" are just stupid. "Lumiere" is the only thing worthwhile in the group Without interacting, Lynch tells the annoying story that is comparable to his best work. I have to watch this story many times. But it works less than 2 minutes, worth it to rent or buy a DVD
