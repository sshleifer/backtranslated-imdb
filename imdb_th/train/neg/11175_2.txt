If nobody knows me, I don't know what this movie is about. Looks like the picture with the text But far from it This movie tells the nonsense story of a New York media representative and his problems. And that's all When the agent is played by Pacino, we must think that it must be important. But it is not difficult to think that this film is meaningless and boring. For one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino is the second film of the year. (Another story is "Simon") that deserves the nickname. "The most boring and ridiculous movie of the year" What happened?
