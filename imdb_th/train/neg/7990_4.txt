'Anita and Me' is a drama about growing in the United Kingdom with a variety of races, such as 'Bend it Like Beckham' or, more closely, 'East is East' which is divided into 1970s. (Despite the Black Country accent) but the movie lacks 'East is the power of the East and the results seem rather thin and repetitive. Moreover, the description of the important relationship of this film between an Asian woman and her white friend is deep enough to prove how the film is structured around it. I was bored with the movie that the hero spent many years as a writer. This is often what real writers have touched. But it is a new element in the novel 'East is East' is fun and sharp. 'Anita and Me' seems clear and boring when compared.
