Now, here is a movie that, if done in Australia, is easy to joke. Sad and annoying. This is weakness and magic and overflowing from the land. Lala di-erector. How wrong? Mostly by taking seriously the work, so shocking that no one in the right mind can be serious. Unless they are stupid gay men who are stupid (But very cute) ... or is an ancient idea that is overlaid with ancient ideas There is no value in the story that is almost like the prequel of Gus Van Sant GERRY ..... and with the name THE FLUFFER, how much weight is there waiting for? This author must be so crazy that he didn't go to Burt and BOOGIE before he had to do it himself. Complex and not developed beyond themes 'Unrequited love of boring' left from the poem Streisand that faded away. We left only the cupcakes that were emotional and the story at the serial level of the TV. The unnecessary fourth action of this protracted drama is a terrifying thing because this movie walks out like the Gerri to the desert and is stuck there. In Oz, in the late 1990s, there were about 20 films that created similar films, but actually called MONEYSHOT. Initially filmed in the Venus factory, it suffered a lot from the director who was more terrifying than Orson, so they filmed. The other half with a brutal TV editor to chop it up and down to 72 minutes and hey-presto. The lesson there when the bad movie turned down well by losing weight. I guess that FLUFF The ER is stiff in its launch and after seeing it not working, I understand why.
