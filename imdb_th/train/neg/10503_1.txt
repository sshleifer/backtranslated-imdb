I watched this movie yesterday .. I rented a DVD from a blockbuster .. I actually know the actors from one movie .. I won't say who ..! (That's under the wrap ..) But I have to admit it's not as good as I think it will be .. Tom Savini? The hat came down to this guy .. but it was a shame that he wasn't in this movie for a long time .. The lack of stuff in this movie was thought, script, sound, etc. It might look like a good movie .. but Not It's not fun .. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm glad my sister paid 10 pounds for renting 3 DVDs from Blockbuster .. I chose this one .. and I was disappointed. Anyway, give me a finger ..! Not my cup of tea! 0 out of 10!
