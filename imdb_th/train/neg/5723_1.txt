Anyone who says better than the hostel is saying that shit is complete. Believe me that I'm not a fan of the hostel. But this is ridiculous This is another shot of the camcorder, straight to the DVD, leaving a little of your thoughts to waste. I can't believe how many of these movies have been and I haven't seen anyone in the video. 80s movies, horror and horror movies made without budget But it is a great story and a lot of new ideas, and most importantly, the heart and soul of the director who has nothing to say Now they seem to be pumped out in an attempt to trick people who are watching Blockbuster to rent a copy until people stop doing this. I think these movies will continue to appear. This movie has a very low idea, as amazing as it used to be. The performance is terrible. The place is completely unbelievable and the soundtrack is very annoying. This time wasting nothing happens unless you make the worst movie of all time. The best part of me / the worst of this movie is when the female character is pointing the gun at someone and threatening to shoot them. If they don't fall back, you will see that she didn't close the trigger. Her fingers, grip, of course jokes
