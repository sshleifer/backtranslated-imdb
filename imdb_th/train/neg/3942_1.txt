Oh, God is a horrible movie. This film has involved people unfortunately, it's not worth watching. I saw it free at my local library. If I pay to see this thing, I will be more sorry. This movie cannot be watched. How can Tarintino be involved with slow and exciting movies? It is not surprising that it has not been distributed so much that everyone involved is embarrassed. I can make a better movie with my camera and big toe. It's too boring for me to hate it. Tarintino just stood in my eyes. This must be a joke that is sick. Don't pay attention to this movie. If someone hints, you should watch it kill them.
