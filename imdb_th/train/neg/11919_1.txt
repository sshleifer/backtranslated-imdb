This must be one of those movies that the trailer is 50 times better than itself. The first time I saw a trailer in 1991, it looked very good. Then I wanted to watch it but never found ... .. To this day, yes, 14 years later. <br /> <br /> Just say I'm really disappointed. Okay. I know it's not an Oscar winner. But still hope that it will be fun Movies without brains to cast blood It's a pity that it doesn't belong to the pool. <br /> <br /> What with all American rock and roll music and acting is terrible, it's scary. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes look garbage <br /> <br /> This DVD cost me just 5 pounds and I believe I think it's too expensive by Â£ 7. <br /> <br /> Now I'm sorry I know I won't.
