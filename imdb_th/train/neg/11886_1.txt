Watching Josh Kornbluth's 'action' in this film reminds me of my first television production class that 'isn't funny'. There is a chance to prove that they really are not really nasty. <br /> < that mind when I try to summarize this wannabe joke The jokes are complex and telegraphy. Poor delivery, painful, OUCH !!!!!!! Writing is just a dorkish. It's like showing Bob Saget. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is painful, like watching a live performance on a Saturday and a half hour. (Post Belushi) <br /> <br /> I hate this movie and want a refund !!!
