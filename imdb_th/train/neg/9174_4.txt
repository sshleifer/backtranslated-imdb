I always like zombies. But this is not good. <br /> <br /> The good part: the girl who has no upper part with gold pants, Sonya Salomaa's bare breasts /> <br /> The bad part: too much video cutting, too slow matrix movement (It's dragging action) Blood and courage is not enough. Bad performances and no stories. Other people in the theater are smart and left behind. Swimming scenes. No top-notch. 10
