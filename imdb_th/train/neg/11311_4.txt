I remember Ben from my sci-fi in 60 days. I did interviews and actors / actors who were not clear, especially Ben, actress Fay Spain and Jody Fair, Angela player in 1961 of The Young Savages Ben is one of the low-key anti-sci-fi people in Chicago around 1970, when I talked to him and "career" and his life. All of this was published in some unforgettable moments throughout the day. Hopefully I will still have a copy of those interviews. But during the march and those people would not remember me many years later Ben is a very good friend. (The downside of those days was not paying for their guests, unless of course they were big-name celebrities and even paying two hundred dollars a lot! It's good to know that Ben is alive and kicking! What is the remake of life? But over 50 years old! Now ugly, now ugly!
