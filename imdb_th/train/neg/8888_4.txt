I give 2 basic intuition points high, but the film has a score of less than 4. This movie has only 4 stories from me, but it has 7.3 from over 600 people. I don't see the reason why they like this movie so much. > <br /> This movie is boring because it almost never leaves those rooms in a broken house and only 5 people in this movie. It's almost two hours long, which isn't necessary at all. Many conversations are slow and meaningless. The tone of the film is dark blue, which looks depressing. This movie shortened only a few sentences. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of "three times" directed by Hou Hsiao hsien that the dialogue is equally boring. There is also a high score! I have to stop watching that after the first story ends. <br /> <br /> This film lacks passion or excitement.
