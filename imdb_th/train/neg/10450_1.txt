This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen since "Date Movie". I laughed throughout the story instead of being afraid. It's funny that the snake will search for any part of the passenger's body to attack, such as eyes, tongue, tongue, breast butt. If we see national geographic channels, we know that snakes will not be on the body when they bite. In each scene, the snake will bite the person and bite on that body. I believe that the manufacturer did not study his information about snakes and their behavior. I do not want to believe that I lost money on this movie, so I do not recommend this movie to trust, just wait until it's at the dollar theater.
