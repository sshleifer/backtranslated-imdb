In 2004 I liked it. Then it was very stupid. It shows that the children are stupid. It's insulting children. Cartoon network was great. One of my favorite programs is Hamtaro. It manages to be interesting and imaginative in the way of programming for children. Performances (foster homes for imaginary friends) are like putting 20 spoons of sugar into your sprite. It seems that today's TV producers are more interested in earning more than engaging their children's imagination and making money! Recently my children are tuning into old programs (60s) to find interesting things to watch. Perhaps in the absence of originality for the television, look at the past and recycle the children's list from the days passed.
