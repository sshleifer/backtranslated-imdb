There is no question about spoilers. For this movie, the director also defeats us and makes this movie a lot of ways. <br /> <br /> Movies that are scammed, such as Critters and Gremlins. Fail On many levels to remember the humor and horror of newly created movies It ended up being a waste of time that a bad actor sent bad conversations in front of an idiot director who sometimes threw stuffed toys into them. They fight with toys that are said in the same way as Tarzan movies that used to shake rubber crocodiles while screaming and trying to do their best to look a little threatened. It's painful to watch and not be helped by the 80s fashion that is worn by actors. <br /> <br /> In general, some crazy aliens, some of whom are imprisoned by the authorities.

Then the movie sorta ended and everything ended well. <br /> <br /> It's not like watching the train wreck. You can't take your eyes. It's terrible.

Fashion police still have a number of outstanding warrants for actors and I dare not to laugh at the rake. This score is the most 2 out of 10 on a good day.
