One of the worst movies I've ever seen, how to define "the worst?" I like to have both eyes pulled out and forced to touch dance with them more than ever to see the ruins. However, One-Hit Wonder Zwick manages a movie that makes Elvis fans, Mary Kay saleswomen, Las Vegas, gays, FBI agents and remaining humanity with good intelligence with funny stories. vis Presley Enterprises licensed Elvis music that actually happened in a movie with a central location that seemed to be "The only good thing of Elvis Presley Imitator is that the dead" is above me. The worst part of this mess - and that requires some work - is a patterned script: in 1958, Elvis' words and songs he would say / show in 1970 were quoted! Worst special effects? Oscar goes to a moron who decides that Elvis's grave may be the most recognizable / photographed grave in the world, similar to a pyramid with a gold plaque attached to the top of the hill and located. In the middle of the garden It is likely that the biggest audience of this film will be Elvis's fans. However, the madness is rampant. (Nixon gave Elvis brand DEA, not the FBI's identity ... and I will continue) actually undermining traditional wisdom. Ugh. I use the word "wisdom" to describe stupid movies. This folly This is a really scary and scary movie.
