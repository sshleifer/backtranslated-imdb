I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but I'm looking forward to doing this. I was intrigued by the advance description of Enterprise. The style is narrow and underwater compared to the familiar Treks. <br /> <br /> I don't see anything interesting. This pilot, I found the plot to be interesting. Confused and confused <br /> <br /> I'll admit that I like character development - human depiction as a 'teenager' who is ready to grow faster than fun. <br /> <br /> And children The Vulcan baby has one hell of a shelf. <br /> Unbelievable <br /> But I don't think I will stick to this story in this series. <br /> <br /> 3/10
