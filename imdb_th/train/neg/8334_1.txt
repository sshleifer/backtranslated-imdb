This is the worst performance from Robert Duval that sounds like William Buckley throughout the story. His beautiful performances take a lot of interest. I'm not sure if this is a intentional or accidental theft. But it's the only thing I can remember from a truly memorable movie. This picture should be shown in every amateur show class that should not be done. Thank God, Duvall went forward for something bigger and better and stopped trying to focus on cultural accents. He is a good actor. But it's about it Chlor is much better. His performances were muted and important.
