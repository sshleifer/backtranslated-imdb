I saw this DVD in my friend's house and thought this was a Turkish action movie with a few Hollywood names. Interested enough, I decided to give it a shot later .. It was a difficult experience to endure. Believe me. Then, after finally seeing the credit roll, I thought, 'We Turks really sucked in creating a Hollywood style movie .. This is an insult to robbery | Movie hostage type ..' But then wait! I check the name and not they are not Turkish names and not this is not Turkish movies; On the other hand, it was literally shot in America with American directors and staff! That makes me think again. - How do you convince names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo in this world to participate in the project? With money, probably .. that makes me think later .. How do you increase this amount to offer them and the expected international actors? Then all of my meditation is gone and I come to find the answer by hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find. And if you still have difficulty in adjusting your budget: by writing and directing the movie you are trying to create or vice versa, I don't have any information about that The bottom line, so this is not a bad movie that everyone is worried about offering .. It makes you think - in my case, even meditating - and there are a lot of movies that don't have any impact. At least make you think It makes you wonder .. It makes you skeptical .. then it makes you wonder again ..
