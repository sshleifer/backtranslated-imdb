Watching this movie in the previous preview and I couldn't stress enough that I thought how bad this movie was. From the beginning, the audience was groaning at Pachino's southern accent. Poor Al actually looks really haggard and I can't decide if this is part of his role as a drug publicist or maybe he doesn't sleep before getting into the scene. However, things that are worse than Pacino's closeup are a bad excuse. At the beginning of the movie, we have been shown that Pacino's characters are gay and I wonder if that's what the screenwriter intended. However, later we should suppress our unbelief and believe that both Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both of them are sleepwalking through a weak role). The worst part is the main plot topic which is related to corporate espionage that has not been fully explained and we have never been interested in the slightest matter. Because this is an example, I will reserve the final judgment because there is a possibility of filming and editing. But you can bet that I will not pay to sign to see this in the cinema.
