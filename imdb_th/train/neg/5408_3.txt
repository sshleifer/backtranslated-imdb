This review is the most spoiler. If you plan to enjoy this movie, do not read this review. <br /> <br /> That's the problem of TV programs for children today. It is all that foster and rest "Wow, good fun, right?" No, it's not. And, unfortunately, it seems that it will infiltrate children's movies as well. And that is the meaning of 'Flight of the Reindeer'. It is accepted that I have never seen 'Flight of the Reindeer' in the last few years, so I may be blurred at some point. The teacher who received the book for Christmas Now the narrator is a famous scientist about the flying habits of some animals. I think it is absurd. However, in this book, the teacher / family learns that the reindeer can fly in the same way as a bullfrog. Obviously, this book was written by scientists hundreds of years ago that disappeared in the North Pole. Now, if it's me, I'll throw the book out to the nearest window. Flying bullfrogs are natural occurrences. But the reindeer flying is a great and unrealistic concept. But the instructor is not me, so I guess that will explain why he decided to fly to the North Pole, leaving his wife and children at home without knowing where he went. Of course, things happened and before he realized the flying reindeer struck his private plane and he was stuck in the north pole. <br /> <br /> Are you still following this? <br /> <br /> Of course, his family was damaged. I will be like that. I mean, a fascinating Christmas. Elsewhere, Master found himself in a city hidden in the North Pole, inhabited by dwarfs and one dictator, dressed only in red and white. Instead of trying to escape as soon as I do, he greets everyone there with open arms. The hidden civilization of a small monster and he greeted them with an open oooo-kayyyy weapon. They gave him this food that they were Santa's elves and they spent the whole year creating toys for Children that they have no idea And the instructors accept all this He also admitted that Santa Claus was a scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or whatever. There is only one problem - they don't want him to leave. The world cannot know their secret existence. In the end, before they know it will have McDonalds and Starbucks in every corner. <br /> <br /> Still with me <br /> < br /> Now, Mr. Dee's family is now Book and assuming that he went to the North Pole Boys, wouldn't they be embarrassed if they knew he had just walked fast? Before the audience knew that they were traveling for Christmas in the real winter wonderland in the world. At the same time, the instructor was bored with the dwarves and decided to go out. I couldn't remember, but I remembered that he held Santa Claus for the point. The fire fight occurred when the dwarves attacked and he was able to escape through Santa's sleigh. Santa is hot on his heels, and with his blood thirst in his eyes, whatever the strange occurrence, he finds himself flying with the family plane that is looking for him. So he jumped on their plane. The plane flew back and everyone lived a happy life. After that, <br /> <br /> The truth is that there are movies that create a shock in the name of Christmas. Over the years The festive charm they received And it is the most seductive charm of 'Flight of the Reindeer'. It's not much wrong with it. There is nothing to insult the intellect (clear that there are only movies for children and can escape with things) or anything that is particularly disgusting. But the problem is that there is nothing that is very accurate. It's not just FEEL Christmassy and for the movie about Christmas, that's a very important flaw. But wait, I don't think 'Reindeer flying target audience will consider that? Why should they? They are all doped with sedatives. They may not be able to spell 'Christmas'. <br /> <br /> I give three out of ten. If it's a TV-Movie, I'll add two more stars. We all know that they will receive
