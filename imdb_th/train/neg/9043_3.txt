I went to see this thing with my wife and son, 3 years old. It seems that he likes more than my wife and me. Surprisingly bad writing for Pixar / Disney's excursions. In fact, I had a very hard time paying attention. This movie looks amazing. But the story was just as strange and long-lasting until I hoped that my son would fall asleep, so I could pick him up and walk away. <br /> <br /> Don't say that this movie is not An interesting concept. It just tells you weirdly (the screenplay isn't good), especially when we "meet the family" for the first time. I know that we should be impressed that the family is strange. But being a good boss, they can make that sequence shorter in 15 minutes (it seems that I didn't use the real time). From that point I scratched my head to find a solution.
