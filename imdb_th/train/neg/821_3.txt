Stanley Kramer directed the thrilling action movie and made two important things: action and excitement. Dominino's principles show that Gene Hackman was a prisoner who had been bent out of prison for some mysterious work. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, and Eli Wallach were their operators - they should work. With the government But that is like making a movie plot mostly Hackman asked many questions that had never been answered, so this movie went anywhere. While trying to be like NIGHT MOVES and PARALLAX VIEW, DOMINO's principles combine ambiguity and mystery together with confusion and boredom. This movie shot very well. But it works well. The direction of Kramer is without any form. It is a very sunny movie. <br /> <br /> The performance is good, with Hackman proving that he can't act badly. Widmark and Wallach are people. Appropriately offensive and Albert is a very talented actor. Even the terrifying Mickey Rooney is always good like a close friend hackman. One strange thing is to select Candice Bergen as a hacking wife. We said that she had finished prison and it seems that she was trying to wear twang in the south. The idea of ​​Kramer in making her look like a trash trailer is to wear an ugly brown wig. It is an ideal role for Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell.
