After reading many comments here, I was surprised that no one remembered that this was a scene created from the Twilight Zone from 1960 called "Mirror Image" starring Vera Miles Rod Serling. Powerful horror in 24 minutes than Sean Ellis did in 88 minutes with a boring nap. Short pieces can affect mysterious and unexplainable endings. But in the documentary, there should be a little more content and the story should make sense. Sadly, the substance and feeling are two things that are missing from "The Broken". Yes, there are some moments. But it's not enough to prove your time Some additional observations: Although this is clearly a contemporary story But there are no characters in the movie that have a mobile phone! And even though a car accident is an event that causes the story to continue But there is no reference to the insurance company, the driver of another car or the police that must make a report My advice: skip this boredom and see the original instead!
