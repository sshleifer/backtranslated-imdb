As a familiar listener of the Rolling Stones, I think this is interesting. Otherwise, since this film was already in the 1960s for me (someone born in 1980), this just looked at me as a scandalous propaganda hippie philosopher. But I'm sure this movie didn't do it for me. But those who worked in the 60s, I expect a lot of drugs with that rock. I was disappointed. Actually, it showed real life, hard work in the studio so I felt as if I was working with They summarize this great screenplay. I have never seen other film directors at all, but I think they follow the style of governance as well. 'Amatuerish', which feels like the TV program Eurotrash, is poorly directed, and lacks real entertainment My only good opinion is that I don't waste my money on it. It's free with Sunday paper.
