The fairy tooth fairy is about a ghost, a witch, a deformed witch who tempts children to go to her house to receive a reward for loose teeth and live their lives. The first few minutes will guide you to the beginning of the legendary teeth in 1949, then switch to the present day. The plot of the horror that has been worn has been assisted by a stable performance. They can do without the Hammond brothers and a few other scenes, but overall the blood is bloody. But fast, which has the smallest effect Eye food is good for both sexes. The camera works well. The dialog box is fair, but it's wonderful. I expect this movie to be a bare bone, low budget and a slasher that has very little redemption factor. I was surprised by the quality of the movie.
