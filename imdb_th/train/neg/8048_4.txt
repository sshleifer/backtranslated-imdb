Suppose you are on a deserted island in the last ten years. Have not heard the screams and left on Halloween. Episode 1 Enter the movie theater Then this movie will be a great scene and a completely new vision in the horror scene. <br /> <br /> At this moment, the 2.7 rating is in IMDb and it doesn't deserve a low appreciation Slashing all the way like "I know what you do" and who - is - at the end, believe me who and why <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly big. Flick well to watch with popcorn cola and don't want to get a difficult plot. Deep character. If the video rental is not in the top position, you can do it without risk. But don't expect a masterpiece I see that much worse.
