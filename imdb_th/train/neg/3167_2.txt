Henry, veterinarian (Paul Rudd) and his fiancée Kate (Eva Longoria) looking for last minute preparations for hospitality It was their wedding morning and Kate was mad for the food preparer about her needs for food presentation. But the horror of the horrifying ice sculpture "Angel", which was ordered by Kate, arrived without wings In the fight with the sculptor, the young woman with heavy "ice" fell to Kate and sent her to the hereafter. Now, a year later, Henry's sister arranged a psychic to tell the veterinarian that Kate wanted him to start dating another woman and move forward. Even so, the lovely medium Ashley (Lake Bell) was interested in Henry himself, causing her to be disappointed with the food pair. (Jason Biggs) More important, Kate returned from the other side to create a disaster for Ashley because she had no intention of letting another woman shake hands with Henry. What can you do to restore Kate into heaven? This is a deeply romantic comedy which is one of the most dedicated fans ever. No, it's not an actor because they are eager to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny, because his fiancée and Bell have unusual styles and humor that are also infected. Biggs, a comedian, was completely wasted for a very talented actor Rudd (see Anchorman, Knocked Up or Clueless Please). He tried the hardest and in fact was the main reason to see this clunker. His appearance and ingenuity are easy to make this film acceptable. But nothing can change the unconscious chapter and the horrible direction to become a winner. So if you are a big fan of romantic comedy, think about it before you split the money from this movie. Even if it's a free ticket to fall on your lap, be warned that this movie is a near-death experience for movie lovers, love and laugh.
