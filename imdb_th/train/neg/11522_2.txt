First of all, the character's name is not the main character of the movie. He is a close friend of the cult leader. The actor who plays Igor believes that the screaming loudly laughs happily and has a devious smile while touching your eyes. It's a great way to scare people. Igor has an annoying shouting habit. (Because he never really spoke) with a high pitched voice He will also say that one idiot is stupid. For example, when a cult leader slaughtered his followers with a loud voice, saw Igor when he saw this, shouted, "Paul! not enough! Why do you do that? I'll make you clean! In another scene, Igor tells the victim that she must 'Take her tools for surgery because now it's time to have surgery.' In addition to bad performances, the ending is not reasonable because while the story creates little things that it has on Climax Which Igor received an arrow in front of his head and two other friends to kill the remaining 'good people'. What's the mental hospital ??? The bottom line is, don't waste your time watching this movie. I hope I can get back during this time I lost watching.
