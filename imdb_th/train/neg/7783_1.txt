Hello HULU.com is playing Elvira's late-night horror movie on their website and this movie is under the name Monsteroid. It's fun to watch Elvira's comments in Crappy movies .... Have fun with movies that are not. good However, this movie has very little value in addition to seeing how bad the 70s are for bad effects horror movies, bad dialog, bad movie creation. Avoid this if you don't want to laugh. While you are at HULU, try another movie that has now 10 episodes and some of them are quite good movies with good plans and production and you can watch these movies in 480p as long as you Have enough speed
