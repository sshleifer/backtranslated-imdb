As you can guess from my ratings and review titles that I don't like Johnny Test Now I think I know what people are saying. "How do you know if it's not good? Have you ever watched it?" I watched this show a couple of times because I was studying movies and animation. Don't hold a candle with my standards. <br /> <br /> I want to talk about animation for the first time because it's the most confusing thing I've ever seen. Like the first two seasons or the first season with hand-animated images I think it's a good show to watch when it's drawn by hand. But then it changed into a flash animation and the quality dropped a lot. <br /> <br /> That's one of my eyes. See the story of the show It's too difficult to be like Dexter's lab. But there are differences because instead of a red head scientist, there are two people, and they are both women. There are dogs talking (why?) And the attitude of the parents is changing. I have other people but I don't think I can write here. (I don't mean curse But I mean, I don't know if there is a word limit or not.) Everything else is at the point of even the character DeeDee Johnny. It's just trying hard to be Dexter. But it seems that I am a heartless person. <br /> <br /> Finally, I want to talk about jokes. Remember, in Dexters, some jokes about shouting? Yes, shouting can be a joke for two or three people. But Dexter's labs had a tricky speech which led me to go back and examine the jokes. Johnny Tess forgot all about and just shouted 50% of the time and stopped the song whenever there was a stupid joke. That's not a funny movie. That is a silly comedy. (I know some people are thinking, not a movie. Funny, stupid, three people, right? See that and test Johnny back to the back and you laugh more than the first choice.) Sometimes, the joke depends on the strange situation like Chowder makes me mad. I have rules for all comics and comedies: for the oddities, not the same funny. It makes you just think. "What are you watching?" <br /> <br /> So it's outstanding in every account. Do not watch this list if you have respect for jokes in shape or form.
