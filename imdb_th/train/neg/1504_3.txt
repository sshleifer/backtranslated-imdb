I am a big fan of Spaghetti Western Genre and I always like people who do the cheapest. However, the infamous Demofilo Fidani director is known to be the cheapest and most worthless work of the genre. The plot of Fidani's film is usually very weak and due to his limited ability, he tries to sell the movie by adding Western famous spaghetti names such as "Django" of "Sartana" into my special name. "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre" In 1971, he just used the name of "Gi첫 La Testa" of Sergio Leone "(aka." Duck You Sucker ") and added 'Hombre'. Movies can be found under various names ( "Fistful Of Death", "Western Story" ...) I bought it myself under the name "Adios Companeros" which This movie is shared with another Fidani movie, which has almost the same actor "Per Una Bara Piena Di Dollari", which is called "Adios Companeros" in the German version. <br /> <br /> The story is quite weak. His involvement with the criminal gangs led by Butch Cassidy (Jack Betts) and Ironhead (Gordon Mitchell) <br /> <br /> The show, led by Jeff Cameron, is very unbelievable. I didn't find Jack Betts as good as 'Butch Cassidy' Gordon Mitchell in the legendary B-movie is a story that should be tried, and although he may not be an excellent actor But I found that his performance in Spaghetti Westerns was quite funny and original, and he recorded some Fidani movies (such as Django and Sartana that are quite hypocrisy ... in the Western showdown). <br /> <br /> There is one funny and original thing about "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre" - the great Klaus Kinski is playing the King! I can imagine Kinski in any role, but before watching this movie, I would never have guessed that someone would cast him as a Kinski priest. Excellent again, even though he had little time for projection and One scene in which he stopped fighting could be a good scene in this story. Another interesting thing about this film is the legendary director and king of chaos. Joe D'Amato filmed a movie. <br /> <br /> "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre" is a cheap movie. Nevertheless It has a funny time As a Western spaghetti enthusiast, I think it's fun to watch. But if you don't, don't be interested in this movie or watch it for the purpose of seeing Kinski as a priest. 3/10
