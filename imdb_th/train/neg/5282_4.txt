I have to confess that I was severely disappointed. <br /> <br /> This version is not able to compete with the 1995 model. The reason I watched it was that I wasn't happy with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth And thought that Rupert Penry Jones looked like the captain that I imagined when reading And he too. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the quality of the redemption is only The rest is not like Austen as you can. <br /> <br /> Miss Elliott would have no way to run through the streets of Bath like this. It wasn't in her character and it was. Not done by women in those days Anne Elliott's book is a woman and she has dignity. There are other disorders that are painful but this is the worst. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 important words from the book, they are in a totally inappropriate period. <br /> <br /> And even if this model is not much shorter than another model But felt like everything was urgent There is little use of caution in introducing their characters, expressions and motivation. Ignore important scenes How can they kill the final scene this way? disaster! And it wasn't being filmed as beautiful as others. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austen, don't waste your time on this.
