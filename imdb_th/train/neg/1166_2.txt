When seen compared to before, I have high hopes for life. The description of the movie on the back of the DVD jacket sounds promising. Life is not delivered Development is very slow. Potential full of actors and cool images The location is interesting. But the return does not compensate for the accumulation Can do more at the end Most movies are just "sit and watch". To be clear, the three of us were plunged to sit down and watch the movie, and with the 50 minute mark that we struggled to pass to the end It needs more shocking elements. If you are looking for an Ichi the Killer or Versus fight, then help yourself with the $ cost and many disappointments.
