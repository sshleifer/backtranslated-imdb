This film was created in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Park and brought the eye back to the world of the rest of "Wild Western Canada" when Archie began writing his story for the document; The idea of ​​that day was to tame the wilderness and convert / absorb the first nation of the country. <br /> <br /> This film lay ahead and ask questions; Why do British people who are well educated and clearly able to become Indian? <br /> <br /> Archie as an English boy who dreams of becoming But understanding all the meanings of dreams is unique and without value. Sounds like a famous puppet. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I saw Archie become a life image of "Cigar Store India" is a character made of wood and not true - very well done. Served as Mr. Brosnan. In addition, he also displays images of Indian forests in the dance scene for tourists. The integrity and reality of it is not realized until he meets and marries his wife, Annie. <br /> <br /> Annie pushes Archie in the direction that will take him. In front of the world stage of England itself, but Gray Owl - a native Canadian of the wilderness <br /> <br /> This is the closest Archie to be the prototype of a noble model. <br /> <br / > Brosnan's interpretation as well as the directors did very well. I watched a documentary about Gray Owl and I think this is a great big screen movie to add to my collection. <br /> <br /> Spoiler - I think the last scene is ah. Archie will meet the Grand Council of Chiefs, a very good time in the movie. <br /> <br /> The view of the beautiful Canadian lake and the "Gray Owl" authentic <br /> <br />
