This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than the most disgusting American garbage, Glitter - Mariah Carey in the excellence of the United States. I can imagine that the authors and producers are using a lot of recreational drugs and when talking about the plot, it really is a good idea. It's not. It's disgusting from Satan's bowels (Those who should have written the script better than this) Robert Jones as the director of Exce. Spending our taxpayers. (The person who holds the lottery) in this nonsense should be responsible. Who in the world thinks that it is a good idea to return to death? I wish you - to set up a Christmas tree. Deadline ... 'Mind the doors' is a classic film of a terrible British film. We don't need warning. And of course, we don't want the poor. Second rate, bad script, poor development and garbage like this. All this from the UK fundraising agency that brought us the sex life of the Potato Men ... I rested my case. <br /> <br /> Don't pay to see this. It is the most ridiculous and complete - one of the saving grace for manufacturers is that they get a huge amount of cash ... our cash ... for building it. They should hang their heads in shame. <br /> <br /> I'm a low and low standard of this film. It makes me feel that our national organization that supports this film thinks it should be worth supporting. There is no hope for the British film industry while the stupid people are performing. Harvey Wienstein, where are you? Come back again, we forgive you !!!
