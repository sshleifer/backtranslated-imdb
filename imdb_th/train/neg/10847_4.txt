The director cut the version, which is what I saw for a long time for this type of movie. Almost two hours is too long. If you have the option to go to the cut of the director who is not sure. <br /> <br /> The main plot is almost impossible. The feeling is that they show only to add violence to the movie. The connection will not be revealed until the back and lack of context makes me weary before I am there. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie, it doesn't work. You never get the feeling needed for the character due to mediocre performances and general management. (Presenting the character of the character after 15 minutes of death) This image is in the splashing part.
