This is the worst movie I remember when watching. Everything is incredibly conservative and retarded. The performance is also awesome. The camera does not work well. The writer / director of the film suffers from Down syndrome if he believes that this movie will help his career. I want one and a half hours of my life when I lose watching this shit. I want to watch videos of grass growing more than this. I don't believe that IMDb is causing me to write 10 lines to post this. But I feel that this movie is so bad that I have to warn others about it. The reason I came about this movie is that my girlfriend requested from the local library to think that it was Kris Kristoferson's movie which was nicknamed "disappeared". My dvd But I feel that some people owe me at least $ 20 for the time, pain and suffering. In conclusion, the director / writer of this movie is better than hoping that I will know him on the road.
