I like Brad Pitt very much. He is an actor with brain and intelligence, not to mention the face, chest and all the rest. When I saw him in "Thelma and Louise" The idea made me annoyed. He thought of "Troy". To me, he was a new Brigitte Bardot. Of course, the difference was clear. Man, American and others. But Brigitte Bardot came up with ideas. He is so beautiful that he is most effective when he plays with it. "Kalifornia" "12 Monkeys" "Fight Club" "Snatch" His humor makes him a human, easily accessible. Fortunately, "Troy" will be forgotten in Coming soon The photos that are still only with the semi-nude Pitt in the charming running position will decorate the walls of legions of strange fans. "Das Boot" is one of the wonderful films of the second part of the 20th century. Wolfgang Petersen is doing. This thing is I think it would be difficult to say that there is no new opportunity to work with Brigitte Bardot.
