Turn your back on or you will get a big problem from the return of my BOYFRIEND! Only the happy ending will bloom your innocence, filled with grief and punishment during the time you are watching. It's safe to say that this movie is all separated by a ridiculous approach and tribute to the zombies, showing that the most ridiculous. We often get names like "Johnny" and "Johnny". There is nowhere to go. There is no specific reason why our "corpse" crawled out of his grave, only to survive until the night of the blessing to make this film useless His mother had the confidence to tell the doctor that he was dead. Johnny bites Eddie's arm after that. The audience was asked a difficult question: why would this movie be the cornerstone? There is an answer, similar to everyone who lives or dies that is a real coincidence. "Living" is a coincidence. "Dead" is nothing like a movie. Show this picture to your girlfriend and she will cross the senior promise to change your life into destruction. Blah !!!
