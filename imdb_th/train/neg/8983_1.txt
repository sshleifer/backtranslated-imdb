They will begin a warm love that will end in Ulu ของs tragic death at the sea. Years later, Martina marries the richest man Sierra in the city and lives life Peaceful tranquility surrounded by money One day, the presence of Ulysses makes her passionate about getting up and acting without thinking of the consequences. The story is quite ridiculous and no actor is involved. In addition, three-fourths of this film is a sexual act that is still filming quite tired because we want to see the development of the story more. It's just a movie of Bigas Luna that has a lot of sex, no arguments and stupid characters everywhere.
