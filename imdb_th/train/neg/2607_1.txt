I watched a movie recently and looks like a reference book. I blame this on the screenplay and the direction is not good. Some were forced to forcibly (Gay rape scene) without clear reason I actually read the book after watching the movie for about 20 years after reading it for the first time. I found it difficult to read and quite awkward. There are too many different concepts that are used for any benefit ... besides the exciting part at that time. Because it covers the content considered 'Sensitive' to speak the least during communism, I can see the obsession that occurred at that time. That is no longer the case, or maybe I will see things now or both. The film tries too much to cover many aspects from the book. The result is a mix of scenes that may make people feel that they are reading. So this is a movie that looks hard and may never have been done.
