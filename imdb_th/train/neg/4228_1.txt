I can't believe how bad this junk! I want my $ 3.99 back! Challenge words, explanations of this poorly made piece! The dub, regardless of shape or style, will be consistent with the actor's mouth. It seems that this film was filmed with an ancient video camera in 1970. I shot better movies with my cell phone camera. The gossip is ridiculous because the plot is unbelievably stupid. The show is something that everyone would expect if you call all of your friends on a Saturday afternoon and complete the tear. Theater in the garage Do not understand me wrong ... I do not expect O'Neil and I will love zombies movies. But the production cost is very low in this film so that can not be viewed avoid!
