I want to know about this movie. Many people seem to be excited. I also have faith. I believe in Jesus Christ But I am open to any comments or opinions. It is not important to me if Jesus exists in the way that is written in the Bible. If Maria is a virgin or is a foreigner as well The important thing for me is the idea of ​​salvation. The idea of ​​love is the only way to find peace in this world. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes me angry is when someone takes a sentence to act as The truth, but without showing the written context For example, they showed in this film after the big sentence: "My enemies who do not want me to be a king over them - bring them here and kill them in front of me." Jesus (Luke 19 : 27) What they do Don't say that you are the context. Jesus tells a story about an evil king. There is no message in the Bible that Jesus supported the killing. He is love! After claiming the scriptures, they showed us that people shouted. (Artificial Christians) that are full of hate Most viewers do not check the information presented so they start to think that Jesus = hate = not good for me or for others. This is a pure management of people. Please use your brain. Don't take everything they tell you in this movie. We destroyed our own foundation, our civilization, if we began to dismantle Jesus in this way and the message that he brought to us. You see the branches you are sitting in.
