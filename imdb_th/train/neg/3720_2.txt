Is this movie a joke? Is it funny? Of course, it's not a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that the humor is intended. But sometimes, poor performances, poor directors and shocking scripts make the audience laugh loudly in the cinema. This plot is acceptable - young artists who promise to reach the top of the dead by the killer that he accidentally entered. The murderer saw the work of a young artist he had held and decided to join the exhibition of his work. In the exhibition, the killer found the sister of a dead artist and they fell in love. It is all predictable and the end will not be predicted because it is a very bad chapter. The film takes place in Vienna, Austria, and shows how beautiful this city is. Don't waste time with this movie unless you're studying how to not show, direct, or write a screenplay!
