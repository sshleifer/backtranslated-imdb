*** Spoiler *** *** Spoiler *** Everybody slapped a teenager, Kelley must suffer from the drought of the initiative? Looks like it's super cool. First of all, this is a noble evidence that can be used well. The rejected boy who grew up and killed all the women who tortured hell from him when he was in junior high school? Can not say that you have nothing to work with But this movie has to go through the same movement as other recent slashers. Everything from scores to camera angles helps us to accurately predict whether there are false alarms and when the killer will attack. Now we know the pattern, then these stupid slasher movies pushed the envelope more reliably. Each minute, let me ask you something: Who in the right mind will be surprised at their friends in the morgue. Dark and dull at night, and only surprise her from the sky while she is alone and surrounded by corpses Does that make sense of cursing? <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is sometimes creative. One good match involves the killing of Denise Richards's character. She was trapped in the pool and the killer appeared at her with an electric saw. There are some good songs on the soundtrack, including one great track by Orgy. The music video is in the special feature section on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Even the best performance. All actors are sleeping through their roles. Of course, David Boreanaz will often endure even in his image as a character in "Angel". Denise Richards is a great actress and she still Keep the rock face throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is like you expect your eyes. Don't even bother. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 (Full 10)
