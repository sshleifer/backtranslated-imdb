Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is about to see Ollie's new wife and children. The problem is that they don't exist - obviously Ollie created it! So it is up to him and his friends to find a woman with children who will agree to post as his family. <br /> <br /> This is not a unique idea. The other pair of silent shorts with this exact plot The best of these is Bobby Vernon. Don't let me be better than one - probably because this story was created a decade later - when comedy becomes more complicated. Now I'm not against physical comedy. But in some slapstick films, people start firing their guns fiercely, kicking and strangling each other, etc. with a little provocation. Sadly, at the end of ONE TOO MANY, that's what they do. There is nothing that is justifiable and as if they have just finished their thoughts. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a major achievement in entertainment. There is not enough return to make merit unless you are a silent fan like yourself.
