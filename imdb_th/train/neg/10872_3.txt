This is an indie movie that I want to like. But ultimately can't Lack of script (Boldly proclaimed in the main name) truly shows and kills images The story is nonsense that is not worth trying to think about. I was bored quickly within 10 minutes and then tortured through the rest of the first 40 minutes - hope for the best - before pressing the button, the script will stop at (To be generous) until the end ... even though it is not worth the effort. OZARK SAVAGE is trying too hard to be wise, raising the best order from EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX. Not done before and better This movie should be more fun in a short period of 10-20 minutes, but as a feature, it just feels uncomfortable and forced. Of course, there is no money in shorts, so I understood the complete financial reason that I thought it was a 75-minute stretch. Director Matt Steinauer showed great promise and I wish him luck.
