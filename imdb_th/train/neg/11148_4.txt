This is an important example of a low budget. Winning things will be a good story. Let's bring Samaire Armstrong back (when seeing her work on OC. I know you do better). Then find a script and a better budget. <br /> <br /> The special technique is terrible and the computer is terrible. It almost made me lose when I saw the wolf for the first time on the screen. And the notification of Samaire Armstrong (alert!). Changing to a werewolf was done by reducing her first to a poor GCIF number before she began to change dolls) <br /> <br /> Interesting story, even though the idea of ​​blood in werewolves is nothing new. When it enters the balance between the evil (possibly) evil and the end of humanity that is possible, both lines will breed a subplot of "linage werewolf books" that affect other characters in a similar fashion. Spells for a moment can work. But may expand more in explaining what happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Give me a better chapter and direction and I'll come back again.
