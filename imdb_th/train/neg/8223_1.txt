Of course, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. No questions at all! Those who conflict with this comment may argue that this name should not be judged by the same criteria as other names because it is an independent film with a low budget but c'mon already, right? Innovation, amateurism and a little scary. <br /> <br /> Agree with everything that is said about this movie. For example, a weak mind, weak acting, numbness. (When it's so bad) The thing that I find most annoying is the lack of all common sense in the script, assuming that it exists during production. There is a lack of clear conversations about the audience. Young women change their personality many times and it seems that they do not show any reason or even the brain - five girls are quite suitable for a little female psychologist? Think about why you don't like it. <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be considered as a victory for this title is a camera that does not leave the van whenever the audience sees everything from inside - Which is the rest of the movie is a good idea, proceeds to explain horribly. <br /> <br /> ?? Oh, and by the way, this film has nothing like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or others. The title was filmed with a mobile camera ?? This is an impact and not a trait! Use wisely. It's amazing. But in this case, it's an excuse for not enough movie shooting.
