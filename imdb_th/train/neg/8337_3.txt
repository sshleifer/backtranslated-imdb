Millie is an SAP. She is married to a rich man named Maitland and they have children. Then she caught him cheating on her and divorced him ... but let him keep the child that she claimed to love. Back in the early 1930s, she was entitled to a heavy wedding ceremony and child support. Later, when she had a girlfriend and a good life, he turned out to be a rogue! Wow, do you have a difficult time choosing men? <br /> <br /> From these bad relationships, Millie has changed. She is now a barbaric party girl - doing everything she can to distract her from her misfortune. Suddenly, many years passed. Milly's daughter she left. Early in the movie, now 17 years old and strange fashion doesn't change at all. Millie's old friend (Yes, it's another evil person!) Now pretend to be a friend of a daughter. Millie promises him that if he touches the woman, she will kill him. Guess what will happen next! <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is confusing and often messy - like "Madam X" but less important. Millie's motives and actions often don't seem reasonable. And this movie seems to have all the little things that have been thrown in - as long as it shows the idea that every human being is an unusual pig
