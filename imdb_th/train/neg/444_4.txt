(Spoiler this time) <br /> <br /> "Rosenstraße" is a movie about a brave woman in the Nazi era of Germany. But it's too long, it doesn't touch and sometimes boring! There are too many clichés and the performance is not good. <br /> <br /> Storytelling (Story) Not good. An old woman remembers the events she had in life as well as in the James Cameron's Titanic. Now we have a point of view. More than any other woman recommends that anyone do the same The confusion is that both of them are remembering the events of other people's lives! Come! This is a lack of knowledge of basic storytelling ... Riemann will know about the fate of the mother of the little girl and her questioning. <br /> <br /> The scene will be shown in the sequence. Wrong and You don't know when it happened. For example, when the scene where Riemann was offering Fabian was when The scene seems to be in the Twenties ... <br /> <br /> Riemann's character is definitely a talented pianist. She is also a Baron! Wow. Her brother returned from the Eastern Front. "Ritterkreuz" which he performed in some scenes So he was a war hero and still a good person who kept his conscience. And he received knowledge of the massacre by the Germans He also made photos! And it is, therefore, the ancient idea after the ancient thought took place, and this is why this film is not working. <br /> <br /> In general, von Tratta makes a chick flick. And in the end it was very easy. Riemann found a way to bring Goebbels into bed and - ta da! - Everyone is free, which is not historical facts. But with pure imagination, even though there is a claim "true story" at the beginning, as well as "Sass". It is based on real events. <br /> <br /> It's sad, but this is a typical German movie in Today, it's not good! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
