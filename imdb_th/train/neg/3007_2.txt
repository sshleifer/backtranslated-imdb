In search of endless horror stories, we will find this movie and seem to launch the DVD again soon for bad reasons. The transfer is terrible and the quality is poor. I don't think it's because of a bad remaster or something. I just think that this movie is not good. <br /> <br /> Filmed at a deserted school with a budget. at all There is no ability to hack. "Slaughter High" starts slowly and doesn't get speed until one hour. First of all, we'll see 'nerd' as he was chosen by the group ... not even knowing what Where should they be ... sports? Cock with his special hooknose, very ugly. He should definitely be cast as a fool. Then there is a 'big man' and a pair of losers and chicks that should be 'hot' but not. It's a mystery that A group of people who reject this group are choosing themselves. But I think the audience will assume these are 'Cool boy' that is currently choosing Selection options are scary because most players have played thirty-one days. As other critics here point out to actors (If you call them) is a group of Brit that has many fluent accents throughout this shit. We were left to assume that this group of 'children' is the only student in this school because Their 'reunification' is only for them at the school, which now shows that they are just abandoned With real people who like: 'This place gives me creeps ...' and 'Someone who wants a beer' is a highlight ... It's not good, skip this one unless unless You will waste time with friends and want to laugh in an effort. If you want to get a good look "Bay Of Blood" Bava's 14 years ago and much better. If you want to see a good slasher BAD, see "Just Before Dawn" or "The Burning" 2 of 10 children.
