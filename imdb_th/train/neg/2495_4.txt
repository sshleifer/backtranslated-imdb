The problem with this type of film is that there are dozens of movies created each year. Fortunately, only a few times will be performing in the theater, while others are pushed to video or TV, like this movie. <br /> <br /> The most important issue of the movie. This is the initiative It was one of the movies that used the "Die Hard" formula of a strong man. But there are problems at the wrong time In this case, it is a character played by Kasper Van Deen, who works for the security agency that thoroughly tests the safety procedures for the company and the general public. In this case, he was sent to the cruise ship, which of course was hijacked. You can see this movie as a mixture of "Die Hard" and "Air Force One" and the movie does not try to conceal that these two movies may be the source of The biggest 'inspiration' So you really can't assume this movie is original. It uses all the clich√©s from the book and this movie doesn't have anything surprising or anything that resembles the original from a distance. <br /> <br /> Like you expect from a movie like this, it has The script is very weak. Or rather say that it has a very lazy writing As I said earlier, the movie has nothing that is original. But also the actual story, which has some elements that are far from possible I mean, hijacking a box of only 8 large cruises that have only half a small pistol and requesting a ransom of just $ 10 million for a boat that is about 10 times that amount Quite ridicule How do they intend to divide that money later? Everyone gets more than a million or what? That barely generates profits for such a large and risky business. Then there was a case of taking hostage passengers Somehow they managed to bring all the passengers on a large ship hostage and they managed to get them in the same room as the only man with his pistol, which he seemed to be unable to hold right watching them. However, you have never seen more than 30 hostages like they were all on board at that time when the character Van Dien followed his son and vice versa, whether they walked into a large cruise ship. They will immediately bump together. Just a few examples of lazy writing in movies. <br /> <br /> But of course it's a flickering action, so the story of the course becomes secondary. But then again, it's not that this movie has good action. Half of the actors looked as if they had never had weapons before and the movie was full of slow ridicule. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is not the best actor, although I have to say that Casper Van Dien really isn't. 'Action Hero' and bad actor As related to the genre and circuit B movie, however, he faced the same problem as Tom Cruise No matter how old he is, he never looks reliable enough to be the father of a teenager. Yesterday, Van Dien started out as a new actor with a future. But starring in this movie didn't help his career much He may have a better ability, even if he has never received the right opportunity to perform. All other actors work fairly well. But their character is a formula that they never really care about. <br /> <br /> Oh, not the worst movie I've ever seen. Whether it is traditional or one of the most memorable. <br /> <br /> 4/10
