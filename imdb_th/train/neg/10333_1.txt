What is an exciting and original series that Fox has downgraded to be a ragged rag? During the first season, the dark goddess is on my weekly "must see" program and not just because Jessica Alba <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the power - that ended at Fox. Decided that they wanted to "tune" the layout within 3 episodes of the season opener. They made me lose being a viewer. (Without seeing Jessica Alba!) I found that the new characters added in the second season were ridiculous and not too skilled. The new line is stretched, the continuity and reliability of the show is too thin. During one of the second seasons, they still slept and dreamed of Max, which in the first season said she couldn't sleep biologically. <br /> <br /> Moral of the story. (Hollywood people never received): If it works, don't be drunk too! <br /> <br /> azjazz
