In the future of 1985, a government committee led by Howard Hesseman is considering a trial for a network that does not have the first inspection of the TV. They sampled. It was programming, playing as a set of games. I can name a good movie 'skit' in one hand without using the thumb "Amazon Women on the Moon", "Kentucky Fried Movie", "Meaning of Life" and "Mr. Mike's Mondo" video. Did I mention "Tunnel Vision"? The reason for that is that this 'movie' is death in the form of a movie. There are no funny games from afar or even the smartest. It takes a lot of impropriety on the part of the filmmaker to not laugh even once. <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dody Dorn Full forehead
