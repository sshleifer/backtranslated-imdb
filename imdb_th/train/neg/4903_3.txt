I have never been a big fan of Taiwanese filmmaking compared to Korea, Hong Kong or even China. The quality of the strong performance is hardly apparent in this film. I don't think I am a hard-to-like audience like I am actually an indie movie fan. However, this film shows weakness and slow pace. I found myself lost in the middle of how it was. The performance certainly did not improve. Rainie's performance was lower than usual while she was 'overpowered'. Trying to be funny and cute. Although I have to admit that she is happy to see Isabella Leong having a more appropriate role as a confusing character, sad and sad Overall, I found this movie disappointing.
