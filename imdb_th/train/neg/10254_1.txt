Spoiler <br /> <br /> Wow, the end of the world is a surprisingly unusual movie experience. <br /> <br /> This is the whole story: Scientists are getting messages from space (Goodbye Independent) The message says things such as a great disaster are about to happen. Then, scientists heard on the radio later that a large earthquake in China. He began to think that the message was involved in a disaster around the world, so he tried to figure out who was receiving the message. (And who sent the message in space) finally he and his wife found that the message came from the convent They visit it Everything looks normal, including the clergyman played by Christopher Lee, who is weary. But scientists are very firm and believe that the message comes from and goes to that convent. So he and his wife returned to the convent in which they were captured by aliens secretly around by disguising themselves as priests and nuns. They were detained according to their wishes and aliens played by the forces. Scientists received what they wanted to get them back to their world. When aliens receive special elements, every alien will leave one by one to their home planet in a tacky transport platform. Lee is the last remaining alien, telling the couple that the world will be destroyed because the aliens decide. Lee approached the carrier and he left. Both looked at a monitor showing a stock of natural disasters that occurred around the world, decided to follow aliens. Because the world was doomed, the couple didn't see the point behind so they walked into the moving car and disappeared. The last shot of this film is the world of the most explosive packaging paper. <br /> <br /> Just <br /> <br /> I've never seen a boring movie in my life. It's the most overwhelming movie I've ever seen. The scientist and his wife are two heroes or the worst protagonists that have ever appeared on the screen. They don't care at all. They saw the destruction of the world on the screen and decided that "What is he who wants the world anyway?" They didn't even try to stop them or make things better. This kind of story may be used if this film has a bad feeling for everything. But the action and atmosphere does not exist The actors and those behind this boring flick are going through their pace so much that you can feel when they press the card when they go down and go back to work. I didn't expect much about this movie because it was the production of the Charles Band, but I didn't expect it to be so bad. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee was asked if the worst movie of What is he he used to do And he talks about the invasion of STARSHIP. I'm sorry Chris, but STARSHIP INVASIONS is really fun. STARSHIP's invasion is terrible, but it's so much fun. The end of the world is huge, the most, the worst: it's boring and inert, without any entertainment costs.
