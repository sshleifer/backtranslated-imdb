Ringmaster is Jerry Springer's pathetic excuse for breaking the film that should be reused because the toilet paper recently destroyed the belief in the art of the movie. First, it was created. Secondly, everyone went to see it. Third, some people vote as the best movie they have ever seen. If a monkey can create a movie, I'm 100 percent confident that it will be better than 1 billion times that most crappy movies have their time (even Godzilla has cool special effects). The film's time is when I am Go out of the theater The only thing that could make this movie worse if Jerry Springer is a star If I want to stare at the shit for an hour and a half, I will throw it in the can. If anyone does not insult this movie, I will eventually pity you, your children, and your children. However, contrary to Springer's beliefs, I do not condone children who have sex clearly.
