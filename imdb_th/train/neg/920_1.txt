Seriously. I just closed my first Demonicus look and the words made me disappointed. <br /> <br /> I remember when I saw Charles Band's name in the movie and my heart would race. He never was Wes Craven or John Carpenter. He was a fortress of hope for the little man. Men with movies coming to video stores instead of multiplexes But they are still rocking more than most modern garbage that we have to endure. <br /> <br /> And now ... <br /> <br /> The obvious California walking route. That pain doubled for "Alps" and the abandoned railway tunnel should be "ancient caves" old! Uh, instead of being a creepy demon fighter by the cover, meaning we have been treated to a friend who wears the latest in Wal-Mart Halloween. Wiggle his finger But he didn't learn to stand until the last five minutes Why can't he be a villain? We had a terrifying Joe boy with a plastic sword. Ouch. <br /> <br /> Charles Band ... You are ashamed that your name is attached to such a rag. I love bad movies. They are good. Hell, sometimes I enjoy a terrible flick. It's terrible. However, this one cannot be watched. A perfect example of making a buck instead of creating a quality movie.
