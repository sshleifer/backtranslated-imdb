The conflicting melodic story of William Gibson, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark headed to a luxury hospital in the countryside where his wife fought the queen, Lillian Gish, who was appointed And Widmark is also a watch for new employees - Lauren Bacall, which brought her life back together Her husband and children Hasty and baffling, set in time and place, indiscriminately with a love story. "David and Lisa" hidden in a luxurious place, Widmark and Bacall have good chemistry But this script does not give anything to them For an hour, most conversations relate to what has to be done about the curtains hanging in the library. (This topic is not used as a symbol. But it's a red herring in a non-puzzle!) The picture hopes to show that different people come when they are working in the same profession and everyone thinks that their opinions are correct. Unfortunately, the roundabout of Minnelli resolves this stew, not providing information, knowledge, or entertainment. ** From ****
