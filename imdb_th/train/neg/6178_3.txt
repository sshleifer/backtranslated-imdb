Frank Tashin's 'The Home Front' is one of the more insecure personal Snafu shorts. The set of cartoons made for the movie is recommended for the military instead of Snafu. 'The Home Front', instead of focusing on the person he loves, returns home and they have to offer war effort as well. Snafu realizes that he was wrong when he thought they were easy. It is a concept that has very little possibility for good jokes and instead of Tashlin will play harder risqu√© cards, ie long-lasting gags associated with dancers. The result is a short meaning that has little relevance or entertainment at present, apart from historical artifacts.
