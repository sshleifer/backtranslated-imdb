I can't believe that the terrible conversation came out of people's mouths and the end of the bloopers attached to the body of this movie is true. And we get the angel angels of Angelique Pettyjohn (in order) and Loren Crabtree in the boot. <br /> <br /> teleportation equipment Triggered by Psychic Angelique Pettyjohn, bringing an alien container to the underground lab in the desert According to director Fred Olen Ray, they were left out of the movie Klaus Kinski, ANDROID, which gave more value than it was to despise. <br /> <br /> Inside the container is an alien dwarf (played by Ray's son) who started killing people It's funny to watch. A small 'creature' in a black reptile set with what looks like a large shell attached to it, running around in darkness. We also saw a little seal tearing into the poster of ET. I think it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> Then there was something that looked like a snake that came out of a smashed container. Death by William Fair, after a small animal chewed into Frank McDonald's neck in the kitchen. Low budget used with aliens. I think ... <br /> <br /> Everything ends abruptly. It seems like they will end the film at the end before releasing the band with the end credits. Talking about the lack of funds ... <br /> <br /> Fred Olane also mentioned the director's comments that they were not sure Aldo Ray would be filming. And remember his script? <br /> <br /> Cheap cheese. It's fun to watch. I'll give that medicine. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
