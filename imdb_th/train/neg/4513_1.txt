Although this book is not accurate according to the actual situation But still describes the feelings of Japan I think it's hard to believe that everyone involved in the making of this film never went to Japan because they didn't feel that Japan was anything less. Almost everything about it is terrible. I will admit that the actors are generally quite good. But cannot have a chance to save Before the film began, I was surprised that there were only ten people in the theater on Friday night. Shortly after the movie was released in Japan 30 minutes, I was surprised that they were I stayed, so I had the right to criticize. The film ends with my groaning and suppressing unbelievable laughter from my Japanese girlfriend. Everyone I saw walking out of the theater had a confusing and disappointing face on their faces. <br /> <br /> For the filmmakers, you owe me two hours.
