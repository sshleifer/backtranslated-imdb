La Chute de la Maison Usher or The Fall of the Usher, known to the English audience, began with Allan (Charles Lamy) heading to the castle of his good friend Sir Roderick Usher (Jean Debucourt) who sent A letter to him Madeleine, his wife is sick. Allan finds Madeleine very ill and her husband Roderick decides and is almost obsessed with drawing like her. While Roderick swept the image of Madeleine, it became weaker and weaker as if the picture was draining away from her. Allan tried to help his friend. But the tragedy soon happened ... <br /> <br /> This French film Produced and directed by Jean Epstein & the second time in two stories, The Fall of the House of Usher, adapted during 1928. Honestly, I do not know that the original novel was published in 1839. I mean, you wait 89 years for movie adaptations and Two together! However, I feel that I have a little problem here because I have read many positive reviews about La Chute de la Maison Usher. And maybe I'm not the right person to write comments. But i have to say That it didn't do anything for me I don't like it clearly. The first thing to say is that this is a silent movie and therefore relies on pictures. But even then I thought that this story was weak. I thought that this movie was boring and boring. It took about an hour and it didn't do anything for me. La Chute de la Maison Usher was created almost 80 years ago and that is a lifetime. The world, movies and tastes have changed a lot since then. Found enjoyment in this movie I feel that this movie is a bad day and may not even start. I never felt any character at all. I never bothered what happened. & I found it quite boring to sit through. I'm sorry if I acted indignantly with a silent movie fan. But that's how I feel. <Br /> <br /> Director Epstein performed well. Many people walked along the footage in La Chute de la Maison. Usher & I would admit freely that it had a certain time. But I think they are not very far apart. The pictures from the mouths of people moving and don't hear what they say, just look strange to me. I don't like music & versions that I see. Collect inserts. Original French language. Which is described by someone who has the strongest French accent Which is closed From the story of Edgar Allen Poe, I suspect that it has a lot of similarities in addition to one or two basic elements, next to Roger Corman House of Usher, starring Vincent Price. <br /> <br /> On the way This movie technique is ok. Consider when it is created You can't tell about a performance that no one has even said, although this movie is full of unnatural movements that are too unnatural to try & suggest emotions or reflect on what happens at a certain level. But after a while, it seems crazy. <br /> <br> /> La Chute de la Maison Usher attracts the former thirsty, who lives in a cave or who is stuck in the past for me. I like movies. My story will not bore me and there are voices & I'm sorry if the last statement that made me look like an idiot without education But that's what I feel The world has continued since 1928 and for the better.
