This is a sluggish and inert production for Shakespeare's most dramatic drama. I can guess that the intention is to make the player easily accessible and understandable as possible for audiences who have never experienced Shakespeare before. By doing this - by making every line clear and all clear - they have drained the play of life and become a flat caricature. However, it's a tedious matter - it's very difficult to get great content. <br /> <br /> The most memorable performance - Sam Waterston is Benedick and Douglas Watson is Don Pedro. However, others aren't worth it. How much is the hero? April Shawnham's hero is the breathless head of Jerry Mayer's Don John's breathless cartoon character Snidely Whiplash (although Snidley is more fun) <br /> <br /> F. Abraham (Did you know that the person who killed Mozart?) Is not in this model unless he disguises himself and removes the name from the credit. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph Papp is basically a god theater. This production is not only But disappointed <br /> <br /> Don't bother with this. See Branagh's Much Ado instead. - His version is full of power and humor, so don't say anything about a great performance.
