Horror fans (I'm talking to people over the age of 12, but if you are under 12 years old, I'm sorry for what you think is insulting): In the short term, if you appreciate your imagination being disturbed by the narrative Original story that is well written Cultivate fear and pass on reliable performances, so I can fully recommend - avoid these steam - made by the director who has been evident for a long time since they were sold by the past day. There was no accident that almost every episode felt as though it was created in 1980 that would not blame honestly on the shoulders of some old men. (Or actually in the 80s) because we are going to watch movies like Argento, Carpenter, Landis, Dante and Barker (actually Clive, WTF). Glad to see Romero having a good feeling to make it miss. Because I'm sure he was asked to join ...) Maybe we should point to the creator Mick Garris, whose credentials include challenging logic and bad TV remake from the masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick 'The Shining' <br /> <br /> Maybe it indicates the status Television today We were starving with the horror of a good TV that we applauded for the old sloppy schlock. Unfortunately, it may be possible. <br /> <br /> Normally I don't see the point of adding comments that do not dispute the flaws and The advantages of production, I will rate it accordingly. However, since this series lacks great merit (There may be the only exception of theme adjustments.) I write this warning more than criticism: Don't waste your time and money. If you do not agree with me, it is more likely that you will not see the horror movie that is good enough. Maybe some of the previous films of some directors may be a much better starting point, but if 'Masters' of Horror is evaluating these works alone, they will not be allowed to graduate even with a bachelor's degree. Unless they are studying a degree from University Of S ** t
