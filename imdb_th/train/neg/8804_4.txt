Great CGI effects & truly rewarding performance by Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is the only horse in this movie. He received an Oscar. The best actor in that year for Morgan Freeman is a crime. <br /> <br /> This film is a magnificent love letter to ridicule the boom with a right wing bias. Can't see, start from the forest service. Vietnam to "Resolution" with Jenny at the end. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it was fun and the American movie passed. I find some of this movie that is extremely nasty.

At the right time "During the past 45 years, those who made mistakes according to the director's vision seemed to be paying an expensive price. Zemeckis is saying that the cells that disguise themselves as innocent and innocent are even patriots of American quality?
