I never thought that the standard of the movie Yashraj would be so bad! This movie has a ridiculous story that doesn't attract attention. <br /> <br /> Saif acts more than Kareena, improving her shape. But it's not a good actor. Akshay is good. Indigo is also good. Can I say that this chapter is not good .. <br /> <br /> The realization of being cheap is full of wondering what it should be. Does that mean that Yashraj's movies should make garbage like this? It has a good history of movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was totally disappointed with this movie.
