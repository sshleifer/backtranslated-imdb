I am looking forward to seeing this when it is in production. But it turned out to be the greatest thing The far cry from Dr Seuss's strange world is rude and disgusting. I don't think Dr Seuss will approve it. Grinch stole Christmas is much better. I understand that there are subtle adult jokes in there, but my children haven't done it yet. While the cat in the hat screamed rude, they caught more than I liked the match with Dr Seuss. It really disturbed me to see that this timeless classic was left on the big screen Who I hope this Dr. Cess will be fair
