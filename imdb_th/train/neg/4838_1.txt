I decided to watch this program because it was nominated for an Oscar this year. I guess there are many people here. I want to like this movie a lot. But ended up in boredom and disappointment. The first scene was ok but the rest of the movie was in camera mode. "Shaky hands" are really annoying. <br /> <br /> I guess the main reason for this film and nominated for Oscar is: /> <br /> American "military mechanism" (people Needing an excuse or reason for war in Iraq urgently by doing something (love), patriotism. <br /> <br /> Why are these efforts "brave? "The director and the main character for _inspire_ the audience with the idea the "Love war like drugs"? .. Please, please! Really boring! <br /> <br /> See how this is to understand how film institutions can fall ...
