This type of movie that one or many minds try to destroy the reputation. (And eliminate all) some innocent people in order to use their lives An interesting place to watch, Pacific Heights, a rocking hand, a single white woman, and a movie made for thousands of TV's are examples of this. But while some people, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights, may offer illegally paranoid or twisted characters that are illegal, play everything by books. And if not for the star's reputation (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota and Madeline Stowe), this movie will sink to ordinary people faster than Danielle Steele's drama. <br /> <br /> Russel plays Michael Carr incessantly. The innocent man who demanded help from the authorities when someone broke into his house and tried to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he quietly vented his anger to help the police in the situation. Wrong (Ray Liotta), a mental villain who has no limits on his power. At first sympathetic to Car (Maybe just pretending to be) The police come to both, but soon the police want Car to get out of that way, destroying the lives of men almost every way. (Which is quite easy when you are a police officer and when you are a police officer who has installed a security system for men in his house) in order to take over and accept his wife Seems to have a lesser end, and others like the police want to prove his power The wife is like a trophy in other words than at the end. And the story of this book, you can predict every event before it happens on the screen if you see these movies enough From the moment of "shocking" our main character, the innocent character realized that he was the victim of credit card fraud. (Acted by a psychic criminal) until his end, he is not really dead.
