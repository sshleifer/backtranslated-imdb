The tedious and unpredictable story of a chemical-contaminated man (Weller) who travels around the country to search for his ex-wife and children. One hand touch In the dangerous path, the doctor (Hurt) and the young journalist (Natasha) try to stop the man. This movie has a place that is not original. But even though it is much better The end result is just a movie without any doubt or indomitable. Even good actors still wasted me giving this 4 (four)
