This movie is "OK". Not bad. Not good. Just ok. If there is anything else in the theater, this will be skipped far away. Unfortunately, Fast and Furious 2 stunk but I want to see more than FF2 :) If you have a fetish for Harrison Ford or punk Other young people will be "cute" movies for you. Personally, I'm waiting for HBO or Blockbuster.
