First of all, I would like to say that if I rate this movie from 1 to 10, in good faith, I'll give it a -4. Not that I'm a strong critic. It's just that this movie is terrible. Everything from the story to the director until the editing is terrible. The story doesn't start with half way. (You can't expect much because it depends on the video game, the things I don't know will go into the movie.) But governance and editing make it worse. The movie will cut along the awkward spot and go to scenes that are not related to the previous scene; Some people like the fast sex scene in the middle. Don't even think that they are put into the story because the characters don't express feelings for each other. You can go to see this movie, expecting to see a garbage dump on the screen for an hour and a half and you still feel disappointed. If you pay to watch this movie, you will lose money and if you don't pay anything, you still have to spend another half hour of your life. So do yourself a favor and don't watch.
