At the end of Ally Sheedy's latter hallucination, this thriller is used creatively to create more than one evil image. She persuaded one that if Bettie Davis's offensive role was coming to her, she could bring it out perfectly. Unfortunately I can't find many other reasons to see this. If you wonder what Sheedy looks like in old fashioned glasses (But why do you have everyone?) This is your answer. For the rest, Sally Kirkland's sex-crazed women are quite boring and even if you like this more than I do, you have to accept that the tension is tense in this scene The fierce fool of the insurance agent is equally disgusting, but at least it has a small role. Nicholas Walker is the inspiration for the leading actors. Paul Keller and his performance were better, Dara Tomanovich, and during her scenes with Sheedy, that level increased slightly. Sheedy's meticulous acting (although she is often an automatic pilot) is admirable in himself. But not in the context with the rest The dress is yellowish brown. The camera is not clear.
