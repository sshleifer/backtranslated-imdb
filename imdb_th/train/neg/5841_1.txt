Bottom spoiler But continue reading or you will never know the horrible fate that awaits all plans to rent "Rodentz" <br /> <br /> on a moonlit night in a distance research lab To get dangerous results Chemical compounds created for "Find and destroy" dead cancer cells that have leaked from the hazardous waste disposal system into the basement of the building. Now, the rats that are involved in experiments in the upper class labs are not the only mice in the plant that will become transformed. Professor Schultz, a leading biological researcher, recently stated that adding new enzymes now helps formulas. His "hunt and destroy" can regenerate in the time necessary to combat serious cancer tumors. When three different degrees of new ingredients are delivered to three different mice and the rest is poured into the "dangerous junk" sink. Unusual, shocking side effects cause fear in the night. At ..... /> <br /> Seriously, this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen this year. It's all about screaming. "Low budget!" From scary performances to special effects, which is the worst thing I've ever seen. The character is a slow and stupid intellectual. The predictable way: walk down the dark path alone. Find a cat stumbling and falling to "rats" can chase them up themselves in a small room, etc. /> <br /> While some movies do cheaply But this movie takes real cake Every possible angle is cut, everything from the previous shot, taking the "Lab" hall from a different angle to make it look bigger. (That reminds me of - why are only two people working in a large building of freakin!?) For music and special effects that can be done on a PC. Workshops for children <br /> <br / > That led me to the worst aspect of the dung-steaming division. The only scary special technique that the computer created was that I looked fake and stand out in every scene, so even the most stupid movies could see them. Create computer And that giant rat suit - Oh my God !!!!!!!! Seriously, should we believe that children who are lonely are monsters? Just pathetic ........ The better side, some blood that looks good, especially when considering the budget. <br /> <br /> All actors suck. No one is involved in production, taking care or knowing what they are doing. I wasted time with the review. Just use my advice. It's a garbage. 1/10 <br /> <br /> About DVDs: The transfer is terrible. The voice is over and the director and his two friends. Describing comments on the disk, which said that they had no involvement in making movies, but were there to ask questions and comment All three of these primeval slime are incredibly stupid that they should be established before they can hurt themselves or others. I don't want to waste your time or your readers anymore because I start to remember more than I want about this movie ..... Rating DVD: 1/10
