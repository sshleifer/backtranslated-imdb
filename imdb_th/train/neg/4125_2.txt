Holy shit! Spanish horror and horror thriller! I received it for about four years and finally started it again overnight. I watched one hour before going to bed. I was fascinated by the whole story. Last night I finished and didn't want to believe where to stop the night before. Indeed, I stopped it for a second before the movie was completely depressed. <br /> <br /> Like I said, I was intrigued and curious to see that this mystery was in the bar. I picked up when he opened the package. To reveal the laser gun and play the game "Laser tag" is awesome. Whew! Then the big revelation is that all that is a terrorist plan by playing a gamer. Whew! You can tell that the Spanish industry is behind the scenes. Director Mateo Gil (co-author of Amenabar on the previous two songs) has excellent scores and excellent photography. But this situation turned out to be foolishness The fact that everyone sat through the front 40 minutes ago was straightforward than me.
