I have received this DVD for more than 2 years and decided to watch it only yesterday. I don't know why it takes as long as I like the Inspector Gadget and even the new gadgets and gadgetsinis. While it may have a palette of bright colors and the technical sophistication of modern animated movies, there are some old things that are missing Keeping this gadget in the bathroom <br /> <br /> First of all, the classic Inspector Gadget theme, music and songs are completely missing. The composer tried to compromise by making similar scores. But still not good enough Gadget-mobile It is now a talking car, not a car that can be converted into a van. Plus it looks more cute and rounder. Instead of looking cool, Penny doesn't have a computer book for her, and she and Brain rarely appear. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't exist. There is something about the formula change and Doctor Claw is used for some people never revealing evil. But that's all I got Things that deal with the Italian giants are short / I will never know. It has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> And if that title relates to anything, his final case will be wrapped in any way, and he is still in force. So why is it called? that 'Final case' is a mystery as well. <br /> <br /> I'm not impressed. This is an insult to show the wonderful animations that disappeared strangely on DVDs. But don't let you buy DVD Inspector. Any gadget you can do I can only sell a few seconds after watching it. No child would like or admire this thing, and there are no old fans who are resistant to it.
