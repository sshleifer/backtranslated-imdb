This long stretch of movie became less of a story about Berkowitz and his impact on NYC, but more about drawing a parody of some Italian-American groups known as "Guidos". The problem is that "Guidos" is not interesting, whether it is a story or an environment in which they are immersed, they live and then a caricature, so Lee expands them. to chest Someone makes their own parody. They don't go home and say "Hey, make ear and nose bigger than this!" That's what Lee did in this movie. The most interesting character in the film is the two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who want to escape from the "Guido" lifestyle. End with an amazing story for the character, especially John Leguizamo and you will Get a good movie to fall asleep Especially when considering a long period of time. <br /> One more protest: For some people who declare to be Yankees fans and grow up in New York, Spike should know how to spell Phil Rizzuto. Which is incorrectly spelled in the closing credits
