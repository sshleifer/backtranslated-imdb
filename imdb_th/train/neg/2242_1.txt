I caught this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival. I didn't hear much about it. Just that it is a thriller that is packed with digital shooting in a very low budget. I hope to meet with the next Brit-Flick, but I must say I am very disappointed. "This is not a love song" according to two criminals who, after accidentally shooting and killing a young farmer's daughter, accidentally became a life-threatening cat and mouse game when the villagers decided to handle these things with their hands. And hunt them down. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that this is another example of having a style beyond the British film. The camera angles and editing are completely incompatible with the story, as well as the popular shows and the shocking slow motion, which create the whole picture like an expensive home video. There are repeated attempts to make the movie look frustrating and witty, which becomes hilarious and superior. (Q is a pathetic image, a drug-enforced scene, and a pointless zoom camera). There's no such bored word to hide the fact that this is a bad story. <br /> <br /> We've seen. This has been many times and has improved hundreds of times, especially in John Boorman's "liberation" expertise, but while in the latter film, we really care for the characters in this movie. Do they hunted and killed as fast as possible. Even if this isn't bad if their enemies are scary or worth it But turned out to be a group of countries that look like innocent people Again, that's disgusting, too bored. 'Before, of course, there are cute people in this country. The filmmakers <br /> <br /> In the defense of the song "This Is Not A Love Love" With a suspicious good time But it's hard to watch this movie Whatever, except to go straight to the video or press to get a very limited movie release, this is not a patch last year with a low budget being hunted in the movie "Dog Dogs". Really, if the money is right, stop going wrong.
