I received this show (I've only watched seven episodes) Four stars because of her jokes / most settings seem to fail. Some people aren't funny. But some were amusing. In a 12-year-old boy, she reminded me of a New York painter who painted the canvas, calling it art and selling a lot of money. That she prayed that there was something stuck to the wall in her attempt to have fun <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole organization is like a finished potato.
