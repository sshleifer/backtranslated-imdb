I'm just blowing four dollars to rent this movie! Why Alliance Atlantis promotes a bad excuse for this movie beyond me But surprisingly, it was a fairly good opinion that two Canadian newspaper critics gave the film. I was bored with our media that justified the movie just because it was Canada and had a low budget. It's like they expect Canadian movies to have a punch, so they give good comments regardless of <br /> <br /> Now about movies: Performances are below average. (Except for male characters who are leaders Quite good) The quality of the movie is not good, which I think would be possible from a very low budget. The script is extremely scary. An example is the story that revolves around one of the leading characters, a female drug dealer who flirts with one of her customers so that she can enlist him and repair the bike for her gang, whose sole purpose is to destroy the SUV. Of many of her gang members were destroyed in these activities (I don't know if you can't afford to buy a new bike because you should be a big drug dealer connected from Vancouver to Toronto.) /> <br /> However, the issue of the matter (Which is not revealed until halfway through) is a drug dealer planning to build a fire building in the Toronto area to try to build a house that is inexpensive - no one will want to live in the area <br /> <br /> - I want to talk a lot. <br /> <br /> The embarrassment of the Toronto Film Festival for accepting such movies, Telefilm for support and the Globe and Mail and Georgia Straight that give reviews Bias <b r /> <br /> Movies should not be treated as special because they are Canadians !!!!
