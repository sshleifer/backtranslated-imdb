The horrific ending - and I couldn't believe that Moore spent a year with it. Smacks of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs, which Hubbard claimed to use the pen in just three weeks. This is a disappointing thing for me to throw my disc from the first 3.5 years. Now, the first 1.5 hours is a tight action, even though it is ridiculous in the place and after that it deteriorates in the decay Series Unbelievable that the last hour and how slow Do we think more deeply? If I want a materialistic lesson, I will read Daniel Quinn Ishmael again. Nonsense to think that 38K people will give up everything for "The new beginning" is ridiculous to throw Kara, who disappears and appears again by Baltar and Six ridiculous to throw in Mitochondrial Eve is just ridiculous.
