Is this the greatest movie I have ever seen? Isn't it the worst? No, <br /> <br /> As a mother of four children, it's good to see things that are light and amusing. It's great, but it's cute. <br /> <br /> I think it's there. Some rooms that need improvement But it was tried. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that this movie deserves a lot. The level of abuse from other investigators is obvious that they are not interested in Eva Longoria. I think she did better in The Sentinel. I think the movie is a matter of opinion. Actors have a huge role whether it is a hit or flop. <br /> <br /> Actors may not work. There may be too many things going on. <br /> <br /> I just want to speak for movies on average. It may be a chicken flick. Kind of the movie "The Split-Up" or French Kiss. ​​My husband still talks about those things :)
