Sometimes I do not understand how directors think when they make movies ... I have injuries after watching Welcome (2007) and think they won't do it again. But after many amazing promotions, Tashan ended up in a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 3 amazing songs to promote - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ..... and what did you get from This film? A limitless story. A lot of predictable plot of Akshay Kumar's acting and nothing interesting except watching Kareena after her big weight loss ... !!! <br /> <br /> Intelligent music ... They take the time to give the pathetic little dialogue of these 4 gangsters and they never thought of giving the background music of the scene when Akshay Kumar was doing stunts. ..! The song is very good, comparable to Tashan Mein and not filmed in the music album !!! :-( If you plan to watch this movie, I will say to watch to listen to background music that goes something like. .. 'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ...' <br /> <br /> Overall, very disappointed, even with the way Bhaiyyaji tried to speak poor English! <br /> <br /> Get out of the man. I have to puke!
