I give 2 instead of 1 because I think "Wild Wild of Wongo" is worse. This is exercise in patience. It's like cleaning your teeth by a bad dentist without a plot. There is no definite logic that doesn't show. (Although the shark has a quality dialogue) we don't doubt anything. We don't know how people will go to where they go. It's an amazing story for me to be released. I agree with previous writers that it's not even funny. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and it will fill the space in the DVD collection. It's like a paperweight. Or bad paintings that you bought from selling hungry artists Covering the cracks in the wall
