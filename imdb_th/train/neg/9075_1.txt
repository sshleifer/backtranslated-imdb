Slackers titled in this film are three friends of Dave College, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel, respectively) who are graduating from university without having to pass the honest exam. But accomplished This story will continue until the end when not the same. But the most favorite character of Nathan's movie (Schwartz Man) shows what they are doing Nathan started blackmailing to compensate for the girl of his dreams while he was unable to do that in normal conditions. The only problem is that when the three of them start working with it, Dave falls in love with the beautiful and lovely Angela (James King). Unfortunately, it's not a great movie. Schwartz makes it easier to watch movies because his performances are excellent. The King's performance is at a moderate level. I think she has been hired to be with her beautiful look. Slackers are reminiscent of American Pie with different directions. Jokes are shallow, like in American Pie. But are they not all used? I think this movie is a warning for the type of filmmakers they are about to run out of initiative. Overall, a moment smiled. But horror films in terms of performances (except Schwartzman) and subject * from *****
