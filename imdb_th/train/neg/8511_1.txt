I can't follow my life, understand or understand the story. When the plot is progressing, it cannot be understood as well. I would guess and say that there is a plot issue that has never been separated. The manufacturer could not separate many details that any novel or novel had time and space to create from other ideas which would make movies about serial killers and the pursuit of killers by police They ended up with many things that happened in the time limit of the documentary film ordered. Really bad because they have strong actors, directors who know how to move things and great movies. In fact, a well-built movie that we can enjoy and relax with for a couple of hours.
