A man took his new wife to his house, where his ex-wife died of an "accident". His new wife was just released from the academy and is still rich! Suddenly she began to hear the sound and saw the skull around the place. Will she be mad again or be the first wife to come back from death? <br /> <br /> You might guess at the end, so I won't spell it. I saw this many times on TV, Saturday afternoon as a child. Before i like But i am still young When I see now, I know how bad it is. It acts horribly, poorly written, very boring. (Even in an hour) and there are five people (One person is the director)! Even so, there are some good things about it. <br /> <br /> Creepy music and settings with large empty houses and nearby ponds have a good atmosphere. There are also a few scary moments. (I increased slightly when she saw the first skull) and the ending is quite powerful. In conclusion, it's not a good movie ... but it's not a total disaster. There was a small cult following. I gave it 2. <br /> <br /> Also try to avoid the Elite DVD Drive version (it matches "Attack of the Giant Leeches"). Jumping and scratching all over It doesn't look bad on TV!
