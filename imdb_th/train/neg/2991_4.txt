I'm a big fan of Lucio Fulci, but I have to say "Zombi 3" (aka. "Zombie Flesh Eaters 2") in 1988, which he did with two other directors, Bruno Mattei and Claudi Fragasso. Disappointed. Even more compared to the previous generation "Zombi 2" of Gul classic of Fulci (aka. "Zombie Felsh Eaters" / "Zombie") in 1979, this is a very disappointing thing. Of course, the low rating at 4.5 shows that it's not a good movie. But these low scores are usually from people who are not in the Italian Zombie movies and as Italian horror fans Many movies that were rewarded with a much lower rating In addition, many of my Italian horror fans seem to think that this movie is a story that is underestimated, which I sadly disagree with. Not that this movie is a complete disaster. It has the ability to exchange gifts over all the disgusting effects of Fulci, which is always a pleasure to watch Italian horror / Gore movies. The basic concept behind this film is not bad. (Although it is far from the original) and I like the image of a brutal soldier Sad about it While the great ancestor "Zombi 2" is full of blood But it is truly creepy. This is not creepy or scary for one minute and the horrors and often just the real reason to watch "Zombi 3". Sometimes this movie looks fun. But is intended for blood and is a comedy without intention I guess most of the blood comes from Fulci and the rest is disappointing that comes from Mattei and Fragasso, the first person involved in the offensive cult (such as "Porno Holocaust") of D'Amato and the second which Responsible for one of the worst movies ever made for Troll 2 But from all Fulci movies I've seen, it's the worst thing, and I've seen most of the soundtracks I am a fan of Fulse and I will always be But this is not his wonderful time It may be fun for blood. But I recommend watching other Fulci movies earlier!
