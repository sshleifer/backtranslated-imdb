Gene Hackman makes himself arrested from prison by an unknown government agency that wants him to be assassinated. Of course, Hackman has the skills and expertise for the job. <br /> <br /> No one told him even though he received it because the audience received little information and parts. That should be a suspicion instead of being annoying and boring. <br /> <br /> Hackers go through the mission. But the escape is confusing and the person at the top of this mysterious entity instructs everyone to die to cover it. So everyone on the cast team will die and in the end, you don't really care. <br /> <br /> One critic pointed out that the film has twice the length of the original, almost three hours and was shuffled Go a bit. Perhaps there is something lost in translation. But I think it is a show of mercy to the audience. <br /> <br /> A very talented actor with people like Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach and Edward Albert. This is a crime. <br /> <br /> And we never know what the federal agencies do, like FBI, CIA, DEA or IRS.
