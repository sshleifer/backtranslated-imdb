I don't know why I continue to do this for myself !! I still defend the Dutch and Belgian theaters and claim that I should get more credit and opportunity ... then they hit your head with this kind of garbage! Intensive care is a terrible production and may be the worst thing that has ever happened in a Dutch-speaking country. It's a Dutch effort to create our own horror franchise based on American classics like Friday the 13th and Halloween. The producers and writers have a very high goal. In this regard But very low Intensive care has become an embarrassing product for everyone who participates and therefore the true creed swept here. It is almost impossible to hunt for the original copy of this and it is only shown on special occasions such as "The Night of Distaste". Intensive Care tries to tell the story and create a storyline ... 5 minutes for 5 minutes from It turns into a slam and lash movie, a brain that has a bad brain that is terrifying. All actors' performances are disgusting, even though they have a respectable name. A male lead, played by Coen Waters ... This man is probably the most famous and beloved artist in Belgium. He is a singer who loves TV shows and idols of many young women. Although he never spoke of this thing he starred in Like everyone else in the Netherlands, he tried to convince himself that Intensive Care never happened.
