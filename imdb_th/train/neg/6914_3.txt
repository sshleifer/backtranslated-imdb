I saw this movie for a moment. (While working with a sample for a movie production company) and it's scary Hewitt is the best person. Hopkins calls his performance in (But still exploding Hewitt in the scene together) and Alex looks bored Trust me in this story: You should avoid this movie like a plague if it is released. It seems that it will continue forever because of the tired plot unfolds in the snail's rhythm. It is an unceasingly relentless film that is crappy and the direction is pedestrians. Alex Baldwin should go to film school if he plans to direct it again. In terms of his performance, his character is not entirely pleasing, which makes him unable to take root. Dan Aykroyd is a good joke and the makeup of a jury near the end of a cute movie. But this movie is really scary.
