Horror / Sci-Fi interesting because it's ridiculous. F / X is quite good ... for what you see The thriller on television is not as bad as their worst. Jeffrey Coombs is an excellent scientist, although it is mistaken for research on stem cells and manipulating human DNA with shark sharks. Scary results cause one hell of a killing machine. A group of scientists led by William Forsyth and Hunter Tolo were invited to a remote island to see a great new experiment. Of course, after laughing and stammering with fear ... the creation of Coombs by the way, his own son was mixed with a hammer. Revenge is not always a reward. Also in the show: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev
