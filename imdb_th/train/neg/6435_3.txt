I think it's hard to believe that everyone will put this movie in the same context as the shaman. The shaman is fragile and creepy, blunt and clumsy and according to the formula. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most beautiful movies I have seen in a period of time. Up for the downward spiral of patronizing exhibitions that make it unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this film has been spiked compared to The Exorcist and visiting my official website adds That interest This website has a story of historical reality. However, the scene per scene of this film is obsessed with seeking "the truth" that it becomes a joke at first, then it is difficult to watch until the end. I began to wonder when the priests examined the miracles that might happen, walked into the beauty parlor, where our heroine would cut and clearly flirt with the priest. Began to receive the wound of Christ (stigma) and felt dazed and upset about the test Priests were sent directly from the Vatican City to investigate the case. Frankie is the ruler of Satan or is a container for Jesus? <br /> <br /> The only miracle in this movie is that it finally ends.
