I caught the "sadness that disappeared" at the New York Film and Video Festival and I thought I had high hopes for this movie. Sadly, this is another Visual FX phone card. The story is quite lame. The light and the camera are not good, along with editing and less music, making the movie look low quality. <br /> Is it too much to ask if the FX shorts have a better story and have The rest of Technical production must always be with FX! You can no longer escape with FX in shorts for 5 years. "405" became a great game. At least it's short, fast, cool and a little funny! There is nothing that can be said about "Missing sadness"
