I've seen many Seagal movies, and while most are not good or even good, this steam band has reduced bars for bad movies. <br /> <br /> Story: Not really sure Something about drugs that make you crazy and strong or something Who are good people and bad people? Difficult to tell the movie, most of the scenes were cut between the people in the room that had a dark light, complaining about the characters Seagals "Mashall". br /> Making a sound ,,,,,, What is a terrifying sound! Will they find anyone who sounds like Seagal? There may be Cheech or Chong who make voice-overs, at least it may be fun. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring and silly. Avoid all costs !!!!
