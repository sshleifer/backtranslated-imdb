Serendipity, a dark cartoon about a cosmetic salesman who has a strange relationship with Elvis Presley, runs into Elvis' disguised sea while speaking at a meeting in Nevada ... Kim Basinger Show girls who are still charming, make merit, like to play quirky movies. But the horrible screenplay (by Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) does not have good humor Pattern and low jokes do not mean classic jokes. But even at the shameful level of shame, the picture is rough and sloppy. If you look at it, see if you can count the number of external images available in Basinger behind her pink Cadillac steering wheel. The hands are always in the same position and watch faces that are not annoying. Hope that both she and Elvis will receive good compensation without stars from ****
