Nick Stahl's name, the young actor and the attractive VHS cover, made me buy and watch this flick, expecting to see a good, disgusting teenage movie! The screenplay is full of scary conversations, conversations and performances. Scary, terrible, terrible, terrible, scary. Conclusion Wasting all time No black humor horror story is just a truly boring story, along with a plot score that is ashamed. The movie begins with six characters. Three pairs actually form a group of friends. But actually, a very nasty person who seems to be an enemy, playing a ridiculous game called "Prohibition" is ridiculous and each person writes yes or no. Some taboo problems are: no previous development of the characters, viewers do not know who they are, their motivation and relationships. Then there was an egg spawn a year later, and the same group was gathered at the New Year's Eve party, which was an insult to each other in a very bad way. But the plot and twists are ridiculous, moderately predictable, and unbelievable that doesn't deserve any additional lines in my review. Only one suggestion: Do not waste time or money on this garbage. You will definitely regret. My score is one (terrible) <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Taboo ?? Jogando Com o Assassino" ("Taboo ?? Playing With the Killer")
