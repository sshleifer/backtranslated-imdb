"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is another 'feel-goody' called 'heart warm' and a rating that shows that ABC has time to unite. <br /> <br /> I understand the problems that These families suffer So that i'm sorry But do not you think that placing four wide-screen plasma TVs, three flat-screen desktop computers, a swimming pool embedded in the back yard, a half house and a closet full of expensive clothes? Is too much BIT for the family Of course, these families came through a lot. Of course, they deserve something better than they had ever been. <br /> <br /> But actually what Ty Pennington and his team put in these houses was enough to fit the neighborhood. All <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes me really angry about this performance is that Tai and his team have good things to say about every little thing related to the family. Or the condition ofTelling the wheelchair that he or she is very strong or 'very brave' will be older after a while. That may sound rude, but believe me; See this list and you will see what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is an exaggeration. If you want to see it forward This comment is just a heads up for what you are watching.
