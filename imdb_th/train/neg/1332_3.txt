The novelty of the clean, hearty Jayo, the four-letter thriller is the only memorable thing of the crafty duo - this formula that is not compatible in the COLLISION program. The end of the line to track the stolen turbocharger prototype (Think of Leno car lovers playing hands in the plot?) The two leading actors are trying hard. They really do. But Leno is not an actor and fishing routine in Morita's water is rapidly becoming older. This film is carried out with the attractiveness of the 80s, but its precious moments become more scarce because it takes 100 minutes that is too long. Fans of Leno's comedic talents will Feeling disappointed. Others will be bored.
