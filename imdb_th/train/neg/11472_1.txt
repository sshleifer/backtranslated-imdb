Everything about this movie is terrible. In the beginning with this film, there are very good actors and I think it is impossible to create a great actor in the greatest disaster for the gangster movie. The audio track is like one of the very bad comedy movies. It has this song throughout the movie and it starts to be quite annoying. <br /> <br /> Please please please, please don't risk yourself. This disaster will only hurt you.
