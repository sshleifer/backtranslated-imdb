I grew up reading Modesty Blaise, both cartoons and books, and she is truly my heroine. Although not a big fan of Quentin Tarantino, I was interested in hearing a few years ago that he was thinking of creating her movie: Can he finally give her a big screen treatment? I heard the name 'My Name Is Modesty' a few months ago and examined the stars received here and was not surprised to find that the score is not too high because the beloved characters often melt the fans. Certainly not correct So I decided not to read any reviews and watch this movie instead, and I just finished watching it and I was shocked and sad and yes, quite angry as well. Sad and very angry that he had spent an hour to see something incredible as Modesty Blaise-character. That becomes a movie that has nothing for viewers or fans. <br /> <br /> It seems that almost everything About this movie is not important and unprofessional, although I have to accept to see some actors in other films earlier that they are fine, so I do not blame them. But the screenplay and the director ... My God, why this kind of nonsense has a slightly higher production cost than your typical TV movie? But is it worse? I don't know the background of this movie, and actually I don't want to know. But I can't help but wonder why Tarantino's face can tell that he loves being polite and then giving him this name? He lost a lot of respect in my eyes. The director is not the right person for this job, and I can sincerely thank him for destroying my night. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3 stars and those stars to the actors and the technical quality that Probably possible Worse than ever The other seven missing are the things that the film does not do well. Oh, well, hopefully at some point there will be a serious production of Modesty Blaise movies that have a goal other than stealing money from Modesty's fans. Even if people like Tarantino decide, I don't hold my breath.
