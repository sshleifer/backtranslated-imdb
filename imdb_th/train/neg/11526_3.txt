I enjoyed the movie Ittenbach before. I've seen "Burning Moon", but while this film is quite scary and disgusting, "Premutos" seems to be mostly played for laughs. While it is admirable that Itenbach created this film without losing money in his spare time (And the DVD documentary is worth watching) I find myself constantly fighting Of course there is bleeding and if that's all you need then go ahead and have fun. But warned: there are many funny stories and boring stories Many people are comparing this to Peter Jackson's movie, especially "Braindead", but when looking at what Jackson did on the same budget in "Bad Taste", it is clear that Ittenbach lacks one thing Jackson has - talent 3. / 10 (for many great effects and for the most limited use of resources - but not worth the money I paid)
