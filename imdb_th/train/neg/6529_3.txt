This movie is funny and painful at the same time "Cinemagic" almost makes me have seizures. Although what they indicate "Cinemagic" is not an innovative technical process, it is "developed" as a result of an accident and they use it because it disguises the fact that Their "monster" looks very stupid. I still don't think it's a coincidence that the author is Sid "Pink". <br /> <br /> This movie is good for laughs. If you are looking for a movie created in nine days with 200,000 dollars, it's entertainment. At least I can say about this. Bats / mice / spiders are highlighted.
