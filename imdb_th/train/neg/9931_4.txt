"Black Angel" was a small raider, with June Vincent being a woman trying to help her husband from an electric chair after he was found guilty of killing an old acquaintance. Dan Duryea (husband of a young woman who Murdered) decided to help Vincent to find the true culprit. Peter Lorre had a role that was undoubtedly one of the suspects. This film noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer, never having anything special success. Is satisfying enough But sometimes it is not appropriate and solving the mystery provokes one of the greatest reactions to "resting". The only ending may cause the film to fall completely. But what led to the conclusion was not good as well. Vincent is a clever heroine and Duryea has never played well. I like the film noirs, but this is a real disappointment.
