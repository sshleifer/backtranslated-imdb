With the movie "Gayniggers from outside the world", how can you make a mistake? Just throw through the leading patterns for the characters. Use Village People as the main supplier for the soundtrack and throwing a lot of gay gags. The plot is not important. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't contain this story and every joke is missed. Every character looks different from one or two German gay jokes. The remaining jokes fail. <br /> <br /> The title makes me laugh and I'm ready to laugh more about this. My expectations are high.
