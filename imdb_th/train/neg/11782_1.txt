The Danish movie "Slim Slam Slum" surprised me that it is the worst movie I have seen to this day. I don't think it's possible to be in the top of a bad b-bad movie list, but this one deserves gold. It's not funny. It's a bad show. good The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has three girls in it. I believe that this film has the potential to be screened in other Danish movies, "Stjerner uden hjerner" like the worst Danish movie ever created! And that is the real thing Congratulations in advance!
