It's great that this movie became one of my most popular shows. It's the # 1 worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not only have I been bored before (Fortunately for not more than 1,5 hours), the efforts of teenagers who humor That feature is not close to being received. But one corner of my mouth tilted slightly After the first awkward part, you are likely to hope that the other parts will improve at least. You hope to be useless. It's just down. <br /> <br /> This movie has no value to tell anything and repeat that isn't three times We only hope that all the remaining miracles of this movie will be lost forever, and Trent Harris never lay his hand on the camera again ...
