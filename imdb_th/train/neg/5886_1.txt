I will go out of the movie half way if not with people who like it. This film is based on real events. But it doesn't make it feel real I have a psychological background, go on a trip with many psychotherapists and get to know crazy people seriously, so it's not that I think people like this don't exist But in the movie, the only character that looks like a human being is the father of Aung Sen. (Alex Baldwin) and Auguste Young (Even though Ivan Rachel Wood is an interesting game - very sexy and fun with evil), there are some funny moments. But the overall tone of the movie is horrible, strange and disgusting. So great! When I watched them through my eyes, I felt like I was watching the show. This thing was brought home during the credit when there were a few people sitting there, not acting, not talking. Those moments were more fun than the previous two hours.
