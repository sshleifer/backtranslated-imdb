It's 1978 and of course there are too many black players on the team as well! Fans will be upset and of course 75,000 seats will be full. But less happy than having many black players on the field! This thing created for the TV movie Super Bowl can be seen, it is not much, but it is really surprising that the talented actor who made the appearance (at that time) perhaps Tom Zelleck most notably. Unfortunately, any good that Selec brings to the screen is called by "actors" like Dick Butkus quickly. <br /> <br /> It's a stupid story about high-end gambling. PJ Jackson was charged from "New York" (read the mafia) to make sure that the game would end in favor. In this case, $ 10,000,000 stake, PJ is innocent enough and doesn't seem to understand by buying people. How many people here and there? Things seem to fall apart for him. One of the other suspects, Lainie, was responsible, while the mystery of the murder is still unknown. But was clearly revealed in the final murder case that Lainie was a new enemy. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie But can see The performance was good and the filming was ok. At least there is no stupid 70's car pursuit (they have their place, not here). Just open your mind about the past overview and the cocaine era and you will survive. <br /> < br /> 2/10 (probably 2.5)
