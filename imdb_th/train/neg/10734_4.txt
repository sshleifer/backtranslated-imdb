I haven't read the negative professional reviews of this movie. I think I have to miss something. The starting point is something interesting. The three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain the story that is invented. That is the best part After the three walked along the intersection, the film split into three posts. That was when boredom began to come. Of course, the thread with Felix C. Babakas, who made a doll out of chewing bread, was the first thing that was curious Unfortunately, the director hit this one to death despite injecting the forest plot line that led to the particular bottom line: restlessness, a two-hour plot. If you suffer from insomnia, look on the bed and you will sleep well.
