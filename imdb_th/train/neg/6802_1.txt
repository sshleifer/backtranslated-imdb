Words cannot explain how bad this movie is. I can't explain by writing only. You see for yourself to understand how scary the movie is. Not that I suggest you do There are many old ideas, mistakes. (And other negative things you can imagine) here to make you cry To start with the first technique, there are many mistakes about the plane. I will not show here But just talking about the color of the plane They didn't even show the airline in the color of the airline that wore it but used 747 painted in the original Boeing uniform. Very bad. This plot is stupid and has been done many times better. There are many ridiculous moments here that I lose counting very fast. In addition, I was beside the bad guys all the time in the movie because the good people were very stupid. "Executive decision" No doubt you can choose or not even "Turbulence" - the movie is better In fact, every movie in the world is better than this movie.
