Despite the pattern of the characters, the actors with no names and low budget clearly, I think this movie is good. Better than I expected At first I was skeptical - the idea of ​​a computer virus that could make an infected person seem like a small matter for me. But in the end, I think that this movie has a good concept. (Although some scenes are a little funny) <br /> <br /> Actors are quite good and both actors seem to be very serious about their roles. I can't think of Janine Turner as someone who looks like Geena Davis. Maybe it's just her face or the makeup, hair and clothes she has in this movie. But it's always nagging at the back of my mind Will make you look until the end
