One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The camera works low. The use of crappy filters. Films are grainy. The script is terrible. <br /> Some of the fighting scenes are ok. I guess .... <br /> <br /> Some scenes are terrible. It's funny ... like Sorbo makes the horse come up and ride at the end ... ha ha. I mean, really .. Horse Oh, can't forget that the bad killer The visit came in the same car throughout the movie .. Who would have thought that after the killing of a federal agent, and they will be tracked down, etc .. ETC really did not see it.
