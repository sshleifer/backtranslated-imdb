This movie is not the best movie of Mary-Kate and Ashley. I don't like it and I was disappointed in that movie. For some reason, it looks like it's a movie that they gather really quickly. In some parts it is boring until I have to fast forward. There are no bloopers or exciting parts like their other movies.
