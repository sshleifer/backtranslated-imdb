When a man without Alzheimer can't remember how many movies he made, he may be the most productive director in the world. That man is Jesus Franco, the king called 'eurotrash'. His Devil Hunter flicked in 1980, fierce, dull, stupid, lazy and exploiting the true sense of the word. (The name of the film is misleading for the beginner) like other Franco movies I've seen That makes it look terrible and it is ... but Franco has a feeling that imitating is not a benevolent way with obscenity with nudity and sloth and violence and even editing the price. Was his The extreme urgency that all his films were created The combination of these elements allows you to drive his movies out, even when you are waiting for them to finish because they are very boring. <br /> <br /> The devil hunter is near to understand at first. Half an hour. Abduction by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or movie star is interrupted by native actions in South America. With repeated twists, dances and zooms that are endless on the ugly totem pole You must be familiar with repeatedly zooming and cutting techniques back to the same shot for about three consecutive times, since this is Franco's main method of extending the movie to a long time. <br /> <br >> The monster that looks like a totem pole is really scary. He has eyes that are raw bugs and his presence will always signal in the soundtrack by the groaning of the loudness. At the beginning of the workpiece, he chewed a native woman tied to a tree and it was hard to know what really happened here, but I think he ate her stomach. (Or your penis is sweet, Jesus!) <br /> <br /> The adventure begins correctly when a young man and his Vietnamese vet friend is sent to the island to recover a white girl. From the kidnapper The guy with an accent that is half-Brooklyn-American, half-English - Liverpud Lien and all mentally retarded All conversations and refinements are ridiculous and ridiculous, making it another layer of movies that can attract your attention. <br /> <br /> Not really happening from here on, and it's quite sluggish. Along with a strange rape like rape. The vague action is caused by the flesh (ha ha!) By an acre that has a 360 degree nudity from the natives and two women and even from the monster himself. As he walked around with his penis, wrestling was an unlikely opportunity for a strong hero. But must do at some point and it is good to know that the director will show the genitals of everyone in the camera. <br /> <br The best qualities of the Devil Hunter are filming. Location Franco may be very cheap. With structural aspects and the story of making movies But he was not joking with various scenes You will get a real island, a forest, a helicopter and a mountain in the wide screen. This is a very cool thing to experience in the era of crappy CGI and nausea behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> Finally, the point of the introduction that this movie seems to look suspicious. If you're trying to watch all the videos, you'll have to watch this at some point and you'll have to be restless. If you like Franco, you will continue to watch this. If you are not in the category above, you will not be able to meet this movie. Copy of it not only But lied and I could hardly recommend the search It is french Lazy Franco Crazy
