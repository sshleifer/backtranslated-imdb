As a member of the actors, I am a member of the band in the basketball game. I want the world to know after being in this movie that we are not allowed to watch because it was banned in Oregon. This is because the producer and director made a contract with the University of Oregon that was shot. It seems that the U mark of O was shown. While we were filming, we were allowed to eat many meals with the team of actors and producers. Nicholson is quite memorable because it is one of the most manners I have ever met. Quite a long time for 20-year-olds. Of course, no matter what the university's life will be in the late 60s and early 70s. Trombone player from Oregon
