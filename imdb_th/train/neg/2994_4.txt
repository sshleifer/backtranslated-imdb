Now I have watched this movie twice and I have to say that I enjoy it both times. It's fast and fun. But in the end it was crazy Have to say that it should be discarded in the trash because of damaging things that may be beneficial to the truth It is clear to those who have seen the horrifying 'Zombie Creeping Flesh' that a large flawed movie might be owed to Bruno Mattei and a little respectable thing about Fulci. This is not ridiculous. Fulci sycophancy's style The director is completely different and you can tell who is the director, especially in the case of Mattei. <br /> <br /> This film is centered on the virus outbreak. As "Top Secret" by scientists. It's a secret that is more noticeable than the effects that can occur on humans) somewhere in Southeast Asia. The virus causes behavior like zombies in those affected and the virus spreads rapidly throughout the area. Our protagonists walked into the danger zone and had to fight to fight the infected Asian crowd. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be stuck half way between being a zombie flick and going outside. This action adventure and confusion is most clearly captured by the zombies themselves. They don't seem to have a set of common features for everyone. Some of them have a variety of intangible, regular, good results in traditional ways and may be the work of Fulse here. The other main groups consist of those who have been infected with the virus, missing their own feelings. But caused severe aggression and the desire to receive a black belt in Ninjitsu: humbly popping around, not sure how to continue the top technique Participate with their brothers and sisters in what appears to be a carnivorous carnival with their victims. Combat skills are not their only ability. But they also specialize in guerrilla tactics, hiding on rafters and under hay bales and sometimes falling from heaven All of this is Mattei's work. <br /> <br /> There are zombies that are very talkative and varied. Obviously, this type of treatment also feels irony. 'I'm really thirsty ... because of your blood.' The absurd twist at the end that DJ changed into zombies. But continue to comment on the fate of humanity, only to act to improve the WTF factor and eliminate any hope of solving serious problems. <br /> <br /> Then there is an embarrassing zombie head. Which gradually moved into the air as a smile, a skeleton created on the face as if to say 'Yes, we know that it doesn't look good.' <br /> <br /> The characters are all filled. The dimensions you expect But the dialogue is funny, foolish, and the dubbing makes us unable to control their situation seriously. Having said that, the first soldier who died will show impressive courage against unstoppable dangerous zombies. In fact, this is the first and only time that we will hit real farming zombies and be one of the only powerful scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> People who play as chief scientists have hearts. But without the ability to temporarily stop In all his lines at random, so he became a confused asthma The on-screen efforts of scientists to find the antidote are unbelievable. Now we will bring these two molecules together! '<br /> <br /> There was a moment that appeared to be truly effective. In the first scene, the female character explores the abandoned garage. When entering the room, we must face the dim view of the moving angle and the angle with the upstart mass on the floor. All images are taken in the light that is distributed in the atmosphere. The silence was interrupted by the presence of a zombie gangster carrying a weapon that quickly destroyed everything in his wake in his terrible despair to have her. His true aggression was one of the few moments of true horror in the movie. The pre and post format through the hotel that plays host to the events that occurred during the first part of the outbreak, and later as the hideout of our protagonists, is filled with a damp atmosphere. There was a scene in which a soldier entered the room carefully, which was clearly the location of the hordes of human beings, and this was quite tense. Things were even more amazing when they were in the hotel without knowing what was hidden. Upstairs But this thing is handled in a smooth and ineffective manner. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say that this movie may be worthy of being called the grandeur of the festival. Powerful tropical zombies More than just a passing movie and bad If nothing else, there are many unintended laughter that I expect from everything in Italy and full of blood from the eighties.
