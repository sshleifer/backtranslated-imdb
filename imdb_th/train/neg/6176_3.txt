I'm not a big fan of Stooges, but I find their history interesting. Recently, I tried to check things from each Stooge era, but the chance to see Joe shorts seems not easy This is the only thing I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Some people say that the quality of shorts in the era of Joe is not Joe's fault and I think it's like that. Joe, as an actor, is far from the worst thing about this. What bothered me the most about this has been pointed out in another opinion: the pit of others, with the third person violating the whole team funny / ethos Stooges. Appropriate - even if there is no conflict between the camera with him and others - and this is how they work Up certainly What are the causes or effects of the market for dry shorts?
