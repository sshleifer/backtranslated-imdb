Ok, I am the owner of this DVD. I get it new at Amazon ... I mean, I think it's bad and a pretty flick and Melissa Bell, an incontinence girl / bitch. They picked up. Come to be hot ... polt just suck the clown, a big guy wearing a mask and it's disgusting But it is ok. I would not recommend if you like. You want to rent a flick. Have fun. After working hard all day. But if you don't have anything to do With such stupid movies, I sometimes watch, and I don't know how the craftsman's DVD is sick in the DVD set. S.i.c.k is not good enough to be owned by a good movie company.
