Of course, it is very good to see improvements in the Turkish film industry. However, I expect to have more creative things from Togan. Gokbakar starts with a script which I believe is not the smartest writer that some people think. Especially the temptation of dialogue, which puts the audience in a position as if they are not smart enough to understand the situation, which in most cases makes the movie unbearable It has a clear ending. You can easily guess that the murderer from the beginning The weakest part of the situation is the impossibility of a serious mental patient to act like a normal person like a professional !!! They used to find the feasibility of patients in the medical community to act as professionals and use them all. Medical terminology that even ordinary people can't use ????? !!!!!! In the scene where the authorities are searching for the most dangerous patients with any weapon to protect themselves as an exotic spot of the movie. And that scene is suitable for the name "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir" !! This is not the only weak part of the movie. There is a lot in this movie. The most dangerous description of the patient is the correct copy from Hannibal and the appearance of Togan at the end is clearly the worst mistake he can make in the first film. The fuss about the greatness of the film and the interviews that the actors made people curious and forced them to see it. Gen is a total disappointment. I would wonder if Sahan is not famous. Can Togan be able to film this movie with this budget? I hope that Tokan will realize that it is not up-to-date to have a role as a director, as he said in an interview, as Hitchcock, who made it wisely and Night Shyamalan successfully proceeded! He should be aware of the fact that he is not Hitchcock or Chayamalan !!!! Hopefully he will be more careful and creative next time in this big industry!
