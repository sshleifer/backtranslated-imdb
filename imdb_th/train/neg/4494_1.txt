*** Spoiler *** *** Spoiler *** Continue ... <br /> <br /> From here, the whole movie broke down in itself. First of all, we found a rogue program with indications that we can get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and other similar things. We received a man with an infinitely slow accent, talking about two 'ghosts' that had no real purpose and had no character and belonged to them. Someone told me that they are vampires (straight from Blade 2), but they haven't defined it so I don't realize. <br /> <br /> People who focus on funny voices with ridiculous names are resistant. The same problem with Oracle just to be longer and far more far. He has a simple point about the cause and the result. Make it then continue to do it and do it until it becomes complicated and stupid. His last line before walking out was comparable to the Storm. "Do you know what happened to the toads ..." in the worst X-men Chocolate cake is a bored, lazy, pathetic and Monica Beluchchi as wife does nothing but what we expect while we see you. <br /> <br /> Then we fought kung fu again !!! why? Neo is implying that One can do anything. He has the highest power and what he uses for Kung Fu is always bloody. And while he was able to stop 1,000 bullets, he still was cut by the sword and still eats 5 minions who could not decipher (vampires?). I want to see him crazy and crazy for people because he can do anything. I can be like before without having to 'wow'. <br /> <br /> The chase of a car that is lying. That's not bad. Hmm ... No, it's not what we used to be. It's possible. Every shot from this scene is in every example, so it may be possible that Wow will be taken away from us, so what we get now is a good chase. Guess it's a kung fu fight !!! OK, it's not neo. But you think he will explain to his close friends about the reality of the matrix At least teach them something that is not difficult. <br /> <br /> "Hey Morpheus. Don't worry about what happens to you in the matrix. It's not true. As long as you understand that there is nothing. Nothing can hurt you. "<br /> <br /> It's easy. <br /> <br /> Ok, so the chase is not bad. It's not boring and seems to be no more than 16 minutes. It's so depressing. And even then it's getting worse. <br /> <br /> The climax in the final movie may be the worst. They have all these complex plans that involve three crew members. Then they will show periodically between Morpheus over a long period of time. To make it worse, they never set clear what this plan needs. The 3 teams are, but you don't know when anyone is doing. One of the crew members fell down, you didn't care, and you didn't know that this would affect what happened. <br /> <br /> I'll summarize it even though it happened to Trinity to be able to return to the matrix. Inter set to end That's the only reason it happened. What questions do they have to send 6 people originally? Trinity within five minutes by myself. <br /> <br /> Neo's journey to the center of the matrix (to speak) is equally lazy. Ooohhh !!! He ran into the Agent Smiths for another 100 !!! Woooooo !!! That requires a lot of thought. Now they are in the path only, so the fight is not bounded and ends soon. The man is the last big scene !!! <br /> <br /> The architects !!! <br /> <br /> Remember everything I could say about Oracle and foreigners? Added together and doubled, that is the real horror of the architect His only reasonable potential is that he is going to create an exciting climax. <br /> <br /> Then he explodes! <br /> <br /> Take a look at the options he gave Neo. Choose one door and all humans die (except 27 !!!). Choose others and all humans die !!! The choice of consideration is what this film tries to explore. It doesn't focus on one hero. If he had the option of saving humanity and Missouri died or saved the life and killed mankind, that is the potnetial for torture and internal tensions. In addition, when Trinity is in the middle of the fall, the potential of true excitement that will make seeing the third thing more important, but no. He saves lives, no one, or saves lives. <br /> <br / > Now the worst thing about the original matrix is ​​Neo is dying and then come back to life again at the end. Every year it comes out, everyone feels very annoyed with the stupid way Jar Jar. They didn't notice that the end of The Matrix made him look at him. Steven Hawking "Oracle told me that I fell in love with One and I love you" .. .. Come !!!! How can the whole world miss the most terrifying way? <br /> <br /> So what is Wachifsky doing in the next? How do they make the end of the original look better? (By exchanging characters) that is worse. I think my keys and r will deteriorate if I continue to write before I get worse. <br /> <br /> And the excitement is not just worth it. Really excited It's a reminder. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is terrible. I do not want it to be bad, but it is not good in many ways and to make matters worse, this is not a movie with insufficient budget. Not a movie with too short a schedule. It's not a movie that hurries away. It's not a movie that has too much influence from the outside. This is the movie that Wachowski set to achieve the full fortune of Warner behind them. And that's what makes this thing so terrible. At least Rancid Aluminum can say that it doesn't have enough time or money. <br /> <br /> Matrix Reloaded, the worst movie ever made? Maybe not so much. The most frustrating and challenging movie ever created. <br /> <br /> Undeniably <br /> <br />
