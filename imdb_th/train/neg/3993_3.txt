This movie is something I expect, not great. But it's not that bad as well In my opinion, the PG13 movie is not scary enough so I know that I will be bored throughout the movie. Sure there are horrible things going on in the hotel room. But nothing that we all haven't seen yet I think I don't like it because I think there are too many twists and occurrences; It's old and repeated I do not understand that all the things that Cusack experienced in that room were true or not. There is no explanation for any events that happened. This movie just dragged away and when it finally ended, you want it to continue because you are still waiting for someone to tell you what this movie is about My favorite thing is special techniques. Apart from that, it's not much fun. Maybe just me But I think this is below average
