Personally, while I can really appreciate the good movies, I have a strange ability to enjoy the worst. Did you know that when you just want to sit there and watch the awesome cookie-cutting action movie to kill time? This is the only movie that I remember being in the middle and I had no intention of returning to play. The plot was planned and predictable, so I asked how the next scene would be easy. The actors were horrible. I saw better performances in high school. Even cutting scenes is not good. But the flow was all wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a parody that forgot a joke.
