Prom Night is a story about a woman named Donna (Brittany Snow), who was chased by a psychopathic killer who tried to kill her in a prom night. And by killing her family, friends and enemies. <br /> <br /> Now, before I start, let me tell you that you are tired of the horror movie PG-13 that is not scary. Idiot of a girl 'Oh my God,' and talk about the story of girls. And you are tired of having a relationship and cry And the last thing you are bored of is the American, Asian, Japanese and Chinese movies. The sum of the Prom Proma is quite high, but I haven't done a review. <br /> <br /> The only reason to see 'Prom night' is to laugh at death if Don't see the Prom night. You never saw a person who killed only one, heard the scream and you saw the blood on the wall. And by the way that people have repeatedly died like 24/7, so not only But they are not scary But it's disgusting By the time I met the actors, I thought I was ready to cast. Women talk too much. Men talk too much and 'Oh, I'm gonna be our prom.' I understand that it's fun. But too serious to ask not to concentrate. <br /> <br /> If I put the Prom Night on the list of the worst movies of 2008 without watching another movie, I will be the first one. together I would not be surprised if it was released in a cheap and fast DVD format. Seriously, don't spend your money or time for boring, cheap, and 'night to die for' when watching movies. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10 (PS if I can give The film Star Center I will)
