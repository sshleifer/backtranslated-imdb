You know when you are on a bus and someone decides to tell their lives and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when everything you want to do is slap a fool and walk. get out? I have a similar feeling while watching this movie. Ok, I really chose to see Aprile and I knew about the taste of Nanni Moretti who made himself one from Caro Diario. But after half an hour of this last installment from his memoirs, I wanted Moretti to slap. All of Caro Diario's are funny, strange, and at least have a few other characters that get vocabulary in the edgeways. However, in Aprile Moretti has the exclusive right to dialogue, so what you Heard for an hour and a half as the high sobbing that arose about his politics, the best, or any of his quirky popular culture at this time. He also found some time to break down movies he didn't like. As I think is reserved for losers like me Of course, being in a position like him, you think he will try to make the point of cinema a bit smarter. Perhaps proper movie creation may have the right idea and structure, or it may be a film that doesn't use his annoying voice. And when he began to wag his tail to my newborn baby, I just wanted to be in someone's company as usual, should not be a film director who was obsessed with his strange preferences for tacky music The next time someone you don't know try to tell their life story, let them slap me. Every attack will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism.
