Eh, not particularly slapping Impressive performances, familiar soundtrack effects But unfamiliar <br /> <br /> There are 3 consecutive deaths near the beginning of the movie that created the scene quite well. Apart from that, there are many characters walking around, not knowing what is happening or pursuing the Red Flock. Kill more time than people There were other deaths and the murderers were equal killers. The killer also likes to make other people kill innocent people as well. The identity was not revealed at the end and the motivation was quite thin and we didn't really care. <br /> <br /> Suppose the movie happened during Christmas. But this is not an important factor. One scene received the light from the Christmas lights. It's about that. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite dark with mud-filled images all the time, at least in the videotape I watch Some conversations disappeared slightly in some open scenes. The ending should be stronger. We think we are aware of what happens even if there are other opportunities.
