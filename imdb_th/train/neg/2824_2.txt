I am a big fan of Porsche and the car is the best star in this movie. <br /> <br /> Haim, a child star in the 80s who is addicted to drugs at the moment, is arid as usual. Up from the secondary character / actor is pointless; No need to say that they are all very average. It is a cool movie that brings you to the memories of the 80s with some strange clothes, good scenes of the backdrop in Colorado, and a very harmless scene. <br /> <br /> All please, don't ' Don't waste your time watching this thing unless you love 80 Corey Haim movies or like yourself, love old school Porsche. (This looks very good) because life is too short to watch crappy movies.
