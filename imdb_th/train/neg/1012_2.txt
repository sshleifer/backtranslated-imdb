How many police will have damage? With enough police to make small wars with weapons such as sprayers, you will think that they will be caught before the weekly newspaper coupons are heard. People who say 'thank you' to the corrupt police. <Br <br /> <br /> You won't get 90ish minutes. Come back. Life is worth more than renting this movie. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for a big-name actor who made a mistake in making a movie. This story <br /> <br /> You like Justin Timberlake, feel free to rent the film. He has an important role in it, so fans may enjoy seeing him. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that most of his fans are young women who may be shut down by violence in this film.
