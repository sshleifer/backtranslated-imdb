I chose "dead creatures" because I think it's a zombie movie like "28 days" or more ... but not at all. It's not a horror movie. Nothing happens except for a group of women who seem to be infected by a strange virus that causes her to eat human flesh for survival. <br /> <br /> The story creates a disgusting scene of a human being ... <br /> <br /> The worst movie <br /> <br /> 10 <br /> <br /> ------------------ <br /> <br /> --------------- ---
