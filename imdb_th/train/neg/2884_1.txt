When I worked at a video store, I found that it was my sacred duty to talk about the worst movies I have ever seen and remind my friends and colleagues. In the midst of a hard day's debate about what was the worst movie, my friend gave me a look. BTK Killer even stated that if I could watch the entire movie and still claim that I had previously chosen it as a bad movie I had lost. I believe that even though I can make a better video in high school and those things cannot be done perfectly Yom of young genius This film is not only But lacking what seems to be the production value (It looks like it was shot in a bad video camera, although it was surprisingly clear) but in the show (hollow and poor, not scratching the skin), including the feeling of a bad movie in general. I remember the scene where I heard the glass break. Suddenly I thought of a poor high school drama. (I know I refer to high school too often here. But this movie looks very young and young) in terms of the scenes in which Seems to be too fake But just like people are reading their script from the script, I'm not sure what really happened. My opinion isn't about justice in this movie because I can't explain that when I watch it. How terrible Almost a ridiculous story that I worked poorly, describing pathetic excuses for movies.
