Another example of the complete loss of the UK lottery. How can this movie prove commercially? The film council that gave money to this pathetic waste should be stuck at a subway station in London to allow this ancient thought to be a dismal example of filming. And felt appropriate to imitate the most striking deadline In the midst of many sins, it is an apparent failure to create a lead character from a distance until the last minute. It's too late! Of course, all development executives that the UK Film Council can observe from the script stage Add to that the scary performances and the laughing look of the living thing and you get a good example that will not scare.
