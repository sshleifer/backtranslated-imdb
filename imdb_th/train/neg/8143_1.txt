I felt dissatisfied with seeing this film at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2006. I attended this festival for over 5 years and I saw some bad movies on occasion. However, 'First Bite' came to the bottom of the movie. New story Despite being shot in a beautiful place with occasional excellent food, this film has a lot of story about twisting and plotting the characters so much that I almost asked for it to end. <br /> The leading actor, David La Haye, has failed completely in performing the character development in this film, showing the elegant chef from beginning to end. Additional sub-plans, such as eating disorders, have been poorly developed and are not suitable for any context in which the film shows that point. <br /> <br /> The style of magic is right. Used as a bad attempt In order to cover the unsuccessful movie, nowhere and totally disappointed
