Wow. I've seen bad movies in my time. But this one really takes the cake. It's the worst movie I've ever seen in the last decade - no exaggeration. <br /> <br /> As a US Army veteran in the war in Afghanistan, I find it almost impossible. To watch this ridiculous movie, not because It brings back memories - far from it - but because there is no attempt to "correct" to be found anywhere in the movie. Not as much as the smallest piece It seems that it was written by an 8-year-old boy who received the concept of war. (And military behavior) from comic books This film was created in Honduras which should be a clue. But even though it is impossible to explain the brutal production value of this creative garbage piece, <br /> <br /> I can try all the items. Endless technical flaws But will take almost forever From ancient shoulder pads that have not been seen or worn since World War II and the character's name tag, such as "ColCollins" (worn by the characters "Colonel Collins"), which is actually spelled back. "Of the Russian alphabet (Not the US letter) The program just goes on. Uniforms, plot devices, and especially the character's behavior - every scene is a scene filled with absurd flaws, inaccuracies and ancient thoughts that Unreasonable <br /> <br /> both the story itself And the character is the least reliable or believable It was a laughing boy in the end. Obviously, this is a movie that was intended to attract a boy with a hairy body before, and I still have a little doubt that they will find that the film is completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> In the distance In short, this movie has no redemption feature at all. It's a waste of time. I encourage everyone who reads this message to pass this garbage too. It is not worth it to waste your time.
