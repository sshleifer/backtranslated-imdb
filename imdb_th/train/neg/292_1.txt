I saw this accidentally when performing on a cable that wanted to like it because I thought Sandra was funny from what I remember. The only facial movement I have in this movie is the shocking jaw that the movie that I just had was so bad. <br /> <br /> People who say this is one of the most fun movies time Only one scene is worth laughing. <br /> <br /> She is a better singer than I can remember you. But I don't want to watch the drama. <br /> <br> I think this is a movie that I try to like because they think they should and don't look neutral.
