To say this, I actually got this movie. I got what the writer / director tried to do. I understand that the conversation is dry and emotionless. I understand that the plot should not be outstanding and outstanding. That is what the writer / director is doing. Humor / humor that is very dry. It seems that the writer / director tried to create a new Napolean Dynamite with this movie. It has all the same features. Even the main character acted like Napoleon. But Napoleon Dynamite is really funny. The script works. This movie is not It has no purpose May I use this new word Its sole purpose is to eliminate Napolean Dynamite and try to capture that image. Unfortunately it doesn't work.
