There are many stupid things about this movie that I can't tell. But there are a few: <br /> <br /> BOGART character: 1. His name ?? Whip McCord (too easy, so I'll leave it there for the boys. It makes the sound of 'Humphrey' good) 2. His long curly hair 3. His black Bart wakes up along the spur! 4. Not sure what lip gloss is for him to wear. But it doesn't have anything too tempting. <br /> <br /> CAGNEY's character (Jim Kincaid): 1. His lipstick doesn't help, either. Swallowing the whole movie! Can't they find a hat that suits him? Even slightly? 3. His pants on the back are too tight. 4. He throws the smoke out of his gun too many times if you know what I mean and I think you do. <br /> <br /> If Are you a Bogart fan or Cagney and think it might be The change in the speed of seeing them in the West, making yourself a favorite and forgetting that idea. Both horses appeared! (That is, when they don't look bored) <br /> <br /> In all fairness, I agree that Westerners are the least favorite movies But I still see a lot more than this. <br /> At the comedy level or in the high camp, The Oklahoma Kid works, otherwise the audience is careful. So see this only if A) You have to see all Westerners who are b) You are the perfect Cagney TRUE Cagney or Bogie c) Any comments above that you are interested in?
