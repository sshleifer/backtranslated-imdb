The good person at the Webster dictionary determines that Logophobia is "fear of words." I may be a phonetic. Because there is no combination of words that scared me more than at the beginning. `Produced, written and directed by: 'and followed by the name of the individual. Imagine having a carpenter, electrician and plumber. But only a few vendors Even the most experienced directors like Speilberg and Scorsese could barely control their movies. But I was all there in the theater seat, popcorn in my hand and I was going to watch The Order when I threw the ball like a fastball. Nolan Ryan, the word that was written and directed by Brian Helland. <br /> <br /> I know Brian Helgeland as his screenwriter in the last 10 years. There will be a graph like the dotcom stock price in 1998, with dramatic performances. Many (Assassins, The Postman, Conspiracy Theory) due to the great success of the river). One good one is so bad when knowing that his last film, BloodWork, is one of the most wasted attempts in Clint Eastwood's career. I therefore breathe and hope for the best. When looking back, I shouldn't breathe out. <br /> <br /> Orders led by Heath Ledger (the story of the Knights of Helland) in the name of Alex Bernier, a priest known as The Carolingians, who were summoned to Rome when the monks were killed in the arc situation The bishop saw that "wanted to know" met with Father Thomas. (As well as the commands and astonishingly played by Still Addings' Mark Addy) They set out to solve the remaining mystery after the death of the untrained priest. <br /> <br /> The complicated story Is a subplot involving the devil Sinclair (played by Shannyn Sossamon), who escaped from the institution as a result of her attempts to kill Alex during the exorcism Alex has feelings for the devil and for some reason is unknown to the audience. They travel to Rome together. <br /> <br /> I didn't sleep well all night. And William Eden (Benno FÃ¼rmann), a hundred years old sinner The sinners, as we said, are those who eat the sins of those who are dying when the church does not do so. William, as fortunate, is tired of being tired and looking for Alex to take on the role and free him from his worldly duties. Alex hesitates but after a new love Mara comes to Alex to return to Sin Eater's ritual to save her life and the transformation is complete. Then Alex searched for answers to many questions, while Father Thomas revealed the plans of the Vatican that had been authorized to his fellow researchers. <br /> <br /> Orders are not scary movies. But it is very boring It has a laughing effect and no connection with any character, even in the most dramatic scene - that Alex is walking in Mara, who is dying - pale and polite and makes us not. Emotional responses to both fate It seems that everyone is speaking quietly and mercilessly that flat films and smelling salts are handled to prevent me from trying to take a quick nap in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> So Mr Helland I beg you, don't try again Share your vision with others and allow more experienced people to help guide you in ways that are not limited to service and self-service. Until then, nothing will come out, which shows that you are more capable than the two-star failed. <br /> <br />
