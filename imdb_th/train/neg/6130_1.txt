In the early 1980s Kurt Thomas was something of a hero in the United States. Inevitably, the person in his position has been offered a movie role that exists only for the sake of I don't know how to pay for Thomas to create this movie. But I have to get a lot of money to accept myself as a fool in the country. Obviously, this movie comes from "Enter The Dragon", which is the most martial arts image. Rather than being a true martial arts, they cook a new, ridiculous martial arts that one critic described correctly as "Crossing between kung fu and broken dance" The gymnast (Thomas, of course) was hired to help some women from the piercing fortress. But every room has a prop that Thomas wants to kick the baddies assistant. Of course, he fights to go to the leading villain and of course they have a fierce fight and have an end to make people who have never seen a movie Field Marshal There is a touch that the nostalgic genre will like, especially Thomas's cylindrical haircut and many star mates. But the only reason to watch this movie is if you are offended by Kurt Thomas, who now hopes that he will never walk in the movie.
