What happened? What we have here is a stable and reliable place with talented and talented actors. But there are some places that have lost it In fact, it never really happened. There was a little excitement when we found that Angie wasn't really pregnant and found that she was the last one. But that is so Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and often brings this movie very scary and all his characters are not close to the importance of this movie. I want to see the interaction between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe not trying to play real comedy, which is a pity that it is not. But may be a drama with funny elements I think that if this film is made, it may be very funny because both female actors are funny in their own way and sitting here.
