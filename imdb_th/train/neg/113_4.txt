Today I find "all of them laughing" on the VHS from the sale of the lease. It's an old and very active VHS. I don't have information about this movie. But I like the references shown on the cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten attract me specially, very cheap. Low and I decided to risk and buy. I searched for IMDb and 6.0 user rating as a wonderful reference. I watched in "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and ?? Wow ?? Four stars! So I decided that I could not waste more time and see it immediately. Of course I just watched "They all laughed" and I found it a very boring movie. The character was poorly developed and I spent several minutes understanding their role in the story. The story should be funny. (The private eye that falls in love with the woman who is pursuing) But I didn't laugh all the time. The coincidence in big cities like New York is ridiculous. Ben Gagara is a very attractive and seductive person who falls in love with him as if she were Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney. In the end, what is more interesting is the appearance of the playboy centerfold and friend of the year Dorothy Stratten, killed by her husband after the film was released and the lives of the actors in "Star 80" and "Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story"; The miraculous beauty of Patti Hansen, the fantastic future, Keith Richards; Always excellent, even though he was fifty-two years old. Audrey Hepburn; And "Amigo" from Roberto Carlos. Although I don't like him, Roberto Carlos is the most famous Brazilian singer since the late 1960s and his fans are called "the king". I will keep this movie in the collection. Only my actions due to these attractions My rating is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Muito Riso e Muita Alegria" ("Laughter and lots of happiness")
