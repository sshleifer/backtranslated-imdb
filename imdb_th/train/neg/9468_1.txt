The only good thing about this ship's wreck is that I don't have to pay. I saw it free at college. And if a college student cannot find humor in something free, it is hopeless. <br /> <br /> The old performances and poor jokes cannot be deceived by designing a wonderful scene. To the Volkswagon Beetles market. I don't know what Michaels Myers is doing in this movie. But I never saw anything that was depressing before. This is nothing more than an outrageous attempt to take advantage of Grinch's previous success (which has an opponent But I enjoy it a lot.) It's hard not to sit down in this failure and wonder if the better project will be sent to the capital. <br /> <br /> You want to adjust Seuss funny? Go with the Grinch
