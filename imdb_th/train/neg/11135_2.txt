What can I say more? The performance was almost no exception. The director and the continuity are poor. Sceenplay can predict the final scene and boring dialogue. One of the features of the DVD is called "Gag Reel", but that may be an explanation of the reaction of the audience to almost every movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most amusing things in the comments of his DVD director. Frankly speaking, he intends to create a movie that has a high production value and uses a real name and he is successful. With such delusions, it is easy to understand that this film opened as it used to be. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most frustrating thing is the darkwolf monster set. (Towards the 'making' feature on the DVD) and look quite The mask and claw are better than the work from the little clothing store. The cgi effect is painfully noticeable and has a quality similar to inexpensive video games.
