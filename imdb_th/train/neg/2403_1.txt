Hit!!! I received this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was there. I was disappointed to find that she was in two short moments. In addition, I pressed the fast forward button all the time. Some teenagers visit Romania with their father and get bitten by wolves and become werewolves if they have a full moon. He killed his father and his friends for about 30 years, but he was not a little old and attended high school. There he met a shy teacher who began to bite and have children with her. This movie sucks and I do not advise anyone. Read war and peace instead. Only Hartman is doing a great job. Look at the young Bob Saget in this !!
