Of course, it's a realistic movie, except that the characters don't seem to be scared when Billy Zane tries to kill someone. He feels bad ... but he doesn't like it. That's why I don't like his performance in this movie. Tom Berenger plays as a soldier again. There is no good excitement, realistic sequence. Never filmed. That's one good thing. Filming. I hate the helicopter sequence, causing only one terrorist to kill almost every bunch of sea ... I give it ** and half from *****
