This movie is very bad, whether you take it as a sci-fi movie, a single horror story or a joke. The whole thing is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The movie looks (and) definitely cheap. The actor doesn't have any idea what the show is and the script clearly shows that it was created along with the shooting. Apparently the monster in the closet was added because the head with no life was scary - she was very beautiful - and they thought they needed something more impressive. They failed here as well. (The makeup is scary, even in the late 1950s, quite funny) <br /> <br /> This film clearly shows why the occupation of director Joseph Green is like that. He is both bad. Actors bring and support <br /> <br /> too "the best achievement of the brain" that is a short time
