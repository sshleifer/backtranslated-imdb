This guy has no idea about the cinema. It seems that he will show interesting drama in his youth and two more acceptable films that are more successful for political reasons, causing them to deceive communist censorship This is all very good. But watch carefully: He doesn't know his work! The scene is not balanced without having to start properly and with content that is messy and full of emptiness. He had nothing to say about it, so he was ordained by violence, nudity and bad language. How is it possible to make a rotten corpse that still doesn't understand the film and art profession? Why didn't they allow him to give up?
