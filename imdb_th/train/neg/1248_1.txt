This movie is not good because there is nothing interesting about it. It is a new creation. But not really again I was very disappointed when considering the tools that Tim Burton had given him, make-up and CGI great, and had plenty of money ($ 100 million), but you can honestly say that what we get is as good as The original movie was not less than $ 6 million, so that movie failed. <br /> <br /> At least in the original movie, the statue of the Liberty scene fell. startup But there is nothing shocking in this film, even the last scene because you will see it. And by the way, if you give some ideas and I do, you can figure out what the ending might happen. I just wish I could go back in time when I thought about it. <br /> <br /> This film will be fantastic and fun if it's in the first film and part of "Beneath the Planet of the Monkey. "This is the way I will write it: <br /> <br /> Astronaut (It should be more than Marky Mark because he is not good enough to take care of the movie by himself, so I will put three men) to go down. Park on what they think will be a star Marseille's encounter with another man (Not gag) The city ruled by monkeys was hunted for friends with good monkeys, discovering that they were on earth through the discovery of ruins that had been destroyed. Run into the crazy mutant humans that live under the war world. Occur between mutants and episodes and then .... Well, let your imagination run fiercely in the way you want to end. <br /> <br /> But my point is that there may be more in this movie. Sadly, Tim Burton knows how to really destroy things. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He is a rotten director who is inspired by what people think. He's trendy, so he must be a good person to think about. Sorry, but not. If someone else does this movie, it will be better and more satisfying.
