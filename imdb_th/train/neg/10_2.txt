This movie has many promises and the storyline is quite interesting. However, actors, directors and editors make this movie worse. <br /> <br /> I feel bad with writers. The performance is wood and there are very few characters to believe. <br /> <br /> Those who have fixed this thing clearly just learned new editing techniques and want to splash them all over the movie. "Flashy" quickly in almost every scene, which has a clear meaning as a symbol. <br /> <br /> I want to like this movie and expect to have the right resolution. Breakdown of equilibrium But it's not. It makes me feel that I'm wasting my time and filmmakers lose money.
