I debated whether or not to choose a spoiler box, because 99% of this list may be seen by Scrubs followers. It may not be in the category of spoilers. <br /> <br /> Clips shown. Hm, we all know that friends are going into the tube when they start by showing clips ... and five and a half years in Scrubs, they go and fall into that hole. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder. that The writer didn't want to write that week and said to himself that "Let's show a joke." It doesn't work. <br /> <br /> For those who start acting every time people fall, it's not a joke when taken out of context. It's not a joke to see Todd trapping a banana hammock unless we know why he hung a banana hammock. <br /> <br /> Two seconds for what should be a JD's fantasy collection. One is Peter's dream. In other words, it's not his imagination, even if I forget. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem. Now forgot We've seen these things before. And a collection of clips of people dancing? why? That's not funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to admit that my favorite two times in the final collection ... Dr. Cox realized that Ben died ... and JD Tell him that he is very proud of him. <br /> <br /> But seeing those moments again doesn't help. In conclusion, say it all. <br /> <br /> The worst episode ever. Bill Lawrence, please do not let your performance go in the same way as your friends, keep it fresh, always make it funny ... or keep it.
