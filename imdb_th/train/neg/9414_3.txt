Even though I received praise from the DVD cover of the version I borrowed But this movie was disappointing Yes, it is more true than other war movies at the time for explaining mud, boredom and irritability of the grunt. Unfortunately this movie came out of the thought that it was all there in the movie. No plot and boring conversation. Not that a good war movie must have a fight scene every five minutes. One of the best movies in World War II, "Twelve O'Clock High" has very little movement. But it compensated by crackling conversations and psychological tension Exceptions for "The story of G. Joe" is a short fight (named "City under siege" on the DVD) which occurred in Italy. Is recognized as one of the quickest and most reliable fighting scenes of war movies But alas, the rest of the film is not worth watching. For this highlight, another close is Pvt Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who intended to be "romeo" but fell out of guilt. On the other hand, Sgt Warnicki is a sympathetic person. As he spoke to Capt. Walker (Mitchum) when another volunteer patrols: "Every step forward is a step closer than ... to the house." But is that the last step? Too many patrols? Drive him across thanks Unfortunately, the rest of the film is not fair to some things that can be touched. For drawing Meredith's picture of Pyle ... it's a terrifying story
