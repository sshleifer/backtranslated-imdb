I have high hopes for this movie because I like books a lot. However, I don't think I can understand the evidence of the movie if I haven't read the book. This film is a noble effort that shows the desperation of people trying to destroy the bond of dominance of a government that has superior power. Corrupt government officials live a life of luxury almost luxurious, while the general public struggles to get the essentials to survive. Perhaps most people feel like this to their leaders and parents, whether they are oppressed or repressed or not. Orlandia's Dystopia seems to be in many places in our modern world. For many years I have read this book. But one person heard the reference to the big brother, the police, thinking and Newspeak often in the media and general dialogue There may be many people who use these words, not knowing where those words come from. I suggest you read the book.
