CRIME BOSS Directed by Alberto De Martino; Italian crime drama, partly filmed in Hamburg, Germany Easy to forget movies Despite having a good car chase sequence, this flick seems to be almost pointless timber. Don Mai conquered the powerful Mafia family and found himself fighting for his own life. The unwritten law and the ethics of the Mafia code make it difficult to trust anyone, especially with a multi-million dollar bet. Cruelty and violence mate the same way on the other hand. This thing can not be placed on the shelf with real poets. Just the appearance of the movie brought the memories back from the American car fare. Even the most popular American actor, Telly Savalas, could not increase the ability of this crime drama. Antonio Sabato also performed with: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
