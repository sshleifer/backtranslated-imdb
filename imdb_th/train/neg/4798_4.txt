* There are some spoilers * This movie is a 80s horror movie in every horror. The plot takes too long to get off the ground, never stealing itself, and then a normal problem is about 40 minutes in the movie. There are some moments of gems for zombies fans, but there are not enough zombies to truly create fear. <br /> <br /> Zombies still take a long time to create a look. First of all, there are half the movies about gangsters and prison gangs. The film's hero is a former Vietnamese veterinarian who falls into the mob. The chief mob placed him and he went to jail. In this prison, they are experimenting with prisoners to find ways to cure them from murder and crime behavior. But the mad scientist / mad scientist chief has other plans in mind. He wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to create .... da da da .... Super Soldier! After some infectious prisoners killed a few soldiers and most of the prison had an infected wine. Scientists / scientists were mad. "Hey, this can be a problem" and give the phone to a genius scientist turned a hot investigative reporter. Special babe - a powerful independent female character, of course, invented the original serum. She went to jail to see what had happened. The soldiers demanded that a few SWAT teams be in a safe position outside the prison, and the male hero takes care of a few prisoners with gold. Hero female heroes and scientists / journalists gather to find ways to cure the children of the jailer and deal with the infectious and non-infected prisoners. At the same time, the gang leader agreed to go to jail so that he could help his imprisoned brother. Soldiers are ready to bomb the place and everyone inside scrambles to find a way out. <br /> <br /> There are many blood-staged scenes that people are killed by being pressed or pulled into prison bars. There are also creepy decapitation scenes and electric scenes associated with the same Rasta prisoner. Still, the most annoying scene is at the beginning of the movie when the corrupt, nasty, raped prisoner. <br /> <br /> The main highlight of this film is one scene to the end. Hero women and children are trying to find their way to the only escape route. Their path leads them to a long hallway on one side, with a wall and another side is a prison bar. Hundreds of bloody zombie hands, through the hairs and faces, as they passed. There are also some good scenes of "A pair of zombies that chew on fresh corpses" and "Many zombies that tear a man into small pieces" <br /> <br /> Overall worth the look. The genre followed with many zombie clich√©s noteworthy; It is a real manual about things that shouldn't be done when creating a zombie movie. But if you are new to zombie flicks and want real fear, you should look elsewhere.
