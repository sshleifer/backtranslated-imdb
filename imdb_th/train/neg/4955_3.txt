In the light of Batman's brave and brave past and quite well, now is the time to endure that mistake in Batman's life. Being a big fan since Tim Burton's first revival 20 years ago, I can accept different tones in dark characters or camps. This is not reliable: too many effects, poor plans and a few questions. The wonderful thing about Batman is the variety of skills and aspects of his personality: crime detectives, playboy fighters, philanthropists, etc. Batman shows him only in karate. And by the way that penguins are capable of such things when jumping into the air, regardless of their riches, and looking at Joker, which is a mixture of Blanka in Street Fighter 2 and finished reggae man pro Which Batman fan's team can accept betrayal, not me. Batman is much better without the "The" article in front of his name.
