I just watched the scenery produced at the Seattle International Film Festival. I was drawn into the movie as a photographer because I am familiar and a fan of Burtynsky's work. While I believe that the movie works well in obtaining it as a cross message, I can't help. But felt that it was created after it was completed for the photos and popular books that followed by Burtynsky. Obviously, one reason for this is to use a comprehensive slide that has zooms and pans throughout them. While this is a good effect when used economically But I feel that 75% of this film is just a slide from Burtynsky's book (which I already have). That may be an exaggeration. But that's what I feel If you are the owner of the book or are familiar with his work, you should be better to skip this book.
