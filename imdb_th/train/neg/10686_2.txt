Please help the economy - take your money elsewhere! The synopsis of this film is: The first lady assassinated her husband because he was unfaithful to her. That was not detected by anyone except Cuba and Angie. She designed and used conspiracy to steal. Kill a lot that no one knows about ... and go out freely. <br /> <br /> Some specific issues are funny: while standing in front. The President of Cuba is a symbol of the killer of bullets ... which came behind the head of the president. <br /> <br /> Cuba and Angie watched movies from the camera and they saw ... clues. They use great effort to protect the film by believing that they are the only ones that have copies of this public movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba spoke to the PSM presidential team members, commenting that No conspiracy Cuba claims that there are more than one person involved. Then, PSM encourages the conspiracy, including the FBI, CIA and NSA. I'm wondering if it's involved with PSM. <br /> <br /> Lady Archer Number one is a fascinating artist. Cuba couldn't draw and she said "You are too close ... standing back ... looking from a different perspective, looking from my point of view." Can anyone think of that clue?
