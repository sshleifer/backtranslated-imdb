I received this movie from a private collector and wanted to know a lot about it. There are 7,8 in IMDb (9 votes only) and some external comments are good. But I must say that it is a game that is normally played and not interesting. Yes, great movies. This movie is well directed. But it didn't disappoint me It started well. But even if not bored at all, the story is very common and things that happen normally, so I don't like it a lot. <br /> <br /> You can laugh. If you like giallos like I like (strange, surreal, ridiculous, full of blood, atmosphere, brutal murder ...) you won't appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> Good governance and editing Each final twist that makes this movie enjoyable. But it may be much better
