I usually don't go out of my way to write comments. But for this I have to do to remind everyone who may think that watching this thing they will see funny. This thing didn't come close. While the evidence (changing color / sex / whatever) is not good enough (and has done better many times before), the real change of two black men is two white women, one of the changes that The least reliable happens on the screen. It won't be good enough if all the script wants is to change to a white chicks. However, the Wayans brothers must disguise themselves as two white women in particular. As you can guess, they fail completely. I saw dragging the queen without make-up, making women more confident than these two people with the best special effects and make-up that Hollywood can give. It's awesome, adding to the mix that the basketball players The ball was built like a building, a terrifying dialogue and a plot hole over the golf course, and this movie gained low popularity. And I like bad movies! Avoid like the plague.
