My name should be enough. <br /> <br /> It makes me bewildered that the rich culture of literary excellence (Mus, Flaubert, Balzac, Map Busan) is turbulent. Such as movie moves Until the 20th century, France had a great tradition of artistic clarity and intelligent philosophy. But the minute you gave the movie camera that they started to behave like voodoo, what would I be like ?! plot? format? Pooh! LET'S FILM The park is fun to ride around! At least this is not as bad as Godard (who has a passion behind the head of a bad person. Oh, Ola Lala, a quiet artist) No, Truffaut maintains the level of image clarity. But the security camera that quickie-mart does not separate either. <br /> <br /> Hahahaha, like you see everyone in the movie school: I bet that the veins are coming out on your neck right now. But don't go without reading the last sentence of my review. <br /> <br /> However, if you like French literature, you will hate this. Those who like this movie may not have read any book except Jack Kerouac's shiver or may be "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" or maybe they read the lyrics of The Doors and they think it's a movement that profound The yer floating thing. I think it's funny that this movie injects some (weak) for Balzac, one of the best and most meaningful writers who have ever lived. Try good truffles But you are not close to the ballpark. <br /> <br /> Avoid this film like a syringe that is infected with HIV. <br /> <br /> If you are a type of person who likes Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE) , Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and Japanese teacher Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA) <br /> <br /> If you are an idiot, Truffaut, Godard and Andy Worhol and for the sake of Pete pushes the veins back to your neck. You look like cabbage
