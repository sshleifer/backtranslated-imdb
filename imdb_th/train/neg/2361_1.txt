This movie is the worst of the series. Although the new line may look at sales only But they all know the only reason why making more money than ever before is due to the end of 3D. It's not that the three dimensions are good too, because it's a 50s 3D with red lenses and Blue (anaglyph) It's the fact that people want to see what it is like. Moreover, this movie is not doing well! Bad script, bad character, bad acting, worse governance This film tries to push the camp factor to almost become like "Looney Tunes". <br /> <br /> Seriously, not for the horrible audience because it looks repetitive and not scary and not funny. Amusing for the funny crowd Just a mess, combined with a really bad pendant that still tries to play all the camps and make it shorter in what they might want. <br /> <br /> I remember that most of us are girlfriend This series just prayed that it would end at this point because of how bad it was. This film is one of the movies that helps to bring horror out of popularity and builds confidence for audiences who want to laugh funny and stupid than good and scary horror movies.
