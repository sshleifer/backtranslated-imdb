This is a horrible little movie - and unfortunately, the company that made this short film made many other films. The short story is a funny idea that is not a joke that starts and may offend you. Of course, it makes me feel uneasy to see small children (mostly appearing for about 2 years), which is about pretending and pretending to be adults - in this case, girls in the dance room and patrons, bar rooms It's a joke that you might be forced to laugh at your children if they pretend to be adults. But I don't see anyone who wants to see this story - especially when the Shirley Temple is very young, dressed in a rather slippery style. Dress and act like a vampire !! Then other children act like adults in some situations that are quite mature At that time, I'm sure they didn't try to attract the pedophile's attention. But when watching today, that's what comes to mind right away! For this reason, this boring movie is crawling out and I hope not to see it again !! Beautiful, strange and very scary
