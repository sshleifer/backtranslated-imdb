I blind bought this movie and regretted that I paid as much as I could. But I would say that at least it's worth the death and laughing performances. It's not a good movie, but I have to say that I have been entertained. I think it might be called bad-good - <br /> <br /> As I said, the performance was terrible. The story is nothing new and better. I guess I have a weakness for the Carnaval-Knight movie. I'll tell you to rent or download. But don't buy it for sure It's not worth more than one watch.
