I'm watching this program on the sci-fi channel immediately. It's terrible. I can't stop watching! I am a video technician and this movie makes me sad I feel bad for everyone involved in this movie. Some cameras work well. Most are very suspicious. There are good actors in the flick. Unfortunately, they are surrounded by things that must be relatives of the director. That's the only way they'll be qualified in the movie! Music is slightly better than acting. If you watch this thing, I hope it will be because there is no other choice! The sequel (yes, sequels) is coming now .... I think I will skip it! Jason
