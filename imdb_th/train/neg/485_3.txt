When I saw the example, I thought: This would be a great movie. And of course it may be possible The actress who plays the main character is reliable and the beauty of the filming is undeniable. However, the conversation uses black shadows on the whole picture. The level of the language is too familiar and contemporary than the action scenes that occurred in the year 1610, and it caused most of the movie's magic to disappear. However, I have to congratulate the translator because the English subtitles are more delicate and more appropriate than the original French cues and may explain that this film has received a good rating!
