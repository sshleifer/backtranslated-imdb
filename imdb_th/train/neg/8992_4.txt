This is a good effort. But the person who wrote the screenplay seems to be a bit dark in what makes the zombies look cool. Not a CGI error and a software company. Actually, I'm not sure if it's a software company - I see no subtitles, so I have to guess what they are talking about. However, my point is - instead of wasting time with silly errors, why not throw more zombies and do more. 2/3 of 20 minutes, including news, announcements, bugs, some people shouting about something And to make matters worse (More boring) Most deaths occur outside the screen. I know that it's too common for movies without a budget. But then there are many impressive effects (Such a good story) which makes me wonder why the director - it's short, no one is interested.
