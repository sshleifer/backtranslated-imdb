Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Ray (Ray Win Stone) is a former criminal with problems with Alcohol and now are forming a drug habit that makes him paranoid and more likely to use family violence with his wife, Valerie (Kathy Burke), who tries to put the family together. But ended up like a doormat At the same time, her mother, Janet (Laila Morse), realizes Ray's son Billy (Charlie Reed-Miles) and the drug abuse behavior that escalates him from the trough. The movie follows the desperate characters as they flee with their lives. <br /> <br /> It is said that the British people seem to enjoy the misery and that it includes watching movies created. Entertain them in this way. Movies like Nil by Mouth emphasize this. It is a story of a broken family torn by crime, poverty, drinking and drugs. Jeremy Kyle will be like three meals of course. It is the story of a man who devastated himself by separating three generations, and each person imitating others, tearing the family apart and the woman trying to hold it together, even if not strong enough. If you pick up a little thing about what you do, you can see that it doesn't promise to look cheerful from the start, and of course it won't disappoint. <br /> <br /> It's the fact that everyone talks about acting and the stars lead Winstone and Burke, causing great performances. We saw Winstone lose it with his wife, causing her to lose consciousness after a number of coke symptoms broke down. During the telephone conversation with her and unleash an arsenal of f and c words when she refused to let him see his children. In private time, we see that Burke loses her peace to the full ladder, affecting the night before kicking. <br /> <br /> This is another movie that doesn't have a plot. To follow This is just a real life feeling of these desperate lives that continue from one day to another. It has been appreciated by many people (including Baftas!) But actually it is too scary and frigid for me. I have no right to criticize about this, knowing that I know anything about it from the location. But sadly I found it **
