Pictures are excellent and reflect the Canadian landscape as well. The story is another side that is very boring. In my eyes, it's a love story in the forest like a Titanic, a love story on a boat. I don't feel that Gray Owl is a great environmentalist. I tend to like Lord Attenborough, but this one is terrible.
