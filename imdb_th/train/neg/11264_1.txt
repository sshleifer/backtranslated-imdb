I have not decided that this will replace Anaconda as "The worst movie I have ever seen" <br /> <br /> Even if you don't care about the elusive accents, low production values ​​and shocking cameras for it. I watched it when I read the book and Want to see how they can perform complex transformations into a 2-hour movie? <br /> <br /> The simple answer is - they can't. The characters appear with a little explanation as to who they are. And then Hill played no part in the lectures. Even the main characters acted unreasonable, so at the time of this movie reaching the climax, you didn't care what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> I can accept that books sometimes have to be written New to fit Movies and it may not be fair to judge this movie with books adapted from But after my friends and I left the cinema, I had to spend a lot of time traveling home to explain what should happen. <br /> <br /> They changed the true meaning of the book name "Rancid Aluminum "by squeezing it into another pointless sound so that this movie has a cool name. <br /> <br /> The film's chaos from start to finish.
