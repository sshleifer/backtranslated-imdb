In fact, it's a scary cheat of movies. The 70 minutes of running time is full of stock images. The rest are outside scenes and interior scenes. The expression of the plot shows very poor results. All of them are scenes that are scalded into one. No attempt to choose the scene But the drama has been communicated with the violence of the actors. Please do not ask. <br /> The story involves a rocket that radiates millions of degrees orbiting the Earth at a distance of five miles that threatens Will destroy the world It is a real-time threat that needs to be diverted if the self-created H-bomb can be placed in an experimental rocket within an hour. There is nothing more here to report except the mad words by scientists to the project because there may be some life on the boat and think of scientific possibilities. But the words created by the liberal madman are past. <br /> <br /> The thing that helps this movie is quite unique is stock video. I have never seen a fighter aircraft fifty years old to choose in other films. This is not a complete list. But there are some planes that I can see There was a short interception by pilots flying in other forms of scorpions F-89 and F-86. The first thing to intercept the interceptors was the Canadian Air Force in the Hawker Hunters and F-86 Saber Jets (or Canada built CF-13s ) And even CF-100 Clunks. <br /> <br /> For some reason, B-52s, B-47s and even B36s will be removed. More expansions <br /> <br /> "Canadian jets are moving at 1200 miles per hour." I don't think so, because one of them seems to be the Tuscany era of World War II. 2 The rest of the F-80 meteorite hit the attack and became the F-84F. At the end, with the flight of wings in the beginning, the F-84s attacked in the form. <br /> <br /> There is a strange cockpit of F- 80 that doesn't seem to be a T-33 training type, but Ba This type of all-weather interceptor interim radar in the nose. These things are disturbing in a snow storm. <br /> <br /> The aircraft carrier with a view angle of 500 meters. It launches the F-8U, F-11F Tigers, A-5 Vigilantes. And the A-3 Skywarriors Air Force scrambled F-86s and F-84s and F-89s more than you have seen in your life as well as F-100 Super Sabers and F-102 Delta Daggers. <br /> <br /> The F-100s hit their attacks with a lot of space inside the F-89 tank carrying their rockets in their winged ends in the Sloo F-86s, F-102. Let the Falcons loose even the F-80s (F-94s?). Some parts that have a mid-wing rocket pod let loose. There is a strange shock of the old model F-84 (prototype) with wings at the beginning. The F-85 is above it. In another eye, it is clearly an advertisement of the manufacturer (Republic Aviation) that shows the difference between old and new. An updated version of the F-84 ThunderJet. The thing that strayed here is something that everyone can guess. <br /> <br /> There are other wonderful stock images of Ottawa in the past when the Canadian capital is the point. Wide in the streets and especially the wonderful images of the New York Times Square during one of the civil defense exercises in the early 1950s. <br /> <br /> I think we have to deal with the idea that this was filmed in Canada with the possible exception. Of the automatic chase seen in the slow picture because the Pacific image seems to be behind the use of Jowett Jupiter is quite incredible and there is a good TR 3 to agree with Canada must be cheap and quite used as a backdrop. <br /> <br /> As far as telling the true story of this movie, there is very little to suggest it apart from the mystery of Ellen Parker. Give your finger to the end of the picture. And of course, you are turning people away. Is it possible? R In Robert Loggia, the director who died before the film was released? Her career because this is her last credit <br /> <br /> It's like a newspaper that presents gifts that are worth more than souvenirs.
