I rarely comment online about movies. But I don't understand how this happens. Who do they think they can create documentary films? They did a weekend course at the school. Some movies received a big examination from their father and kidnapped David Badiel's family one by one until he agreed to stay there. Or that he had the opportunity to be friends with family / long-term relationships that made this thing out of mercy I don't care, don't want to know Even though he was most shy But muttering his wrinkles and hiding his face from the camera At the same time, DOP must be a gangster from the neighbors. It seems that there is no design, sound, script, direction and correction. All are grateful and quite frankly indifferent to me Spend some time in my life thinking about this movie.
