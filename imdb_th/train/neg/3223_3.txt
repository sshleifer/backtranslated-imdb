Lol! Not a good way to start I think this is original. But then I discovered that it was a clone of the conspiracy of the year. 1976. I never saw KING KONG until I was 15 years old. I saw this movie when I was 9 years old. The funky disco music of the movie is stuck in your head! Not to mention the music of the movie by Yetians. This is the worst monster effect I have ever seen. At the same time, the film is still the holy grail of the memorable B-word movie: "Take a sedative and go to bed." "Put the Yeti in your tank and you have a Yeti power. Watch this movie in MOVIE MACRABE that Elvira hosts. There is one scene where it is like KING KONG in return! In KING KONG, he grabbed a girl and climbed into the building. But in this movie, he climbs up the building and grabs the girl. (Falling)! In addition, in that year there was another clone, KONG MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977), which came from Hong Kong. There are travel matte scenes and body parts that use the engine. This movie will make you laugh. It's like I said, just imitating KING KONG, rated PG for violence, language, specific elements and some horrifying scenes.
