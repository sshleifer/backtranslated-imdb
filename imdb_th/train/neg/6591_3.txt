That is the sound of Stan and Ollie spinning in the grave. <br /> <br /> I won't disturb the film's basic flaws because they clearly see that they go without saying anything. This small thing is "Laurel and Hardy's new adventure". Despite the stars that have been dead for thirty years when it was created, such little things <br /> <br /> A bad idea is to have an actor play a clown at the page. The course was called Laurel and Hardy. It may work well. For a really bad idea, try to select two actors to imitate your partner. Okay, they may claim to be nephews. But the end result is the same. <br /> <br /> Bronson Pinchot can be a joke. Okay, forget the foreign stranger "Larry Cousin" schtick in Perfect Strangers and see him in True Romance. Although here he has a foul odor. May not be all his fault, and just like the director and sponsor - everyone who is better than the content - he may be desperate to get money There are people who claim to be Americans, find it difficult to specialize in using an effective English accent. This cause is not helped here by Pinchot Stan. What is Wales? Iran? Pakistan? Only in Stan's trademark yell. He came close, though, while singing too much, to the point of being boring, nothing to write to the house. Gailard Sartain did a little better than Ollie. This - stepping into the dog's ground or kicking into the knee? <br /> <br /> Remember the origin with a two-second break, easy-to-use teamwork and natural cuteness? Replaced by two old men and a joke, so you can park the bus through the gap While the manuscript has a plot that can be summed up in two panels. (And the name that has a punch!) Mixed with the story of the brotherhood of boys I can't claim to watch all the movies of Laurel and Hardy 108, but I think it's a safe solution that even their lowest point is the previous league. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main problem is The manuscripts were arranged to be played by themselves or at least using their accents. At least giving a natural and powerless feeling compared to the caricature that has been invented Pinchot and Sartain, and since then Stan has done something wrong and many more at that time? "I will give you a cremation stand"; "I want to marinate my friend" Stop! <br /> <br /> The only memorable moment is a reference to Bozo the Clown, a cartoonist who shared the L & H comics of Larry Harmon. Of course, Harmon purchased the title rights. (Makes it awkward to see Â® after Laurel and Hardy) and is the co-director and producer of this imitation. <br /> <br /> Many questions Stan and Ollie will Do you make a fart sound if they are still alive today? Will they make mummies and broken bottles? Stan was hit on the penis with a spear and ended up in a great CGI-finale? I hope I can't. <br /> <br /> I laugh once. But I think it's unbelievable how bad it is. Why is this movie going on first? The creator thinks who will like it? It may be the worst movie I have ever seen. Hate that I didn't watch after the first five minutes. About as much fun as getting your head stuck in the middle, while red hot poker and nettles are forced to insert your back
