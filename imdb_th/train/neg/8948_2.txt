'Ninteen Eighty-Four' is a film about the future society that the government controls all things and no one can trust. It's a very dark movie and a movie that won't make you feel good about yourself. It's about the love that happens in this society and the betrayal of lovers and about human nature. This film has a very good concept and is well done in drawing this society in dark tones. (Compared to happiness and bright colors in dreams) and the general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places However, despite the ingenuity of the movie showing this idea, the film is very slow and doesn't seem to understand the idea. Seems to spend too much time to be smarter than telling a story
