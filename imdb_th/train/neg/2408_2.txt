This movie is about a new generation of scientists who have created a serum that makes the dead alive again. He used it with his brother for the first time when he was shot dead in the car. His brother is infected with other gang members. In some scenes, zombies will see walking very slowly and in other scenes they run very fast. The show is normal. But the story doesn't help the movie Makeup consists of blood on the face of zombies. The budget for this movie, I'm sure there are a lot of restrictions. I believe that this movie is better if the story is more original and has a better budget If you don't see a good zombie flick, don't see this one.
