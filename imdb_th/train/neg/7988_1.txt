Anita and I seem to be more than just an excuse for Meera Syal, the author of novels and screenplays for prejudice against injustice, frustration and general hatred for her English. The general sentiment of India above England in this film is foul. <br /> <br /> British people in this film have overweight, violent, violent, foul mouths, promiscuous, engaging in Neglecting children, stupid, without education The cynical class, poor eating and dim - just change the Indian culture. Local priests will be "redeemed" at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the other hand Indian families are beautiful, intelligent, educated, able to speak many languages, be caring and loving parents and be animal feed in high school. The film has a terrible prejudice until I am surprised that the BBC has received a scholarship. If it is another British family in an Indian community that explains this way, this movie will be seen as a racist. br /> There are times when my eyebrows are rising up the forehead. I think it will be in my hair. First, the gossip scene between women in the celebration of Divali - extra words: English is dirty and promiscuous - and men - commands: English women are prostitutes Secondly, the meal with Anita, which Neema's family said to her about knives - Knowledge: English is so stupid. You can make them do anything. <br /> <br /> But insulting. Towards English - even English. Wedding is a nasty thing - obviously all the way through the movie Anita's character was drawn horribly - almost as a fallen woman - I felt that the film ended in anger. <br /> <br /> This is not "Bend like Ben. Hamham "where humor focuses on love Exaggeration of the behavior and traditions of the community from someone in that community and a film about two girls from different backgrounds combined Anita and I seem to convey that the pattern of apartheid is inevitable because English is almost an untouchable version of Indian castes, and this is emphasized by a thin attack of "Other" community: English <br /> <br /> I feel that Anita and me are a job full of hate. On that basis, the BBC should not give money to support production.
