Home Alone is the first movie that is good enough ... The sequel is quite the same in the new scene. This one is trying to be original and successful to a certain extent ... Of course, the formula is the same, so it's like watching the same movie for the third time with a slight change. The new score is quite bad. (Although parts The new "trap setting" is if nothing is interesting and different), especially compared to the grandest score of the first score and the score is almost But not as good as it should be. Second, it's (almost) made by using songs that are not quite original. But it is not the same The story is fair and quite original of the franchise. But in general, it is still the same movie as the first movie, the second, with worse performances and less impressive examples of scary characters. Most performances are not impressive. Most characters are caricatures. The new bandit is less entertaining than the old one. (And they enjoy spying, which is almost criminals because of the great spy flicks that limit the fact that there are more (And more traps) are just a weak effort in trying to go one higher than the first two movies ... and it doesn't work The idea behind the robbers and their mission is the same ... Adult and serious for children's movies (and there are sexual jokes or two stories. But that's not the first time in the series). It is unnecessarily complex, just like a typical plot. I can follow But I wonder if the child can do it Some expressions are clearly delivered that even children may feel stupid. In general, animal things are not fun. There are fewer brothers and sisters, which should mean that more developed people But they have less personality than the least important of the first two movies In conclusion, it is not that it looks good or worth it unless you like to see criminals who are injured by cartoon violence. I recommend this to the big fans of the series only. 3/10
