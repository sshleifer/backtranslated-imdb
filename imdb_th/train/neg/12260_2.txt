Sometimes I take a break and think about why movies about killer sharks and / or crocodiles still occur today. They have created these "jaws" since the 70s. Not that they are getting more popular. This concept remains the same in all respects. So we have animals that start killing people. The first time it came down to some characters that followed, then began to attack. The main characters are usually played by two nobles, except for those who were once more famous. One of the main characters will often die before anyone else kills animals, often exploding. Then we often get the last shot that we see that the animal is still alive or laying eggs, etc. "Krocodylus" generally uses too many similar ideas. If you don't count the fact that "Expert" is a captain in this style. In this case, your standard is quite low. It's funny that he played by Duncan Regehr. But he likes to be Zorro. All I will give bonus points to it.
