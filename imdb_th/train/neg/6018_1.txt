I find it sad that Christians. (And I am one) felt that we had to make movies like "Leave behind" We have a much better story to say that there is no need to preach. I'm very disappointed with this movie. As a committed filmmaker who believes in Christ, I see that this film is a perfect example for what I would not do with a career in movies.
