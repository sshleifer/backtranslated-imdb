Okay .. This is not the worst movie I have ever seen. But I've heard many good things about it and I was very disappointed. I can see where the filmmakers come from, and they try to show the fact that both sides of this fight are not completely different from others, that people are lost in battle, etc. etc. (ie My assumption, however = ^ _ ^ =) <br /> <br /> Whatever the reason, the movie makes me bored. I have watched movies that are very long, but this seems to be dragging around .. in general, because I can't make the characters interested. I'm just thinking anyway .. Who cares ??? I found that the show was quite dead and the conversation was stressful. I understand that this is the 1800s and all, but most conversations seem unnatural. It seems that no one has any emotions throughout the story except during this kind of event. <br /> <br /> "Love" in the story doesn't seem to be supported by anything other than "I am a man and You are a woman "Which I did not consider love But I felt that I was being led to the belief that these people were in love. "All the horror that surrounds us, we have each other to be attached to" what is printed or whatever. I hope to have the power between the two best friends. (Which both seemed to be interested in that woman at first) but that was a downfall May avoid the love triangle. I don't know. <br /> <br /> Ah .. Daniel Holt is the only character I really like. And Su Lee is okay. I don't like Jake, but he seems too ... innocent. I guess. Jack Bull, I don't care at all. And I'm pretty sure you should hate everyone else, except the poor ordinary people who have just been cut left and right It is beautiful graphics and makes "The horror of the war" has been exhausted, but I have seen many other movies that have the same theme to do better (I like The Patriot very much, although it has a slight mood swings) but as I have already said. What can I say? :)
