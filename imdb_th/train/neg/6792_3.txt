This is a movie that has good actors and places that look good. But it still does not exist Director Richard Brooke had to be exhausted during this time of the game. His professionalism is better than this! The remaining horses and action seem to be slow to move, even when the scene is not moving. This film needs to speed up if anything. The horse looks very scary to me and the tire marks that are clearly visible during the desert track - lazy, sloppy work. Very bad. But I see everyone doing better Although Ben Johnson is always happy I saw this flick for the first time almost 30 years ago. I was disappointed at that time and remained so when I watched the second time 30 years later.
