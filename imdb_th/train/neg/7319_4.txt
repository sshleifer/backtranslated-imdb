When you reach the scene involving Albert Brooks without his shirt ... try not to shut your mouth with a furry <br /> <br /> I like Albert Brooks. I've watched the most if it's not all his movies. But it was the first time seeing this movie. Modern Romance is an interesting story about love. There are some movies that deal with desperate or romantic love, even in the year 1979 at Chilly Scenes of Winter. Both of them dealt with men who were more passionate than being attracted to their hearts / obsessed with their women. <br /> <br /> In which the Chilly scene of the winter border in this film is stalked. according Of love because both are already related .. and go out of the relationship .. and come back again. <br /> <br /> And since it was a movie that was released in 1981, it was time for Terms of form and such That's the main reason I like this movie.

She may pull the hair out of her teeth for many days. After that, <br /> <br /> However, it's an ok movie. It would be better if I didn't see Albert Brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 minutes in a row because it would allow me to watch this movie.
