Warning: The investigation has a dangerous spoiler. <br /> <br /> A couple of years back, I tried to watch the first five films in this franchise and plan to make an overview of All Elm St. series, however, only two years and I find that I do not remember about them enough to do it or not? I think they can't make much impression. From what I can remember some parts of the sequel? The dream warrior in particular? Not as bad as it is often done, even if the original is not classic. In general, the ability to predict the location (If a person falls asleep because of being killed in a dream) does not give tension to the storytelling. But while I do not remember much from the first five films, I know that they never dive deep into Freddy's Dead. <br /> <br /> The indication that Freddie's sick has reached the point. How can this The fact that the film was promoted in the death of the character The fact that the film's conclusion is not hidden But in reality, the whole purpose of this film is to show soullessness and disdain for this business. <br /> <br /> The use of morally questionable ideas. The child molested himself as a talented villain. The interpretation of Robert Engeland was not scary with laughter. I tend to think that Freddie's ridicule in teenage victims is less focused on characters than teen viewers who can watch this rag. It's as if Englund is crying. "Do we know that this is garbage? But you pay to see it. Who is laughing? "And I'm sure that the victims of child abuse are discouraged to see images without feeling of their fate. Is Freddie's appearance in the movie always a fundamental matter? What he received from doing here is "haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr ?? har ?? harars" and that is, if this is the only Elm St. movie that you have seen, you will not know the characters at all. Even when the pre-cast character dies in the film, the backward Englund plays as a pantomime villain-hector with the clash of Transatlantic (Eg bragging, wrong, and not funny). Acting <br /> <br /> Poor at the international level. Just see how many times Breckin Meyer did his hand gestures and body language. Only Kananga. His And when Rosanne, Tom, Arnold, and Alice Cooper appeared, you almost clearly saw the film sink into the mud. The script is almost totally disgusting, without having to do anything. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map in which the coordinator Freddie Choir is like a coward. " You are f ** ked. "When prompted for the map, Carlos replied," The map is good. Say we are f ** ked. "Who wrote the screenplay for Oscar Wilde <br /> <br /> or the scene? That Carlos was tortured by Freddie. His hearing developed to the level that Jae Pain? So Freddie tortured him by threatening to place a needle? Sounds that can be fatal because all sounds are amplified The fact that Carlos yelled at his voice in order not to fall, seems to have no effect. "Heard well from Carlos," Freddie expects to have some better chapters. It is also worth noting that sleeping in dreams does not occur naturally, so being unconscious will not allow access to Freddy's world immediately. Although part of the lecture includes human computer games and the storyline logic, the final three-dimensional scene is not very high on the specification list. <br /> <br /> The teenager heading to the actor this time is the most nasty. The group that doesn't like the whole set, Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only person to greet Freddy with "Close f ** k up the guy" and kick in the scallop. And the incompatible pop music is always part of the mix? Freddy's Dead doesn't have laughter No fear No interest, no fun. <br /> <br />
