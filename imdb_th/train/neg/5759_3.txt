This is the third parody of the horrible movie and hopefully be the last one. Now, most of the spoofs are in The Ring, Signs and 8 Mile. For strange reasons, in my opinion, this movie is pointless and unnecessary and not funny. I might laugh three times and that's not enough for comedians. I'm happy with the first two. But this one is stupid. If your joke consists of corpses that are beaten and people throwing at each other continuously, this movie is for you. In my opinion, if you are smart enough to stay home and save money and stop making these types of movies, they are getting worse. 3/10
