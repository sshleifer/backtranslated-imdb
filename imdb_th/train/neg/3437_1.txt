I watched this movie yesterday I have to admit it's not my cup of tea. Although it should be a horror movie of it But when I watched this thing, I was thinking .. 'This movie doesn't have any reason.' Where did this man in the black coat come from? Where are the two men going when they leave the girl behind? Where does the shark come from on earth? <br /> <br /> Not all elements in this movie are included. I feel like these filmmakers wasted time and money on movies that were bound to it. <br /> <br /> I've seen many good horror movies at this time. The worst horror movie I've ever seen. At the end of this movie, I told myself that I wouldn't watch anymore .. The performance was very happy. In this movie, I decided to give a finger! Count me with this! 0 out of 10!
