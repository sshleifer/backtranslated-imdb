I entered the movie theater with Sky Captain in 2004, expecting a good movie. Almost every film review has a positive effect. The effects look attractive, reliable examples. <br /> <br /> There is no need to speak. The disappointment doesn't really explain the feeling I have. Received from this movie It is anger. <br /> <br /> In addition to being boring and badly written, the reason for this film is getting 2 out of 10 stars because everything in this movie is stolen from other sources. I understand the difference between showing respect and stealing: this is a steal. More importantly, it seems that filmmakers don't steal points or move points. They steal to show that they can. There is no point to show the clip of The Wizard of Oz in the movie theater at the beginning of the movie except for setting other scenes. (Which I will not do thoroughly) which stole from the same movie Needless to say, all the concepts in the movie are not original or even rotated in the old concept: it is just to improve what I have seen from the pulp era robots that are reminiscent of old superman cartoons and the latest film "The Iron Giant "For the evil martial arts artist of the villain that has been used in countless movies that have been known most in recent years. Came as Darth Maul in "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace" <br /> <br /> The true story of the film, mainly made of wood. Perhaps this is because all the movies were created on a blue screen with computer images packed in everything that helped the actors. This is an excuse for a bad performance. If a person used to be a child, they understand that without reference to that image there is no excuse not to try. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is no humanity in the movie. this story The protagonist is the only real human being here. Almost all the enemies are robots and the number of friendly characters displayed during the movie can be counted by one hand. If the robot is attacking the whole world, we should not expect to see humanity running away from them or The main character's sub-performances make us unable to connect with anything here. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the worst movie, that's why I didn't give 1. This movie is an example of something. Wrong with modern action movies: filmmakers try to prove that this movie has special effects. But without any artistic vision or initiative
