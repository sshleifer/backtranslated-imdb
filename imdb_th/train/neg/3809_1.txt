This list is very annoying !!! I feel sorry for the actors who have to try to be funny (especially Bob Saget). Laughing tracks try to cover up the sad jokes and the "Awwww" tracks happen at the most unnecessary times. Especially the Olsen Twin In addition, this show is an ancient city. If you have to search for ancient words, then read "Full House". Every story has a "life lesson" to learn at the end. Meaningful words make everything better and still have the ability to make the most impatient child aware of the sudden goodness of GASP. Too bad this is impossible in real life I do not know how people can watch this program without interrupting the character's behavior or laughing tracks. I found myself shouting at the TV. "That's not funny / sad / cute." If life is like this, the world will break.
