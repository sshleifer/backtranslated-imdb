This movie is hilarious, not in a good way. The fight is not good, as sometimes they will try to scare you by destroying the bones and even this thing happens only two or three times, not enough to call it shockmovie. Can walk into the open field with 10 people shooting him with uzi, pick up the gun, start to shoot back and not hurt. <br /> <br /> The story is empty. The guy wakes up, causing his memory to disappear. Began fighting because that's what he's done. Five years later, the memories of revenge blablabla <br /> <br /> Not worth your money, not worth your time unless you get drunk and bored.
