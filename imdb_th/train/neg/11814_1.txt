Back in that day, I remember seeing the Nintendo Energy Dumb comics with works of art like this one ... then there was a word that this program was coming near to television! I'm not a fanatic But curious ... I want to know how bad this program is. All my friends say that this program has no real meaning and is too stupid for straight people like me (I'm really gay) so I decided to watch the program with low expectations. <br /> <br /> What an awesome experience !!!!!!!!!!! First of all, I hate new characters. Tiff and Tuff are very stupid, and I hate that many boy fans pouring in to Tiff. It's sad. I hate that they created Chef Kalazaki. (Or his unnamed name) is a good person who is a restaurant owner. Can not move well. 4Kids TV! Escargoon is nothing but a consultant of the King Dedede loser (who sucked big on this program) and me Hate the face of a company that is supplying Dedede with those horrible weapons to destroy Kirby. Stupid. I hate this show. <br /> <br /> Then I started to hate Kirby even more because it was obvious. That Nintendo Just got a pain when popular in Kirby. Kirby will not win Mario in the fight for coolness and Kirby will not have anything except the small cream of gay NUF SAID !!!
