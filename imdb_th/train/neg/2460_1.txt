I really want to like this movie. But it never gave me a chance Basically it will be a Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme. But it failed miserably It feels like being written and executed by high school students for some school projects and that is a level that should be humorous. There is no subtlety and even more shame for the ridicule. It never feels like a documentary. And while the lines are not funny at first, the efforts to deliver Dead-pan will help. - Of course, anything is better than howling beyond the fact that we are being subjected. People who like "comedies" in the veins of "Big Momma's House" or "Norbit"; People who think that the word "smash" is funny. Others should stay away and not waste time.
