It's hard to watch this movie. CGI for dragons is well done. But lacking a suitable model for light and shadow Moreover, the same image was used endlessly by dragons that walked through a slightly boring path. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see "Marcus Aurelius" in the credit of the show. In the past, the Empire was performing in this movie! Like "Whoopie Goldberg", it must be an alias and one can blame him for using one. If he appears in this stinker, <br /> <br /> The story may be interesting. But the show is flat and the direction is boring. If you have to watch this movie, go to your friend's house and get drunk while doing so - it's fun.
