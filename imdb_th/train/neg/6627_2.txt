What happened to RGV? He seems to repeat himself in every movie. Does he have all the creativity? If he has time to sit in the back seat Going to the movies with great expectations - of course, I never thought it would be close to the original. I know it won't be a promotion, say it all. But even then I thought it would be a great RGV treatment. After that, he wasn't the same person who directed Sathya and the company? Or is he? I have a question after watching Aag. I'm not going to talk about the story or most of the story from the original. If you're dying to see it, you can play fun games with friends: specify scenes from the original. One and give your own rating! Therefore, Veeru became Heero (is it repetitive?), Guessing Heeru would not sound like that. Ajay Devgan is quite disastrous when Heero is humorous and blurred conversations that are really effective in the company. Fake chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) does not exist. In fact, even more charming, Nisha tries to become a nuisance. She becomes Reached the peak at the end Rajasthan, in fact, is not bad compared to others. He is a future watcher. I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as a Babban. He looked like a parody of Gabbar Singh. There was a scene where he was drinking something from a bowl covered with a shawl instead of fearing that he was begging with a bowl. The only outstanding performance was Mohalal as a Narasimha inspector. I fear that I do not have the patience to write more.
