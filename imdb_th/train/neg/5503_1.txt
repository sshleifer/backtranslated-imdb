I grew up watching traditional TV series during the sixties, and one thing I can tell you right away is no comparison. This film is totally ridiculous with the live pilot set. Mars with different shapes A special effect that looks like something that a small child would create The only highlight in this film is yes. There really happened when Ray Walston finally appeared. He wears black glasses and refers to life on this planet for 30 years to show respect for the TV series. However, the true uncle Martin was unable to help this turkey.
