This is the worst documentary to come out of Canada !!!! I'm glad to see them not making another movie. What they want to do is create a movie and don't have to be a movie they write. They change the script to suit the person they are pitching. I couldn't leave the theater fast enough when I saw at the Toronto Film Festival that year. Please do not watch this movie.
