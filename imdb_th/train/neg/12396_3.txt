There are many good things to say about Underneath. Soderbergh's unreasonable efforts in the neo-noir Soderbergh remaking Criss-Cross. Robert Siodmak's good noir, faithfully, does not change the plot very much. This will drain the atmosphere of every film noir every ounce, making it the same thing in the atmosphere. The least interesting places, way of life and popular times, Soderbergh, which will later create great crime movies like Out of Sight and a series of oceans with a style and good atmosphere, must use a clear path that is harmful to creation. New things by improving the story with the most ugly fashion in the early 1990s. The nightclub has a band, a garage that is disgusting and boring. Burt Lancaster's heroic roast of Peter Gallagher is left by his executioner, who remains in the purchase of modern appliances such as cinemas such as stereo, TV and other modern equipment from movies. <br /> < br /> It's more fun and less boring if getting a few points, such as a better score, more texture for a character than just William Fichtner that shows bad performances. Not sharper Unfortunately, underneath these things, Soderbergh, the good director, didn't take advantage of his anxiety at this time. Such management worked amazingly when he helped the crime movie with more tongue in the cheek like George Clooney's image mentioned earlier or social drama or character such as traffic or sex. Lie and videotape With movies like Underneath, it will make the audience feel bored
