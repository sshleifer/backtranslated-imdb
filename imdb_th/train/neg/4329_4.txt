I will never forget the great wit and humor of the original holiday movie! The timeline and timing of the events in the movie are outstanding! However, the continuation of this European holiday is very important. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, Griswalds won the European holiday in the game list. The problem is that many jokes in this movie are less than that. "Haha" laughs. For example, Flight Attendant on the plane asked Clark. "Do you want your coke in the can?" Clark replied. "No, I'll bring it here." That is about a single line that is funny in this movie. <br /> <br /> European Vacation humor is stressful as if the writer had borrowed all the jokes from the first movie. Trying to re-hash the script and rely on the chase scenes that are ridiculously ticking to the end of the picture to kill time. <br /> <br /> The worse, more natural cartoons like Randy Quaid in Cousin Eddie and the original children playing Rusty and Audrey from the first movie, nowhere to be found Their transition is not a joke, cannot be done, and it seems that they are doing things that are constantly moving. There are also vulgar sex jokes and opinions that are not only But not funny, they still have bad tastes. <br /> <br /> Griswald should be in Wally World, a place that makes them legendary! Do not join them on a scary adventure in Europe. Viewers should watch the original holiday movie instead of this! You will be glad you did.
