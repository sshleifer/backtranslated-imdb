This dirt is almost impossible to follow. Shit, image quality starts from bad to worse, worse again! Things happen because no reasoning characters appear and disappear. Does the director suffer a big brain injury during production? <br /> <br /> The poor movie that has been left behind is only a terrible evil. Sh * t If you like rape, murder and Hurt yourself alley, and if the scene of the murder scene is not enough, you can enjoy clips of real people who were executed I watched it almost all But had to shut down after I saw some brains blowing out Previously I had seen movies that made me feel ashamed and dirty.
