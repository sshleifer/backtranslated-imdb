I know many of Ben Stiller's films are going to be released or will be released this year. But maybe he should confirm the quality, not quantity. <br /> <br /> I was stunned by what the filmmakers thought. "<br /> <br /> Stiller's Ruben is awesome. Stunning and one of the worst performances of the year, Stiller's Schtick is boring. He undoubtedly has comic abilities, but he must find another schtick or take a break to find really funny content. Because his movie starts with no pain, no sense of humor until badly bleed. <br /> <br /> There is no chemical reaction between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is embarrassing because of her. Is a smart actress and has a good career As long as she continues to make more movies such as "The Good Girl" (which she's excellent) and doesn't like "Along Came Polly", she'll have a career that she will be proud of. <br /> <br /> Aniston tries. With the utmost ability to overcome the limp material she is working on But it is a scary job for any actress Except for a moment with Alex Baldwin as the leader of Reuben and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Reuben's best friend, there is nothing funny in this horrible movie. Other supporting characters include Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria. As Claude is annoying, Azaria's accent is not only But only stupid <br /> <br /> The location of "Along Came Polly" shows promise. Unfortunately, it needs a writer who can make it a good joke instead of a boring, boring and boring excuse for a comedy.
