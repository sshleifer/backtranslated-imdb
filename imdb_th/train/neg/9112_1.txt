Basically Cruel Intentions 2 is Cruel Intent 1 again. The story is the same as the first story. (Even some lines) with a few exceptions The actors are not known more and have fewer abilities. Instead of being fascinated and inducing me to watch it, I felt dirty because it was compared to watching porn movies soft. I'm not sure whether to blame the lines of some actors or writers and I felt bad to say because I knew it. Hard to do both Waste an hour in my life Indeed, it surprised me that some movies were created and this is not an exception ... I can't believe that they will create a third movie.
