The Alexandre Aja remake of Alexandre Aja is one of the bright spots of 2006, not just a classic horror film rebuilt. But it is quite good as well So almost a year later, we are being treated because of that remake. While the original writer Wes Craven returned to be a producer and scriptwriter, the film failed to reach the level determined by the original and the remake of a group of military trainers. Visit the desert to check-in scientists. Some people and found themselves fleeing from mutant families from the first film (At least those who are still with new people) There are many blood that must come here. What annoyed me about this movie is the lack of character features. The audience didn't give a damn about what happened to these people because we didn't go in. Even the mutants had the last appearance and this time nothing happened. Blood for the sake of pointless blood There must be a reason for this to happen in order to be interesting. Nothing happened here. Interesting. Recently, there was a rape scene in the movie. Here we still have another reason that is not true. Hope this is a series of hills that will not be visited again.
