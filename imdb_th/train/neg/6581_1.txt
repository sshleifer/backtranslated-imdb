I rent a "new best friend", hoping to have a movie that is like a fun teen thriller, such as "Gossip" and "The Curve", but "New Best Friend" is like "The In Crowd" without excitement And the show is incredibly fake "New best friend" is boring and the events between movies are the same. Skip this movie ... it's a waste of time.
