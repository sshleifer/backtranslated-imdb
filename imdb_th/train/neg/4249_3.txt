I never knew that this movie existed until shortly after seeing Blade: Trinity. I was busy with the Trinity committee when I saw some users mention that Wes Craven's series was much better. ' Shit 'at Blade, doing my quick research: check the scores on IMDb & RottenTomatoes for Dracula: Ascension and somewhere in search. I found this to be a sequel to Dracula 2000. I also noticed that inside Wes Craven Dracula board There are really strong followers for this movie, which is in conflict with the scores I have seen. <br /> <br /> Now let's come to the conclusion of privacy here. I remember seeing Dracula 2000 and I couldn't remember. Then I saw Dracula's score: Ascension reduced my expectations a lot. But then again, I am the type of person who truly wants to watch movies. (Any movie) so that I can express my own opinion. <br /> <br /> Two things I know when I start watching this movie are that it has a low budget, so because I will go. Have to ignore v / fx and think that it will be compensated by the story and the show. I was slightly impressed by the casting in this movie (Jason London, Roy Schieder and Jason Scott Lee) <br /> <br /> Oh geez ?? This movie is CHEESY! But at least I can have fun. I found it to be ridiculous and bad sound from recording the dialogue in the FEW scene. The stupidity of the characters in this movie. Of course, they all know about vampires and some basic things. Luke also has books. But does it make them not want to be infected? No, this is the worst thing, and it's hard to hit the girl to leave the shower and check the sound that she hears nothing more than a towel. <br /> <br /> I have to blink. At some point Because I'm not sure how 'Dracula' has clothes on his body, especially since he is a big and angry person, and I think that if I was in that situation, I wouldn't want to be the person to dress him. > <br /> So the movie ends like a central film about a trilogy? It's not 'Cliff Hangar' instead. Now I have to wait for 'Legacy', Episode 3 Oh, the value of the entertainment of the Cheesy movie.
