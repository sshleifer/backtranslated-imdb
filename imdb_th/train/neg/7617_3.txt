It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But the hostel is much worse This movie is more funny and ridiculous than scary. I laugh almost always when watching it. Low quality effects (When you look, you will understand what I'm talking about and how low the quality is). (I heard them for the first time) and it looks like it was shot by an amateur. Camcorder (So ​​it looks more like a TV show than a movie) but at least I have the patience to watch it till the end. Like a comedy? Look at it. Want a horror? Go see Ju-On: The Grudge or another horror movie. <br /> <br /> If I'm talking about the Legend of Diablo, I don't know if I can classify it as a horror genre or not. Only a low budget shit. <br /> <br /> I rate 3 out of 10.
