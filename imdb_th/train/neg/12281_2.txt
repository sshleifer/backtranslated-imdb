When hearing about watching this drama, I decided to watch it when I stumbled through the cable. I do not see how these women "get rid of" and "their struggles", focusing on topics that are similar. I guess if you are interested in a story about a woman's personal parts and how it affects their lives. Otherwise, it is quite boring and boring. If anything, I found it a bit embarrassing. <br /> <br /> I asked a girl friend who was watching this story and she thought it was scary as well. So not just men who "don't understand"
