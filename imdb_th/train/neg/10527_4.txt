I discovered this movie with a retailer selling OOP and this is definitely an OOP. One year after The Exorcist, she came back to do business with this movie. But what we all know is that Blair's career has never broken. She has never become a star. That's one of the reasons why many of her films are OOP. She gave good results in this movie. It's about denying that her parents didn't know and had no friends at all. Played at the age of 15, playing with 14 girls, that's a joke This film is well known in the rape scene in the shower because they stick to her pure broom. In most versions that have been cut, why don't I know there is no blood involved? Okay Blair is naked. But nothing shows without T&A so there is nothing to offend people But the movie is very slow Usually I'm not happy. But I almost felt a deep sleep It's just about 14 years old, becoming a rebellious society. But there is no blood flow, no piercing, nothing Why is this in the horror genre still a miracle for me? If you are a big fan of Blair, you can buy it if you find it, otherwise leave it.
