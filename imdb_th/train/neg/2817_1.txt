Tobe Hooper may be the greatest horror song. Like other horror fans, I love Texas Chainsaw, but I think in order to put your name in the movie name, you should have more than one hit movie. I can't think of other movies that Hooper has done. (On his own, do not count Poltergeist) that affect the horror genre or the film world And this movie, Night Terrors, just back up my point. <br /> <br /> Poor Robert Englund. I give him credit. He did what he could. For this movie? Pure delirium Unnecessary nude scenes every five minutes are stories that have to be written in our scenes and are scary scenes, music and movies. Nothing in this movie can be redeemed. Don't waste time. <br /> <br /> Overall, 1 out of 10 I feel sorry for Hooper. His career seems to end before it really starts. I hope he can flick a good flick at least one way that he can show justice status. <br /> <br />
