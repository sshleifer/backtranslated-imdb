"The fallen man" is under the garbage category (WOL). I am sorry that I am now more than two hours without entertainment. My other family members also watched this movie and commented on the screen and realized the mummies. I feel sorry for the actor (Wagner). I have read other negative reviews and cannot add anything else to this movie unless it is reduced to 25 minutes, so it may take 30 minutes on the TV. Do not lose any parts. It reminds me of dishes that have many good ingredients. But when served is not fresh In my humble opinion, the mummy 42 feet should be 8-10 feet in size and improve the plot by bringing mystery and replacing him with many people who want to revoke the facts and want DNA samples for evil reasons. The hero is disgraced and thrown by their ears. Later, after all things were evil and drunk Heroes will save everyday life and prove that everyone is wrong.
