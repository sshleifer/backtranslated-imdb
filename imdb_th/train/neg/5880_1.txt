The movie starts to slow down when we go to the movies. We think it looks quite good. But after about 5 minutes, we were all tired of our thoughts and wondered what kind of movie we would watch. I didn't like this movie and The best part of the night was when the alarm and fire returned because the project was broken because we thought we were all able to go home. This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Are we tired of it? And most people in the cinema actually RAN out of the door at the end because it's garbage I was surprised that no one walked out earlier. If you go to see it, make sure you have something that will keep you busy. It's better. Don't watch it.
