Horror movie 2 is a very disappointing story. Just reference movies like Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to jokes. The film was well-launched with white people who liked the rap scene and the great use of James Woods and Andy Richter. The movie plunged unfortunately. The performance is terrible. Tori Spelling looks and goes out completely. The movie looks hacking together and is surprisingly slow. Some longer gags in this snail movie relate to the joints and movies Tom Cruise said earlier, funny to everyone in my theater. The movie thank you for coming to a stop at 83 minutes in the end that is not shocking. (I was shocked to say that the ending didn't end with a joke.) I didn't know what to say, except that it was a hasty sequel that made Miramax more income on the back of a stupid teenager. Overall, the movie is not very good.
