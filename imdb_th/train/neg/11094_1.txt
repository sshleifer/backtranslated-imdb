This movie is another story that is in the movie program that doesn't have to worry about seeing it 40 years ago as a teenager. Stay up late to do so. It's very annoying to find that romance is about 95%, 4% everything else, 1% history, if so It's what I call the victim and change one movie with an interesting name. The real movie is deception. This is a story that should be treated at a good movie theater level. This movie almost insulted those who served. The real members of Lafayette Escadrille did not escape from the law or were the product of an improper home. They were in fact the idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I wonder how many people come from the upper background than Tab Hunter's character The flight school is not for the wise alecks and knows that it is everything, such as a person who shows that here will not last for two days. It will be either infantry or infantry. The discipline in the French army is quite severe. In short, another Hollywierd version of the historical episode that deserves proper treatment.
