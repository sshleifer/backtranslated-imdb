If you've heard these three words, speak to you ... "Joe Don Baker" Fear ... <br /> <br /> Final Justice is an action movie with a small budget. (Pronounced like a stork) He is a rude, ugly and rude character who is pursuing criminals in Malta that killed his partner in Texas. His partner fell twice in the movie. Terrible corrections. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) ended up being jailed 4 or 5 times in this movie. In addition, he shot everyone like him in the wild west. I guess no one told him that it was the 20th century. A female police officer was assigned to show him around Malta (which looks like Elaine from Sinfeld) and she is the only one who can withstand. Can be narrow-minded She must be crazy. <br /> <br /> The dancers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie. Their dance shows throughout the film and I started to bond with lazy women. At least it's better to see Geronimo trying to make him unable to do anything. The ending was quite flawed and predictable, and I was happy that it ended. You will never forget the last line of Joe Don Baker from the movie. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine what he was like in THREE Bond movies ... Very strange! However, if you are ready to laugh and see this story in MST3K sometimes, I have also heard his other terrible stories (in many cases). The "Mitchell" version MST3K is being released from DVD by Rhino. Wai!
