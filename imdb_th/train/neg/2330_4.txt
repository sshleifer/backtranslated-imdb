I like that this begins with special effects that are appropriate, especially for movies aged 50 years. However, this movie has stopped since early, with stupid conversations, because all men try to flirt with Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius") <br /> <br /> See this thing in the 90s after being lost Go long Fun to see Francis again, the actress who made the most TV programs since the film was released .... and still serves. It's interesting to see Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J. Adams") that looks younger, which I can't remember if it's not this voice. <br /> <br /> I watch. Half of this The movie before boredom is overwhelming and I have a strong desire to go to bed. I appreciate them making this VHS tape again in stereo. But it is a weak effort This is one of the exaggerated movies that "aristocracy" thinks "heavy" and "thought provoking" that is nonsense. It appears "smart" because the rest of the 50s sci-fi movie is very stupid !! <br /> <br /> Some people, if the early scenes look good on the wide screen, which I didn't do. This time of writing Maybe another look - this time in widescreen transfer. 2.35: 1 will make me change this opinion.
