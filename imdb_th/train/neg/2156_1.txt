I have been familiar with the magic book 'Goodnight Mister Tom' for a long time, and recently I had the opportunity to watch its adaptations. I have heard many positive words about this, so I have high hopes. When this film was finished, I was horrified. <br /> <br /> This film is not a good movie. 'Goodnight Mister Tom' is a very bad adaptation and in practice 4.5 / 10 of this book Missed In particular, I found that many characters and some wonderful scenes in the book are not in this story. There is not much talk, it hurries and moves too fast. But I am sorry for the fact that you have never seen the bond and love between William Beach and Tom in this movie. Selection is not a good thing as well. I think it should be really good. But it's very different from books! A terrible modification, one of the worst things I've ever seen. This deserves to be rebuilt that is 1,000 times better than this garbage dump.
