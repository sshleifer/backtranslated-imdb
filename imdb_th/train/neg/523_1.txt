It's amazing for me to be entertained today. Maybe I am a dinosaur from the fifties and I am not familiar with the movies of the present day and it is clearly the case about this movie because many people like it I found it foul and rude. I'm not talking about many movies in my life. But this movie is suitable for money Humor is complex and rude. I am not a politically correct person and even I find that being a gay joke is not only not funny but seriously nasty. (I'm not gay) The main character in this movie is not just a cute person. When the movie finally ended, I heard a lot of people commenting that they were disappointed with what they just paid to see.
