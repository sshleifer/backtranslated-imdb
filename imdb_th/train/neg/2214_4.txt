This movie is not bad. But it is quite bad The performance is really good! Jeffrey Rung Combs works quite well as a mad scientist who is his special ability if you don't know that: D Bill forsythe .. Um, I'm not sure why he was in this movie. He is way too good for this kind of thing and his role is certainly not demanding. I rented this thing with the strength of both leaderboards and I wasn't really disappointed. I mean, heck, it's a half-shark / half movie. It's not Shakespeare folks. In addition to the plot, which is filled with holes and poor conversations, I want to know that movies still make a lot of things to be desired. There are pictures that they try to look "cool", but they end up covering the scene or just coming out of a normal cheezy. They also blow it many times when they have a good conversation and cut off before the person Will be able to send calls It's quite bad But if you're a big fan, this Jeffrey should check out. He gave a wonderful performance and did what he could with the characters. The forsythe was not bad as well and was a female leader. Hey if I remember her name The bottom line, I will not waste your time.
