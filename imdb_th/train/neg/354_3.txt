Look carefully in selecting the best talents to create this film: Connery, Fishburn, Cap Shaw, Harris, Underwood, Betty, Ti. Phen, they proved to be a hoe, which is a saying that a good actor can't save a bad script. The story requires a lot of faith from the audience that things that should not be possible should exceed the standard of Hollywood. It is not particularly original and "twisting" is completely cruel.
