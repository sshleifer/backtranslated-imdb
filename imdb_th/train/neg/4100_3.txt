It's a little disappointing movie. I will say: The acting is proud. In many cases, I do not feel that facial expressions match the words or intent of the scene. Angry character (Or sad, happy, frustrated) should make the audience believe that he is angry (Or sad, happy, disappointed) that didn't happen here. <br /> <br /> Comments about the writer, assuming that you know the character is wise. They do things and say what comes out of it: the character Andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to each other at dinner. Then he exploded and told his father that "Don't touch you. You ***!" Maybe if we see a prequel, we will understand what comes from but there is no prequel. So we would rather be in the sea for a reason! <br /> <br /> One strange and strange thing that Andrew made was to go to the old quarry, sit down on the edge that saw "still water" below; He then reached into his jeans pocket and separated one cigarette and one point. He did the same thing three times during the movie; I guess we should see this as an act of torture alone and angry? Maybe once, but three times, maybe four times that I lost counts. <br /> <br /> Honestly, he really knew he was adopted. This happened very quickly in the movie, so there was no sense of the dramatic changes he might have received due to this discovery. It's not clear why he was bitter or something else. <br /> <br /> I think it has a Linian feel towards the movie. Is this mountain fast in his career?
