There seems to be a lot of movies like this coming out in the 70s and the fact that I don't remember one name being their hand outside is a measure of their impact. This is what the author called the casserole. They are almost not just a vehicle for keeping movie stars in the public eye. <br /> <br /> We have Micheal Caine, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden; Have enough names to get bums on the cinema seats Every taste in the hero supports Although one suspect that most of the audience is still disappointed, <br /> <br /> Their talents are thrown away and I suspect that stars with so much money and such fame may be hopeless or lacking. Good feeling. This type of movie is hardly gold plated for CV. Perhaps the actor should choose director instead of around. <br /> <br /> It's quite clear that it should be crap from the beginning. The jaunty-jazz theme song that is ridiculously inconsistent, which is spread every time that requires a little bit of noise with confidence in the atmosphere of the elevator. Going with the steam of Central Africa or the endless Sahara with a camel and palm as a backdrop? Of course, being a crazy ball, Ennio Morricone knows what to do.

But after that, the dumb song must be involved and make the atom have a little atmosphere created. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are invented and arrogant with choreographed fighting scenes. Improperly - drama year class And of course, players will have to fight with jazz music - like you do. <br /> <br /> And that's a lot of comments about this program. Except to say that the script is quite gruesome as well. <br /> <br /> Stick to your hobby on this list. Even if it has your favorite movie star, you must be disappointed as well.
