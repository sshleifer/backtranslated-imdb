This is not Michael Madsen's fault. He is hardly in it. This movie is terrifying. If you want to laugh and weary, go ahead and watch this movie. Words can't explain how stupid it is. Sorry, Michael, the movie was dark. All other actors are unknown. When watching it, it feels like a soft porn movie, but there are no nudity or hot scenes. This film has sexual overtones because it's about the underground S&M killer. The performance is not good except for the part of Michael Madsen. I hope he gets a good return from this movie. It's something I'm not proud of. It's not a movie B for cable. It's like F and shouldn't be shown at all.
