If speaking simply, backward, relaxed, lenient, anti-establishment, anti-civilization, Juvenilia is interested in you. This is an ideal movie. The screenplay is not good, with unheard conversations and boring mobile cameras. This is a movie that presents the world in a simple, attractive manner. Manichean: All adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) have Feeling and falling And the worst monster hunter The only escape from the horrors of the overall civilization is the first screaming (yawning) and infantile regression (literally) in an area like an ancient cave in the forest along with utopia in the form of a rave party - again. The times in the forest (naturally ...) show all the weaknesses of the first film and many more.
