I can only believe that Garsanin must be two people. The author of "A Double Life" is wonderful and funny. "Born yesterday" and co-wrote a great screenplay, such as "Adam's Rib" and "Pat And Mike" with his wife Ruth Gordon. "Some kind of nut" and this actor tried But the script was exhausted and lamented that even Brenda Wakecaro's great efforts were always defeated. The script sank to the lowest point in a truly disgusting sequence in which Jansen's character tested the drive's character to make sure he wasn't gay. Ugly sequence But sadly, it can be easily played in movies. Today, "minority" jokes are now completely verboten, but "fag" jokes are still "good, clean, fun families".
