*** *** Spoiler *** *** Spoiler from the release of this wonderful film straight record set: It's an instant classic. Not long ago to know that this movie was bigger. 'Kindergarten Cop' or `Police Academy 7 '. The greatness of it makes me unable to speak while I walk out of the cinema and go back to the ticket counter to buy another dozen tickets. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that requires a variety of viewing. The first watch will definitely surprise you. The feeling but not shy - it happens to our best. This story is so clever that anyone will wonder about the death of the author. What appears to be a simple story of a fool that penetrates into the FBI becomes a comparative story that works at many levels and teaches us about the most important things in life. The complexity of the plot structure will make you messy for the first time viewing. But don't give up! Until I didn't watch my sixth or seventh time, I began to unravel some of the hidden mysteries of `Corky Romano 'and beware of unexpected twists at the end, otherwise you might be caught. Complete with the disclosure that FBI Brick Davis representative is the most wanted criminal of the FBI, Corky is not a true FBI agent. Pops Romano is innocent, Peter Romano admits that he is illiterate and Polly Romano From the cabinet when having homosexual behavior I am very surprised that I can tell you that <br /> <br /> Chris Cutton's comedy talent is unparalleled as he takes the character Corgi Romano. Through all unpredictable situations Reminiscent of John Reynolds' performances in 'Manos, Hands of Fate', Kattan shows various personalities and manages the entire scene with the perfect funny time. However, Kattan is not just a joke. He is also directing the drama as he controls the feelings of the audience with little movement on his face. His facial expressions reflect life in some way. For example, in the scene in which he faces his brother, you see the expression of social injustice and alienation that is clearly reflected on his painful face. During that time, it is difficult to find dry eyes in the house. <br /> <br /> The screenwriter David Garrett and Jason Ward are the true heroes of `Corky Romano 'with stories. Such proportions are easy to understand why two experienced writers have to work to complete this project. Their storytelling skills and their unorthodox structure make it look like `Pulp Fiction '. It looks like a medium dance. Saturday Night Live The story of Garrett and Ward looks attractive and attractive because it captures you too. Your hair swallows you all, shaking it around and spitting you out immediately. At the end of an extraterrestrial experience known as 'Corky Romano', you will find yourself a different person with a different worldview and different ideas, and with only one question in your mind: <br /> <br /> Why is God?!?
