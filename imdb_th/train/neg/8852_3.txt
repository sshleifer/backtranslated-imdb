To be honest, I didn't look at all the original 'whining'. But those scenes that I saw made it clear that the first whining sound was a great movie. Excellent. Must do the next seven terrifying sectors. They started with "Howling II: Your Sister Werewolf". I received this movie from VHS from my uncle recently when he distributed old movies that he bought back at Atari as a new brand. I just watched it last night and it's not really bad. It's very strange. I mean all the things that Sybil Danning is doing in three ways, with her two werewolves being out of place and quite annoying. (But rather hot) Christopher thought to stab the dead Karen as if she were a vampire, etc. This movie is actually like the beast of Dracula and The Lost Boys ... except for werewolves because everything Christopher Lee (who plays Dracula By himself) is talking about werewolves, rather torn from every vampire movie In the heart of garlic, night life must die at night and the guardians of werewolves live in Not very much for acting. But the worst thing came from Annie McEnroe. I swear that at one point in the movie, I found myself being rooted for a werewolf that would tear her neck off because the neck would often say something. However, the plot is quite stupid and old-fashioned, so there are no issues to tell you. You can read from Wikipedia. By the way, what makes me nauseous about this movie is the fact that it is the only film from all seven sectors involved in some way with the original (not counting Howling IV (1988) which is a remake of the original or In other words, it is a sequel based on the same novel), so don't watch this movie. There is no real horror, almost a werewolf and a special fx horrible 3/10
