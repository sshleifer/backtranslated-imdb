This film on paper looks like it might be good after watching even though I know that this movie is terrible !! The story is meaningless and I think I count the best part of the 5,000 cut scenes. Each scene makes this movie more boring and ridiculous. I look dark, dark, no noise at all to increase its horror. But the truth is that the only thing that scares me is music, what they call the tragedy, they play opera, I mean seriously !! This movie summarizes all the bad things about this type of movie. To be honest, don't say anything more than watching your own risk. This movie is a complete garbage. ENJOY !!
