It seems that the actors should make sure that at least the average movie. So I sat down for an unbelievable time. 102 minutes ahead of Ed Harris, no one seemed to be the owner of the acting skills. Even Sean Connery, who I often worshiped, had a holiday during filming. One can convince me. <br /> <br /> This makes the movie look cheap and unreal. <br /> <br /> The story makes a little story. It's an exciting story and this unexpected plot. <br /> <br /> Summary. Look at this movie only if you have nothing to do.
