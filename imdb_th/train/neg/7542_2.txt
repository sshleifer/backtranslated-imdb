This movie is probably a mysterious and serious horror movie about a man looking for a lost woman. However, in the 30-minute movie, it becomes unrealistic jokes with annoying characters and random scenes. I can't imagine anyone not laughing when Cage karate randomly kicks that blonde girl or when he "endures" the old woman. The lines, characters and performances are all badly done. I always like Nicolas Cage as an actor. But he created a horrible movie this year This is the worst thing (still ...) <br /> <br /> I won't recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a thrilling story. If you really want to enjoy this, go to rent the original. However, if you intend to watch it, be prepared to laugh at certain scenes and end scenes instead of being serious. That's the only way you can enjoy this movie.
