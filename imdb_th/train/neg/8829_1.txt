This is a deep storytelling. It was about an hour in the movie before we had a lot of ideas about what it should be about; The characters often mumble without hearing. Actions that do not seem to relate frequently; It seems that no one is really interested in who killed the woman; A pair of scary children go swimming in waters that seem to be threatening. But nothing happened The Irish were punched in front of one of his friends without a clear reason ... Continue to be boring like a movie. Half of the entertainment elements are landscape photography. But everyone can aim at the Australian outback to get an overall memorable picture - boring, intermittent, feigned and extremely annoying for wasting time watching
