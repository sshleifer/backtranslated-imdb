I watched this movie recently because a friend brought it from New York after 30 minutes. I said to him "You have to be joking. Is this funny?" He thought it was good. I told him that I thought it would be one of the most stupid movies ever created. "What should it be? I asked. "Propaganda movies created for children?" Plot. Stupid. The show is the worst thing for most executives and people who look at this type of rag and think that it is related to life, love or life after death, which presents a strange perspective .. Need psychiatry to help. Please, if someone tries to get you stuck in your DVD player or video, think about it as if you have a virus on your computer ... it won't break. Your player But it will destroy your cool if they do the Razzies in '40s. This will be rewarded in all categories (PS. It is still under suspicious chaos of "Ladder to Heaven")
