**** Do not read this review if you want the shocking conclusion of "The Crater Lake Monster" as a surprise. **** <br /> <br /> Clay plesiosaur increases from the depth of Crater Lake To create a disaster for a group of local narrow-minded people, not to mention the fast-forward button. Calling the "Crater Lake Monster" skillfully is a clear exaggeration. If you are not a big fan of cheap movies, you may not be able to watch here from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The problem with movies is that when there is no action of a monster. It really sucks and goes nowhere. The script is very much Ed Wood-ish, which is fully designed in the way it creates the main action scenes. There is nothing too strange for "The Crater Lake Monster". It describes its dinosaurs by colliding with a star falling into a crater lake. 'superheating' water to the point that eggs hatch dinosaurs that seem to rest at the bottom of the lake for thousands of years. Although we can accept that the eggs may lie there for a long time and still be exposed and can not work "Superheating" water at such high temperatures causes most lakes to evaporate or not. In addition to some fog tokens in one or two scenes, we do not see the evidence of hot water in addition to scripts in a few lines. <br /> <br /> The script is quite clear in some episodes and It will do everything to get the character near the lake so that they are threatened by dino. The couple had just experienced the car problems and while their cars were being serviced, they decided to rent a boat and head to the crater lake. Um ... You think the stranger in this story May be there In the order that was just a bizarre ordinary, the drunken man robbed a liquor store and decided to kill the cashier and the nearby stand instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of liquor. The chase followed and didn't want to know ... They ended up at the lake. Snack time for Cratey! Yes, it's not hard to figure out, and you are far more than a chapter that you will be frustrated when it takes ten minutes for these scenes to open. <br /> <br /> Its shamelessness is all. Love and I want to like "The Crater Lake Monster". Really, I just can't do it. There isn't much more, and this is another movie that should be put on during the party because you can talk to it and it's not important. <br /> <br /> This movie has a list of things to happen. The smallest, most important thing is the dinosaur, which appears in three forms: the shadow, the shadow of a large model head that is dragged into the water And the insertion of clay that has been fully realized which actually looks quite good There is also a cute Hicks pair in there and they have a lot of humor in the movie. The ceaseless ending caused us to grieve with the death of both the monster and one of our beloved Hicks, so all good things about this movie will die at the end. Why am I affected by this conclusion? Is it a sad song that plays on a closed credit? Or that I just cried in time when I wasted watching movies like this?
