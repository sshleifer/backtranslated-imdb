Sometimes doing things that are strange and contemporary may not work well for everyone. While I would admit that the design of the scene and the concept of the movie is quite interesting, the use of these ideas is the only consistent story that cannot be used. This movie is very slow, pointless and pointless. Even Robin Williams can help with this garbage. Obviously it was Barry Levinson's dream that fell on the face. But he should warn others around the world about this
