"Igor and the Lunatics" is a horror film filled with hippies and hippies. Obviously, nearly twenty years later, Charles Manson continues to inspire trash creators. But was incompetent This is a general production Troma meaning. In other words, there are a lot of boring and irrelevant movies, all that comes with a ridiculous plot. Have a bit of random blood and free nude pictures on display? Which is not bad, but it is pointless and ugly to look frustrating. "Igor and Lunatics" is absolutely desperate to use a lot of videos twice, like a circle to see the kill The plot of the intermittent attempt to tell the story of the hippies performed by the drug addict and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul, one of Paul's lower-ranked disciples, Igor, became obsessed with The scriptures and the story of the drug are a little bit and gradually make the whole cult cult descend to madness. Just to show a little example of how crazy Igor: He tore his heart out of the chest of a really sexy hitch-hiker girl! There is an annoying sound synthesizer soundtrack and a tricky trick to deceive the real art camera, such as slow-motion videos and scary dream sequences. There may be one sequence that has more or less features that are worthwhile for trash junkies and that is when a poor woman is cut in half with a machete. For whatever reason, the camera captures the shock of a bloody stomach blade for fifteen seconds.
