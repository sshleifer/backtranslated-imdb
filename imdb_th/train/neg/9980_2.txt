Do not waste 90 minutes on "Fast Food, Fast Women". It is a nuisance scene for the three lines that are laughing together because of predictable writing, scary performances and even songs that are not. good I found that the main character was tired of watching every time she was on the screen. SHE needed fast food. <br /> <br /> Take 90 minutes that you devoted to this turkey. Do exciting things. Over ... like cutting your toenails You should have more entertainment. <br /> <br /> The only thing that comes from this movie is Louise Lasser, but she deserves something better than this tired script. It's inefficient as the old man in the movie field. <br /> <br /> Watch out!
