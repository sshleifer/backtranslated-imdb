When I watched this year's Wrestlemania match card, I was stoked and unable to control myself because I was full of excitement. <br /> <br /> It started ... and it ended. <br /> <br /> I sat there, angry because I needed a refund. I mean, you watched Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites), which will go down as a classic, and then you expect the same and get the average garbage they have every time. One moment in all the shows that destroyed it for me was when HBK knocked out !!!! At that time, HBK lost JOHN CENA !!!!!!!!!! John Cena was a loser. It almost destroyed Wrestlemania 22 for me when he beat TRIPLE H! I can't watch WWE after seeing Wrestlemania 23. I start watching again (lucky). I have confidence in the WWE again after Wrestlemania 24 (the greatest I have ever seen), which is the classic Wrestlemania. For 'Mania 23 and give us many memorable moments. <br /> <br /> If you have watched any previous Wrestlemanias, just like you are a fan (Wrestlemania 20 I'm a fan) Please don't watch this thing and make the same mistakes that I made and leave WWE behind. And if you look and get angry, start watching again and watch Wrestlemania 24. It's absolutely classic.
