Now ... I now know that Rob Zombie stole the name of his "House of 1,000 Corpses" crapfest. Now I can rest peacefully. Nothing about monotonous performances or plays will cause people to die in "The House of Seven Corpses", but ghoulie groovie comes up from his plot (ha!) To kill the amateurs. Morale in low price, old house! In the Hell House (sorry I can't remember the real name of the address), a group of mysterious deaths that have not been explained long ago. Some people, such as Artich Lurch, stood up in John Carradine. (Which has a small role that gives the movie a worthwhile moment only) to mention the supernatural Film director John Ireland denied that it was a superstitious hok. Opposite results, such as "Satan School for Girls" Production cost for the TV, an interesting plot) crossed with "Children Don't Don't Play" (low-rent movies about low-cost filmmakers who wake the dead); The problem is that there is nowhere near entertainment or fun. "The House of Seven Corpses" died at the first frame and spent the rest of 89 minutes to pass through a brutal life dragging us all the painful moments ...
