I didn't see it in twenty years. OJ is a bus driver. Arte Johnson is a guide to Lorenzo. Kidnapped. <br /> <br /> Yes, Lorenzo looked at the house very much like a natural villain. I think I watched it. Most of the time, for OJ, I saw Towering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing but still saw Arte Johnson. <br /> <br /> I was a bit bored at Johnson. Seriously. <br /> <br /> And yes it changes the plot In reading other posts, I remember being a plot that they were going to kidnap some wealthy girls. But then the precious stamp business appeared out of the blue. <br /> <br /> Will I go to the stamp? If it comes as a movie, I might save it to check again. But I won't miss it yet. <br /> <br /> There are better movies from the seventies like this to check.
