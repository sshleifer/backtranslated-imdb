There are people there who will be green! That is the only explanation that I can suggest why the House of the Dead movie exists and that is just a scary part for the entire movie. It's terrible that you will go to watch movies forever. I want to turn off this TV seriously and turn to the TV to color the heat vent. But I feel bound to my words to suffer both I don't know why I did these bad things for myself. <br /> <br /> As if it were important Twenty-twenty people are desperate to leave the island in the Pacific Northwest (actually Canada, because it's cheap) for 'Rave of the Century' (which consists of about 8 people and songs that are not appreciated). The old rugged fishery amounted to $ 1,000 to take them there after they missed the main ferry. That is a mania that is worth the dough! The fishermen warned them that this island is known as the Island of Death (hang on - I think this is the home of death?) And all of them doomed yadda yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> The first mistake here, why would there be a frantic little story (from the century, my feet!) Will be held in some remote island? Why are everyone willing to spend a lot of money to get it? Why have to pay more to the old fishermen who are back when they can come back to other people? <br /> <br /> When they arrived, they discovered that they were crazy. (Which consists of 2 small stage tents) and port-a-john) were smashed with blood everywhere and no one was around. What do those who think logically do? Of course for their lives But not these innocent blind people decided to look for them They soon discovered an old carved house that was 50 times larger than the outside. Another half an hour of stumbling in the forest follows an excuse to kill some of the lesser characters and after much boredom, they come home again. Characters like movies, nowhere. <br /> <br /> In this terrible disaster, there are many gibberish conversations, evil performances, huge jumbo performances of the same name. Recognized internationally as a good idea for the filmmakers that I will never know. The clip does not refer to any scene and makes this trash deteriorated even more if possible. <br /> <br /> It's not related to the game at the end. It makes Resident Evil look like a movie theater. Hell, even with Double Dragon, it seems that many Oscars should be compared to this garbage. The only person who came out of this with his dignity is still intact, Jurgen Prochnow. He may have taken his money and ran. But he tried his best with a scary script and brought a little pity to his character. The remaining actors suck, I'm afraid. The character is an idiot and deserving of death. <br /> <br /> Moreover, if you cut out the vows and useless pictures, I don't see the reason why this movie can't be shown on TV the morning. Saturday It's not scary. Pirates of the Caribbean are more terrifying than the bad guys in this movie. Where did the villains come from? There are only a few people on the island to start with. I guess this is the reason they chose to use the video over and over again. I am not a child. You will see that the same zombies have died dozens of times. <br /> <br /> Who will eventually blame for celluloid severely? No one other than director Uwe Boll. His film control doesn't exist. You can clearly see that the actors do not see what they should do and the zombies do not seriously focus on this. The actors seem to be reading the queue cards because they stop in the middle of a long sentence and continue to speak as soon as they see the next card. Everything is strange. <br /> <br /> Plus this film that was filmed like a two-part mini-series. I have seen better production of TV programs. And don't let me start to fix This film is a gibberish, which has thousands of images, thousands of pointless images and a camera pan that doesn't have dozens of meanings. There is no real skill or ability to do this. It truly puzzled and shocked how this terrible movie could happen and George A. Romero can't even get anyone to call. House of the Dead makes references to Romero in a lazy effort. But it's only frustrating that they think this is the same league as the REAL zombie movie. <br /> <br /> For what? It is worth it. 1.85: 1 The image of an amorphic looks very good and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean, but it's not impressive and gives a clear sound that the ADR is used too. DVD comes with special But why torture yourself This check is not enough warning or not far away! You're all doomed. I tell you! Doomed! Doom !!!
