:: Potential spoiler :: <br /> <br /> Man, this movie is terrible. Catholic thriller / superstition / suspense is better than trampling from previous movies. <br /> <br /> Priests doubt sex and priesthood. Politics and religion Sly Church Plans related to the church Dawn of a new evil era Voodoo, all kinds of magic fight between good and evil. <br /> <br /> Stupid and stupid with a weak enough story. The story revolves around two concepts: forgiveness is well known as the sacrament of anointing the sick - the final right that a person can ask to pay for his sins while in the mouth of death. And the boycott of cutting people out of the church In general, the boycott will not be able to receive repayment. So come in Sin Eater and I'll leave it. Throw the dopy that I specified and you have "The Order". <br /> <br /> Found a sex scene with a priest, coordinating with the image of the Virgin Mary, rather insulting Catholics It ended with the word Heath Ledger (I interpreted) "I am a savior and sin. I live without love. Blah blah blah blah" / Q He walked in the dark alley with a long robe alla. "The Mate Rix "> <br /> I gave this movie 1 story, not just But it is crappy and informal But also because it can insult all beliefs in the process If you want to see something better, I suggest "The Prophecy" with Christopher Walken.
