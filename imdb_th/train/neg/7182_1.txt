I can't recommend more Christmas movies than this worthless piece. (Believe me, want a double negatives film here - it's terrible). The film has a problem from opening credits when it is revealed that the screenwriter is the same person as the composer. The musical numbers are too long and there is nothing good ("Thank you very much". There is a good melody, but the lyrics are too stupid.) I am more than happy to pick up a chain worn by Scrooge in a strange hell sequence of movies Sit down and watch this story in the movie again. <br /> <br /> The only part of this movie. While Jacob Marley Dressed in silly white powder, Guinness expressed dissatisfaction with his scene in what was an attempt to make it look like he was floating like a ghost or showing his most insulting in this film Albert Finney, at the same time, blends the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laugh to create his desperate, desperate character, Quasimodo / Scrooge. Unable to believe his change. <br /> <br /> Steer clear of creating a nasty movie in every matter.
