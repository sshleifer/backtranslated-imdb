I completely agree with the other comments that someone should do with Tiger Lily and this movie. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the worst French movies I've ever seen. For a long time of 2 Wolves horror movies in a short time. <br /> <br /> It's really sad because the actors are very interesting and enjoy the original idea. In particular, Antoine DeCaunes and Jean Rochefort are in my beloved group. I am bitterly disappointed to see them compromise in poor movies. <br /> <br /> Lou Doyon is quite bad as usual, which proves that beautiful face And famous parents can take you to watch movies But they don't need to give you the ability. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you want to laugh. See Alain Chabat instead. Or a good time filled with fun, like LA FILLE DE D ' ARTAGNAN
