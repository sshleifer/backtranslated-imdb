Before I explained the "Alias" comment, let me say "Desert route" is bad, even the standard of Westerners who stare at The Three Stooges. In fact, it has Carmen La Roux as a semi-han Wanita, when you hear your Mexican accent, you will immediately recognize her as a Senorita Rita from a short classic priest "Saved by the Belle" <br /> <br /> in "Path The Desert "John Wayne plays the character Moe Howard and Eddie. Chandler's role as Curly Howard. Like their Stooge minions, they run throughout the movie 53 minutes as Moe presses the curl button. Wayne's character is a bully. The skirt is not very beloved. But should be good. <br /> <br /> Playing a rodeo cowboy who travels to Wayne, holds the box office at the muzzle and receives the prize money he will receive if the participation is good. Other riders have to pay 25 cents (in fact, even less after Wayne stripped the box office). There is no explanation for the great riders of Wayne is still considered a hero. Making the girl <br /> <br /> Things are complicated because at this point the villain. (Al Ferguson) and his best friend Larry Fine (played by Paul Fix - who will play Sheriff Micah on television "The Rifleman"). See Wayne rob at the box office and steal the remaining money and kill the livestock manager. Mo and Alon were blamed. <br /> <br /> So Mo and Lon moved to another city to escape from the law and they changed their names to Smith and Jones. They met before anyone else. But their old friend, Larry, who is the older sister, becomes the second half lover (Senorita Rita is left behind the old town and does not appear in the movie anymore) <br /> <br /> Larry's sister Beautifully played by the beautiful Mary Kornman. (Now growing up But at a young age, she was one of the original cast members of Hal Roach's "Our Gang" shorts.) Kornman was the main reason for watching mega-lame and her scenes with Moe and Curly better than others in Produce as though they used a completely different team to shoot them. <br /> <br /> Even in 1935, the action sequence in this thing is very weak and the technical filmmaking is bad. Much The two main chase scenes ended with a wide shot of the rider falling from the horse. Both times the editors cut into shots of one of the characters rolling on the floor. But without a horse in the frame, the stock of the movie is completely different and the characters have clothes that are different from the riders. Free stock images are used elsewhere. There is nothing even a reliable remote. <br /> <br /> One thing to be aware of is the scene in the middle of the movie that Moe and Curly ride on. And then drove them out of the cabin (To the right screen) as the troops were approaching the cabin from the left. The cameraman followed the two stooges and the pan slowly right, then whip the pan to the left to reveal the troops approaching. In addition to movies in the house, I have never seen anything like this before, not because it looks stupid (which it can do), but because the talented director will not show the scene in this manner. They will shoot the two riders, then change the camera position and shoot the movie about the approaching troops as action scenes. Or if they are creative, they will set the scene accordingly, so the camera will show riders in the foreground and the troops that are approaching in the background. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I am only a child
