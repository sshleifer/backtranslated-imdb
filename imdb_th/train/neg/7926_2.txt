Traditional traditional exploitation - although far from being enjoyed at almost every level associated with some men who turn cats into meat-eating animals because of the cat food they make to those people. The cat scifi element can not get enough, and when the food is contaminated, the meat runs away. The cat turned down the owner. Placed poorly in almost every level.

But a very cute person (In general, I like this guy because of his smile that makes interviews and reviews) that you can justify the junk that he has become. Mikels wants to make a movie and he doesn't care how they appear. As long as he still produces something With more power for him But I hope he won't let us watch movies at his home.
