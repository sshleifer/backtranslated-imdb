Use the basic flick of Frankenstein to inject the Reanimator (but not the good part) and you have Doctor Hackenstein. Of course, this is an obvious inspiration from the movie. But never appeared to have anything special in itself. <br /> <br /> Scientists accidentally killed his wife inadvertently, so the whole movie happened the same night as he tried. To revive his wife In order to revive his wife, he decided to cut off the body from some of the women who were stuck and accidentally decided to stay all night at his place. Really good And not being a director Everything here is a standard way too. A little effort with humor that works. (See the scene where Hackenstein hid behind her deaf assistant because she would undoubtedly be upset if she saw him clutching a woman and a needle) but it was almost not enough. Good music, good blood, and actors look very good. And for half of the time I get entertainment from this movie But I never felt like this was more than the time passed. Avoid <br /> <br /> Try using Frankenhooker instead.
