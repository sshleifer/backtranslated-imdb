Watching the Marlen Brando on the screen is like watching a skilled carpenter carve complicated details into pieces of mahogany. Brando's performance is the only thing that makes this movie look. The story lacks consciousness and laughing. (Not a cartoon) Other big-name actors seem to be trying hard to give the characters that they represent to be partly human ... These characters are human beings of wet cardboard. Everything about the technical aspects of this movie is plain or just scary. The director threw the image and took a slow motion picture without penalty. A song that is accidentally a cartoon and destroys the hint of any amazing effect. It's not what I really look for from a movie. But even though the wardrobe is going out The honorable Brando can't focus on the horrific rags that he has inside. I heard this movie called "David Lynch-esquire" and "Humorously disrespectful" ... It's not David Li's movie Born from evil creativity - this film has no creativity at all. And do not confuse folly
