I was really shocked that the best director, Chuck Jones, began to create the most boring cartoon I've ever seen. I didn't laugh once for this short time and it was Bugs Bunny cartoon for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny's cartoons are always funny, not boring! Alas, this short, became a Good Night Elmer (another incredibly boring Jones abbreviation) by adding Bugs Bunny. <br /> <br /> The first warning sign of a boring cartoon is not gag Elmer's goodnight is boring because it draws two old gags forever with predictable returns. On the other hand, this cartoon experienced a second warning of a boring cartoon: too much dialogue At least the cartoon has more than two arms. But most of them seem to be longer than they are because of the large gap of dialogue At one point, Elmer ate dinner and commented that "That's a bad thing." It's the most repetitive dialogue I've ever heard in cartoons. (The characters that read the text out loud in the next generation do not count in my book.) Although this comic is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 20. Thanks to this repeated conversation. <br /> <br /> Elmer's Rabbit Pet is not a fun cartoon for me. But if you sell your soul to Chuck Jones and can not accept that he directed a few clunkers in his career. You may enjoy it.
