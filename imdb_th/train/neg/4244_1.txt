In contrast to my principles, I would like to conclude because I just saw this "art" and still very impressed. The reader was asked to forgive my strong vocabulary. <br /> <br /> This movie is very scary and I am never interested in writing one word about it. "Makes me sick until death, which rarely happens to me The fact that I paid did not make me feel better, as well as the fact that this film deserves a high score from users. <br /> <br /> So what is this movie? It has a fashion name - "44 minutes". First time thinking about "15 minutes", which is a much better way in movies. But still not good in my book and of course both can compare But luck will have what they share is their worst appearance They both have Mr. Oleg Taktarov, who has his strong Russian accent, meets expectations and popular prejudices. His purpose was to appeal to the Cold War. Ah, we miss the good old age? Now I do not mean that he is a bad actor. I still do not judge his true performance. But he is not a real person. Here he is like a master. The way that everyone still indulges in these things is beyond my understanding. We can recognize modern American foreigners here. The point in the movie when Taktarov explained to his friends that the Romans were not German and they were in America laughing. We will assume that the greatest desire of the wretched partner is to become an American. "Real"? <br /> <br /> Then there was a media problem. Yes, it seems that what we learn mostly comes from cameras, interviews and journalists. The director should make us feel the rhythm of the presumption before 44 minutes. He bored us with interviews throughout the movie, like on a cheap TV program trying to turn the wheel in 15 minutes. Media issues are central to the issue. Will be presented in the manner that the teacher speaks to the bluffed students But deserves a separate opinion. We're focusing on 44 minutes now, so I try to identify the purpose of this film. What is it? To make a good time for the audience? To glorify a weapon or not To glorify the police? Show violence? Oh yes, the authorities gave the Bible to underage people. Therefore must promote peace and understanding after all? I do not think so But don't ask me I only know that I do not enjoy this thing. <br /> <br /> Ama Michael Maen I agree that I am a big fan. I hope he will be a bright spot, but I'm wrong. It's not his fault. <br /> <br /> As the last note, comparing "firepower" and "willpower" at the end of the movie is one of the worst lines. I have heard <br /> <br /> To summarize the scale from 1-10. I am pure 1 that is not pure.
