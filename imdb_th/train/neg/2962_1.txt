The movie about dinosaurs can be entertaining. Whoopi Goldberg can make movies as well, but Whoopi and the dinosaurs <br /> <br /> After the first 20 minutes of "Theodore Rex" I concluded one story: this movie is evil. Evil, vile, vile, and disgusting despite the audience Nothing bad happens in an accident. This is like a picture of a torture room. <br /> <br /> First of all, Whoopi doesn't do good action movies (see "Fatal Beauty" if you think I'm lying) but the filmmakers wore 'don't care - you are Strong police here again. <br /> <br /> See millions of police friends flicks this week? Now this is one million numbers with friends. <br /> <br /> Don't like dinosaurs, cute and humane animations from Spielberg, TV shows about them, right? Terrible. This is another person and he is a policeman. <br /> <br /> You are one of those people who hate to chase cars, gunfire, messy conversations, FX that are boring and see talented people ( Goldberg, Mueller-) Stahl, Roundtree) Is stuck in a movie that looks like a tax cut? Big tax cuts <br /> <br /> and you read this review until the end You deserve to continue to be serious. <br /> <br /> No stars, not one star. And if they create the sequel of "Theodore Rex", Hollywood deserves to be attacked by a group of foam rubber dinosaurs that invade the whole body. <br /> <br /> Now I'll pay for it.
