........ and very bad things !!! How long does this train wreck take? 14 episodes or something ?? I know why now <br /> <br /> I bought the "Serenity" episode from Amazon Unboxed. It's my first purchase, so it's free. That is the only good thing about the experience (event ??) <br /> <br /> I will not comment on the show because I guess the new person who doesn't really get the job. Just down At least I have never seen them before in any theater, theater or TV show. If I do that, I can easily forget them. <br /> <br /> But the special technique is really scary. Actually, this is not a multi-million dollar project, but the original Star Trek can do better & that's thirty-five years ago. In particular, I have been laughing out of bad people. (Those harvesting or something like that) as it chases the firefly that looks hilarious with smoke coming out of the engine Eventually, I was expecting to see Wiley Coyote riding on top while chasing Roadrunner. Modern jet / rocket engines didn't do that. <br /> <br /> And that's not something. The worst The type of wild shooting in the west makes me wonder if I am actually watching a sci-fi movie or Gene Autry. <br /> <br /> Regardless of advertising, don't waste time ... I do ... everything. 80 minutes of disaster called "Firefly"
