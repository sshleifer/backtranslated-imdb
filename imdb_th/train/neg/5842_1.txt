It's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> It starts well with the title sequence. But it's about as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> This movie is about me becoming a monster and going. On fun killing The performance is not bad. But the script is pointless and the movie is not scary, even though it is a song in the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It is really amazing that some groups of pebbles combine into garbage bags and ideas. It will make a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie. It's a trash and I suggest you don't waste a moment in your life! One tenth
