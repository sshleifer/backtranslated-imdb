Urgh! 3 things the movie needs: good script, good plot and good casting I watched this movie, expecting it to be terrible and very frustrating when it was terrible. I lost my intention to live half way. The only thing that made me stop looking at the forks is Rose Byrne (which is the reason I watched it at first). She works well because Rastus and her appearance hasn't changed much since she was 13 years old. Is a great first attempt in the movie The dog is also very good. Both work well with awesome materials. Sandra Bernhard I think this is the biggest mistake of this film. She is completely amazed and I don't think she will get the character. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 2 of 10 - and that's because of Rose.
