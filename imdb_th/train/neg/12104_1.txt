Bill Maher's Religulous does not attack organized religions Is an attack on Christianity and Islam In addition to mocking Rabbis' group, who invented a machine that had been subjected to inconsistency in the Sabbath, he did not attack Judaism and seemed angry when the Rabbi challenged Israel's existence if Bill Maher acted According to his assumption of logical conclusion, he realized that building Israel in the Palestinian territories was based on what is called 'Sacred Books' of managed religions This is evidence that he has no purpose or lack of concentration in making this movie. <br /> <br /> I think it's hard to believe that the man doesn't believe in God or even the wise man. Can go up to be religious and laugh at them and call them stupid because of their beliefs But what do you have to give in return? Nowhere is he telling them why he thinks they are stupid. What made him a "rational" person in the room? In the way it reflects how he really does and in the process it looks stupid like those people. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch good movies / documentaries about the evils of religion and How can religion really harm human civilization? See 'Richard Dawkins' All-Evil Root'. It is an excellent research documentary that clearly summarizes what Hope to achieve and what is it. <br /> <br /> Bill Maher's religion is not a joke. There are no interesting questions. It seems to be an overstatement and destruction of an old man who is not satisfied with his Catholic rearing. I almost felt sorry for him.
