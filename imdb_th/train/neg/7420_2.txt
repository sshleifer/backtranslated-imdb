Romance without feeling the drama without issues (or drama) .... This movie should be these things and fail in every account as if it were not trying. Or as if the director / editor / screenwriter didn't really try Actors can do it - they need better support. <br /> <br /> One element that doesn't fail is the score by George Delarue. Beautiful and moving. It's really embarrassing to this movie. In the words of a good movie actor and movement and harmonious music and add effects This editor plastered on the song, regardless of the dialogue and movement. The love scene is a very disgusting story: this is an insult to the talent of the leading actor. <br /> <br /> There is another element in the movie that can be used: shooting a place. Notably for a moment in Grand Central Station I guess in advance what will happen. But the way it was filmed in that scene was amazing. <br /> <br /> Some critics on this board point out that the assassination of US criminal Nazi scientists has occurred over the years. Coming to MacCarthy's time when the movie seems to start to look at American society seriously. It turns to traditional love. Before any human feelings can move us, it is in the (predictable) 'thrill' escape. <br /> <br /> Just as the movie insulted the talent of the actors. br /> <br /> You have been warned.
