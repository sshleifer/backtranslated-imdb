According to IMDb Takashi Miike, the head of the Imprint horror division was banned in the United States. So I thought I would translate the Swedish critic I wrote for it ... <br /> <br /> It's hard to have expectations from Eiji when the killer, director Takashi directs. Mieke in the Masters of Horror series. And the DVD cover of the publisher looks very good. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in Bardello, Japan in the distance in the 19th century and tells Tell the story of the journalist who is searching. Komomo, the woman he left behind and the person he promised to return Tired and depressed, he arrived at Bordello, hoping that this would be the end of his long journey. It turns out that a prostitute who is deformed and silent knows about Komomo and the desperate man, telling her where she is and what happened to her since he left. The story that she told him seemed to be depressing, difficult to swallow ... <br /> <br /> The first thing that made me about now is the unnatural story that Japanese actors speak fluent English. I'll leave it like that. It's not a big deal. What is the big deal? However, it is a miserable way for the rest of it. Miike's story moves slowly until I can't help watching the clock many times during the 63 minutes. The protracted torture scene, which takes place somewhere in In the middle of the movie, I felt that I was not paying attention - and intrusive, obscene - even though the scenes were not interesting. I feel that it is only violence for violence - no style or purpose. The only scene that aroused any emotion from me was the picture of blood fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swift currents ... and in all honesty, the only emotion they provoked was disgust. <br /> <br / > <br /> A journalist who searches for the love he had left behind, played by Billy Draco for me, the most memorable as Frank Nitti - whiteclad al Capone, the murderer in Brian De Palmas The Untouchables. (1987) I often find that Dragos portrayal of Nitti That looks very ice (And I mean well) and that's probably why I'm almost annoyed when I find him terrible (Not in a good way) in this one. His performance does not seem to occur during any feelings or sympathy that shows that the expression is too bad. When his character was supposed to respond to the horrible things Komomo had been under, I was sitting on the couch, twisting and spinning to try to escape the horrifying performance that Drago brought out. Yuoki Kudoh told most stories. (Geisha's Memoir 2005) Wrong prostitute players <br /> <br /> The ending seems to be terrifying, scary, but I just found that it's kind of ... You know ... "blah" (and I look at my watch again in many times, just hoping for a crappy episode). Perhaps the last scene might make me smile a little But that was because I couldn't help thinking of the Red Dwarf episode and overturning Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules with their glued eyes. They look like aliens ... Good luck to you. If you've seen it at the moment and now decide to see the publisher, I'll break the picture of the ending for you forever. <br /> <br /> My first thought. When Finally, the imprint is the only thing that makes the pain of watching it worth it. Hear the main topic by Edward Shearmur (the same song that I believe is used in every episode of this series) and if there is - friggin warning. <br /> <br /> One might point to the costume design by Michiko Kitamura and say that at least something is lacking in style and refinement .. but there are movies and TV shows. Much more The showing off "Geisha - fashion," Japan's better than nothing, but this is very low and I'm disappointed. The teacher of the horror of Takashi Miike is boring, boring and pointless. In other words; It's really bad!
