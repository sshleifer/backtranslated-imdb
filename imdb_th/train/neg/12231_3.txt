I saw this movie and sometimes I'm not sure because I believe that the movie 'See me' Munchie acts as a 'joke' for the next year. Watch Star Wars again. Don't watch Munchie. <br /> <br / > As a responsible parent (I'm talking to those who are parents now) I will not let your children. Used to participate in this video festival of pseudo-occult To say that Munchie is Satan, for the co-viewers, is likely to be 'duh' bleak. He is a brutal alien, a powerful and all-malignant person. Saw adults persuading children with a way of life that they could not buy He is a peddler of simple answers and wrong ideals. He is everything that the moral audience is not. He is Ron Popeil of the devil. <br /> <br /> I pray (I mean this. Truly and in shape, with an emphasis on the past) that the film did not make the format jump to DVD It is my hope that This type of 'yellow film' died without grief on the cold night of 1994. <br /> <br /> Munchie loves pizza. I forgot to mention that It happened a lot.
