Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes join the team as a basketball player. Okay, that sounds there. It leaves many rooms for good jokes and good stories. But no such incident occurred in several minutes after the film's pathetic efforts This film became a redundant, retarded and ridiculous story after the first twenty seconds passed. Woody Harrelson played one of my favorite t.v. characters, Woody from Bravo and I am looking forward to seeing him in this film. But after seeing his "performance", I concluded that he should play in the stupid Hicks country at the bartender. His acting is boring and poor as in the movie. Another actor in this movie is Rosie Perez. I've watched movies with Perez before But I decided that the reason I was happy with other jobs in her career is that she is not the main character and does not have many words (Do the Right Thing), but now in White Main, she can't jump. The main drama, which has so many lines, means that viewers will have to endure incredible sounds and her whining voice. So after watching this movie (Words that are loosely used) and hear Rosie Perez much more than I admire. Now I can say that I am a white person and I am ready to jump...
