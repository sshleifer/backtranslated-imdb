60 minutes in the beautiful Christina Galbo trying to escape from the lonely boarding school that she brought to the beginning of the movie. Does she escape from some fate that is too scary to think of a killer monster that wears black gloves or supernatural evil? No, she ran out of gangsters for 40 minutes. After that, the numbers went around the school in a dark candlelight and looked panicked or paranoid, which didn't say much in itself. Because the best movies were created There are characters that walk around the pathways and stairs that you should be Alain Resnais. Or you know how to shine that ladder in bright red and purple apples like Mario Bava. We know that a killer walks along the edge of school But his body looks distressing and sparse, and without the horrors of the internal organs that we expect to see in the giallo, we do not understand the horrible mystery / unspeakable secrets And gratitude and accuracy, which is the type of movie La Residencia want to be But do not know how to do We know there is something wrong because the woman reported missing. But we never received the mysterious atmosphere that premonition says "Something's wrong here." When Serrador tried to comment on the sexual oppression of female students, he did so with the rapid hysteria and details of separate eyes and lips. The high pitched noises, no aesthetics and desire of PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK will be found here. It is quite clumsy and pointless without any real sense of urgency or direction. Many people are presented as suspects. But there is little reason to pay attention to the identity of the murderer who has not noticed the characters in the movie I like the first kill. The knife's image aimed at the painful face of the victim as a lullaby in the background. But the rest is not important for my taste I must say that Serrador can do much better with killing children and the suspicion of someone who can kill a child?
