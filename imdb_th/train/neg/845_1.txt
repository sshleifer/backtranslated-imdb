It's a shame that you can't vote in the center of IMDb because I won't hesitate! In fact, I would go as far as to say that this movie is in the negative star. <br /> <br /> I like others who bought this movie because I thought that Michael Madsen was there. Well ... no chance! This movie is shocking! Imagine the length of the movie 'The Bold and the Beautiful'. Primal Instinct is not as close to that goodness, and before this I used to think that there is nothing worse than the length of the movie 'The Bold and the Beautiful. '<br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how can you do this for us? The worst part is that I didn't fast forward a bit. I hope that at the end they will reveal that it's a boring joke. They think it would be funny to make us look at a very bad movie. < br /> <br /> Where do I start ... Director - Zero Stars, Screenplay - Zero Stars, Acting - Zero Stars, Cinematography - Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Zero Stars, Production Design - Zero Stars, Makeup - Zero Stars, Selection - Zero Stars, Revision - Zero Stars, Trailer - Half a Star, Check Graphic Design - Half a Star, the DVD - Half a Star <br /> <br /> However, I think it's very important to see the movie so bad that you will know that the film is really bad. Is for this reason I am so happy that I see this movie just so I have a bad movie to put at the bottom of my list
