From the moment when the movie begins, there is a discrepancy. When this film takes place on the border of Normandy and the Middle East and is also a foreign film, we expect to have a sound emphasis that is appropriate This is not done as the majority of American actors. In addition, I found that the performances that have to be performed the best, the story is quite difficult to follow from the beginning. Who is it? Otherwise, this movie will be very accurate in costumes and scenery. If you want to watch a movie to know how it was in the past (Although there is no accent), this movie is worth the rental. If you are looking for a great movie like Kingdom of Heaven, look elsewhere.
