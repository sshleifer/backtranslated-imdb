Darkman 3: Die Darkman Die Directed by Brad Ford May, the same person who created Darman's first sequel. Darkman 3 is worse than Darkman 2 and in my opinion, nothing special. Larry Drake is not. Has been the main villain anymore, now played by Jeff Fahey, whose character wants to get Darkman's work again and build. This time, there are exceptionally strong humans to be leaders of the whole city. The film is quite the same as the story and execution as Darkman 2, but I was mostly frustrated by the presence of many scenes from Darkman 2. These sequels took place in a short time and with so little money to decide. Like this, do a few scenes with style and cute But still a very tired and often stupid movie The characters scream and laugh too and it's very annoying. There is no philosophical depth in this film and it is like the remake of Darkman 2, which is not equal. Darkman 2 has many fantastic scenes and stylish camera work and Larry Drake's ability to play the most villainous. The big Darkman 3 offers some good scenes and moments. But most of this movie is tired and full of ancient ideas The positive thing in this movie is the past story revision (Westlake's nightmare) and a truly surprising pair. And worth mentioning is the nasty death scene of the main villain, a cute and creative comic book without blood More interesting than the death of the main villain in the second episode. <br /> <br /> Darkman 3 is the worst in the whole series and we have to remember that these two sequels were created directly with videos and guys. He did not approach Raimi's original Darkman and Liam. Neeson Darkman 2 is an actor who has many scenes and suspense. But the last item (?) This time is tired and often a stupid and boring sequel It has some advantages as mentioned above. But the overall feeling is not to do this at first May is a talented director so hopefully he will receive more memorable projects in the future. <br /> <br /> 3/10
