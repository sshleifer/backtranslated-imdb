Although this is "better", Mulva first (which doesn't say much But I want to see dry colors) but still bad Do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these low budget pictures. I was sucked into buying a few DVDs to support indie filmmakers and boys. I'm sorry. Some people have not been officially "released". (Not bought from the creator himself) and I can't determine how bad it is. Avoid anything that has Teen Ape or Bonejack in there because it appears in other small indie movies that are friends with them. If you are friends of these people, chances are you will be in their movies and enjoy creating them. But for those who have to watch them? No way. The video is bad, the sound is not good, the show is bad, the plot is not good ... etc. etc. These things are not funny. I only gave this 2 things because Debbie Rochon was in there and that's about it. Maybe it doesn't deserve to be 2 about 1 1 / 16th stars that will show slightly better than the first star. (Which I hope I can get a negative score) If you want a movie that doesn't have a budget, choose to buy items from LBP's "Friends" at Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins or even Raising the Stakes.
