Russian movie "4" tracks the lives of three strangers (Not four people) who met one night in a local bar One is a musician who sells frozen meat and a girl calling <br /> <br /> "4," I gather to aim for the sadness and despair of life in Russia after the Soviets (characters There are so many stories that will make their lives look more interesting than they actually are.) But this movie is not continuous and boring until I seriously suspect that many people will be able to In any way It seems that there is a suggestion for this film that the shiny Russian government depends on shady actions behind the use of cloning facilities, selling frozen meat for decades, etc. - but This film has no shape. Everyone can know that someone has arrived here. <br /> <br /> Despite having good performances and a few directed scenes, "4" is a two-hour endurance contest which should be avoided. Pay all
