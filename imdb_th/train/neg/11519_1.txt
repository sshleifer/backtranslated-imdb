This is the most boring movie I've ever seen. So wonderful That is James Cromwell as a player who doesn't know about I can go indefinitely, but I will spend more time on this review than anyone has ever done with the script. The only thing about this movie is about us and them and how to enjoy the insulting of human reasoning. This is one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen - and I love James Garner.
