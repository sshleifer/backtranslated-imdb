This film is a perfect example of the latest horror movies that are not completely recognized. There are two paths to be filmed in horror: You didn't explain what happened. (Or who is a murderer, such as in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre) or let the characters be stories and various characters Halloween may be an example of this. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Creep failed in this area. I don't see any reason for Craig's little story to come back without fully capturing his character or motivation. There is no recognition of all the characters, although the nature of the character circle of Kate in the movie is the most successful part of the story. <br /> <br /> At the end, most of this story was not broadcast. The life needed to make a scene or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and the creation of empty movies that dragged down the movie. <br /> <br /> This film will go down as another example of the movie. That may be much better, even if it's not good The only thing that has been used appropriately in movies is the setting: characters, stories, directions and overall writing will benefit from face lifting. <br /> <br /> Creeps have no purpose. interested Stupid horror movies that do not have intellectual or emotional investments But sad about it ...
