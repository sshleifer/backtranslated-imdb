I saw this movie trailer and it looked very good so I went out and bought it. That performance is chaos, special effects. (If you call it that way) seems to be something that should not be played outside of school. Some characters are very stupid. In this movie, you will blame the minutes that appear on the screen. For the story, forget it. This is a warning. Don't waste money on this movie. It must be the worst thing I've ever seen. If for some reason you like this movie, watch Troll 2. You might enjoy it as well.
