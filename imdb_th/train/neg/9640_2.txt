I always wonder about this movie because it's hard to find, so when I stumble upon it on eBay, I have split 10 dollars and bought it. Now I understand why it's very rare! This movie is terrible, written very badly, and has a low budget, hopelessly, that the ending credits that show all the cut scenes they fumble on their line are truly the highlight of the movie This movie is about psychic powers (Pettyjohn, who clearly shows her bare-chested scenes), which uses her power to experiment to pull objects from another dimension to this reality. When she pulled out a box like a military object, he burst into the back of the truck with one soldier to protect it and you know what? SURPRISE! The boy in the monster costume made of foam rubber appears immediately, killing the soldier with scratches all over his face and then fleeing to a nearby town. But instead of installing half of the county's forces to find and protect the responsible people, just let Pettyjohn and Ray find it by himself. But regardless of whether this film will create credibility for LONG before, I rarely survive from being voted 1 by me just because of unintentionally laughing. He didn't know about it! 2 out of 10 Really, really bad!
