I rented this movie just because of the promise of William Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez. I think when I saw the name of RR on the cover (as an actor) that this movie is good. It looks like the movie that Rodriguez will do, so if he lends his name to it, must it be better? Wrong, wrong By the worst correction since "Manos Hands of Fate". The method is not reasonable and makes the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you will not want to try to follow it anymore. I do not know Dafoe and How did Rodriguez participate in this film? They might owe someone. But they have a good way for this In addition, they are still in the film just a few minutes per person, and Rodriguez doesn't speak. So if you want to watch a movie that has a bad edit, a bad show and a more confusing story as my guest. But do not say that you do not receive a warning
