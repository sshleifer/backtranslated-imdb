Returning to the lake side cabin does not depend on the original condition in any way, with only one main character (Stanley) returning to the sequel. Of the first movie, the story and the performance are very good But this is one movie that I won't watch again. Essentially, it's equal to what the sequel to Urban Legends and the Blair Witch is like, but with a much worse performance. I saw the opera performing better. It's pathetic until you have to laugh. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. In any way, watching it will divert attention from the first story.
