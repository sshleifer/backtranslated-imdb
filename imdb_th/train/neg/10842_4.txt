Recently, I watched this movie on TCM, hoping to become a popular jewel because I consider many movies from the 30s. This is not a gem - or even semi-precious. Ancient clothes and limousine Rolls Royce in the 1930s immediately hit you. The selection of strange actors as well, but most have too many dumb and unnecessary transformations. This film has many good ingredients and a basic story with a promise. But the components are not mixed according to the correct formula It didn't come together like it should be. And that is a shame Quite clear But with a little change, this may be a very good movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is about an American actress (Jean Harlow) looking for a wealthy English husband. She meets Franchot Tone and His friend, who is in the fun in the Rolls Royce that belongs to his friend's employer Harlow assumed that the voice was the Lord who owned the roll and she placed his image. At the beginning of the film, there is no real difference in the comedy. <br /> <br /> However, the tone revealed the fact that his employer was the fifth German columnist during World War II. 5th, without knowing it, and that is when the movie changes the tone completely and begins to crumble. Tone and Harlow marry But when the honeymoon began, he was shot with the type Mata (Benita Hume) and Harlow escaped the scene with the accuser accusing her of being a murderer. (In fact, the tone of the resurgence of the wound) <br /> <br /> Harlow fled to France, where she fell in love again, this time with the wealthy French Cadres. The voice is now in the army and Harlow is unexpectedly brought back together in Grant's nursing room, where he is in a rehab facility from a plane crash. In the next scene, the tone blames Harlow for abandoning him because she is a gold digger. Harlow never explained about witnesses who accused her of being a murderer and fearful! That was one of the destructive unrealistic movie equipment in the story. <br /> <br /> Then Ton was brought back to contact the woman (Hume) who shot him. The new plane that Tone delivered to him from England Incredibly, both Hume and Tone will remember each other a bit. But can not be placed anywhere! Ok, the sound was shot almost to death. Perhaps his memory was a little bit of a hit. But Hume shot how many people she forgot one of her marks? (She seems to be pretending to be unable to memory) <br /> <br /> This thing cannot be explained and is not necessary. Hume should definitely remember him. But playing it shy when she knew that the voice could not put her That will be a much better treatment. <br /> <br /> The ending is not happy as well. The movie created with the tone and Harlow conspired to maintain the good reputation of Grant Caddy, which led to his deceitful burial as a hero. Then Harlow and Tone just walked away. It's an honor to Maintain the understanding of the French people about their national war heroes. But very dissatisfied as a love story. <br /> <br /> The thing that the film asks is From allegations of murder; The tone forgives her and his love towards her quietly rekindles; He then held a torch for her, even when helping her to destroy the site to maintain Grant's reputation. In the meantime, Harlow finally realized the capital for the people he was. Then, when he saw the tone for the brave man and the nobleman, Harlow also reflected his feelings. At the end of the movie, they both reconcile as they work together to determine the nature of Grant's death. After the funeral of Grant's hero, we saw them embrace and kiss them. That would be a small movie for Cary Grant fans. It would be better if Tone played the murdered French cad and gave the first husband who had long suffered with Harlow. <br /> <br /> That is the story. Hard to understand Irish people living in England while Carrie Grant was selected as a Frenchman This movie is probably much better if they come back to play a role. That will be useful for movies that should be received ...
