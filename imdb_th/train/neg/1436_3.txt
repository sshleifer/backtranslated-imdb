Oh, who loves some of the best talent in the British TV, created this movie so I can assume that they are working under incredible time pressure. The scene in this mysterious high ground (Mostly attack "Monsters" and we see from his point of view) but I'm afraid that I find that most stories are unintentionally funny! Such as the time when the hero discovered the remains of a piece on a golf course: Oh, look, have a hand ... Oh and there is another hand there ... Umm, it's a bit baffling ... <br /> <br >> For many years, British cult television fans have campaigned to publish this serial on VHS or DVD. Now I think I understand why!
