This is one of the movies that have a great video box, but there is a wired Camra and an unknown actor who speaks with a bad conversation. It's very dark. This is hard to understand. This is Vanessa Sanchez of WCW (Tygres in WCW before it was folded) and she is a good actor. I like cheap movies, especially movies with errors because they enjoy watching but unfourtunatly Severed Not one of them, this movie is okay to see if you like voodoo and cutting heads. But this is not a blockbuster But if you want something new To see and rent
