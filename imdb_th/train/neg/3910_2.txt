Isabel Allende, a novel about a lyrical love about three noble families in South America, was destroyed. The chaos of the movie that is mostly caused by Anglo actors who are unable to use Latin with problems in Allende's characters and the Scandinavian director's hand feels uncomfortable. Go to the theater for the second time to make sure I don't miss important things that may change my mind. For my disappointment, I didn't miss anything. No one in Meryl Streep, Jeremy Steel, Glenn Cole and Vanessa Redgrave can slither from the trap prepared by director Bille August. They all look completely stiff. And resigned as if trying at least as much as possible, they expected to fade without being observed in a lovely time (Yes, the movie is an art directed within one inch of life.) Want to know that the production designer was allowed to put KFC on, placing the product featured in the scene that occurred around 1970 - the year before KFC came in. It was formerly known as: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even what is forgiveness in the world? What did Kentucky Fried Chicken do in the military dictatorship in South America in the 1970s? The fast-food chain of America did not attack South America until the early 1980s. "House of the Spirits" seems to be a movie in 1993 because it is a club that is honest and faithful to the vague ideas of the novel. Being a Miramax representative, therefore having to market as an art movie As a result, it is not an event or art. And for that thing, Isabel Allende should sue for rape.
