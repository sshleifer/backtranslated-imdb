Let me start by saying that I can enjoy Italy's bad horror movies or taking advantage of the flick from the 1970s seriously. This is terrible. <br /> <br /> There are many elements that Martino tried to inject and nothing worked. (Except for the outrageous things) Well, of course, there are some Westerners who know that they are located in a forest. I can't remember where it happened ... It was so sad ... In general, people came to the resort to see this native tribe and 'The host of it But they finally regret it Proceeded to go on a rampage, killing, saying that some rest and tribe as well Sounds good, right? Don't expect to get anything. There was little violence until the end. The special effects were terrible, like the kindergarten that taught them and the love story that happened that laughed. <br /> <br /> There are a few scenes in which they appear. Take the camera under the water in the pool and throw the crocodile. Toys such as darts into the water and that should be a crocodile attack. I'm not kidding. In an amazingly special effect created, the Matchbox van is the target of an incredibly overwhelming Gator plastic, which suddenly has a size of five times that of a van. (A few minutes before he was big enough to eat humans But now he dwarfs a large cargo truck ...) It's really pathetic. The other single flick that I can think of is the terrible effect I was drawn from. This is Bruno Mattei's masterpiece "Rats" with plastic mice on the conveyor belt. <br /> By Normally I would say that Sergio Martino is a person who should not miss. But this one must not be missed Waste of time and not worth buying a $ 15 sticker from No Shame. This is SHAME. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 kids
