About 4 years ago, I like this movie. I will see it over and over again, but now ... I can't. In fact, I think this movie will be a great story for the Mystery Science Theater 3000. Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg) and the magic plot My favorite part is when Kalkin rides his bike and he meets a gang and gang members, saying "Hey Tyler! ya goin 'Where is MOON ?? "Try looking for a classic line that "Do you have feelings in your toes?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's better than "The Good Son".
