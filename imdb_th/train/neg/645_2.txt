When I saw this movie trailer for the first time, I couldn't wait to see it. The plot seems good and the settings are excellent. I mean the slasher movie that happened on the commuter night. Good idea !! And the storyline: a high school teacher who became sexually obsessed with one of his crazy students was arrested and fled three years later on a prom night! Prom night, the night that should be happy and memorable, become hell !! Anyway, I saw it and was very disappointed. It's not just the worst horror movie I've ever seen. But it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen !! First of all, it's not scary. In that film, there was no time when I jumped from the seat. The murder scene is so wonderful and boring. Every attacker was stabbed in his stomach several times or cut his throat. In addition, there are still unstable blood (rated PG-13). The most bloody scene is probably the scene where the murderer killed a black girl. He slits her neck and blood stains on the cloths hanging around them (they didn't show that he was cutting her neck). <br /> <br /> Next, you will see the killer facing. The first time he suggested. He is not mysterious, creepy or scary. He is just this guy who kills people. <br /> <br /> Everything in that movie is ancient. For example, when in the end, the killer is about to kill the main character and in the last moment the detective shoots and kills him. In addition, everything in this movie is predictable. The victim, after seeing the man with a knife running for her life, hides, thinking that she has escaped and then the killer emerges and kills her. <br /> <br /> Finally, the sequence of this movie is terrible. The man came into the hotel, killing a few people. The bodies were discovered. People pulled fire alarms and everyone was evacuated. The main character forgot something in her room, faced with a killer, ran and escaped. That's it! She and her boyfriend go home, the slaughterers patrol the house, find the girl. The detective is then killed. The movie sequence is stupid and repetitive. <br /> <br /> If you think about watching this whole movie because the preview looks good, trust me. Don't waste your time or money. It is not surprising that this movie was screened in the smallest theater in the cinema. My friends and I, along with two women, sitting in the back are the only ones in the theater. Should tell something about the movie in advance
