As a fan of science fiction movies, I got to know about The Matrix since its launch in 1999. From a little, I would allow people to tell me about it. I think it's original and highly complex. I am also a respected Alice in Wonderland. I never understood how I would miss the Matrix when it was released. With the upcoming release of The Matrix Reloaded, it's time to buy a DVD and watch it. <br /> <br /> Too much disappointment. Evidence of the matrix (Control equipment compared to movies) is a clever location of the philosophy of a parallel world. The reality, the choice is shopworn. However, I still buy in movies as science fiction if it still exists in that genre. Unfortunately it became standard. "Will they escape, penetrate, help people who need help?" To make matters worse, it becomes another form of martial arts. The problem is that science fiction movies and martial arts are two different types of movies. For the innocent, one religion or another, the combination of both is ineffective. It's like mixing science fiction with love. You can have one or the other, but not both in the same movie or at least not at the same level in the same movie. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem like this with The Matrix Matrix Reloaded, solve the problem. Actually At least thirty minutes of the film, including martial arts or car chases that are prolonged. (This observation is not interested in questions that arise in the negative reviews of all professional movies: If Neo can do things for Superman, why should every argument be? Of course, the answer is what attracts the youth population. Theater.) Then there are aspects. "Redemption through love" The device was disintegrated by Richard Wagner over a hundred years ago. In fact, he was better managed in Die Gotterdammerung. <br /> <br /> So what makes those who see Matrix Reloaded is gone. Martial arts fans may groan through repetition. Science fiction fans wonder why they sit at the Kung Fu Festival. Most men in the audience who may be bored with the romance of movies. <br /> <br /> What will you get from the movie The Matrix, a science fiction franchise? Art or TV drama? Each person's bits do not create anything more for them, as well as movies that satisfy each other's movies.
