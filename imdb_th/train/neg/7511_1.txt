This is one of the most ridiculous and direct movies I've seen for a long time. I never liked Spike Lee but thought I would try: wrong. This movie should show that the real life murder of How does Son of Sam affect the neighborhood in the summer of 1977. What really is the center of the most boring characters that I suspect that anyone who has taken care of as much as the problem The addictive marriage problems, etc., etc. The scene shows the murder as such. Shooting and returning to Saturday Night Fever! The more ironic thing is Spike Lee's choice to appear as a journalist in the movie: Spike. Believe me, you're not Hitchcock, far from the movie, making them even worse The most stupid scene must be a dog that speaks with a ridiculous tone that was described in one scene before it was shot? What do you think when you create this movie? Not thinking of it is my guess. People who think they will see crime drama, use my advice and don't waste your time or money on this loser. You should see Jerry Springer in this case better! Lose the film, I give 1 out of 10: great dud
