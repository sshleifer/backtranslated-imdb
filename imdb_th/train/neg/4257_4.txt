"Dracula II: Ascension" is the story of a group of medical students who find Dracula's body when a mysterious stranger appears and offers students $ 30 million to harvest the body and steal blood to bid. Undeniably, students find themselves being chased relentlessly by vampire killers from the Vatican City! "Dracula II: Ascension" is a horror movie that provides a bit of entertainment with many flaws. There is a good Gore effect, such as a scene that really cut scenes. But there is not enough violence for my liking, the movie becomes boring and memorable quickly and without any doubt, so if you like the modern vampire flicks, see Vampire chillers in the atmosphere from the 60s and early 70s, such as "Lips of Blood", "The Brides of Dracula" or "Lemora: Supernatural Baby Tales" to name just a few. 4 out of 10
