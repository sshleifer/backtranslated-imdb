This film was clearly not well made and hastened. I know that funding for this film is hard to happen. However, if the plot has any kind of original content that someone will see that it has received the necessary funds, this is not the case and such movies are not necessary for themselves and there is no purpose The story for this movie is finished and is better than I might have added many times before. There is no reason to create a movie that has no chance to compete with others. I received a notification from my computer that I needed at least ten lines to send my comments, so the following line is just a cow to fill the area. In my opinion, it is not necessary to talk about this movie again. There are many things I have said, and if you waste enough time to read this review more for the sake of God, don't waste your time watching this movie again. The only exception is if you are a person who likes to watch crappy movies playing in the women's entertainment network at 2:00 am. In that case, try to see what interests me.
