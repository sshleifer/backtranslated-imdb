I found out about this film because of the Jewish Ben Chaplin from Game On. Game On is a funny British comedy and apparently he left because he wanted to break into Hollywood. And star in this film He failed to thank God. <br /> <br /> This movie is a simple romantic joke with Janeane. Garofalo plays an ugly woman who uses her neighbor Uma Thurman to date with Ben Chaplin. Because she thinks Ben Chaplin will not like you because she is ugly. This movie is not good for many reasons. The plot is unbelievably predictable from a bit sluggish to a bit delicacy: just editing the three of them is fun and then taking pictures. Both scenes make me cringe! Janeane's character is arrogant (and speculated from her role as "comedian" and stood up in real life as well). She claims that this movie is "anti-feminist" in It's true. It's true. Men more often than not go to see personality. It is interesting to observe her hypocrisy as well. She used to be a feminist and "comedian" for many years before accepting this role and then decided immediately. After that, the film was not good. I imagine that you don't like the idea and script of this movie before it's marketed. But she made sure that she was so quiet that she would receive money for this movie imitation I mean come! She made it for the benefit of heaven! What this film is against real people, if anything It shows that men are stupid animals whose brains are in their groves and men who do stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurman Noelle's characters. <br /> <br /> There are other bad things. About this movie, like Ben Chaplin's character All British men, American women, find it cute and Jamie Foxx is Chaplin's best friend. Black and of course, Foxx must try and mimic his accent a few times. For a good measure That is the best thing that the screenwriter can do. Blimey. They have never done that before, except for everything that Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore had created. There is also a truly scary sex phone scene which is strange and proves how cheap this movie is. All other comments here say that Janeane Garofalo is not ugly but really beautiful. I'm watching the same movie with them, right? Of course, she will not have an observer, and the only thing that is good about this movie is that she is correctly selected as an ugly person. Although I said I didn't see Uma Thurman's appeal as well, she looked emaciated and emaciated. <br /> <br /> I guarantee three things about this movie if you never watch: <br /> <br /> <br /> You will know what the ending will be. <br /> <br /> You will find painful sex scenes on the phone and painful; <br /> <br /> You will be bored after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> See your dangers.
