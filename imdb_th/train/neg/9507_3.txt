I am often frustrated with movies written by same sex people clearly. Especially when it is clear that they have not done enough research to find out that something is not just But does not sound real <br /> <br /> The scene that I remember was the scene in the bathroom that Jack told. His football teammate Diane was pregnant. Regardless of the shape or style, it is a man who used to encourage others to get pregnant women in high school. They may cheer about men who have sex with the hot cheerleaders. But I can guarantee that the first football team to hear about it will not be in the urine. <br /> <br /> It's clear that this movie can't be. Worse, but come!
