The gold medal, directed by Christian Calson, centered on "couples", three pairs and relationships with passion and violence. Started pretty well, as far as I'm concerned. Interesting. Couples break into couples, different sex, male and female friends, two men and women who are "gay." What roles are movies? There are some scenes that show that they like to be aggressive when having sex or playing with others, but there seems to be no real purpose. My assumption is that they show day-to-day illustrations of how to combine sex / violence in a couple's life. The couple is not very aggressive and not even being shot in an erotic manner. As a character, they don't add a lot of themes or plot. <br /> <br /> Two male friends make a lot of plot. They are involved in gay bashing by convincing homosexual men to have sex with them in the alley. This story intensifies. And the violence changed them It became a way of sexual satisfaction. And their need for violence increased when the movie continued The main problem I have is unbelievable violence. It seems that any character is in danger, it doesn't work, because the whole content of the movie is about the relationship of the character and the violence. This is a major problem. Unfortunately, makeup doesn't help as well. Sometimes okay, sometimes very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one character had a stain on his face. <br /> <br /> A couple of interesting characters are "drafts". Here, Calson seems to have more than that. Will speak and can develop more consistent stories Probably because the characters seem to be developed and have resolution at the end. Gold coins may be better if it's stuck with these two things. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Calson for wanting to be a huge success in this movie. It is admirable Most low-budget flicks do not require much. I don't think Calson will achieve the goal. I myself do not find anything special or insecure. Gold coins are not reliable. But this doesn't mean that the director won't be able to do something about his next movie. <br /> <br /> Looks like he has something to say.
