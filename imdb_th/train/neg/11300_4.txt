1st View 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir - Harold Young): Universal Mummy 3 is similar to the first two stories, as far as the final result from the audience's perspective. Similar stories and results At this time, the location of the story is the United States as the new follower of the Egyptian priest, sending mummies to our country in the hope that he will revive his life to kill the descendants of those who opened the original grave. This time, Mummy played by Lonnie Chan. (Which did not make much difference because he had not been asked to perform so much for this character), the new priest became a body keeper in the city and sent mummies to do dirt after making banana leaves Once again, a young woman is arriving while the priest falls in love with one of the descent's fiancee and wants her to be yes - to be immortal with him. (Have we never heard of this before?) Of course, the plan was prevented when the townspeople hunted the mummy with a torch. (Similar to Frankenstein's monster) and the burning of living things ... how did they get the sequel? I guess you will find the next one in the series ?? or not.....
