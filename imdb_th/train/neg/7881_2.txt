This film is a picture of a teenage Benjamin who has a spasm which had to go to a boarding school because of his punches in mathematics. He did not create the best experience in life before and had serious self-esteem problems. After getting rough in his new school, he began to make friends, fell in love with a girl and do some American teenage Pieish things. <br /> <br /> In addition to some funny elements, the movie tells in a very serious way. By focusing on Benjamin and his problems. <br /> <br /> If you don't like this, save time and see something else. If you are like that, be careful of the following things: <br /> <br /> 1) Benjamin is all loser. No matter what he does, he makes a lot of mistakes and then he must sacrifice himself all the time. For me he is not "Charming loser" that you can feel sympathy and laugh with But he and his behavior really annoyed me, and with my own teenager who was not behind me, I could not stand to watch. <br /> <br /> 2) This movie is almost trying to be true and The story seems to be my story. Experience the characters that are not (except Janosch probably) and yes, I know that this movie is based on an autobiography written by 17 years old, but with some experience with German schools and German youths themselves, I don't believe him. <br /> <br /> 3) Performing sexual awakening is important for this film. But I suspect that a teenager does "Cookie Ejaculation" - where everyone must hit the cookie with his sperm during self-help in the forest and the loser must eat wet-sperm cookies afterwards. Even though it created me comedy in a nasty way But not funny, not focusing on the serious effort of this movie. <br /> <br /> 4) There are sub stories about Benjamin's family and his father betraying his wife. Do not know why it is there and where It makes me bored. <br /> <br /> Well, I hate this movie because Benjamin's character is without any text, concept, style, and it fails to try and act seriously. However, I can imagine that some people may feel right and feel if you like "The Other Sister". You may like this too. I hate both. <br /> <br /> A 17-year-old boy shouldn't write an autobiography and if they do, it's not the best idea to create a movie. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
