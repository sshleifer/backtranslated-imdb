The film is "sensational", but in the same way that the car collided sensibly. It's hard to look out. Overall, this movie is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment and an irrational experiment. The filmmakers are manipulating and there seems to be no problem with the lowest divisor. The manner in which money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation. The intervention process that the filmmakers forced Ted to join (meeting with the so-called experts) was empty and without effort to connect with Ted, but it turned out that they acted to cover the posters of filmmakers and to Take advantage of Ted's situation The worst part is that the filmmakers stopped following Ted after 6 months and seemed to be cut off from the stories they followed closely several months ago. If they are taken care of, they will find Better "experts" to help Ted If they really want to see what Ted will do, they should let him spend money without any interference. This movie is the best Jackass stunt, not documentary. It is a sad story that the US $ 100,000 can actually change the lives of homeless people if they are put in their right hand.
