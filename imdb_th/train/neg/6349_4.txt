Woody Allen has created the greatest comedies ever, and I will seriously consider that Annie Hall is the greatest movie of all time. But if I really think about it, of course, he has some movies that are not very good. But not that bad, such as the Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown. Previously, he had never been as bad as Melinda and Melinda before. Not very tired and not very funny But how does this happen? The plot runs around four friends who are eating dinner together. Two people are playwrights and the other talks about the jokes that happened to her friends. It is about a girl who explodes in an unexpected dinner party. We have never heard of the rest because both plays began to debate whether it would make comedy or tragedy better or not. Than we begin to see both views Both centers where this woman named Melinda has problems with drugs and with her old husband. In the tragedy, she is a friend in an old family who, after attempting to commit suicide, decides to appear at the front door, her best friend, without any obvious reason. Comedy movie about Melida stumbling into a party after eating 28 sleeping pills. The two follow the whirlwind of unreasonable events or get together or make you laugh more than once or twice. There are good performances from Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell, but they can't do it together. They should not stop them from sinking than other movies this year.
