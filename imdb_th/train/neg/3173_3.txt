This film is similar to the drama "Blithe Spirit" written by Noel Coward. The story of a ghost wife and mediator is very much linked to the work of coward I was amazed that this kind of movie does not accept the original writer's concept. I realized that people might not know that this is a scary matter. But it's a sad story. <br /> <br /> Sad. These movies are very expensive to produce. I will lift up when the screenplay is original. I also looked up when it was a creative way to produce a work that had been released earlier. There are some examples that are mentioned (such as Topper, etc.). <br /> <br /> I realized that the movie is still an inexpensive entertainment format. However, I did not please when the taste of the people allowed. In this situation, people will overlook my tastes. <br /> <br /> I hope to get better entertainment from movies. <br /> <br /> In this case I would rather see playing
