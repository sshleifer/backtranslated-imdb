In general, this is a pale shadow of High Fidelity, which is a witty movie and has excellent performances, along with many truly winning characters. Watching the detective has no such thing. <br /> <br /> The evidence of a video shop that has fallen out of the feet of a mysterious woman who is quirky is good. But has never been fully explored or sufficient, thanks to a very weak script And meticulousness in leadership, not to mention the lack of storytelling style with true images I mean, this movie is centered on movies. But that itself has no meaning! That is a big failure there. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that we don't care about the main characters because the script and actor (Murphy and Liu) fail to make them true or sympathize with things. Any real way, so this movie becomes a series that deals with two people who seem to be not very interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, another story: for a romantic comedy? It's not funny. And romance is not very romantic. <br /> <br /> So avoid, even if it takes 90 minutes, but it's not worth it to sit ...
