Okay, I must say that before the disclosure of 'Monster' says that he doesn't really match that category. There are only strange things that have annoying screams! And personally, I think Grandma can run away from that. However, in fact, I am entering this movie, even though the main character is drunk and addicted, the heroine does not come to attract the scenes, such as when she runs away from the train and you can see the picture at that door. Looks creepy and when he is recently killed and the 'devil' puts his hand on the screen. <br /> <br /> But when a disaster arises while the monster is revealed, it becomes horror by Your average with limited excitement or panic is slow. I'm getting more bored and want to close things out. I like that most people say that it is rooted for homeless people to do it, especially the guy he gives cheap laughter to me here and there. I think this movie can be really special instead of a horror story that everyone today! Just boring and not worth the money. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a cheap place here and there or a festival that is not interested (which is limited, but for everyone you are a horror movie watcher) Serious morale. Look elsewhere.
