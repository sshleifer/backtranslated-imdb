Christopher Dugan had to be taught by a memorable nun because he could not abandon this concept. The drama "Sister Mary Ignatius explained to you" presented - at least in Hollywood. - in the same tone as Diane Keaton's lecture scene here Sister Mary is an exaggeration. Lamphun is a bitter word of quiet, confident teachings, a doctrine and nuns that are of high justice. But the film confirms that we take seriously this exaggeration - while, as mentioned, keeping the same tone in the scene "Explain everything." The two approached the fiercest clash, and in the last twenty minutes, the film went out into the gorge and exploded. No survivors May be used if the sound of the scene with the four old students and the encounter with Sister Mary has been pitched like the Sister Mary scene or if the Sister Mary scene is presented more realistic This method doesn't work at all.
