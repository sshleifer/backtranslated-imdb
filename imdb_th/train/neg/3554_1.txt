I rented it back in the 1980s and couldn't open anything specific about the movie - only that it was the worst movie I've ever seen. This is not one of them. "It's terrible. It's funny." This is not one of the "It's so scary. It makes you feel bad." It's not one of those movies. I can't remember the actors' performances. But it was not well taken. The story is disjointed and it doesn't have a certain style. When I passed, I was angry that I wasted my time. <br /> <br /> I've seen many movies that I don't understand because of unfamiliar culture, patterns and / or storytelling. It is clear that those movies have certain qualities. No incubator at all. <br /> <br /> I think that I actually didn't comment on this "piece" for fear that someone might look out of curiosity.
