Best of the best 4 is better than 3 but hardly basic. I say this because Episode 4 doesn't conflict with part 1/2 (eg 3), (for example, they don't have references to Tommy Lee who have siblings) <br /> <br /> Next, I like Russia. The plot and especially the part that is the bit of Sven Ole-Thorsen as Boris, besides that, and the few scenes of the movie are nothing special. The limited budget is also very noticeable. (Especially in the blast plane scene) <br /> <br /> In addition, part 4 does not have morals or say anything like Episode 3, there are a few more. A well-known actor (Hudson, Torrance) in episode 4, but nothing like the beginning of the series. (And even these characters still have a small role) <br /> <br /> Alas, it seems that most of all is E show and true. He can't show movies. <br /> <br /> See on tape. Rating: 4
