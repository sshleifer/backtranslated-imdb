Obviously there are many good reasons I have never heard about "Dr. Hackenstein" before. Me and two friends accidentally found it and decided stupidly to give a chance. That's the reason: it sucks! It is a horror / parody that is pointless. In fact, I'm not sure if this would be a joke because sometimes the script is quite serious and trying hard to be an ambitious and realistic horror in the late 80s in the 1909 morning. Of the new era in medical science, respectively, the opening of Dr. Elliott Hackenstein wants three women, right? No more, no less ?? To refurbish his beloved wife, whom he accidentally killed She is now the only surviving leader. But the stupid sniper gave the man's body So when Dr. Hackenstein shouted out that "I want three women bodies to bring my wife back." His words are not cold and there are three women appearing miraculously. (And a really annoying nerd child) the doorstep Why not happen to me "I want a sexy woman that is seductive to fill my empty harem !!!" ?? Look, nothing! However, the good doctor saw his wish. Unfortunately ?? For science, that is ?? He developed sympathy for one of the three girls, "Dr. Hankenstein" is a lame movie that tries to earn money from the success of "Re-Animator" and even stealing the comedy, some aspects of the classics, decisively talking to one torpedo It's easy to see why this movie has never spoken anywhere because it doesn't attract fans of horror or comedy. The most funny character is the female ruby ​​who speaks loudly without doubt. Appeared by Anne Ramsey against the cherubim The 80s horror movie will definitely recognize her from Wesley's "Death Friend", in which she plays the offensive witch neighbor who has been executed by basketball. "Dr. Hacken Stein "is expected to occur in the early 1900s, but hardly any attempt to create that atmosphere again Dr. Lab Hankenstein is a somewhat obscure series in the 80s with boilers and test tubes filled with all kinds of fluorescent colors.
