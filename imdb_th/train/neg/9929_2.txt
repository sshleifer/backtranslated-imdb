Watching this thing is like taking a big mackerel, slapping your face over and over again. Even if you think "The mackerel will not be able to come back." * Slap * There, I'm not sure what they're thinking. This is a type of pilot that I watched and wondered. "Do the actors know that they are on a ship that has already been determined which will not be created as a series? Not only the black image But in Swedish and Indian as well, and while "Blazing Saddles" makes these images become a mixture of comedy and awkwardness But these patterns are extremely disgusting. No plot, no ending Still, if you are a student of comedy, watch this pilot to see what you shouldn't do.
