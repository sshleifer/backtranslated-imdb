Poor Poor Firestarter that looks like a TV movie that is worse than a bad documentary. So disappointing that came from Hooper and Dourif! <br /> <br /> The government contractor performed human experiments with a hydrogen bomb. The boys born from both experiments have a fever of up to 100 degrees continuously and when he is an adult, the people in his life start to burn naturally. He tried to find the reason why <br /> <br /> The people on the fire did very well. But when they reached the point where they did well, on the other hand they changed to puppets. When the jets shot out of the character's arm, it seemed ridiculous instead of being as alarmed as it should be. It is still ridiculous as the light that is clearly seen traveling through the telephone line and spraying a large jet from the receiver's earpiece. How will that happen? <br /> <br /> The other thing that makes me feel stupid about movies is when the characters have the vision of their deceased parents. Later, we saw the same picture from those visions in the movie at home.
