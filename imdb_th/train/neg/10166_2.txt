If he wants to be correct, he should choose Frisco's native people and not NY actors who do not know about Sucka Free (not Sucker Free). I live in SF for life and people here do not speak or Do what these actors do Everything seemed to be true and the only cat I saw from the bay was JT Bigga Figga with his little pendant as a rapper. It is not surprising that he is the only person in the movie that looks like a real cat here. (Like his warrior shirt) I have never seen anyone wearing a giant gear or any 9ers at all. He installed them in an SF or Auckland shirt that was not sold here. HP does not have color-coded alleys. Black and Asian. Do not wear a headband or wristband with the color of Africa or the Chinese Olympic team and all Chinese gangsters wear Yao Ming and try black while shooting a loop. Moreover, at this time, there is an important yuppie community that invaded all of the missions shown by some white friends and declared themselves "100% West Coast Boriqua". This is not New York! Puerto Ricans here are not far away, and Latino people on missions are different from what has been shown here, which is without a doubt from NY. In addition, HP is not just a black district in the city. The precise description shows the drama between HP in their own skirt, including vs. Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc. <br /> <br /> This movie should be better if Lee did more than this. Do homework and have a better story to work with
