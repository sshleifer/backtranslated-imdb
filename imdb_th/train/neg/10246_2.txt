The end of the world is a film that has no strange events because it should be about the destruction of all the world. The main character is a certain type of scientist. I'm not sure what kind it is. He has two positions in the government agency (?) Which is protected by four security personnel. His first job was to check the signal to and from space. (Although this looks more like a hobby than he did when he was not working. 2) Job # 2 wants him to wear protective clothing and go into a dark room ... At least that's the best thing I can find Obviously, the "plant" is not a top secret. Scientists brought his wife there. She went out (Traveling to eat dinner) as he discovers the message from space: Major Earth Disruption over and over again He said something about it that it was the first message from space that he could decipher. His wife told him that they were going to a dinner party. So they went out and went to a party (!?!). Moments later, he found that China experienced a huge earthquake. From here, the movie goes ... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is there, but that doesn't help much. In addition, Lee also has a lackluster work that appears in Howling II. This film is boring. But there are enough stupid elements that you may have to suffer when you like Christopher Lee or Sci-fi. Level Z. There are also many stock videos of the world that have been destroyed.
