This movie is like other Dutch movies, so if you like watching movies like Turks and De Klein, blond hair If so, you're okay with this. (Although both have much better stories and actors) Sommers became strong enough. But even one scene that ended up had nothing to do with the story There are many nude pictures. (But I and others can't find that woman) The conversation is laughing. (Because we do annoying things of other movie watchers) and some scenes are completely random, this is More than an unintended joke than anything else (Such as a random scene in which the owl tore the eyes of someone ... nothing related to anything, and only once referenced later in the sentence "You heard what happened ... I was there"). The only reason I gave 2 is because some places that they look good ... just that and the reason I see it is because we went to see an example. (Here in Holland, we have a strange system about specimens. You pay less for regular movies, and you don't know which movie it is. What you know is a new movie that has not been screened in the cinema.) My advice is to stay far from this movie if you want to see a good Dutch movie, temmink or zwartboek.
