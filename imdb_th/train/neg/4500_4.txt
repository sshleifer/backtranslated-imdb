This movie isn't really bad. Someone commented that Mo is a type of American in Europe. But there are those who do not need Anglo Saxon Yahoo! And the character Xavier will not sway. <br /> <br /> Try to consider the qualities of the French people as a person: <br /> <br /> 1) Others - more people check. <br /> <br /> 2) Looks that are not polite look, even though: <br /> <br /> 3) Great appreciation of food. <br /> <br /> 4) Ethics The work of Lukewarm examined (forgetting the fact that he should be a wealthy broker from watching him in the movie he seems to be in For ten hours of work) <br /> <br /> 5) Beautiful wife, check even though: <br /> <br /> 6) Wrong interpretation of marriage vows. Check <br / > <br /> 7) Big ego, which says that the American woman owes you if you buy her dinner, check <br /> <br /> No matter Mo is hick or not, there is no reason for her. Will fall in love with this satisfying European twit in addition to the script. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to see the figure A cute and lovely Karen Allen, I'll make a movie star; Two things for them
