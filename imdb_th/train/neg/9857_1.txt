I just finished watching this movie and I found that it wasn't funny. <br /> <br /> I'm a RPG game (computer type, not a thing at the DnD table) but I don't find jokes In this joke, <br /> <br /> Some scenes seem to drag out a lot. (Tilt and zoom may be reduced to 5 seconds more than in minutes) and feel as though the director is Just trying to add time. <br /> <br /> I think I laughed a couple of times in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The acting itself is not bad. The standard that B grade movies should have. <br /> <br /> I do not advise to pay attention to this film until you are a great DnD fan and even though it's best to avoid it.
