While the three-dimensional animation (Highlights of the show) Well done, but most other elements don't change. As if the filmmakers thought "Well, it will be 3-D, so we don't have to work hard to plan or develop characters." And the fact that it's a movie for children is no excuse. The public is drawn to the three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's Dad), just as they were drawn into three-dimensional graphics. The only dimension of the main character shown is a two-dimensional scooter that twists the plot from time to time by forcing him to eat everything in sight. <br /> <br /> And the exact player. ? Buzz Aldrin's appearance at the end (after watching one-and-a-half hours of the same cartoon-shaped robot cartoon) on the screen and ruins of everyone by calling the main character of the film "Contaminants" and announced that on the screen is really impossible. <br /> <br /> ??? !!! ??? You just want to tell the children that Easter Bunny and Santa Claus do not exist while you are there?
