We arrived at an unbelievable point in this movie. In general, dinosaurs came on this boat, driven by a strange old fart named Neweyes (which I wanted after watching this movie). Clearly, Neweyes heard the wishes of children everywhere and decided that he should give the child's wishes. That dinosaurs were brought into modern times to allow everyone to see unscrupulous exploitation Dinosaurs eat this, which makes them smarter. (Unfortunately, the script writer does not have it) by the seemingly strange way from all the wishes of children in the world. Neweyes is the desire to bring dinosaurs to the present day? Why does the desire of children stop hunger? Disease? War? I mean come! Does Neweyes have no connection to all of this power that he has? Finally, when the dinosaurs came to the present day, they began to sing, dance and devastate. (Essentially, what you might see on a bad LSD trip, I mean somewhere else you can see the T-Rex playing golf and jumping on a balloon of Spider-man?) They ended up in the circus and Brother Neweyes. Screweyes (???) Why make children who are friendly with dinosaurs signed? Why do children sign contracts? Screweyes said that if the dinosaurs took ... "brain drain" - he would let the children go to dinosaurs instead of separating the evil of the Screweyes. Arms, arms and arms sold out and accepted his terms?! This is stupid! They might intimidate him, causing him to quit eating contracts, and then walk with the kids. I think the filmmakers tried to show that the violence was not good, which was the point of doubt when the dinosaurs finally escaped and had crows around. Screweyes and apparently eat him completely. Yes, that's not violence! We don't make sense. It's not fun. It's stupid. It's stupid. Written badly and has the biggest plot hole ever committed to filming. Even children's movies ... This is BAD.
