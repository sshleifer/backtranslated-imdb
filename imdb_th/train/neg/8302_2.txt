Funny how the studio thinks it can create a sequel to the classic Christmas story with all new actors and expect it to float. Of course, they use many actors for Batman. But in that case, Batman is a classic character before any actor wears his robe. In this case, you have a classic character in glasses. Blonde head horn, wearing Ralphy, who wants a red BB gun, rider for Christmas ... somehow we should forget him. If I don't know if it is a sequel, I will not guess from the actors ... except of course Charles Grodin tries hard to imitate Darrin McGavin that you are always reminded that the manuscript is better ... br /> <br /> In the end, it might be better if they show better movies. They should look for things that are like or don't care about the original and don't try to copy the look. This is just a cheap imitation. The Ralphy does not cause sympathy, just the desire to look like his character, shoot his eyes out or die.
