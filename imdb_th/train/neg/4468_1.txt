OK, plain and simple. If you are a fan of other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD), keep away from LEGEND. <br /> <br /> It's definitely the most frustrating TR game. It looks very good. It sounds very good. But it can't be played and I give up I felt I was robbed by Eidos. <br /> <br /> It's very easy. TR is a PC game before anything else. You can control Lara using the keyboard in the game 6 Tomb Raider. Control is standard in AOD. They are 'tacky' but still the same general control sequence in the Legend. They change movement and control methods. And she can't control at all. <br /> <br /> I see other opinions from people who say 'use the mouse'. Why don't I say other people use 'gamepad'? Why not? Others say, 'But this is the standard for 3rd person control for many years.' I don't care. It's not the standard for other TR games, so why mess with it? Oh, I know because they don't care less about their loyal traditional fan base. They want cash for new kids who haven't even heard the series until the movie comes out and makes a lot of money. Poor. <Br /> <br /> My advice to serious TR fans is to stay away from this game and if you buy a complaint with Eidos, I've seen many other posts, mostly in the Eidos forums from people. The person who told them The waste that is how Perhaps they'll listen.
