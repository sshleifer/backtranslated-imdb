I will tell you one thing for Jeanette and Nelson - even when in a merciless musical drama without any pain and pain, there are still eyes in their eyes. Yes, the chemistry between famous couples is there, even though the material is thin like paper. Although the score is real But does not really depend on just a few catchy songs And even in such an unbelievable situation - yes, even imagined. <br /> <br /> The truth is to say that she has more chemistry with Nelson than her husband Gene Raymond, her husband. Own via SMILIN 'which is still a much better movie <br /> <br /> Sorry, I love Jeanette and Nelson as much as the next fan But this is the lowest point of the division. Jeanette is more than a shame in her "hep" number with Binnie Barnes - and Nelson can stare empty when facing the most ridiculous situation. <br /> <br /> Can wonder what this is Like Broadway in 1938, of course, it requires more flair and style than seen in this weak MGM production. Edward Everett Horton acted without a role and no player. Can breathe in this life It's like a night of amateur at the studio, although there are only a handful of professionals who put up supporters. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Painful rendition of Rodgers and Hart can not be recommended. Even for MacDonald's and Eddy's fans, and even though Jeanette's close-up shots still shine with the beauty of her spider webs But this movie is terrible
