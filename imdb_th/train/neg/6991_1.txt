Don't just bother I think I will see movies that have greatness and good deeds. <br /> <br /> But it's boring and predictable after an interesting start In the middle of the movie, you have only a small amount of socialization and all the tension will disappear because it slows down the speed. At the end it will be better But not really great I think the director took this movie too violently. In this type of film, even if you don't care about the plot, at least you want a good performance. I almost accidentally fell in the middle / main part of it. Rating 3/10 <br /> <br /> Derboiler
