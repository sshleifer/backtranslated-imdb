"The Bat People" is a terrible movie that deserves MST3K treatment. Like other movies, "The Creeping Terror" <br /> <br /> In that we live in a landscape full of bats. We see Many things happen, such as flying bats and attacking objects, chasing trucks, accidents at emergency rooms and more! All of this combined with the 70s' simplicity (Hey, think "Mitchell" here!) Makes "The Bat People" actually one of the best episodes of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" made in the series. ! Moviewise It is terrible to avoid such an epidemic, unless Tom Servo and Crow are watching with you. <br /> <br /> "The Bat People" - like "The Bad People !!!!!" Of course. <br /> <br /> 1/10 Of course !!!!!
