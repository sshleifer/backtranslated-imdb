Is a bad movie I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes are involved in this. If you are going to make a movie related to baseball and show a baseball scene, at least make the action look more realistic. Why do people always stand up without any reason during the competition? *** Possible spoiler *** and the final scene in the movie .... What is that? We believe that DeNiro met him on the court in the referee uniform and the game was playing in heavy rain conditions ... one of the worst scenes in sports movies, 3 stars out of 10.
