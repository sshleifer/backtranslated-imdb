Good actors and good performances cannot conceal chapters that do not have conversations, bad conversations and behavior patterns that hover around things that you don't care about. The most interesting character is David Berkowitz. There is no character development - no growth, no interest, just some suffering without reason, especially teaching us and not disturbing entertainment.
