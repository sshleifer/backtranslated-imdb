I agree with jamrom4 .. This is the only scary movie I've ever seen .. Holy shit is terrible .. I was warned not to watch .. and I watched it stupidly .. about 10 minutes. In pain The experience that I completely surrender to see the cruelty .. but sitting until the end .. just see if I can .. well I have and now I hope I don't .. it's disgusting .. nothing Happened and the ending was Everyone says .. no matter which movie has the right to survive .. I urge all of you to take the fear of fat in driving the bus .. If only I listened to the same warning .. please help. Myself from this movie I have a feeling that those who give high scores participate in the making of movies .. and everyone should be wiped out of the planet's face ..
