There are people here who actually compare this movie in some ways to High Noon. Now it's a real stretch! I am a big fan of Sinatra, including his acting role. But perhaps the only person who can play this role is Don Knot. First of all, while someone pointed out that Sinatra didn't have a creation for Wannabe, a bad person in the West, he was just too 'light' at this point in his life. Maybe he was about the same height as speaking to Audie Murphy, but Murphy had a fairly tight shape. Sinatra meets each other because of the small children talking, which no one should seriously take. <br /> <br /> The story is not boring and unreliable. I don't want to spoil But I think the end and the way the townspeople respond in this matter, there is no other reason why these people allow themselves to be 'bad people'. I do not understand why people let themselves be possessed like that. <br /> <br /> There is an 'interesting love' in the story and I follow it correctly. She is upset when the main character reacts. TBA to recognize who they are, so others will not kill the criminals, he now has a true love for you. Stand up for yourself! Tell him your name so he will kill you! 'Haha. Stop you killing me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic evidence of the movie is not good enough and no matter how they try it, there is no logical path to follow in addition to Garbage basket. Want to know why it's not in the video and never appear on TV? Apparently, the critics panned it in 1956 and they were right - this movie is quite bad. I almost bet that Sinatra paid someone to six things as deep as possible. <br /> <br /> You want to see good Westerners. Try the tension at Table Rock or At Gunpoint. Two really talented Western actors. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko Frank. You are the greatest singer - but you're not in this kind of movie.
