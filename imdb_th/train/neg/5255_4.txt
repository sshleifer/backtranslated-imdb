This movie looks very exciting. It has a delightful black joke. But overall, the story has a lot of ancient ideas, just like the text that appears. If you are a big fan of violence in mainstream movies like hostels or see, you will love it. If you are looking for something that is high on the eyebrows I saw that it was part of the edinburgh 06 film festival and I chose it just because I was looking for something disturbing. Eventually it will not interfere. Just grind and unpleasant to sit through. If you really want to challenge, see what is missing. If you want to make money or tell your friends about movies that are really messy, this is for you.
