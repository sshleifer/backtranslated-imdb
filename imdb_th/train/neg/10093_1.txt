I do not believe that this movie will be composed. It's terrible. I was fooled by all the box art. Don't be fooled !! It's not worth your time. I promise you. I do not know if the review is positive for this flick is a joke or something. I'm very disappointed: (<br /> <br /> The explanation on the back of the box doesn't match! The girl who made up on her is a stripper. The conclusion on the back says that she is only 17, not the people who write explanations for the film are also interested in watching it !? Those positive reviews must be a joke that they have to do. If anyone likes this movie, then I actually lose all faith in humanity. <br /> <br /> And don't even let me start the story compared. With the title or the fact that this movie was created entirely in 2 places or the police were not close to the actual uniform Who cares about police uniforms? Compare with the rest of this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to zombies and all fans.
