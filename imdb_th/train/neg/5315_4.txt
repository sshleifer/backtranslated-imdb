Kol, a space prisoner in a row of space, able to hijack the space shuttle and escape to the forests of America, where he, along with new friends, discovered a new attempt to escape from the "Alienator". The best movie of Fred Olen Ray's career "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers". This movie can't help. But feels like a small matter, low budget like the previous movie But not as fun as I used to have There are no actors who really stand out in me. This movie is okay for viewers who do not choose to rain on Saturday afternoons. But that's a good thing for me. <br /> <br /> My grade: D + <br /> <br> I saw: Showtime Thriller
