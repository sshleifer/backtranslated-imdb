I will be vague about the comments that may spoil my There is enough canning plot in this film, which is basically destroyed. <br /> <br /> This movie received a little idea from the classic Southern To Kill A Mockingbird. Maybe TKOM received the idea from the source .... No matter how, after you watch this, you will say "Yes, that's a scam." <br /> <br /> I truly think The entertaining thing about these McMovies is that when you identify the plot elements, then consider whether they will stick to the original or try to twist. Not many twists in this
