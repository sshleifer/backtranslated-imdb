If you ever wanted to watch a movie that is more style-oriented than the substance for you for me, Son de Mar is beautiful with SEE, but there are precious little things, except that yarns that look blasphemous and innocent will change you. This may be one of the famous 'chicks' flicks you've heard so much. <br /> <br /> We went through this movie half way before anything really happened: Ulises (Jordi Molla) Went out to sea to search for tuna and did not return to leave his wife Martina (Leonor Watling)) and his son to take care of himself Then, in the six-minute period of anger, they buried Ulises. Martina married again and her son began to enter middle age. This fast moving is a little shaking and sloppy: after 40 minutes more or less hanging around, we go into a full drama within six minutes. I think this is called the sporadic narrative spacing. <br /> <br /> Five years later, Ulises (as in the superhero who lost Ulysses; Get it?) Go back to 'Penelope. (Watling) only to find that she is married. Sierra (Eduard Fernandez) mysteriously wealthy man (What can he do to get all the flour?) The mystery helps the crocodile to be a pet. When Martina is furious about the question of his disappearance, he tells her that he will take her to Sumatra Island someday and she will understand everything. <br /> <br /> And this is the thing. He did Don't take her to Sumatra. Reference data has just died somewhere in the script. He didn't explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and children for five years. He didn't accept himself as an honorable person, and the film didn't fill the gap that starred us at least half of the movie. I can conclude that the director Bigas Luna wants us to fill the story with a mysterious clue. (Fish, reptiles, sea) that he proposed through a dramatic film filming and a suspicious dialogue. It doesn't work. 'Ark' The storytelling in this film ends with looking like a shaky clothesline. <Br /> <br /> I'm sure Jordi Molla is a good actor. But I can't buy his Ulises as any type of hero (Which is what Ulysses should be) This man should be rented to strengthen the old marriage. I'm sure Virgil will be impressed. He has not been placed as often as I understand. <br /> <br /> The poem's 'device' numbers are clear in this film and I have no other choice but to think of it as a reversal of sex. Ulysses' famous siren song (Such as a beautiful young woman singing a seductive song The crew that was punished if they responded well, called Sirens) If this is what Bigas Luna is up to, you can see the problem - he offers a complex symbol in an attempt to snatch and grab at High Art again. It doesn't work at least. In my eyes <br /> <br /> Watling is a beautiful and attractive actress. But she gives us the character here that seems to have no intelligence or Even the romantic depth It was beyond me that she would fall in love with a man with a rental symbol on his face (like empty), a 1960s style hair. It looks like an algae and one of the modern 21st century beards. '(You know? The growth of the four days is not much less than this.) He encouraged him to be a dreamer (I think), but his eyes suggest that he may suffer more from receiving more light to an unusual chapter. br /> <br /> But don't despair, this movie looks good. Do not try to connect the points on the red herring or think about what you hear in the conversation. You can lose fast forwarding in this movie (especially in the first 40 minutes) and you won't miss much.
