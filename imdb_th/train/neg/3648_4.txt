A couple without children (Brooke Adams, Jeff Haygana) Go to the doctor (James Karen) to try to conceive. It works, but Adams gradually realizes that something is wrong with the child ... <br / > <br /> Interesting ideas are made by flea scripts - the basic idea is ok. But became a predictable story. At the end, I saw "twisting" every time I came. That direction is bad - he doesn't seem to know how to shoot the basic scenes. The production cost - will be good - the punch is very shabby and the blood scene is not very satisfactory. (I almost closed when the pregnant woman began to pierce herself at the stomach) with a special punch technique. This film ended at the end when it was quite clear, they didn't have any idea how to end this story. <br /> <br /> Some good performances make it quite tolerable. Was good at their role and watched me But it's about it The film was released in 1991 and is still unknown - it's easy to see why I gave 4.
