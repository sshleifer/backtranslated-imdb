Good performances and artistic directions are not good movies. This movie is scary and depressing. I am not very happy at the end of the "happiness" associated with the union protests. Humor efforts about the pregnancy of the lake are certainly disastrous, and a movie involving Baldwin's brother has already hit each other. In a positive sense, Lang is still one of America's top famous actors. He alone makes this worthwhile in my VCR.
