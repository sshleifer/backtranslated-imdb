Charles's outing is good. But this is a relatively low performance Marlon Brando has a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland who forgot to develop and make the movie slightly hurt I'm still trying to find out why Charlie wants to change his name. Every movie that has "Charles" is terrible.
