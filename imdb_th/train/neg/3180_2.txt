It's a boring movie! In order to summarize it all, it was only Nana Patekar dancing up in the Karisma Kapoor's daughter-in-law as she tried to escape from the village with her son. Who can be bored ??? The concept is not too bad. But it did not perform well Canadian locations and some village scenes were shot beautifully. However, the overall picture of the movie is shorter. The story may be excellent. But this movie seems to drag There is only so much foolishness that people can only do three hours of blood. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole movie is the song "Ishq Kamina" and that is only five minutes In addition, this movie is nonsense.
