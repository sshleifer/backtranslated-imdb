Great movie with Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome. Here he is involved in women who die under the sea. <br /> <br /> Soon, Rome is hired to find out what happened to women. Naturally, it is a woman under the sea Her roommate Lainie Kazan. Soon the wind died on the floor. <br /> <br /> Richard Conte is very old, playing as a police officer and a friend of Rome. When the owner of the local club was killed, the error occurred in Rome and became an interesting chase scene. That is a very bad thing if you have to rely on the chase scene to show action. <br /> <br /> Racel Welch shows amazing beauty to her neck. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, you don't know. Why the woman was killed Don't even ask
