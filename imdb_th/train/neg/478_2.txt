The worst competition for Warner Bros Kay Film I only saw eight people. But the comet on Broadway is the worst. The best thing about it is that it's short. Oh and the Orry-Kelly outfit (of course) is ok. James Wong Howe's movie is not Kay Francis throughout the face. Looks fat and less charming than usual. That is so good as a dancer "joke", semi-hard (it looks more like a fashion show than a joke). The last shot - Kay Francis and her children. (When did the child know that Kay Francis was your mother, did I fall asleep?) Walked up on the dirty path to the fog painted prison. The entire movie is incredibly cheap and doesn't care that it will be infected by cynicism in the part of everyone who does it: Warner Bros. throws junk to an unknown dolphin. What they get is garbage.
