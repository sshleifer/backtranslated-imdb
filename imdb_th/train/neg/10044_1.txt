This is the biggest flop of 2008. I don't know which director has the idea of ​​creating a huge disaster. The song was added without a situation. The story stretched out to fill the 3-hour gap and the most disgusting was the action scenes of the actors who all had special powers that could run during the fire and nothing Happened to them And one person fighting with 100 people, with only the best performances by Anil Kapoor. He's always been the best actor in the role of a villain with the Hiklish-speaking cartoon ... Akki still works well. Too ... but the animators just forgot it
