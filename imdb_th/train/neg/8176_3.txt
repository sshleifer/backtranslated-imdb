I watched this movie last night with expectations. <br /> <br /> Except 'Combo', I think the performance is not good and the lecture is limited. It's like a drama. 'Created for TV' <br /> <br /> I feel that this movie has been well planned. Beginning of hammering in the initial context (Yes, we understand that this is the 80s of the United Kingdom - you can stop.) It's boring and gives a one-sided view of life in the UK in the 80s - poverty, war, and the Margaret dynasty. Thatcher still has nothing in between? In fact, there is a middle class that has existed since then - just ordinary workers with appropriate wages and mortgages. The Falklands clip seems to have been added at the end for 'Amazing effect' I believe that <br /> <br /> the sequence of events that makes sense. We see that their thoughts have changed so fast. <br /> <br /> The relationship between 'Shaun' and 'Smell' is the curling of the feet. I can't even look during the jogging scene. I find it very difficult to believe that she will get the attention of boys not only But younger But still looks much younger I know that there are only four years between them. But four years is nothing when you reach your twenties But it's very different in your teenager! In my experience, the difference in adolescent age occurs only when younger women, because girls grow much faster and are in the waves of boys older than a couple of years. Sorry, but I didn't buy it - as Unnecessary plot points created for value. <br /> <br /> The ending is quite suddenly and again as a plan. If the event of throwing a flag should be a symbol, then it is quite short in my eyes. <br /> <br /> It's a bug that the British film deals with myself, the nobility or the poor. Do not understand. I am very wrong with Trainspotting and Four Weddings are charming, but we can't make any brits happen. Why is our movie always hanging in the class system? I was born in 1973, so the age of 'Shaun' is not much different. In 1983, I grew up in a single guardian family on a degraded town council land. In the city in english However, my childhood experience is very different from the pictures shown in the movie - I do not remember that racism is a problem. (Although I didn't say that it didn't exist) 'This is England', not in my experience. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I feel that this movie is lacking in chemicals and I feel bored and not. Always impressed
