When my 'deja vu, my deja vu' aired last season, I'm glad. I think the scrubs do something clever and unique about the concept of the clip show. They are playing new gags in a way that is self-aware and I really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I found it really unfortunate that I was wrong. One season later, they succumbed to the fact that almost everyone's sitcoms inevitably show clips ... and it seems that they are collected by children with Dr. Cox's shaving heads work experience. Shows how the editors behave as lazy as they are in combination because it will not appear again until 'My Long Goodbye' in the next 4 episodes. I can't imagine that Vick is too much effort When talking about maintaining the continuity of what was once a well-designed sitcom Who knows why it has been slotted there? It seems lazy and not there. Remind me (mostly) the episode that aired last year. <br /> <br /> Three two-second clips packed with Background music DVD added for the rainy day (much), not the time of the television broadcast
