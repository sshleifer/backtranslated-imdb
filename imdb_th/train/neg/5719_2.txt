This movie is much like a movie hostel except for * BAD * and is undoubtedly a lot. The blood element is there. But you don't feel anything for the character, making the violence very inefficient Some are weird ... like forced snake down the throat someones. What happened to that? Should be scary or full of blood? It's so stupid. As for the torture, there is no real thing. (Except those who had been lit in the first place, which they did not show) the main bad guy still said "Make them die slowly" but the butchers kill them all quickly. Death is quite fast. Yes, I watched the "No ratings" version. So overall, not the worst gore movie I've ever seen. But not too good You won't miss anything if you skip it.
