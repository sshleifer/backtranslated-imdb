There you have it again. Confusion in my account. Two real! First of all, even though I wanted to think about myself, I knew a little about the benefits of the euro in the 70s and its most prolific people. I've never heard of Joseph W. Sarno before. Create a movie that benefits seventy rancid and insulting and I haven't seen anyone yet! how? why? What happens here? Second, and even worse, when you think you will find a new source for vague cult movies, the most famous director and should be "Masterpieces" become boring and annoying movies. Lesbian vampire movies are recognized as sub-genres that have no meaning. But some people bathe in a harsh atmosphere and have a curious feeling. Joseph Sarno's film has nothing to offer, except for a lot of nonsense nudity and even a boring story quickly. The incident occurred in a quiet old castle hidden deep in the German mountains, which five centuries ago inhabited the evil and bloodthirsty baroness. Her faithful disciples continued to throw naked dances in the castle tombs, illuminated with candles shaped like lingam ?? AUCH and hope to revive the baron again soon. Go with the female guests and sexy, so more erotic rituals Sounds delicious and entertaining enough, but "Devil's Toys" has a lot of sequences that have nothing to do with reality and that the facial expressions of the actors who are unaware of the actors cannot be tolerated! Sarno cannot create suspense or create a gothic atmosphere. (Or maybe he doesn't care) and the ability of the actress to limit himself to standing in front of the front camera and pulling a really pathetic face Please do something you like yourself: No matter how scary you are trying to watch a vampire lesbian movie in the 70s, this movie is not worth the money you lost! Even the songs of Jess Franco and Jean Rollin are still pure art compared to this song.
