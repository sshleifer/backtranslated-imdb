... or maybe it's just so bad The plot is new, cheap, which is strange because it should be a prequel, not a sequel. Rather, the movie seems to be the first to be rebuilt with scenes that mimic the things that happened in the beginning. There are only nonsense and unlikely things. At first, this great actor was composed of B-list actors and did not accept the most horrible performances. Half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first episode, because almost all the main characters, including characters that are not in the first movie I know that this was created from the pilot episode of the TV series. But that's not an excuse They do not need to change the image (bad) into a movie. There is only one thing that is very good and that is the order of the erotic. However, since these things are not as close to the best at first, even if this does not raise the level above 1, if you have the opportunity to watch it for free and you are straight. Should check if you want non-porn erotic stuff If not avoid all costs 1/10
