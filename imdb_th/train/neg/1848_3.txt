There are bad movies, then there are terrible movies that become art. This is one of those movies. My partner and I still have both types of bullets shocked you. You know, staring at space and drooling! You can tell the people involved. (I hope that they will change their names to protect themselves) are exploding and they are certainly not shy. I give one of these three, just because smut is free and the blood loss is really bad. I laughed out loud in most movies, so I think you can say that it gives me a good time. Beware of the audience of the above words. It doesn't mean that this is a good movie because it's not. All I can say in my defense is that it is impossible to forward a movie with a great title!
