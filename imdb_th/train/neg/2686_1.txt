First of all, I'm not an American or Middle Eastern person. Secondly, I don't have religion. The closest thing to my religion is sports and movies. From now on, I believe that I will be given the best duty in giving opinions about neutrality and without prejudice. <br /> <br /> Most of these short films are the most humiliating. This terrifying event should be used to remember every innocent person killed by savage and savage "some people". What I saw in most short films became an attempt to score a variety of political issues. Example: <br /> <br /> 1) As for Ken Loach, of course, we are all sad that this friend has a difficult life in his country. But what is relevant to innocent victims in 2001? Two wrong mistakes, right ?! No matter! This movie should have a narrative for those who have trouble listening to some non-consecutive English-speaking accents. <br /> <br /> 2) The most disturbing thing is that Youssef Chahine's segment is clearly he Have problems with logic He cited the reason for the murder because - America is democratic, and because some Americans vote for powerful politicians, all Americans ultimately have responsibility for their actions and decisions in the Middle East. Helloooo ! Are men really? Some Americans don't vote! Some Americans don't even know where the Middle East is. Some people do not even know that religion is being treated there; And most people do not know the real political issues played behind. ### Mr Chahine The reason we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind logic. The innocent victims in the Twin Towers come from all over the world. The firefighters who were killed, the rescuers, the office staff, the stand and the flight passengers had nothing to do with politics. But we are not allowed to live because people "some" think that everyone has to choose sides or religion We are seen as a fair game for violent politics. <br /> <br /> 3) Israeli groups show victims of bombing. Another filmmaker used this event to push his own political agenda. Sometimes it's not about you. Some people think about "me, me". Sometimes it's a matter of others. <br /> <br /> 4) Idrissa Ouedraogo is a joke and another political scorer. Obviously they want money from the international community by emphasizing their poverty. Blah, blah, blah <br /> <br /> This film erased the memories of the victims "11 September 2001" < br /> <br /> The best thing for it is trash.
