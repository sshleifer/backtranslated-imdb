This is my first movie review about IMDb. I was forced to register after watching this movie. I can't have a good conscience, so I can't see this movie. People must be warned! <br /> <br /> First of all, my score is: 0 (as in "center") <br /> <br /> I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis and Christopher Walken and I still hate movies. This story has a plot, but who cares when there is no script. The dialogue is unrealistic and boring. The situation is planned, the flow of events is slow and there are no rules. Characters are not sympathetic and do not care and the story, although according to the evidence, is a good fool This movie is part of the crab. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about losing money in this movie. It's not worth the time you spent watching. Please don't see it ... I beg you!
