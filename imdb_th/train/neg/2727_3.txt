This oddity in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION does not need to be included because she is in the movie for less than 30 minutes. However, what she does is shine when she is on the screen. The nearer plot is just an excuse to show Warner players to receive a daily contract. JANCIE RULE shows promise and is a shame that she is not a big star. RUTH ROMAN handles the role of go-getter "with self-confidence Better if this is color The position of Travis Air Force Base with some rear projection works well. The best thing about this movie is the wonderful musical interlude. If you like THANK LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN, you'll like this one.
