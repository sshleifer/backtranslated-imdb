The theme of the film since its inception is the type that is associated with seductive women, which means temptation of weak men. But in their arms But still in a frightening situation that often results in harm to male victims Not tempted to be forced to take their medicine, and here Susan Lucci is shown as a siren, although her performance will be cut from the blood. Most of the plays are not enough to make her acting reliable. Isabelle (Lucci) The unstable wife of Stewart Collins (John O'Hurley) begins a love affair for fun with a yacht salesman, Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), just a bag for her. But Richard's seriousness was clearly hypnotized by his lover, while she took advantage of his enthusiasm by putting him in a risky plan to graduate in the form of malicious intent. When Davis was convinced that the tricky Isabel was the victim of assault by her husband, he tried hard to release her from what he felt was a husband and wife trap in order to marry himself. Own His fate will be found in a preliminary essay that hired a professional killer to get rid of the allegedly violent steward. After the assault of the man-attack, Collins, a police investigation by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, became more curious about Isabelle's involvement in the crime while at the same time being real In order to pay dear compensation for the inamorata encroachment, Lucci and Kasnoff were chosen as suitable collaborators, each giving a more tedious reading than a charming couple set, but O'Hurley and McDermott presented A strong reversal in movies that suffer from hacking situations. Non-creative direction and design elements Released on the DVD of this Fremantle, most of the shadows that showed a man under the spell of the deceiver benefited from the quality of the picture and sound on the plane and even without any special qualities.
