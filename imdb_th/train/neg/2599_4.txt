I got a very cheap DVD and I am all Drewbie and that may be the only group that this movie can give to anyone else's attention. <br /> <br /> Early Drew movies. She looks very good. Many of her love scenes, such as bathing scenes, sexy dance scenes, sexy costumes, etc. She has never shown the friendly charm we know from her latest movie. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is quite normal or low. These averages, and seems to have been built for more than one story for a TV film. There are no real horror stories or tensions, and the dialogue is always wonderful. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part is probably the end because I don't really understand. But may not have anything to understand But at least you don't come to the end you expect and it comes faster than you think. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this movie is for Drewbies especially.
