Some people here comment that this is the worst Elvis movie ever. They are only partially correct. For me, this is the worst movie ever made! I have never seen anything that is rude, vulgar and insulting and vile and against human nature as this film. The real shyness of this film industry is not bad. There is no fun filled with rubbish in the camp in Elvis's other bad movies, such as Clambake. This is rotten to sit through the painful, pure garbage. Native Americans should prosecute that they are old and poor. Treatment here In fact, every human being should be prosecuted for crimes and damage to this film. There are serious strains of all 0 stars. Grade: F
