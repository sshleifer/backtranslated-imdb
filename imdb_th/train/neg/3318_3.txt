How good is Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the movie that's right for you ... very bad that you have a complete role. I didn't read Jane Austen's book, but I couldn't believe it was superficial and the character wasn't even more than a caricature. It may not be easy to reduce the show in 2 hours, about 600 pages of books. But I expect to see only old furniture and tea cups I was relieved every time I saw an actor who didn't mark it too much (twice).
