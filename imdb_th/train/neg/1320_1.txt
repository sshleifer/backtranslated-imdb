This movie is what I expected when I first read the selection. I should write a more exciting plot. It is a pity that they left it with the Howler monkey. Alberto Tomba is a good skier. But he must thank God (And us too) that he does not have to rely on his actor skills to earn a living He can't play. He can't speak. He can't move well on the mainland without skiing ... Michelle Han Siker is a beautiful blonde girl. Obviously, she was not chosen for her remarkable abilities in the drama. But most probably because of her good legs However, I have to admit that she may be a Tomba acting teacher because he is an actor that is worse than her and it is funny, especially when considering that she is not Italian I laughed all the time watching this movie. I find it ridiculous and meaningless to make me laugh so loud.
