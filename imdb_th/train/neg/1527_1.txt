If you really want to waste two hours, do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Watch TV 2) Find movies 'Men in White' 3) When 'Men in White' arrives, sit and watch < br /> <br /> And that is, after listening to a bad punishment for two hours, citing horrible movies (And not a joke) and experiencing something that may have the lowest value ever created in history. Recently, you will lose two hours. Br /> <br /> Why am I doing this? I'm stupid enough to think that this movie might not be good. It's not. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are old enough to remember Power Rangers, you may see some familiar faces in the movie. Assumed that in order to save production costs, Saban (Who is the creator of the Power Rangers) has decided to sprinkle the old monster costume. I saw a young monster from the episode that I saw when I was a child, so I think at least I can say that It's worth thinking about <br /> <br /> But if you want to see the true power Monster Rangers go to see the Power Rangers themselves. It's much better than this garbage. (And that's what it says!)
