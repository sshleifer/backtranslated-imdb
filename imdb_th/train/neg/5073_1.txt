The teaser for the Tree of Palme tries to pass it as a comparison symbol for a fairy tale with true meaning. Then begin to rave about the animation immediately. I should know what that means Violent with bad repair for the girl he cared for. <br /> <br /> Like all movie characters, Palme is poorly defined. You are not bound to the character even though Shatta has already received a girlfriend. It seems that the writer is interested in cramming the drama and all the complexity he can in this movie, rather than exploring the inspiration and character of his character. <br /> <br /> New, useless stories are taken. Used in the last fifteen Movie minutes The author needs to update his story seriously. Maybe he tried to be an epic But it is too much information for a two hour movie However, I can't help but wonder if the plot has many dimensions and the characters should be more suitable for the TV series or graphic novels. <br /> <br /> In the last five minutes of the movie I can do it. Not tolerate the lack of quality anymore and begin to laugh at how the characters are all connected and plotted I touched my friend and he started to crack as well as a young man sitting behind us. We try hard to control ourselves. But we can't use the terrible quality of this movie. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, the animation is incredible, and the audience will find themselves admiring the lush backgrounds and characters that are there. Charming designs, animations almost will guide you. When you don't care about the character, it tells you how to feel.
