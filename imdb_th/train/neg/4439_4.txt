Yikes. This is terrible. The plays are not good in the beginning and the decision to transfer to filming is not good - especially when Peploe doesn't decide how she wants to maintain the origin of this drama. And decided to use an awesome editing style to remind you that you are watching a movie But in reality it is only to remind you that you are watching a movie that is terrible By her material Mira Sorvino's central performance is remarkably pathetic: the stage-y and plum are as if she were playing through the ivory works of Helena Bonham-Carter. Only Fiona Shaw shows the record - and it may be that her drama lineage means that she can handle the material the best - but it's hard to watch movies for solo performances alone. Although the show is light All of Shaw Ben Kingsley turned back on average and released his daughter, Rachel Sterling, daughter of Diana Rigg Stirling, playing as a supporting character. Sadly, Bertolucci's magic does not rub against his wife if this film is evidence.
