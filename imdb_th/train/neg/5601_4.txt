I watched this because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and presented Claudio Cassinelli, the actor I liked. I am absolutely disappointed. <br /> <br /> The idea that prisoners who are condemned to fight for death for organizing TV ratings is too much with Rollerball, Logan Run, Blade Runner and the new movie Death Race. Which of course will suck I entered because it was a star. Jason Statham <br /> <br /> This is just a boring part. The "Kill Bike" action is ridiculous. "Training" is a nap - a carnival. It never grabs me and makes I want to care about everyone including celebrities "Dallas" Jared Martin or Fred Williamson <br /> <br /> Choose one of the others mentioned and you will be better.
