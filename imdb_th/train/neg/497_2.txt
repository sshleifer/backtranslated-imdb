This is a very stupid movie. It may be fun with cool looking aliens and country settings. <br /> <br /> Some aliens have heard the broadcast of War of the Worlds when a small country radio station plays Halloween. They come to the world to kill humans. But instead of killing them, causing people to be their slaves and acting stupidly, the film's cover shows that aliens are riding a surfboard in space ... not what they do These are not the aliens of the party. They are stupid silly people and have annoying high modulation. The alien who has the most acceptable tone is the alien Jack Nicholson, who always wears his sunglasses. In addition to aliens, the performance is very bad. Clearly, writing is meaningful for children because every character is written like a child. <br /> <br /> This is a dumb movie that only children will appreciate. <br /> <br /> Score of Me: 1/2 from **** 100 minutes PG for mild language
