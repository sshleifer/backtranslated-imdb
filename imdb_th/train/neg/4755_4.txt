I think this movie is good in one part. The beginning is exciting. The first 30 minutes of the movie was good. The camera angle in the first 30 minutes was strange and I didn't like it because they didn't cover all the actors. <br /> <br /> I think the last 25 minutes of this movie are not as great as we expected. In the case of this movie, <br /> <br /> The dial doesn't make sense and I Do not think that they have a lot of flair. <br /> <br /> I feel like they're trying to mimic movies like mobile phones in terms of conversations. But failing miserably, it seems that they will show scenes between many actors. Is used for the benefit of it and does not make sense of any story. <br /> <br /> This movie has But the law and Ken <br /> <br /> I don't think it will be a waste. When it's a movie ok but not gr8
