This film makes you appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote. It's very boring in beautiful pictures when Hamilton goes quite easily in the Focus Soft shot. However, what I find difficult in this film is that even though Anja Schüte is about 19 years old when being shot, the girl will get a younger picture that is true All Lolita things, especially since having an old man involved make me quite uneasy. The heroine was shaved in the pubis area to make her look younger. Come on, sex is a good time in the past between adults who consent. Another thing that I found strange was that both Beart and Schüte had no nude scenes in this movie, at least not the right scene.
