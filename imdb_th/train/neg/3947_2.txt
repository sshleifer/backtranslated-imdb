In the modest cartoon, Alexandra Staden, who plays Modesty Blaise, looks like an anorectic fashion model. Politeness will not give advice to women to show more skin to get more money. I don't see any similarities with my comic book with Modesty and this movie. It's like the movie Mission Impossible. It's about Ethan Hunt, who was trapped in a high school detention room talking to a janitor when he went to junior high school. Sue If you're a Modesty fan, don't see the movie. You will be angry. If you don't know much about the comic book, Modesty rented another movie. Don't waste time on this. I don't understand that Quentin Tarantino can use his name. I will request a refund at my DVD rental shop tomorrow.
