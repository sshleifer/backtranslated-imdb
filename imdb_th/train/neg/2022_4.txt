This man received many good reviews in the book of criticism. Frankly, I found it too slow and not interesting from the beginning. I waited for a little steam. But never happened This movie has been very exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare and King James English have never been interested in me, so it may be me. There is a fair share in the first half of this movie when they show Ronald Colman as Othello. <br /> <br /> The advantages of this film include - thanks to the revived print. Filming movies and Shelly Winters that are small, slim and attractive. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is too boring, too redundant in some scenes to watch again. In addition, we all know that most actors are crazy. But still has the glory of Hollywood to show in this story
