This is the worst movie I've ever seen! Molly (Molly Hall) can't do anything! She has no emotions at all. It's all blah blah blah like she read from boring textbook books. Clever children and children who love food (The name is not worth remembering). It was so annoying that I was mad. Mollys Dad showed a lack of emotions about his missing daughter Police officers and father Mollys talk the same way four times. It was really scary. All over and over again Beatrice should have something bad going on with her because of being heartless. I just wasted my time watching this movie!
