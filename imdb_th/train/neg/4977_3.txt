This is a movie created for the TV and does not require repeated sci-fi channels to tell the story of Beowulf, especially after the latest 2005 movie "Beowulf and Grendel". We went through a fight with a terrifying creature known as Grendel because it left the kingdom with fear and chaos while the powerful Viking warrior Beowulf was called. To get rid of them Rampage of monsters If this was accomplished, the king would not have to sacrifice children. After a few failed attempts, the animal was killed. But it was furious and angry. The mother soon attacked, letting it go. Wolfe again lent his great power and courage to overcome it. "Grendel" seems to be shot with a small budget and A CG effects are terrible, as I said that this movie is not really necessary.
