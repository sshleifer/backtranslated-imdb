I will give credit to writer / director William Gove to find someone to raise funds for "thrilling". A good argument for not wasting money on subscribing to HBO is to buy a DVD alone. Dennis Hopper, the pedestrian and the Richard Grieco game does not add anything to their resumes, although the art is not half bad. The conversation will make you feel scary with doubt. This is the worst storytelling. No tension, no doubt, no fear, no fear, no care, no stomach, nothing Attractive and nude girls often increase boredom. But this is the best movie seen as an example. I feel sorry about this guy who is Green Light. Suitable for late night visits and viewing only. You have been warned
