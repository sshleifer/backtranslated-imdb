The RIVERS CRIMSON is one of the unresolved truths and beyond all that I've seen from France. There is nothing worse than producing a French film that tries to make a movie made in Hollywood and CR is a perfect example of horror / action / buddy. I almost stopped it. Half way because I know it's not worth anything except the French people who try to show off. <br /> <br /> The film began to shine as though the horror was extensive, but quickly changed from horror. Position, into action as the file type x to flick a friend that in the end all and there is no CR. It is full of ancient ideas that at one point I thought the whole story was funny. Those painful and quiet conversations disappeared and faded away and faded in the right moment, causing me to lament. I think the movie created in Hollywood uses this piercing technique. <br /> <br /> The chase scene with Vincent Castle runs as a killer, so it's almost overstated. Will be a matter of beauty The peak at the top of the hill, along with the stupid revelation about the killer with Cassel and Reno, playing "buddies" like Nolte and Murphy in the last 48 hours, making this film a little credible. <br /> <br> > Difficult to believe that the director THE CRIMSON RIVERS directed GOTHIKA, which, despite problems But did not get close to the horrors of the movie that was too confused about this
