Awesome, awesome TV show! Why Comedy Central decided to repeat the old episodes of this program beyond me? It's really bad! Of course I'm talking about the season after the first two. The first two seasons are golden, and if I talk about these seasons, especially this show, there will be eight to ten stars. There are no comedians who appear after the first two seasons that are not part of a good casting. They are scary and funny, not funny at all !!! <br /> <br /> The original actors are full of talented comedians such as Arty, Phil and Mary North (Or her name) everyone should receive a better offer This show has a lot of exaggeration and is worth the time to surf your channel less than Saturday Night Live, which is another scary program. Go out on Saturday night and have fun and let MAD TV wither and die as it should be
