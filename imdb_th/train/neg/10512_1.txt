I rent this flick for one reason, Tom Savini. I respect his work. But this is true. I have a scary ancient idea. Half of the film is a naked woman called sometimes "Blair Witch". Animated black and white scenes provoked a camera. Tom's character is really scary. It's a scary script. And you have to love these lines that they use "There is someone outside that isn't funny." No, but your performance is I hope I will give this flick 0! Oh, the name of the character Judd, Molly, the ally, Emilio, but they leave Anthony, the breakfast club reunite in the forest of forgiving performances.
