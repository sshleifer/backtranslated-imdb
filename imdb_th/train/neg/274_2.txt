There seems to be little in the way of the middle ground associated with Watch On the Rhine. Any one likes it. Very much appreciate sincerity, liberal views and good performances. Overall inclination I fall into the latter category very much and find movies and plays - about the activities of European refugees in Washington during the war - a tiring job worthwhile for performances and periodically. Lillian Hellman, beside the angel, is not involved. Her plays were written for those who share her views, and she rarely explores the ideas that the author and the audience did not, except that it pointed out how "other side" was scary. Although I found myself falling a hundred percent with what she said, as in Rhine - I still couldn't stand the way she spoke. Her character is not true, and while her ears for conversation show some facilities for the way people say that she has no real intelligence or originality. She really has nothing new to say. I fully agree with the destruction of Mary McCarthy's long-standing Hellman last year. For those who think that the theater is dead or is in the extremes and longing for the good old days, I look at Watch On the Rhine, which is terrible as Angels In America, which shows just how In the tomb sixty years ago
