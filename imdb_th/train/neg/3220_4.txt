I absolutely hate it when one movie is separated near the end after you have invested one hour. And that's what happened to this movie I was intrigued by the actors and the fact that Malamud wrote the story. I didn't read that. But I can't imagine that it will end like this movie ends. I'm lucky I didn't pay to watch or rent because my library has it. Oh, wasted a great performance. (Especially very perfect wife) Now it's funny I didn't research about building But it plays as if the director made his marble or died 3/4 of the story through the movie Before that point, the story and the characters were developing, with a lot of organized points and not wasting too much time. But Oh, it takes 1/2 hour - if that's not the storyline, the worst worthless thing I've ever seen. I hate when that person's faith is destroyed. It feels like a violent act.
