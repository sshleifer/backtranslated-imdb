Just showing Sean Connery as a Harvard lawyer. Kate Cap Shaw (Is she still working?) As his wife (Slightly different age) and Lawrence Fishburn are the Southern Police (!) And Ed Harris Of a fundamentalist Southern serial killer. <br /> <br /> Weird actors, but this movie plays with the audience seriously. ** (Do not read if you intend to watch the movie. This seriously, or watch this movie seriously because the destroyer) First of all, I feel myself stripping my eyes repeatedly at the pattern. Liberal: Every police has a habit of abuse. Black people have no evidence The coroner, witness and even the lawyer of the accused collaborated with him. (He was accused of raping and killing a young girl) because he was a black person. <br /> <br /> Connery is a Harvard law professor who gives passion. Make a speech about injustice to black people and the death penalty He was approached by the judge's grandmother to protect him and reopen the trial. <br /> <br /> Connery was extracted (gaping ...) by a small town officer. And the IL's Good Child Club, but found that the alleged murderer Blair's case, which is now in the line of death, was all invented. The main evidence is his confession that was beaten by him. <br /> <br /> The dance was performed by a black police (!) Who even played Russian roulette to confess from him. Connery found that another prisoner in the prison executed a real murder, and after a few people with severe symptoms, Hannibal, the narrator like Ed Harris, knew that Harris hid Avu. Where is the murder? <br /> <br /> He has been sentenced again and Blair is released. <br /> <br /> I think ... this movie .... < br /> <br /> Suddenly! It turns out that Blair is a psychopathic psychopath and he uses "White offense" to join Connery He composed the story with Ed Harris in return for Blair making a few murders for Harris. <br /> <br /> Blair now comes back with thanks to Connery's lost PC principle! The last 30 minutes is an action movie. A strange action that has been attached to a legal drama, Connery and Fishburn, fighting a serial killer in a gruesome crocodile house on a pole. (Yes, you read it correctly) in Everglades. <br /> <br /> That's a strange movie. <br /> <br /> So the whole system is damaged and ineffective. The police are just bullies. And those who tortured Abu as well But criminals are psychopaths and deserve to be <br /> <br /> Truly downhill at all levels! The system is completely rotten and the PC with a white conscience, which defies the system is severely overlooked. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down. Obviously Connery had to make a mortgage payment or something.
