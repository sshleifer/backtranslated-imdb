Borkborg vampires dominate the world and use human blood as fuel. However, there will be changes in energy due to the traitorous robot (Chris Kristofferson) and the female warrior (Kathleen Long) while facing Lance Henriksen and Gary Dae Niels (Cyborg's player in ridiculous movies) from all the questions that have not yet been answered by the horrifying movie. The most painful thing is who's thinking is Chris Chris. Kristofferson Country singer. Do not understand me wrong. I see that Kristofferson Is a vigilante or something But not a robot Strange one wondering what this was written for Dolph Lundgren, but Lundgren must have wisdom that will not do. However, despite the terrible selection of actors Kristofferson Is the most fun thing about movies He gave more human performances (and Kristofferson Is playing a robot), even if it's a joke Kristofferson Lance Henriksen was knocked out, and Gary Daniels wasted, but in general, the knight failed. You stand back with fear of wondering who thought this was a good idea on paper. (This is the movie that Kristofferson That part of the organ is fighting against the robot in the backpack.) The worst thing is that it ended up in the sequel, if luckily this story is not true even though I still have a nightmare about such an opportunity. < br /> <br /> * from 4 (not good)
