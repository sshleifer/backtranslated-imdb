This is an art film created in 1969 or 1972 (National Film Conservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb say 1972). This film seems to indicate a certain time, regardless of the exact date - by The work of cameras and pop art styles that are pure in the late 60s to the early 70s. Early 60s <br /> <br /> The film consists of Of three simple, distorted images using strange techniques of the camera. These distorted images come with music and without any interaction or plot, apparently with the same intent as the form of performing arts and Like most performing arts, it's interesting at first. But quickly became boring This film that will bring it more openly is boring and will not be ignored. But may be the person who created the movie, their family and friends, and there may be a few people who are too hip and "with it" so that we can understand mortals
