This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, ridiculous graphics and pathetic scripts, and the biggest question is that this relatively low script will have a selection process. <br /> <br /> I like all kinds of movies from Deep drama to the male genre that kills everything you see in the movie, so I can't say I'm meticulous. I'm struggling to find something to compare. But I can't think of anything that matches this. Maybe it's the Starship 2 spacecraft. In my opinion, the movie God cried and I thought to throw my DVD player, but compared to this effect. It's great. Great performances and scripts should be rewarded. Did you know that when this movie is not good in a funny way, many people are not one of those people who kill your soul in minutes.
