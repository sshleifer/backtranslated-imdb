Very bad! Why don't you use real actors? Look, this must stop! Stop using non-actors! If you need credibility or any message sent through these cheap films ... please let God's love use real actors! Most are free to use ... Take advantage of that! Now back to my opinion ... However, humor is lower than the variety of bathrooms and not funny at all levels for quality ... In one scene filmed on public buses, you can see the reflection of the crew. .. Guess what? It's a man who looks like a Sony camera and probably isn't his. I consider the only audience for this movie is someone with a blood-amulet fetish ... and it's not good.
