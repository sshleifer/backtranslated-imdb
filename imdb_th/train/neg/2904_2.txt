If during the first 10 minutes of this film, you do not know that the main character who wrote the Life Advice column is going to have a table - Oh - wisely, turn and learn some precious life lessons of yourself. There may be something wrong with you. The setting can be predicted to destroy the movie, even if the rest of the movie is good (which is not). <br /> <br /> There is almost no chemical reaction between the lead and Stalker-ish of Steve Carell. Joke It is hard to believe that Binoche's characters are interested in him. Then, in the end, it ended miraculously and everyone lived a happy life forever. That's not a great America!
