This is a Japanese movie. But some people speak English It's a lovely movie and has beautiful pictures that are beautiful in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> However, that's the only rewarding feature for me The story is generally boring. Who wants to see a girl who laments 90 percent of this movie because her "picture" husband is much older than he advertised? Actually it may be a lazy person ... but grab it. <br /> <br /> In the past 10 minutes, she looks dead. Then, for most viewers, it was too late. We have already fallen asleep.
