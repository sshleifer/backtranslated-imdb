This movie is not good. Bad performances, bad governance, bad writing But it wasn't bad in a funny way It's terrible in a boring way. I watched "Surface to Air" because I thought it might be a laugh. It's not. Don't make mistakes. I do. There are many fun ways to spend an hour and a half like watching dry colors Reading dictionary Seriously.
