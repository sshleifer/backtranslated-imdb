Okay, I'm dying to watch this movie. Talk about "Who's who" in the horror lands in the movie .... My friends rent this thing, bring it and we start to watch it. It should be a joke .... I don't smile even once until 40 minutes. <br /> <br /> Is it related to the budget? In fact, there are no movies out there, at a cost close to absolutely nothing, and they are amazing. In addition, while watching this movie, I couldn't help but realize the similarities. (Such as theft) with limited budget indie movies called "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE". Read my review about this.> <br /> This movie ... It has real potential. "Star power" stolen plot (Make movies behind the scenes of creating movies ... IE ... "APOCALYPSE ACTRESS" .... Seriously, this angers me more, I think about) ... It's really funny. Many jokes fail. The show is okay for what it is. But it was dragged, not a joke and the plot was completely stolen. <br /> <br /> I gave this two because it wasn't SOOO AWFUL, but that's the only reason.
