I really want to like this movie. But eventually bored and did not believe The first match is the camera feed from robots that travel to explode and become shaky. But then the rest of the movie will remain in shakycam mode, even during a quiet conversation time to the point of vain. Rented houses out of tripods and steadicams? The fact that it was taken on the 16 mm day did not help anything because the film was detailed and shaky. <br /> <br /> For every effort that Bigelow put into vehicles and equipment. The correct errors and obvious inconsistencies that they destroy the credibility of the movie. <br /> <br /> - The car will not erupt in the fire after a single shot and when it is swallowed. Will not be extinguished with A small fire extinguisher held by hand. <br /> <br /> - Humvee alone will not drive around Baghdad in 2004, but will be supported by other vehicles in the event of a broken or attacked vehicle - as It is extremely difficult to attack the insurgents in the long run, where the bullets clearly show that it takes only one second to reach the target. <br /> <br /> - I believe the bombs were taken to Removal area specified in or Creeps base is not a random point in the desert <br /> <br /> - Attack of the tanker took place in the Green Zone, which indicates that the area is very safe, with very few attacks from the inside. Most zones are offices and palaces with a few residential areas. But it was a dangerous image of dark alleys and lurking lurks Oddly, James never had a problem with the ridiculous tactics of ordering his two companions to go to each other on their own, so setting up a kidnapping attempt <br /> <br /> - Speaking like This 3-man team is often a clear building, chasing insurgents and others on their own, even though there are dozens of soldiers. <br /> <br /> - The team must stare at the insurgents. How many hours outside to see if he wasn't /> <br /> d do not have to create shots <br show. Viewers see how the size and layout of the base is, or how much it relates to Baghdad. I do not know how the EOD team reports and there are no other characters. This is what the characters will know, so we should do so. <br /> <br /> "Surprised" and various scenes can be predicted. perfect Yes, it is obvious that the Colonel, a psychiatrist, will have problems with the Iraqi people that he is trying to move with. Choosing a cereal home will be overwhelming and the kidnapped driver will not wait for you when you leave the car > <br /> Finally, the lack of character development is almost complete. Renner's characters from the beginning have a relationship at home, hardship, daredevil and adrenaline. He is the same at the end of the movie. What's the point? <br /> <br /> If this is the best Iraq war movie ever, it's a sad story. Just half an hour I saw, I would like to introduce Generation Kill with HBO instead.
