Priyadarshan- Whenever someone hears his name, his first thought is 'funny'. That's what this guy is known for, or rather known. After giving a great blockbuster comedy like Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train was slowly hit with movies like Chupke Chupke and a few others that I can't remember the name right now. There is now an ugly movie like Dhol. The first word that will make our minds after hearing his name is - 'Torture'. <br /> <br /> Dhol is a mixture of funny jokes, unsightly toilets, suspense and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol is one or two scenes, which is a joke, even without being witty, and secondly, except Kunal Khemu and a grumpy grandmother. <br /> <br /> Talk about acting. Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi is on top (if you compare them with others in the movie) then Tusshar Kapoor. Then Tanushree and finally the two people mentioned above, the flaws in Kunal Khemu is that he is loud in his jokes and even Even in his performance Grandma looks like a ghost in the beginning and she is not funny. But rather stupid. <br /> <br /> That story too Four boys follow the girls and need money. But with a slight twist There is a man who is 'bad' that is stupid and stupid. And finally, goodness wins over the bad and everything is fine The idea of ​​having Dhol with a voice full of cash in it is not witty. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about a movie is its length. After about an hour, you will feel tired and want to leave the theater. But being a critic, it is my responsibility to allow the film for two and a half hours. This film continues and the same type of joke will happen over and over again, and the situation will stand in a different place. <br /> <br /> If your mother-in-law comes home and starts Mock you all and send you to watch this movie and have fun 3 out of 10
