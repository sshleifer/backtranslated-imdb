This should be my type of movie. Even if it was sucked, it should still be in my alley. I like the movie "Congo" and "Allan Quatermaine". I have a weakness in my mind for aliens / demons / adventure. Let's see why I decided to watch at first. <br /> <br /> 1 Horror / Sci-fi always interested me 2 I'm a big fan of archaeologists and this film deals with rare treasures 3. The supernatural enemy with quality FX 4. Christian Slater and Dorf in general I like 5. Tara <br /> <br /> So this movie Therefore has the least potential in the horror cheese category of video stores But boy sucking ass The only exchange is Slater and Dorf and not everyone who finds them is as fun as I do ... I mean, come face to face both of these. But now goes to some mistakes. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid, although the overall movie is getting worse But Reid's performance is really bad. We not only talk badly, I'm talking about the nomination of Tara Reid for the worst performance of the year. I don't know if she has the ability to perform or not. But playing the curator of the museum is not in her group ... completely watching. She tries to carry a scientist with education, not unlike what you watch in bad pornography. I mean, it's not bad. But it's terrible to laugh Oh, and for those you want to see, you are not naked, just go down in an unseen love scene without needing <br /> <br /> Even with Reid's performance, maybe this movie may work. But the plot is influential and the plot seems to be written by 10 years old. I didn't realize that this was a video game adaptation until after watching the DVD, otherwise I would like stupidity. Unleashed in real time <br /> <br /> The story jumped from the childhood of Slater at the orphanage where he received the terrible things that happened. In his adult life, Slater was recruited by some 713 units, a paranormal army that hunted evil or something. The blame must go out because he is too rebellious. I guess you never really knew unless it was in one of the voices I received during The movie begins with Slater's hunt, hunting for his latest piece after contacting "A Chilean mercenary who specializes in selling rare artifacts" I may say wrongly. But you get the idea. <br /> <br /> There is an evil doctor who wants to release hell on earth. (Unreasonable) Experiment with Super Mara / Alien - Hybrids. Human "Tonic" bullets (The devil can't stand in the sun) and of course Slater and Dorf try to help everyone. <br /> <br /> Jesus I can't wade through Ancient elements The script requires repeated operations to limit focus and provide some depth. I mean, why is this evil scientist cursing evil? Yes, humanity is already doomed and he just tries to keep the human race. I guess he was infected? how did this happen? Oh yes, he has a demonic thing in the cage and pulls blood to shoot himself. how did this happen Why and where did he get excellent ammunition? (Yes, they used the old sci-fi that stood by the parasitic aliens / demons that "assimilated" with the spine of their host). Of course, Slater is like a half-super-slug blade blade, but his ammunition trunk. "Not fully fuse due to electric shock" Thank God Oh and those who have "assimilated" these do not know that they are half-demon aliens and act as good members of the community until there are some secret signs that they change the killer zombies. Yes, we have received zombies. <br /> <br /> So many shit that may be entertaining, but not at all. <br /> <br /> In addition, the ending is completely stupid because everything turns out to be. The big deal that needs to be resolved at first ... At least nothing is that the dynamite bomb cannot be managed. <br /> <br /> Not the worst thing you will see.
