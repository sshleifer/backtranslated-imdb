This movie is a junk that is confusing. You never know what happened. The characters were poorly written and most of them were not sympathetic at all except Gus (played by George Eads, expert). But compared to others (Dark Harvest, Dracula Curse), it should have won an Academy Award. It is very sad to see the talented actor like George Eads in an infamous and tasteless movie. The life you sink low to a whole new low level People want to make sure that this director will not work in the movie again. This should be a horror movie because it's more funny, scary. For a lifetime shame for shame
