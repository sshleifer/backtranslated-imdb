Nick Cage is Gates, a treasure hunter (Oh, sorry ... treasure "guardian", no matter what it means). The descendants of treasure hunters. One of his ancestors received clues about the location of the great treasures that most of our founding fathers, if not all Freemasons, decided to hide because they didn't want all their freedom money. <Br /> <br /> The first clue became a long lost ship that was hidden in the Arctic. The door and his team consists of Ian Financier (Sean Bean), Doc Riley. (Justin Bartha, the immortal "Gigli") and a faceless wireless partner come into the cargo ship. They leaked out of the bulk of the gunpowder as soon as they were on the ground, not that they were meant in any way. Finally, they found clues. (The skeleton is hovering over) and it turns out that it is a pipe that has been written ... on it, sort of. Don't ask me to explain. <br /> <br /> It's a mystery, and although the fact that his travels are not clear To find the true treasure, Gates walked around to find a puzzle. In this frozen luggage room while the crew stood idle I mean come Some people should be a little vocal in their disappointment to travel to the Arctic and find nothing interesting. But they stood there while the door into his own world to solve the mystery. <br /> <br /> The next clue will become the Declaration of Independence. Ian decides to steal it. The door is shocked. Various characters present horrendous expressions. (Familiar with it) all this led to the descendants of Ian pulling a gun in the gate and the gunpowder exploded violently. (Oh, that's why they're all gunpowder! Eh and his companions escaped and Gates and the movie Doc Riley walked nine miles in temperatures below zero to go to the Inuit village. <br /> <br >> To stop them, Gates will Conclusion After trying the FBI and Super Archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), Gates and Riley have to steal it themselves. Riley then told Gates thoroughly why they could not steal the Declaration because it was protected with metal eyes and lasers and advanced safety. Then the door told Riley that there was an opportunity to steal it from the storage room. Riley knows what the storage room is. The door asks? "The place where they make jams and jellies" I'm not kidding; That is the real line. Bartha doesn't send jokes as well. So Riley did all the research about the National Library and the archives and water and sewage, but didn't know what the storage room was. This indicates what the level of this script is. <br /> <br /> To make this remaining period shorter, Gates did something wrong with the D of I in a ridiculous destruction that might happen. (I hate the way they describe computer technology in movies - full of graphics and fonts that are improbable and unusable). Abigail Chase has tagged for convenience and can be seen. Clear At one point, as the three of them away from the law, discuss plans for all of them as much clothing store surrounded by people <br /> <br /> A series of clues and the kidnapping of his door. Played by Jon Voight, the patient leads to good people and bad people, as well as the large Indiana Jones fun house located under New York City. Strange that subway builders have never encountered this. Ian Gates and Gates bring Gates to chase wild goose Ian believes that they were trapped in the alleyway and left them there. However, after they left, Riley asked how they could go out. ... <br /> <br /> ... Oh, boy ... <br /> <br /> .. . Press the button and the door will open. Not me seriously The buttons are just as they have in the toilet space in the office building. The good thing that he knows where However, after having more swirling buttons, they find a great treasure room. (Remember, this is all under Manhattan!) Which is filled with many historic things. Riley was again delivered a really stupid line and FBI staff Harvey Keitel forgave them, seized Sean Bean and allowed two leading actors to marry. <br /> <br /> For any audience I think it's hard to ignore all the revelations. The logic and characters are very fixed. Although some of its exhibitions are related to good historical lessons that are inserted in the conversation at random times. I want more conversations like that in my life.
