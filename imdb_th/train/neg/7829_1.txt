The beginning of the 1990s brought many "strange" and "off-beat" independent films, which were specific sub-genres, a crime movie in the semi-spiritual desert. Other notes were "Wild at Heart", "From Dusk Til. Dawn "and at one level," Natural Born Killers ", good movies such as Garbage that turned out like" Highway 666 "," Destiny Turns on the Radio "and an inefficient anti-resistance masterpiece" Under The Hula Moon ". That aims to The exact mood But still reaches the point of causing irritation While pursuing the spirit world of the desert and the casting of Chris Penn is a good idea. But the film is not dirty or difficult enough to be a good crime movie. I won't blow the ending. But said that it was bad This film is a bad side effect of type cancer. This is the garbage of India.
