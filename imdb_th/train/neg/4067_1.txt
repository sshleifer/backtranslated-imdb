Am I wrong or the 2007 version is just peeling off the original? I have to ask because the DVD that I just bought is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ..... bad performances, bad edits, etc ... the only "exploitation" aspect here. Is the way we are copied for us Money to buy this shit It is nothing more than a lightweight porn flick ... No real blood, no scary images, just garbage that has been done. If anyone wants to see a great movie with no actors, some names, blood flowing and a good story ... get Baby Blood ... it's done at a cheap price, but doing well ... and the story is too real. But I will keep it to laugh .... it's pathetic! New comments .... 3 Sep ..... I will keep this movie forever because it's terrible. It's almost good .... in a really bad way ... The performance that Worst ... Classic, real movie shit!
