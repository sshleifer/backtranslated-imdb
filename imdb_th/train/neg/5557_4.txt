OK, but that makes this movie a good thing, isn't it really? In my opinion, there is not much to suggest. I find it very slow, boring. In fact, it can be very predictable and through. And two predictable But not so much. I feel that this movie is quite a camp sometimes, which I do not think is suitable for this series and the character Jeff Fay plays the bad guy in this sector. He is a good actor. But I felt that he played his character to the top. I guess it was suitable for the tone of the movie which would be great if I liked this movie. Plus there was a terrible torpedo. Arnold Vosloo came back in the title role. But getting a little to work with in this movie, the characters have not really developed as I had hoped for. Well, this is just my opinion. But for me while this movie is It is not quite good. Vote for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
