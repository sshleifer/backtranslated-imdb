Maybe this is not fair because I can only do half way through the movie. One of the few things I can't see because of insanity. <br /> <br /> The performance is terrible. The camera's performance is terrible. The plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is unrealistic. For example - During the negotiation, coke coke will be stored in the briefcase - I have no expertise. But I think people tend to put in their bags. <br /> <br /> They use the same stupid effects. Whenever the punch is thrown (It was the sound of 'stomping' the north end) and they used a toy gun that was voiced. <br /> <br /> The worst movie ever.
