I can't know who will get the budget for this bad movie. It's like a desperate television station in everything. They were buried under a snow, electrical currents will be turned on and off continuously. Where does this light (fake) come from? That and the stupid things that fight between the characters They seem to be more interested in complaining than trying to invent ways to survive. It tries to create feelings of emergency and help people. But since it's a very bad acting and acting, you won't fix your Florence Nightingale with a flick. I joined the negative response and I confirm that this is one of the worst movies ever.
