It's "The F.B.I." starring Reed Hadley, with handsome guests! The movie begins with kidnapping (conveniently) by accident which leads to one thing and another - which does not indicate the main story which is "The Big House in the United States" The Breakout Story The story is not very likely to say less. It's like "violent" TV programs only (for times) <br /> <br /> But - actors are traveling! Imagine this: Ralph Meeker was sent to prison. His roommates are the following criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (Read "Muscle" magazine!) And William Talman (Read "Detective" magazine!) Honest! You should know that the first scene reveals what happened to the "missing" boy. Accepting the "voice-over" ending. If you don't want to hang, don't miss the opening scene between "Iceman" and the boy (year Votrian do good asthma asthma) <br /> <br /> *** Big house, United States (1955) Howard W. Koch ~ Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
