Not long ago, they tried to honk this movie late at night with cable television commercials. Do not believe advertising. I am one of the unfortunate people who have seen the smelly person in the cinema. This is my opinion. The 3rd worst movie of all time is behind Mac & Me (the # 1 worst) and Jack Frost (# 2 worst). Actually, there is nothing in this movie, funny or disturbing, or anything that claims to be, so don't waste your money. The only good thing for giving to your worst enemy is I didn't lie about that. The person you love to kill or torture will be an important candidate for this film. It's so terrible. If you don't believe me, you should suffer from misery in watching this, which I suspect you can do. Both thumbs down enthusiastically
