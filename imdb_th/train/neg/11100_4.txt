Like traditional stories, there are very high expectations for this film. (Especially when Barker is crazy about the interview) finally see it and what can I say? It's all substance! The director is all over the place. The performance is brutal. The flashy image and choreography are quite flat, completely empty and unnecessary. (What happened to general music video techniques like nonsense, Moe went ahead slowly, right? Do not want in this movie and make the feeling become MTV Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo music video While some of the killings are cool and cruel. But there is something laughing ridiculously (The first murder of a Japanese girl is hilarious and the death of Ted Raimi is a stupid joke). At the end, at that point, it felt more messy. There is no explanation at all. I mean, I know what happened when I read this. But for people who don't have more confusion at times, even though I don't know where to go and what I'm trying to do - it happens like crazy all the time. <br /> <br /> God, I want to like movies. This story is great because I am a big fan of Barker's work and like stories that have enormous potential. For the movie that broke the hell, I enjoyed Kitamura's movie as a fun romps, but this movie was just full of amateur and silly from beginning to end - I didn't care about anyone or anything. The story of the rush and severely curtailed The true source makes it totally different. Get it gory and Vinnie Jones plays wonderful badass, but everything else is all over the place, rather disappointing, very sorry.
