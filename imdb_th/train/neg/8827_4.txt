I love flickering in the 80s and I remember when "Silent Night / Deadly Night" was pulled from our theater. I was so disappointed that I was so excited to see these things in Fear.net You Better Watch Out is what I expected from this type of movie. The quality of the special effects is ridiculous. According to today's standards, character development is too long. But all that laughs out loud. Funny! <br /> <br /> The scene that he lost because Santa or his father was feeling his mother and later when the crowd showed the torch, the fire - not the torch you wanted in the 80s, but the real torch! - really stimulate my funny bones However, the scene that he was monitoring the children in his neighborhood made me feel creepy in a different nature. I also enjoy thinking about who these actors are. I think the main character is the cute teddy bear of the brothers.
