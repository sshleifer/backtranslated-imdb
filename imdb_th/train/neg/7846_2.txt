Do you know? I went to see "The hill with 2 eyes". I want to like it. I really like the original and the new creation is quite fun. Obviously they have more money to throw around. Wes Craven made a second special technique. Although I still like the original movie But the remake was well done and it was a delight to me. Special effects that are intense and excellent. In short, a great popcorn movie for horror fans. <br /> <br /> Which leads us to "The Hills have eyes 2" Where will I start? Plot or lack, it is thin paper We did not destroy the new area here. The soldiers decided to check the area and all these people disappeared. So what will we do now? Came to send the National Guard to investigate In the true Hollywood fashion, we have to make them the stupid and the worst soldiers ever seen. I never saw that evidence before. In order to make the short story short, you must mutate, kill the soldiers, moron one by one in graphic form. Nicotero's special effects are excellent again. But killing no matter how boring and predictable the graphics are. For me, it seems that this flick can be done just to grab a quick buck. It's blood and graphics. But I think it can be predictable, boring and not scary at all. For me, it would be nice if this movie had one original idea, Craven and his son, shared the writing duties and he was involved in many favorite horror movies. But sadly this is not one of them
