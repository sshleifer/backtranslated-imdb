4 out of 16 previous voters, how can this movie be 10? How do I have more than half of the eligible voters? 7 or higher. Who voted here? I can only think of it as a child - a very small child. The truth is that this is a bad movie in all aspects. The story is stupid. The performance is hard to imagine as a show; The character has no characteristics And the conversation is very bad I saw this afternoon raining on a sci-fi channel. In a tragic event with repeated broadcasts, I suggest you read the book instead.
