Murder By Numbers is one of the movies that you think is made for TV, but not when considering the only actor of any note is Bullock (although Michael Pitt seems to be moving towards something bigger and better) but It is not surprising that this movie will fade away from the memories quickly. Like ... remember that lock your front door when you go out. Or wearing new clothes when you leave the shower. <br /> <br /> Bullock plays the role of Cassie Mayweather, a policeman with personal problems. (Not all) together with her new partner (Ben Chaplin, who looks wet) She was called to investigate a murder of a young woman. There is nothing wrong there, except that perps are two teen students who think they have planned and executed the perfect murder. The battle of the will occurs between Cassie and the main suspect Richie Haywood. (Ryan Gosling) <br /> <br /> The problem that can't be bent here is that both leaders are desperate. Bullock, although she looks very good. But can believe in the role of a cynical policeman like Rodney Dangerfield (in fact, he should be better!) Chaplin for his guilt is a completely irrelevant organization and I regret that he had to put This film is in his personal history in an attempt to break into the hall. At least Gosling and Pitt as a stubborn suspect As if the maneuvering was not good enough, the story to send someone to sleep and the last predictable scene (But without reason) Highly filming this movie in the head before it had a chance to run. <br /> <br /> "Murder By Numbers" Nothing happened to it, even the pointless nude scenes by Bullock. Can not be exchanged A little good But still not enough to save Which is memorable, predictable and redundant - this is a movie that will not move the police forward As Cassie said in her next case, there was nothing for the people to see and move on.
