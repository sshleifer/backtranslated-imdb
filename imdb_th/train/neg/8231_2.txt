There may be a spoiler ... but it can really be separated !!. <br /> <br /> Five across the eye can be summed up in one word .... amateur, this movie tries best. That is different from most movies by filming the movie 'Blair Witch' .... It doesn't work ... it ended up looking and feeling like someone had a cheap video camera And decided to create a movie This story does not have a description. The protagonists are not real inspiration. (And it seems that lesbians wear power suits compared to the five girls) and there is no violence to speak of ... just screaming and loud noises This film takes place inside the van, which means beautiful scenery is not a problem. All five girls do the best with what they have received. But overall, as an awesome actress ... even though the content makes it difficult to determine if they can actually do it, they use the movie THE WHOLE to scream and groan and moan .... Until half the time, it was difficult to speak out and the camera was really bad. It was really hard to tell who was speaking. This video depicts itself as a serious torture movie. But in reality, there are five girls in the van who are screaming in fear ... that is the sum of the whole movie ..... We reach the end after what looks like 5 hours screaming. And the five girls are still alive ... with one finger deletion Raise your finger to just one finger (understand ... finger .... lol) for an actress who is trying hard and may lose sound. (And their pride) after creating this horrible movie Don't judge this from the poster .... You will be very disappointed.
