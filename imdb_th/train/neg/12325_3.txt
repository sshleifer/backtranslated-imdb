I can remember that performance I still remember the fun song kicking "America's Funniest People" ass. Frankly, it should have been a lame or bad American name or completely disgusting. Dave was unable to record this program and Bob Saget was unable or able to replace the host for AFV that came later. But this show went to hell because there were people who sent a crappy video. It has also developed into a variety program with guest stars including Olson Twins Plus AFV being in a great position before they begin to choose children who are disrespectful as winners. Am I talking about videos that are nasty and weak? But still rock music theme!
