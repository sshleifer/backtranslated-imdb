Ah, this movie has great potential! Good quality actor B, Jessica Simpson's thighs and ... that's about it. <br /> <br /> I believe that some unnamed men in the marketing department have ideas. Basically, make a Legally Blond movie, but do it in New York. A big city that is bright with opportunities, opportunities, energy and money, and everyone is hungry for energy and money. Try adding to Jessica Simpson, a small town, Owen's Wilson's brother, and there's no clear reason for Andy Dick. (Because he should be interested in this movie) <br /> <br /> Basic story: <br /> <br /> Boy from New York, girl followed, boy scam, girl in New York with cousin , Accepting work under false pretenses, mucks up, being courted by other boys kissing <br /> <br /> Just don't watch movies. This unit will Happier One reviewer spoke of Guantanamo and I certainly agreed with him. This film caused a shock. And I know what you are thinking ... at least at some point I will see Simpson naked or too close It won't happen. Give yourself time. You will have a better sexy time. <br /> <br /> Movie editing is subtle. The show is unbearable and why they use the blue screen. <br /> <br /> In summary ; This is a betrayal to the theater that should be punished for the most. <br /> <br /> Another question, why Willie Nelson often plays as a good father in almost every flick? And why there is no black, Latin, Asian or European People in this movie?
