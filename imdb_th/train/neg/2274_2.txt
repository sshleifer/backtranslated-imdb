I hate Hollywood But love movies so i have to watch horrible movies in the cinema And I hope Vanilla Sky will be a good thing I hope they will keep the original. "Open your eyes" as before, or they will make their own It was a little both and it sucked <br /> <br /> It started well. I love Radiohead I hope to have more But at the end, we were listening to Good Vibrations from The Beach Boys. They have one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple, but why oh, why do they have to send GV during Climax? It's more annoying than being confused or overt. Especially when there is nothing related to this matter At least makes some meaning behind the song. A = Elementary children, no matter what. <br /> <br /> He is still working with the club scene. It is very cool. As if the audience would receive a movie The part that will not be able to read the subtitles and the rest It's as simple as that. Motivation makes everyone confused. I don't understand Diaz's motivation. (Did they ever make chicken soup before?) And some others and I hate Kurt Russell above the water. Tom Cruise cannot be shown. (Especially in this type of movie [such as Eyes Wide Shut]) and the elevator I understand However, they tried to improve the original with a crappy American soundtrack and crappy corners, including good film prints and glossy processing, and it would help if the crow didn't make it drunk.
