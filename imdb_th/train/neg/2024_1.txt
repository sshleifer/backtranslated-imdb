Trying to make money from the success of Deal or Deal and 1 to 100 becomes an excuse for entertainment - Show Me The Money, in which 12 sexy dancers shine out in a shiny red dress. Contestants will receive the beginning of the phrase, such as "Which team loses ... There are three options, A, B or C, each of which makes the phrase perfect. The contestants have three chances to give answers to one of these three options. Host - William Shatner, the most disgusting - Ask the contestant if he wants "Lock the answer" and when the contestant says Yes, he picked up a 'dancer', which he shouted "Show money!" She opened a number of scrolls, and if his answer was correct, he would add that amount to his win. If he is wrong, the amount will be deducted. (In theory, it is possible for the contestants to fall in this tragic reality and end up with Chettner's money.) There is also a "killer card" and if the contestants choose women That person Nothing happened. If he answered wrong, the game will go to death immediately and must answer another question. If he mistook him for nothing, <br /> <br /> Before going to the advertisement, Shouter shouted "Come dance" and Chattner, the contestant and the 12 dancers, shook the bandit in At the end of the show, Shatner asks the woman for "The Last Dance" and they shake it a little bit. <br /> <br /> I gave this show the most 6 episodes, hoping that this story would be pathetic. The excuse for the game will be shown as a door. (It may be worse - they may bribe Cuba Gooding Jr to be a host even though I think he is a better dancer than 'Shat' while they call him today) <br /> <br /> 7/08: Guess what I'm wrong! It lasted only 5 episodes. There is hope for this world.
