I can't recommend this movie as an appointment movie. Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical story about the life that lives in the southeast industrial estate of London is an intense story. Beckettian is one of Dante's hellish circles. At the center of it is Ray Winstone, who had previously done this type of character. But it's never good as well This film opens with him ordering drinks at the pub-bar - that's all - and you experience the frustration, self-hatred and barbarism that he plays in various forms throughout the film course. It is a master actor. <br /> <br /> Of course, the wise and the occupant need foil in this drama, and Winstone was paired by Kathy Burke as a long-suffering wife. Charlie Creed -Miles came back again as Billy's son, Billy, fire, plastered, even though he had to wonder what he had let himself. Gary Oldman directed the actors closely to the actors to increase the monotony of the Council that flattened 4/10.
