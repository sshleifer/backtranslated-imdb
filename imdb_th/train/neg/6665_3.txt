Ok, a simple stupid story into the life of a dead young chick and her brother and wreaks havoc in their lives - a mildly interesting one. However, everything has ideas. (Everyone has something ...) - The operation is everything. <br /> <br /> This is something that disturbs me with this flick. And it makes me very annoyed. The rhythm (directed, corrected) slows, the speed is uneven and is expected to reach a climax. We saw a bustling highway five, six, seven times - why? The character of Norton is seen as a game that children are not deep enough to understand his problems / spirits / blah and take root for or against him. Is he a coward, a rogue, or just a fool? Reference to "Taxi driver" is ridiculous and unnecessary, and for some people disagree with this flick (or go to EN for that) <br /> <br /> and IMHO. End Cheap emotional tips for teen lovers somewhere in Central America This man should kill the child and blame his father for the real disaster. Or the child should be killed by the father at the end, etc. But none of us has ended the magic that the children missed. Families that are unusually happy are not dangerous, safe and happy again, so we can enjoy our popcorn that is not disturbed. <br /> <br /> And that scene Stupid people come into the movie. Oh God, I have to think. Long and difficult to find things that are more surprising! You didn't shoot the scene with hidden cameras and hidden crews. The creator of this film may think that it is a good idea. But it is more annoying Again, if you are a 16 year old girl somewhere in Kansas, anywhere or anywhere, and dreaming of having sex with a madman twice as old. Okay. You might enjoy this movie and its "message".
