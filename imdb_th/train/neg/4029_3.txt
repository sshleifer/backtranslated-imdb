The idea behind THE LOST MISSILE is not bad. Unfortunately, the story looks dull in the middle and too many stock images, including bad special effects, causing the film to sink in sub-levels. /> <br /> The movie begins with Missiles heading to the world With fear because the power to attack the Soviet world can divert objects However, it is not a good thing because this ship looks like a steam path that destroys everything in its path, and the ship is in a low orbit around the world. In other words, when each pass is passed, there is one execution that may kill us all !! So it is up to the good scientists of the United States (led by Robert Loggia who is very young and very hard to remember) to determine and plan to help us - and especially help New York on the flight path immediately! Unfortunately they can't save Ottawa. (I've never been there before, so I can't tell if this is a big loss or not) but with the old knowledge of Americans, they can finally destroy this. The harbinger of destruction !! <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the idea is not bad and original. But many fighter jets and manning radar scopes are quite old and seem to have internal gaps. Overall, it's a good movie. But not being inspired by fans who like this genre may like - everyone else sees at your own risk
