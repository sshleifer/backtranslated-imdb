Today I see "My Bollywood Bride" mostly at the IAAC Film Festival in New York and have to leave the theater because of the nausea that has occurred within me. I used to watch Bollywood movies and I used to watch Bollywood movies. This film can't decide which movie to choose, so it ends with a joke. <br /> <br /> Looks like it's being copied freely from movies like Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling. And that lazy Bollywood will be weaned by the commitment to stick to the script too and well - trampling? Who can bring interesting stories and millions of interesting stories to appear on the screen in the land of billions of people? The intelligent driver of the cow on the road, a scene that has no cost, a foreign location, a pointless scene of Mumbai street. They are all there. Every ancient idea about India has been faithfully combined. Predictably abominable. Ugh !!! The performance is weak across the board, except Neha Dubey that is capable and beautiful. One wondered why she chose this kind of project.
