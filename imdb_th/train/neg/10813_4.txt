The first half of this model is the best version I've ever seen. (And I think I've seen Jane Eyre, all the models that I used to do.) Childhood development and Jane's character are great. Then, as if someone said "Eh oh, it took too long" and hacked the rest of the story to destroy. Important scenes when combined together will be combined and ordered in a way that they completely change the story. There is a slight change or even the development of the scene, which it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story that will follow. The great disappointment was the beginning, opening many hopes, and then finally fanfare it.
