Normally I will not comment online. But this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only is it filmed like soap soap. ("Children and restless people" filmed by a professional, really compared to this), but it has horrible wounds. It has no action It's full of useless garbage. <br /> <br /> Here are some examples: Men want to kill the main character while he is fired because he is so (after being filled with shit). Men put a knife on his neck and say something like "You're dead." Then the main character says: "If you kill me, you're dead. I told the police that you're threatening me." ) Will be like (going to Shanghai): "Oh no ... the police are after me! !! Oh my God. "<br /> <br /> Remember: This is just an example. I can't believe that this movie really exists. So: If you want to watch the worst movie ... go ahead. I recommend :)
