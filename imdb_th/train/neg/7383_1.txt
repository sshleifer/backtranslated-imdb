I feel happy to be the owner of what is known as Steven Seagal's worst movie. I know I am doing something special when Steven opens his mouth and the sound of others comes out. In the middle of this movie, my eyes started to be painful and I almost fell out of the chair with uncontrollable laughter. <br /> <br /> Steven is like Steven.) Who makes people with ponytails with bad hairs go into the forces? He also wrote himself as an unbelievable love for women. At least 20 years, the younger generation, the supporting actors, seemed to be shot in the dark - they filmed this movie in the dark with a flashlight torch for Shining bright, right? <br /> <br /> This is a truly nasty thing in every possible way. Invite all your friends and create social activities - it's truly special.
