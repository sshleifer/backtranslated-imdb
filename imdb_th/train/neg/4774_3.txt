I'm not sure if the creator follows the movie Saw or 12 Angry Men (people gather the facts to get the truth). It's not good and not worth watching. <br /> <br / > I don't watch movies about blood and blood. But because this movie has a lot more to do than others He has a part without realizing to the innocent young man to go to prison by accepting the evidence planted. (Given to him by MJH) in the evidence room (and MJH will not be a lawyer in litigation But able to access that evidence - bring it out and bring the wrong evidence back - so she doesn't need police assistance But still plays a greater role in his final death Gun dealers should know that his gun will be used for evil purposes. The insurer rejected the person who clearly wanted to, etc. But the police crime seemed a little bit compared to him, not knowing what he was doing. The filmmakers can take the next step and allow him to be the one that encourages MJH to grow the evidence that will make him more flawless and shouting at MJH that he (the police) makes her busy. <br /> It will be more interesting if each person dies in a way that gives clues to others. Why does he / she stay there and deserve death? For example, an insurer may have an application that he refuses, rammed down on his neck, so he choked them. The eastern woman may have her eyes gouged out because she is a false witness, etc. Yes. But more interesting than <br /> <br /> dialog box is not sharp Twists and endings are one of the worse. (If not the worst) I've seen the ending, followed by a three-star knock from my rating. <br /> <br /> Actors do a good job, especially junk and motivation. They have to work. <br /> <br /> Overall, the garbage of time.
