Waiting inside the theater with a ticket in my hand, I expect to be an interesting fantasy sci-fi movie that eventually draws the appetite of a movie about robot technology. Its angle again The impact could not help the boring plot, which by my opinion worsened this year. The acting in this film caused me no satisfaction. Will Smith didn't show anything new in this movie. But I have never seen his performance changed due to "Men In Black" which is his only success from my opinion. He had to retire from his previous name without the name "I, Robot" and "Men In Black 2" 4/10.
