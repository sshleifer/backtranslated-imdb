So what's really tricky to create Indiana Jones when you have an actor who has been portrayed as a character from an adventure story book that doesn't want to go out for adventure ??? Anyone who writes a script for JAKE SPEED may be fired, but for whatever reason it is possible, the film lacks excitement. Does not mean that it will not have any movement, but look at the dark side of the image This is not similar to Indiana Jones or the thrill of adventures with cliffhangers and narrow escape routes and JAKE SPEED was promoted with clever propaganda methods to make me and others. Never heard about that man, so who needs his attention?
