If Mr Cranky rated this thing, I would be tempted just to copy his review and put it here. But while he still can't, I have to give it to myself. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gave this movie 1 instead of 0 is Malcolm McDowall's performance is great. However, not even he can help this film from disaster. The director had to be really distracted when he worked on this issue because it was just a group of scenes that were thrown together with very little continuity - reminiscent of a bad 70's movie that was even worse. Both actors and directors seem to create it when they go together, which may show how bad the original script is. <br /> <br /> It's not worth talking about Nene. See the company called Proxate Corporation, which collects crews of people distributed to carry dangerous goods on container ships / old slave ships to Nigeria. The computer of this ship is a baby stored in a glass bottle and connected to a crew via USB 12 or something like that. The company should be called Prostate Corporation because the entertainment value of this movie is at the level. That is equivalent to checking the same name. <br /> <br /> I can't find the scene that I can speak well. Do and make any real feelings in the context of the movie. I watched it until the end when I touched the bird flu and this movie reminded me of many people that are worse than me - especially Malcolm McDowall. I will not hold this to him as a great actor And every great actor has the right to a bad movie in one of their careers The shop is hired or you are a man and the doctor does not test the prostate this week and you feel that this is a bad thing. A copy to support Malcolm, then use it as a drink
