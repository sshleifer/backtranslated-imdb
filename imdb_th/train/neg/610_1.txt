I bought this movie at a cheap price in the sale. Read the back of the DVD box and assume that I can't lose it. If it is rubbish, then there is no loss. If it is good then bargain ... /> <br /> Then I watched it ... <br /> <br /> Normally, I'm a fan of Christopher Walken, but in this movie, he commands a little on-screen presence. The death of his friend near the beginning, which sparked the "action" in the plot, seems to have little impact on him and his ultimate revenge is boring and indomitable. <Br /> <br /> Usually great, while revolutions and revenge can catch the audience and snare them to feel something for the character. However, watching this movie gives you a feeling. Saw a set of confusion and random events tied together tightly. Br /> <br /> At this point I cried ... <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a painful scene. Most of the time I watched it. The day before, r was subjected to the scene in which the pilot sacrificed himself by refusing to jump out of the truck carrying bombs because he didn't want to kill any civilians. And Job pain, though not as bad Emergency surgery with injured women The performance is not good throughout the chapter and the story is weak. The "action" is weaker and the "image" does not make the eyes lose. To conclude that there are good movies, bad movies, terrible movies, terrible movies ... <br /> <br /> Then, the new level is "McBain"
