I tried to decide whether to jump into chopping wood would be more fun than this wreck or not. It is the devastation of what was once a classic movie, one with Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith. We have Lucas's death. He wants us to swallow Annakin as Vader's nonsense? I never believed it was true. This film shows those feelings. The story doesn't work since Phantom Moron and each new movie has just made nonsense until everything is left as a toy parade. I have to go. I know where the new stone will be thrown Do you want a spoiler? They come here Luke and Leia are not related Vader is not their father. Duke Countoo should switch sides while he still can. Yoda has fewer speaking skills than Yogi Baira. His advice was never good for anyone. Obi Wan lied to Luke in the first two movies. Annakin didn't create C3P0. He found him in the desert and lied to his mother about gathering him from the beginning. Chewbacca has a punch. All this confusion with Vader and the collapse of the Republic may be blamed for being stupid. Amma-Lamma-Dong-Dong If you have a brain, you won't come within Annie's light year But she said that he did what George Lucas wrote for her. What is it!
