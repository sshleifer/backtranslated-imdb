Quite disappointing before the first two movies. There is nothing suspicious for the first movie and the second story. By focusing on the people who 'run' the cube, basically it will reduce the tension within the cube because we don't care about the characters in it. Most of the movies are boring and it becomes truly scary when there is the release of the leader who has glasses and green eyes. After that, though, it went down to an unintended hilarity. The ending is perfect. But tied it back into the first person indirectly Terrible script, the best acting and the direction is not impressive. Much less track
