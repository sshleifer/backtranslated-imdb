... Are they interested in making this movie? who? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie that is about to be rented for the summer of '42, this is not the summer of '42. <br /> <br /> When the big star Your are Know and Sardar and Sarsagard will get more screen time. That is your first warning, and of course for the movie "artsy" there is a curse and a lot of skin hovers around to make it. See as "arty" <br /> <br /> Sarsgaard behaves his eyes. His usual dull cardboard characters separated by a period should be concentrated. The intensity of people with bipolar disorder <br /> <br /> Miller is most famous for her look & what she says about Pittsburgh after this film. Pittsburgh should hold a grudge against her. She shows the true native of Pittsburgh. <br /> <br /> Foster gives Sarsgaard his money in the form of a cardboard show. Wow! Is this his first role after high school graduation? <br /> <br /> So we have this strange triangle. Foster is interested in Miller. But staying with his boss / girlfriend, he couldn't bring Miller to bed and would not put his master to bed. So he hung up with Sarsgaard & Miller and watched them Fine, loud acclaim Eventually, just rounding it out, Foster & Sarsgaard came along with Foster in the Miller. The role now I know how two men use it. (As if it were something that I wanted to know) <br /> <br /> After that, all that was left was a tragic ending for one character & a retrospective of the remaining 2 things that made me right. Must be in the hole of my stomach Oh, wait! That is the Pepperoni pizza that I just had. <br /> <br /> I want to go back in time when this movie took my life.
