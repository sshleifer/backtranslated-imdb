Where to start This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The correction is the worst. Sound effects are terrible and the sound editing is languishing. Most movies that everyone can do here are crappy kick effects. I had to turn up the volume to the fullest with you, what happened .... and should I hear anything? May be one of the worst scripts ever made I can't believe that people put green for this movie. It makes me think that I can pick up the shit in the box, send it to the manufacturer and let them bring me money to make a movie for me. <br /> <br /> Dolph is normal. Dolph doesn't have to say anything again. The villain is not good. The protagonist is bad and the movie has a foul odor.
