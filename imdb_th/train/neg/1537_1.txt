Really bad shot in the "film" video made by not one, not two. But a three amateur video producer. <br /> <br /> If you do horrible horror movies, at least throw blood, blood and nudity, some blood from the latex that is cut from the arm props Bought at a Halloween store Have lesbians and prostitutes But without nudity or sex Lesbians spend time on the bed for a long time, but say only. <br /> <br /> Looks like there is no editing effect, fade away, wipe, etc. Sometimes, a little black appears to separate the scene. br /> <br /> Scary music by the heavy metal band that has the most credit-based websites. In the end, the werewolves are shown with a rubber mask attached to the actor's face. They don't have to worry about brown makeup on the neck, arms or wrist. <br /> <br /> I guarantee that a 10 year old boy with a video camera will be able to make a better movie. There is no reason to buy. Rent or watch this movie, except as an example of how to make a low budget video.
