The movie My Name is Modesty has a story about a story that happened about one page in Blaise's 10th novel, Night of the Morningstar. It describes the events that are polite of children (17 in the middle age book Twenty in the film) confirms her leadership in the war over the casino. As this will happen before the adventures of Blaise, her closest friend Willi Garvin, her trustworthiness is not in the movie. That is one of the main problems because the relationship between Blaise and Garvin is one of the interesting aspects of the novel and the long comic. Another problem is that this film is quite boring, unbelievable because it's only a small episode that has been made into a movie script. The casting is ok. But Alexandra Steder is not really convincing as a heroine and is too old to take this role. I get the impression that this film is a fast and dirty solution to not give permission to Blaise franchise.
