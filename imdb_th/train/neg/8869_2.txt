With the launch of "Farligt förflutet", the Swedish film industry has truly hit the rock bottom. Stefan (Jens Hultén) ​​has been in the past years having a peaceful life with his wife Marie. (Regina Lund) One day, Stefan's old friend arrives with kindly asking him. Stephan made a small mission. He was supposed to bring a suitcase full of heroines through the Swedish-German customs. Unfortunately, things in Germany did not work as planned, and now Stefan is having a big problem. It is always good to see Swedish movies that break the traditional family drama. Unfortunately, if the person involved in the production has no clue as to whether the movie should be written, filmed or cut, the result will be disastrous. The content can be summed up with: bad performances, discrete plot and silly conversations. The only highlight in this movie is the unexplained sex scene with incredibly beautiful Regina Lund. This only takes a few seconds to maintain the purity of 90 minutes, roughly saying that it is really something.
