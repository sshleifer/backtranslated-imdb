If Todd Chet comes out and admits that this movie is intended to be a fake type of zombies, I will change my rank to eight. Imagine a movie in which every scene, genre, and even the acting scene is designed to be a joke. I might be crap. The soup character rearranges what is left of the character and still has a better script. Especially the second scene came to mind when I thought about this movie. Spoiler alert! One is when Mike's father and another father walk. I repeatedly walk down the stairs full of zombies. This is a small staircase and even if they fight against a weak human being But nothing happened to them When they reached the end, the former Marines turned around, saying "Lord, you are the one with him" and only one other shot in the military complex. The girl stabbed the zombie with a machete and was immediately surrounded. The camera moved around her for about forty seconds while she was surrounded by long arm zombies. Then she almost ran out of the crowd and joined other human beings. Spoiler alert up! These scenes must have faith. Still, I still enjoy this movie almost as much as a comedy, because it's very funny. The glory reached Todd Sheets so many people in his movie and had a drive to make it. But not really for anything else
