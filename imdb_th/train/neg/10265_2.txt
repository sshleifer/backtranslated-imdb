Kirstie Alley looked a bit slender. But only a little in this mess, along with the shy man MacGuyver, bleached blonde hair and all The location of this film is about an old woman (50 !!!) who cannot create her screenplay due to age discrimination, so she sends her younger grandson to be a writer. Not a traditional idea and not a very good movie that has lousy performances, ridiculous dialogue and ridiculous plot. There is another story about a writer who is interested or admired in Kirstie's character and why this is a mystery. The actors who played Kirsty's brother were made of wood and other animals. They were tortured to watch their scenes. There is nothing to say about this movie. Avoid it.
