In short, this film is completely worthless. <br /> <br /> The idea is to create a movie from the perspective of what some people from the early 1900s might think in the future. Interesting ideas But the lack of a story or an attractive character makes us unable to suppress our unbelief, so the idea will fail. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie was done with a color screen actor. Green Should be impressive But as a person, the graphics are too weak to become obvious crutches for hiding difficult edges with green screening. The color is clearly washed without any effect, except to reduce the image quality. And I do not understand why everyone thinks what is shown in this movie will be wrong If anything, retrograde graphics can be reduced to a strip of graphics that are not really good - they don't even measure ancient Jurassic Park graphics. Models for robots are simple, plain and very unparalleled. There are strange prehistoric monsters on this island. But they didn't explain anything. <br /> <br /> The story is scary beyond belief. In fact, I don't want to believe that just walking out of this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is not stimulated and throughout the film depends on the mistrust and deception. Why is the character Morris Paley staying there? We didn't believe that Joe was a hero. In any way I mean, he flew the plane and helped one person (Polly) for personal reasons. Yes, there are great heroes for you. Dex has very little screen time, so why should we care? Joe wants to help him too? Who is Nepalease who imprisoned Joe and Polly in my grave and why did they do that? (Remember that the entire Totenkopf operation is a robot) <br /> <br /> The hole of the story: (1) Why is Bai Ling's character (falling from her great character in "The Crow ") Stop the robot that once caught Joe? They are looking for a bottle and don't find them. (2) Why in hell will you be arrested but not dead? (He doesn't know or know about bottles and bad people don't know that Polly has a bottle and connects with Joe and Dex.) ? (3) Polly states that "they" don't know anything about Totenkopf, but she has a secret source of information about him, which has what appears to be a complete FBI style file about him. As described by Nepal - if they knew everything about this mysterious area, then why would the hell be an empty map at that point? (5) At one point, Polly and Joe had to give up clothes (burned) - Joe received new clothes like his old clothes. But Polly is forced to wear a strange look in one line of continuity. Suddenly, Polly brings her original clothes. <br /> <br /> * Sigh * I should change my brain. My long time to see this shit. <br /> <br /> We should be happy with the music created even though there is nothing interesting or exciting from a distance on the screen. <br /> < br /> and performances? We should be impressed with the poor English accent. Which character is not annoying? I think Ling Bai's conversation should be the best in all movies. (She doesn't have one line) The conversation is not camping and does not increase to the level of cheese. It's bad and annoying These people are not heroes or interesting. They are the kind of people you will try to ignore or separate. If you ever encounter bad luck in real life, <br /> <br /> I can't believe that this movie has received a higher score here. IMHO, should be competing with "Batman Forever" at the lowest level 100 all the time.
