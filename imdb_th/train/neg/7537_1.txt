And I think The Beach is terrible with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our generation, Nicolas Cage. Don't blame him for the great role if someone can understand what is. The end of that movie, slap behind you. It is a combination of The Village and the Crappier script. It starts with catching your eye and when it enters the plot it doesn't make sense and don't let me start the ending !!!! What is it now? The only thing that makes this movie is Nicolas Cage, a great joke and his ability to joke in the most bizarre situations. If you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch, save yourself five dollars and go home and turn off the lights and when some people ask you why, just say the most foolish thing in your heart. And go there!
