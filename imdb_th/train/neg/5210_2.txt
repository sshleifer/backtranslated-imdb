First of all, let me be honest. I didn't watch this movie at all. I watched the first five minutes and when I realized that I was almost insomnia I decided that I might move fast and see if it was more interesting later or not. This film is just a series of weak attempts to create an unconventional story and be told about things that had never happened before: a good horror movie. Because I feel that it is important to say that even movies that have bad special effects can still do well if they do well. This movie can't and will make you sleep well if you try to watch. Finally, I feel it's important to say that I think this movie is in the public domain, so if you feel that you have to watch it for sure, than searching on the internet will show places that you don't have to pay to see this.
