American Pie is gone far from the beginning. At first I believed that the actors had no clue what they were doing and instead of just creating a remake from a college party. The story is defined as two young college students. (Featuring a solid girl) set up the dream of attending college just to experience late night partying, sex, and of course alcoholics. Stupid plot and coming from the original pie In fact, they don't have another apple pie in the movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I work in a video store and can rent for free. But remember that it is a waste of time unless you enjoy a silly sex movie with nudity and crazy drinking. I am a teenager myself and I believe that even if Ivan is a great alternative
