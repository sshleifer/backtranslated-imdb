The only reason I remember this movie is because (And still is) the most time-consuming and money that I have ever spent. I am 17 years old and my friend is 18 years old. We are as old as action movies as something that we will enjoy the most. (2nd most OK). We walked out of our insulting feelings. We needed our money back. But the time cannot be returned. <br /> <br /> The correction is what killed this movie. When the truck was attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers, this movie insulted the audience's intelligence with these villains in the 4x4 VW Bugs. Please launch rockets on the car. Rocket on the truck. ? The worse thing is that these VW manage to get 15-18 shots from the 4 rocket launchers. You will see a VW with 4 rockets. Shoot 2 cars, cut around the car with the last car attached back one second later. Along with two other rocket launchers, then forward the 4 rocket suit trucks. <br /> <br /> We tried our best to achieve a big victory that had never happened before. Looks like they will run out of money and stop. <br /> <br /> Nonsense
