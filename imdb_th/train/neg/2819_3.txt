The Marquis De Sade, Egypt, ancient knowledge cult, Robert Englund in the role of two sexes free and nudity, murder and mayhem ... On paper, Tobe Hopper's night terrarium sounded like at least fun. Give the ingredients. It's not. It's a plot less than an uproar that brings little entertainment. Basically, there isn't any vague plot about the cult that follows De Sade's work for no apparent reason. hole Felt the need to persuade the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her That is very beautiful - I think it has something about the Gnostics, but who knows what the author thinks? Most of this film is a winding story like a heroine, experiencing the bizarre, dreamy scenes and erotic encounters, inserting Englund's scenes as De Deade in the 19th century that chewed the scenery. It seems that manufacturers are trying to do something serious. But regardless of what they are buried in, pride, bad performances, witty, and head that looks like a fake head. <br /> <br /> There are not many good points. Robert Englund enjoys receiving. Watch as Zoe Trilling, the lead actor, while not very good, is attractive and in various stages of striptease in movies, but watching Night Terrors is a boring job. At least I have to watch the movie "When you are a criminal like me" from the Australian Film Certification Guide, which is in front of many VHS tapes from the nineties
