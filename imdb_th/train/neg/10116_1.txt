I want the last 30 minuets in my life to come back honestly. <br /> <br /> The only person who is appropriate to watch this movie is Helen Keller, who I keep talking to myself. > Then the zombies appeared and they had a raccoon color there. Eyes <br /> <br /> They talked like a normal person. <br /> <br /> One driver <br /> <br /> Some Voodoo girls ask "Zombies". One of them needs something and "Zombies" say (I want to dance). <br /> <br /> (That's it) Come out to my movie. Can not tolerate anymore. Can I sue for 6 hours of my life ?????
