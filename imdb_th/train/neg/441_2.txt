We don't have this on TV in England. But I walked through the internet on YouTube. It is stupid, not big and boring! Came from the creator of "Earthworm Jim" Douglas TenNapel. I never went into that cartoon. But I have to admit it is better The cartoonist has not done anything for many years now. For Doug TenNapel, this is the comeback, the return and the lowest moment! This story is about three cats that inherited a house and a lot of money from a dead old woman boss. They argue and disagree with what they want to continue using their money "boring"! Scary animation The main character is meant to be a cat, right? But they don't look like cats at all! A monster that is shaped like a strange monster with a big mouth, sharp teeth and big eyes! Characters, humans and other animals are really cute! Music is scary and annoying! In addition, the story is weak and may be copied from an older list. It surprised me that this list was voted 7.5 / 10 from other IMDb audiences. How did the television ever be! But now most of them are stupid people, making it easy and cheap. Some of you on the site may not agree with me. Well, I'm sorry. But this was a waste of money and wasted time and was glad that Britain would not accept this shit. If you have a digital, you have to) but I don't have it. It's not my problem! Loser! 2/10 (and it's very fortunate to receive that because I have shown the other worst items!)
