The same opinion as the headline of a school girl, even though doing this website, is the most stupid movie I have ever seen. It's ridiculous. The way that this fool will sit there and say Jumping it is a good movie that may be the most stupid thing I've ever heard. I can sneak behind you and go to "Boo" and it will make you jump. But that doesn't mean I have the ability to write or direct. Movies, not to mention "They tied everything together at the end." It's not a good reason for movies to be well received. What kind of movie would it be if they didn't tie everything together? I guess it would make it a half movie, not a whole movie. So in general, this idiot girl is praising them for making movies. I like that young people today hold high standards of media and manufacturing companies. It is not surprising that the political system of this country can escape everything we want. We have stupid things like that in our country. What happens if this woman becomes a leader on some days? That's the idea. scary Get life and watch real movies sometimes. Try using Shawshank Redemption or On the Waterfront or something like that. And don't criticize it "boring" after you see it. Use the brain that God helps you analyze.
