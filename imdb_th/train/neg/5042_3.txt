The main complaint of this film is the fact that I can't tell who it is. No racism But these Asian people have the same look! Can I tell a story? But what the hell is that happening People 's identity is not a mystery. If they are puzzles, I will care about them. But I didn't leave the screen quickly. <br /> <br /> Tons of wide images and faces that don't have a quiet mood. But I don't know these people But they're sitting there (Which is a great movie) You will think that with a reasonable budget, at the very least they can make it look like Hollywood 90s.
