Over the years that have been looking for a movie that has half the rent for my children, I have developed a sixth sense for seeing the straightforward effort through eight really wonderful videos. On this ball and the children spent half the movie asking me "What did you say? And "Why did he do that?" And my eyes hurt from rolling them every minute because the characters worked very poorly in introducing random plot changes And the next time someone decides that there is no skill in using the sword just "Bring realism" to movies. Please run through them with a blunt butter knife. "Prehysteria!" Is the head and shoulders above this thing.
