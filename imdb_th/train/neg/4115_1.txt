"Fire play" interesting start. But it went down quickly The only good actor is Tobin Bell and he has a very small part. Beyond Bell "Power Play" has no redemption value or interest. "Power Play" There are earthquakes in a few days than California has in a year. Seismic scenes in department stores are planned and completely unbelievable. And all action scenes seem to be third graders playing It's so bad, just <br /> <br /> the bottom line. If "Power Play" was created in the 60s or 70s, it would be considered a "B" class movie. Poor. In 2001, it was a very sad story. Is there something that is a class movie "D"? If so, "Power Play" will mold the mold.
