I am a big fan of Stephen King. I love The Running Man. Clearly, I'm very excited that someone created this movie. And when the local network shows this movie, I am in heaven I'm ready for a night of fun. <br /> <br /> The first indicator that has something wrong happens when I notice that there are some people who have shown Arnold Schwarzenegger. I can't believe that people who are famous for movies that are full of runnin 'an' shootin 'can play more witty roles as described in this book. I still believe that this will be a good movie anyway. Who knows, perhaps Arnold may have some hidden talents? <br /> <br /> He can't. Soon I find that the only reason he was chosen because some people rewrite the whole story again. To create a story about fighting in the 'shoot' Let the girls <br /> <br /> be shocked. This is not what the book says. I know that books can't be placed on the screen. But this is not related to books Stephen King should condemn any revelations with this film openly and he should not use the name of The Running Man for unscrupulous movies. I'm not talking often But this movie is not good If I didn't stay at home, I would have to throw the rotten tomatoes on the screen again: not good. <br /> <br /> (Please note that I use 'people' a lot. Very ashamed to work on this and I do not want. More embarrassed by the name here)
