"Seed" is a pornography that is tortured ... No doubt, but strange. Uwe Boll wrote, created and directed a movie that was more polished than he had done in recent memories. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch the movie Boll, I feel that some pages of The script must disappear. There is a big gap in the story and dialogue. Of course, there is nothing reasonable. This movie is quite surreal in this respect. <br /> <br /> ***** Spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Why are the six police who arrested Seed separated? And go How different are they when they reach the dark habitat like a real cop that will come in and wash the house in pairs or by three? Why did the police never use their radio? How can the body break down quickly, a process that normally takes several months? (I know it's time to take pictures ... but the seeds can't be in the killing table if they wait around before the victims break down to the point of showing.) Why does Seed reach the bib and The mask while he waits for the death row instead of wearing a general uniform? How can Seed enter the most secure prison? Walk around the cell block and walk again without stopping or noticing. If nearly 80 people (according to some newspaper articles shown in the movie) are killed, why are there? The only detective working in this case? Why the researcher decided immediately that he should find Seed at Seed's home, where he was initially arrested and where he killed the victim. (He doesn't think he will do this sooner.) Why does the police detective go alone without having to spare and not let the sender know what he is doing and where he is going? <br /> <br /> This was especially disappointing when Boll was clearly on his way to make sure we understood why the electric chair didn't work properly. He spends several minutes setting up the screen when he can take the time to create other aspects of the movie at least more logical. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILER *** ** <br /> In short, the movie only acts as a frame for a few assorted scenes (maybe Boll will think that these are "his" pictures) of a brutal death by gunshot baton. Go to the head. Action By electricity and the interest of living animals raised for them to compress (The opening scenes of animals that are skins are unnecessary and annoying. But I understand their purpose in the context of the film.) The core is undoubtedly the terrifying death of a middle-aged woman. Seed uses an ax, apparently spending a lot of time with this story and reminds me of the classic scene. In "Reservoir Dogs" even though there is no Steely Dan soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Is this a good movie? No. Is it worth watching? Only if you are a big fan of pornography, torture, or if you are determined to see pornographic examples of torture As I said at the beginning of this review, although this movie is disgusting and boring. But it is truly more capable than most Boll movies Maybe he will continue to develop as a producer. I hope that he will progress beyond the pornography that is tortured and continue in the veins of the "post".
