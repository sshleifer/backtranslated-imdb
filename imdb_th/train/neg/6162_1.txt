"Smokey and the Thief" is not Shakespeare. But no one wants to be It hurts low But it has a brain It has a very clever script with configurable characters and fun summaries. People came out of the theater. Smiling "Hooper" didn't give this thing. No reason to smile If it should be a tribute to Hollywood Stuntman, it makes them look deeply lazy without giving anything except the choreography that is badly choreographed and one of the most unbelievable jumping cars I've ever had. See Poor Sally Field (as a girlfriend who wrote her hand on the field) will get her weakest role, not a joke or smart line. ("If you do that, I'm not here when you come back.") Bert Reynolds, the brain watching the camera and flashing But jokes are available to all audiences, sitting through "Hooper" * from ****
