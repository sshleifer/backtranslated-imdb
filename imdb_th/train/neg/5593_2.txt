I love Dracula But this movie is very disappointing! I remember Lee from the movie Dracula, others since I was young and I think he's great. But this movie is terrible I do not know whether it is a child or not, who deceived me to believe that Lee is the best Dracula with style, appeal and evil. Or maybe it's just this movie that makes me disappointed. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine Dracula with an English accusation and insulting body language? Do you like when the plot has unrealistic options by characters and boring and lacking any tension ..? This is the movie for you! <br /> <br /> Not like that - don't see! I just gave 2 because I managed to stay awake in both movies. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but if you like this movie, then you have to get sleep and the only house in the dark room There are many Space behind you May be alone in your parents' house or in a stranger house Because even the characters in this movie look terrified and I think the whole sum! <br /> <br /> Or you might like this movie because it's a place in Dracula's movie history. Dracula's story evolved from Nosferatu to this day. The reason that the movie is not an appealing thing, it does not draw you into the mystery that guides for me to make the legendary Vampyre fascinating with it The scenery looks like a cheap theater. And I'm not saying that denying everything that happened in the 70s because I can love old and new movies
