I work through the classic movie collection Chilling Classics 50 and the movie THE WITCHES 'MOUNTAIN (El Monte de las brujas) is something like the 17th movie in the movie series. <br /> <br /> Catch My interest The plot is not continuous. Seems like a temporary conversation The performance is not good. The character is not sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The best scene is the beginning, with an angry woman who is pushed to burn a daughter that looks stout. However, the only connection to this scene is the rest of the movie, as the characters bring Mario with the most mustache ever. But <br /> <br /> This film is not effective at all levels. Such music is too intrusive. The light is very dark, so some scenes are almost completely black. It can't really be seen - what can I say?
