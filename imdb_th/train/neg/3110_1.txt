I often come to this site before going to the movies because I like to see what other people think of the movie. I read a lot of reviews that said 'Thriller is not a horror movie'. This story makes me try this movie. I have a problem with these 'thriller / horror' messages because it's not! I almost go and ask for a refund and if you have lots of comments like this junk .... well you have to easily! At the end of the movie, the people behind me said loudly, "Wasted time." "I can't summarize this better." I waited for something to happen ... but it wasn't. There is a possibility of a great fear. (Or excitement if you like) but nothing happens Williams performed quite well. But I felt that he had changed the short script by a poor chapter. Save your money. This is a turkey which has a DVD storage. 'Bargain Box' near you in the near future!
