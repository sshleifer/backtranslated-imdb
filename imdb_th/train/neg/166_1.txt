First of all, I didn't sit down to watch the Premier of the "Star Trek" series to see a cowboy flying in space. This is the way that the Enterprise episode works. <br /> <br /> 1 Archer finds a nebula or something that is in the line of the scene and wants to look closer. But it might destroy the ship. 2 He sent a shuttle to the nebula and the shuttle was damaged ... <br /> <br /> Every time I saw all the problems were going on because of a stupid mistake. Archer's Oh, and you see an example of one episode that shows Archer and T'pol kissing?!?!?!?!?!?!?! I plan to watch at that time. But after that, I gave up with Enterprise and turned on the TV right away !!!! This is the journey of the stars. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> There is also something that has a banana slug? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana slug but had to leave behind for stupid reasons. Okay, well, a little stupid to bring your pets, bullets in space, but whatever. the desert !!!!! Banana bullets cannot fall into the desert. !!!!!!!!!!!!! These writers are stupid. <br /> <br /> In any way, just say that Enterprise doesn't look !!!!!
