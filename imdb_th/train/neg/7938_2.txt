A family that is looking for old street attractions that are included in Father's coffee table book. Meet an old-fashioned, old-fashioned performance performed by a strange one-eyed man. When their family van stopped when leaving the presentation, they were forced to live in an abandoned fishing camp, almost the location of this shelter several decades ago. <br /> <br /> There are many movies in the 'subcategory of horror' from Tod Browning's beloved 'Freaks' (1932) to 'Freaked' (1981), the comedy of Alex Winter. (Or will soon be with 'Freaked'). However, 'Side Sho' will never be like that. And if it never reached the classic status .. it will be a clear clue about the tragic status of our genre From ridiculously bad open songs to 17-year-old daughters that are naturally older than her mother, this film doesn't have many benefits. The writing is not interesting. But not bad .. just boring That direction is bad and the strange effects that are rare are quite scary and unbelievable. The performance was great and the casting was even worse. Anyone who believes that the age of these two teenagers must not find a teenager for a long time. Is far from violent and violent enough to compensate for the lack of other qualities .. and when there is a slight violence, it is not good at all And I can't forget to talk about the end of the fight scene, with all honesty, the worst thing I have ever seen in a movie Overall, this is an easy-to-forget and low-quality horror movie that is worth being left alone at the bottom of the dollar trash. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 2.5 / 10
