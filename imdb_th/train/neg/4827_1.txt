If this film is intended to discourage people from making drugs, it will fail. I'm ready to start using them. I'm waiting for what will happen and nothing has ever been done. This movie is not a horror movie or drama. It is just the suspicion of the drug user. This movie may be rewarded with the use of the word "F" many times and is useless. It is not well specified. But I felt like they were doing Meth to replace Meth. They owe it to someone. Hector became worse and more paranoid when the movie went on and the girls became more desperate. Truly unreasonable ending This film has no meaning unless it is shown that it is annoying to be trapped in a house without a head. I rely on other suggestions when I decide to watch this movie and the rating of this movie should be much lower than average.
