What? Jamie Fox should be funny or not. He really believes that he is really funny. It's funny. See his confidence in being a joke. No identity. ... I mean, you can see the idols. He immediately got Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence because he was trying hard to imitate them in most movies. The only problem was that he did not perform well, was uneven, and some things that came out there. Looks like Denzel with macho-s ** Attitude and Then go to the Martin Lawrence comedy stupid and clumsy. There is no personal touch with everything I mean. He doesn't share the personality he is trying to sell and I'm sure he doesn't have anything to say personally. He is Mr. Dal-Boy himself. <br /> <br /> I hope to get Hollywood and the black community in America to find that there are better people to launch into the stars. High level like Don Cheadle. Pathetic Jamie is better than showing the old mixed version.
