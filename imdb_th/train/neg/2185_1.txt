... or a quick summary of the audience .... <br /> <br /> You have this doctor who is experimenting with the stolen body part for some vague reason. He wants a perfect transplant. But felt he wanted to do this in his basement WTF ??? And suddenly, unfortunately, and comfortable, his fiance made her cut off from the road accident he was responsible for With grief, he kept her head in a lasagna pan (Or is it strudel?) And the pump is full "adreno-serum" (sic) to keep it alive And then she woke up, speaking out of her head (to speak), even though her neck was clearly cut at the vocal cords and she had no lungs so she couldn't speak even if she had a look like b * tch Not ungrateful, not agreeing with what her fiancee did for her Like a woman ..... <br /> <br /> Then his grief changed into being when he saw that it was possible to cultivate his beloved head on the body. The first lazy Bimbo brain he can accept At the same time, a small medical assistant, Igor, had a philosophical debate with the head, which created Carrie's friendship with "A monster in the closet" (every mad scientist has one) Finally, the screenwriter realized that he was unable to harm his hatred and feared the intimacy with the audience. He killed everyone. Then went to the bank to check the cash before the film's financial sponsor had a chance to stop paying on it. <br /> <br /> I used to say that I think this is a movie that doesn't. Good or not. <br /> <br /> Someone told Turner Classic Movies to stop showing the modified version. The helper's eyes with his arms were torn away from the house without leaving too much blood.
