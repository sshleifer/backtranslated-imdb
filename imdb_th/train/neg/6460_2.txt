* Who can tell me where to be happy? !! <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very weak comedian. (Thomas Hanechurch) is looking weak (with him!) And all things are very thick! <br /> <br /> * Are they trying to make a live comic book that turns into a terrifying cartoon nightmare and isn't it funny? Like the plan scene in the bathroom; It's very good with the imagination of the cinema. But nothing more .. except pain! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland ??! His relationship with his daughter ??! <br /> <br /> * This is the work they do to make money from it. But it became a crime when this money was Robbed from us who were deceived by a very low art and entertainment without entertainment! <br /> <br /> * Okay, it would be ugly if it was a big event and starred Brando in his golden years with the stars of truth. <br /> <br /> * Sheen's family is here. Just realize that! <br /> <br /> * Anyone who finds himself likes this movie or - God forbid - love it! Then you will have to be treated before you become more dangerous and hurt others! <br /> <br /> * (Brando) No doubt it's a genius. But this movie can't! And he didn't intend to be one here after reading the story for sure !! But the major problem is that no one works in this thing. Try or want to be smart, small or even good !!! (Sorry I cry now! The torture of the movie is unbelievable!) <br /> <br /> * There is a scene (Brando) banged (Mira Sorvino) with her shoes! It's like serious! Maybe he saw himself in her, so he punished himself to be in the shit! <br /> <br /> * For a thousand years: This is probably better. (Or worse than this!) The script until the train robbery is good and I just think they will escape to pursue other things. (Smokey and bandit) but also (Brando) as the sheriff In fact, these monsters are more benevolent than what I have seen! <br /> <br /> * Why isn't this masterpiece razzie ?! Do you want me to believe that there are movies below this? I don't think so! It was a situation where Razzie's supervisors had to win with negligence !! <br /> <br /> * Martin Sheen came here as a guest star to support his failed son. But ironically, his father failed like his son! And why so! Well! Because I hate Martin Sheen, maybe more than I hate cartoon movies, not as good as my dreams! <br /> <br /> * It's not a funny movie, not .. It's a horror movie! And I just hate horror movies, especially movies that are advertised as cartoons! <br /> <br /> * Can you name a good thing about it? Well! Compare with the monster movies of Marlon Brando (The Island of Dr. Moreau - 1996) near (Casablanca) !! <br /> <br /> PS: If you still want to know what it is or who is The bad guys, the ugly and the most ugly in this movie .. Just pray the last prayer and go and see .. May God help you!
