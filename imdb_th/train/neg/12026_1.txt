I hope that when performing comedy, people try to make it really funny. This is a movie that you can watch. But nothing special about this After watching, you will say it's okay. It's not boring to watch. But let the audience not be funny to laugh at Entertainment should mean that you get something more than okay. The story of this movie wants to be "Tootsie" but it fails instead. <br /> <br /> I give 1 in 10.
