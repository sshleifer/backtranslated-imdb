In standard view, this is a very scary movie. However, it gives a score that is close to the joke. I can think of a true comedy that makes me laugh as hard as I watch this movie. The ghost of Andy Griffith in the Native American dance series sends me into hysterics every time I will not waste gas or energy. Drive to the video store to rent. But if you happen to lie on the sofa at 3 o'clock in the morning and it comes on TV
