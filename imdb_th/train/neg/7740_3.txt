This movie tries to ignore 2/3 of the journey. Sadly, this movie ends with confusion. While I know that some artifacts are standard for movies 'Buddy Police' I have drawn into the characters that have been striking together. But in the end, this film relies on the chase sequence as a crutch too and I lose interest. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers performed a great role in making the characters lonely and doing their own things. And we have to see who they are and identify the two police officers from the beginning We create our own opinions instead of being forced to look at them through constant quarrels. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is too much and it distracts from what seems to be the solution. Fun. This is something related to Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) at the end of the movie: <br /> <br /> 1 His real estate proposal 2. His story with Psychic Radio 3. He was investigated by internal affairs. Garden successor murder <br /> <br /> If you add the concerns of Casey at you like he wants to be an actress, and avenging. His father died Now these things come together and combine together well. But all the planning elements come together to chase this long and pathetic bogus until I almost don't have time to stop the anger and give time to what has just happened. The director wrote an impressive screenplay, unable to overcome bad movie making. <br /> <br /> As if the ridiculous chase scenes were not good enough, one with four separate parts and maybe Near half an hour, Joe Gavilan district called for his real estate deal while chasing the perpetrator with a gun. These lines and special funny courses make me meaningless whether or not criminals are caught. We have forgotten or don't care about the murder plan anymore because of the plot and the sight of the chase many times, causing us to mellow beyond all understanding. <br /> <br /> While I can walk about the chase. They break a good story, I will not do. This may be a fun movie recipe. But it's too big for a movie and it becomes a waste of time Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett did quite well and Gladys Knight's small appearance was noteworthy. Sadly, none of the actors can help this hopelessly misunderstood movie. <br /> <br /> At this time, it may be better to like "The Hulk" and "Lara Croft II". Didn't do this Good movie I have heard that Harrison Ford claims to make a movie that is thought to make money only. I'm not sure if it's true or not. The real thing is getting a great box office. You don't want great movies or great actors. This movie doesn't have a leading role in this movie. My recommendation for Harrison Ford is: stick with Indiana Jones. At least you can still run.
