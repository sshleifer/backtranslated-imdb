The story is ok. Akshay Kumar is as good as ever. And that is the only good thing about the movie Kareena Kapoor. It looks bad, colorful and crying for her size. But she doesn't look slim I do not know why the hell therefore Anil Kapoor accepts such a bad role. There is nothing to do for him in the movie. Just because it is a Yashraj movie does not mean that the actor should accept the role, but it is bad. Ali Khan says it doesn't matter. I think it's a good time for Indian directors and producers to start thinking about Indian customers as being very smart. What are we stupid people !!!! What do they think? They will show 2 men playing in the SWAT for one person and we will believe them. Is an Indian police an idiot that they try to catch criminals? They accept 100+ policemen and no one is surrounded by the palace. The action is disgusting and I have never seen such a bad act before. Akshay Kumar is between the 30-40 police circle. You shoot at him ..... and he shoots them back. Police ammunition, no one touched him But he killed all the cops. CRAP <br /> <br /> I think the fight director who thinks that this scene should be retired. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend not to watch movies. this story
