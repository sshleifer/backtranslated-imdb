I saw this movie directly after reading it and it could be a very neutral or stupid idea. I think it's the back Firstly, it is not accurate in small details but is important. One of the first things I noticed was that during Winston's day, in everyday life, his work, his conversation, eating in the cafeteria, etc. He felt free to look unhappy and make the eyes that people are not afraid of. One of the most important parts of this book is that even in small activities, it is impossible to express his true feelings on his face safely at any given time. This is shown in the street scene of the working class. In the book, Winston knew that this was a huge risk to walk there and not believe and fear every trip. While in the movie, he does it often and does not have to be afraid. You will lose the important feeling of heavy surveillance and risk from bats. <br /> <br /> Other minor inaccuracies include Winston. Hide his diary on the wall Yes, little changes, but it's a question. What is the question? There is also the most annoying thing that the director can do with the book and that is the character that changes. <br /> <br /> The big inaccuracies are more disturbing. First of all, one of the important books is Big Brother, a government based on a wise philosophy. In the movie, they skip and make you think that the government is operated by Hitler with technology. Which is true in one sense, when directed by acting But if that's all you get from Big Brother, you'll miss the important points of the book. The scary thing about Big Brother is that it has some issues behind its philosophy. When O'Brien delighted Winstons in the ministry of love, he listened to everything Winston said to his eldest brother. The fact that he listened and progressed forward in his philosophy resulted in the most creepy and interesting things in the end (watch out for spoilers in advance) when Winston said he loved the big brother. That is, you are not sure whether it beats and torments caused by this or the true power behind the philosophy I have no way to say that Big Brother's philosophy has attracted me. But its intelligence and depth are things that make this book unbelievably disturbing. <br /> <br /> There is also a way that anyone Winston in this movie? It's terrible, no connection at all. <br /> <br /> Where is O'Brien before he gives his address to Winston? One of the things that holds this book is the idea of ​​Winstons about O'Brien before he contacts him. In the movie, they just jumped in the gun. <br /> <br /> But it was concluded that this movie had a terrible adjustment because it was impossible to jump on the gun and the characters changed in Less than two hours Does anyone think that this movie can be seen if it takes less than two hours? At least the movie needs 3 hours to capture some important emotions and connections. What is less than that is useless. <br /> <br /> If you love books and I mean true love, you won't agree with this movie and there is a chance you know that you won't like it. Since this book is not available and this film proves that it is impossible to cram the good things for a small roll movie. <br /> <br /> Two stars out of ten.
