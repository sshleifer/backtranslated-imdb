The proverb "Don't judge a book from the cover" has been declared a warning for those who do not look under the surface. <br /> <br /> When I watched the art "King of the Ants" I immediately thought that HORROR! Arcane shows proudly on the cover, and after talking about the dark vision, the conclusion of the contract of murder, betrayal and revenge. But what I discovered beneath the surface is less interesting than what you can find under the average rock. <br /> <br /> "King of the Ants" presents Chris L. McKenna as a choreographer. City of Dawley, ordinary people ready to build His own name in this world, although it means murder Except Jean Anglia, who is not interested in you, I never felt sympathy or sympathy for this character.

Bad conversations and unimaginable events after an unlikely event. Oh, horror!
