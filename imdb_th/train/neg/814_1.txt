This movie is not normal. Ancient ideas about all police films are available and involved. Where did the bad people escape? Check Partners? Check out the collision of bizarre personality with partners? Check out the new page with what to prove? Check out Rookie showing the veteran gray. Check on the only thing that doesn't touch is an idiot. Shoot yourself on foot and introvert. But I think they are helping those old chestnuts for the next outing. Add to the fight of sex with Girl Power, along with old-fashioned gags and over-content such as the award-winning Dooley car being dumped all the time and you have a recipe for really bad movies. Avoid this cost.
