This movie is a good example of how to destroy a book in 109 minutes, except the name of the characters in the film is very similar to the book. The book is full of strong Latin characters and represents the majority of non-Latin people. No character development in the movie, and we have no reason to love or hate characters. And to remove the complete version is inexcusable. Isabel Allende has written a powerful book and this book is something that should be read!
