I've been looking for this movie for many years because it's quite rare because it's one of those nasty videos. I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year. It was a very low price movie. The story was set around the Amazon jungle tribe that lived in the fear of demons. Laura Crawford is a model kidnapped by gangsters while she works in South America. They brought her into the forest. Laura was protected by some ridiculous natives who called themselves "demons". She had to go despite all the unpleasant things until they were happy. Girl chained up The devil shows how to eat meat in a terrifying manner. Peter Weston is a demon hunter who entered the forest to try to help her.
