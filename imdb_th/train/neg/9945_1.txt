After watching about half of this movie, I noticed some strange things ... I found myself constantly changing through TV channels to see what else was there - not the characteristics of good movies. > <br /> This movie is on the list. In many categories and I have to say that it has failed, most of them miss out on them. Everyone 80% in the movie. I changed to see the old screenings instead. Bottom line - The whole movie feels as though it doesn't make sense. What and ended with a mix without visible tastes
