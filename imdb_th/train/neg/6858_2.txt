John Heston's Wise Blood is more than Flannery O'Connor's deceptive book than I can imagine. From the most terrifying performance (And not you "Oh, that has been done with the purpose. You just don't understand" to me!) About the musical score that is suitable for the episode of Rockford Files. This movie is more than nasty. Actually expect a pleasant experience But the misrepresentation of the characters in the South, from the ridiculously depicting southern region to the laughing, the way their faith is expressed is something that cannot be explained Until the end of which there is no complete confidence in the character, it fails wherever the O'Connor books shine and reflect. Actors who portray the police "South" may include eating hot dogs that have been exposed from the NYC road and referring to the godfather. The only performance is Ned Beatty, which is lively and fixed in representing Hoover Shoates, an artist, a religious priest who hears Moates preach Christ's Church without Christ and see signs of dollars and business opportunities. O'Connor's most powerful book is best known as a creepy story and a religious stream that has resulted in a lifeless corpse of "faith". Mr. Huston's movie is a shameful mockery of the intentions of The author, according to me and her fans, well understood that if I dare say that While I perceive that I cannot know clearly what the author wants to convey But I have the love you have for you and your work that I want to be a girlfriend. If I watch Wise Blood like Mr. Huston does, I'll throw it in the trash. For the benefit of Flannery and my, I forgive John Heston for forgetting .... that will take some time.
