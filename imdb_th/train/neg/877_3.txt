I am excited to watch this film, hoping that it will be a sequel to classic cult. "Private lesson" which represents any teenage dream There is only a hot sex scene on the rooftop, but that's it. I've been watching this for a long time. But believe me, this is just the usual boring main flick. <br /> <br /> Hot women, but not enough to rent or buy movies My advice is to watch this only when it's broadcast on cable.
