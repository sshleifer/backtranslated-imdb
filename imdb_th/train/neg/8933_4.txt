When watching last night, it surprised me that Fox spent a lot of money on it and received little investment. It is a disaster that must be believed. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the first morning of the filming Raquel Welch dusted off the shelves above her fireplace to prepare a place for her Academy Award. To win, of course, for this brave original movie. That's not what happened. <br /> <br /> The battle in that series is detailed in print by Rex Reed. Before being released When it was finally launched, there were no regular circus releases. If I remember correctly in Houston, it was open at the drive-ins and the theater. The neighborhood and never played in a large place. <br /> <br /> I put a lot of blame on the hot director Michael Sarne. Force after directing (Not everything is good) Joan, a movie with music about young people swinging in Moden London. <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, Fox would shoot him out. That is why the scenes do not appear in sequence and the characters appear and disappear. Impressive actors (Kathleen Freeman, Jim Bagzas, John Carradine, Andy Devine and others) wasted without doing anything. <br /> < br /> to extend the length to qualify Carmen Miranda (In the great movie from THE GANG'S ALL HERE) and Laurel and Hardee who never dreamed that they will play in the movie X rating. <br /> <br /> The X ranking is due to Use sex language However, the characters don't seem to be fun at all. Maybe someone related to this film has a strict sense and thinks that if they can make these things unattractive, it's not bad to take advantage of them. <br /> <br /> This is one. In the picture "Youth" that almost went bankrupt in Hollywood in 1970, one writer joked that EASY RIDER (which was made to change the bag) was the most expensive movie ever created because many movies were made. M, which tried and failed in the worst ways to replicate success. Sixty times the prestigious director, Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger, created movies like RPM and SKIDOO to attract new audiences. White directors and writers try to create movies to attract black audiences. Those movies are locked in a safe place and both have names and many others from that genre are never the best I have ever known in a video or cable at home. They are the dark secrets of the studio. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch's performance in this story is everything that is considered good. With the right direction and script, she can play the genre of liberated women Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck, who have specialized skills. She looks good and has a terrifying set. Mae West is a lively seventy-year-old actress. The most I've ever seen On the one hand, it was a sad story to see her trying to capture her glory years ago. But I'm sure you want money. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a big budget In this era of movies, take a look at BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS (or from Fox) because it's not really serious about yourself. It's a game that kids play with devices at large studios. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE tries to say something. No one wants to listen.
