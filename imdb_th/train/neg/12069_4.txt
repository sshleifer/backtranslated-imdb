Karl Monson, horror film producer, grade Z, is one of the most productive directors in the low-budget mayhem. His films are filled with inappropriate blood, laughable performances, Boring sub and conversations Thought that it was a pity to kill the guests who stayed at the family mansion. But this movie is almost bloodless. You didn't see the murder, except the shadows and blood flowed a few steps that were lethargic and the plot was quite unattractive. There was power but lack of blood and feud made me disappointed. Just be careful: Don't misunderstand that Monson's movie and Andy Milligan's "Legacy of Blood" are equally weak.
