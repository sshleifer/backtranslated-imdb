Looking for a chopped dinosaur will come back again for our senses in this great third movie. This time, terrorists in Europe (Irish, as I said) Hello. Army escorts should transport uranium. They pulled into the shipyard, opened the truck, and discovered our old friend's carnosaurs. Pandemonium had already visited when the rubber dinos chomp the terrorists, police and marines. It seems that this movie will be inspired by aliens (like Carnosaur 2, mostly), with pathetic marines going through the gun shipyard that is ready. This third script should be a great movie and not Is about a lot of blood, once erupted when Dino Yang tore off the sea head Dino is a creature that is hard and has a normal reshuffle and the T-Rex sounds like an angry elephant when it roars. (It seems to have no eyes) One of the film's most stupid scenes is when the coppers arrive at the scene. They go into a building with trucks that were robbed and heard strange sounds from other trucks In turn, it's a surprise! The Rubber Reptile Gang came out and ate them. Why did Dino be locked in the second truck after escaping from the first time? How are they locked because the truck doors can be locked from the outside only? What is the purpose of filming this scene? Who will care? The two thumbs down for the large rubber Iguanas.
