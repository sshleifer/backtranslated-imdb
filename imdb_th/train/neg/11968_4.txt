This is just a general of Willis Bruce, an action movie. Watch with your popcorn and friends. Rent to save money <br /> <br /> There is no real thing. The fight is not the same. The soldiers are not real. The victims are unrealistic. And why the characters of Tom Skerritt talked to Willis from the DECK OF THE CARRIER. What happened to that? He could not do that from within the boat. <br /> <br /> Sure, Bruce W. received severe wounds. There are a number of average explosions. <br /> <br /> If the film shows Navy SEALS correctly, don't be stuck in Africa, expecting them to come to your rescue. <br /> <br /> Noble attack In the village most disturbed me "Front row seats for ethnic cleansing" ... when Bruce looked at the killing that took place in the city And what will he do He crawled into the city on his stomach. How many people died when they walked around? Oh ... need to count the bodies. I guess <br /> <br /> And if an African man is very important, he says "Duh?" <br /> <br /> Finally This film is very dark, not only in the plot. But it happened a lot at night. It was difficult to do what happened. <br /> <br /> Rent it.
