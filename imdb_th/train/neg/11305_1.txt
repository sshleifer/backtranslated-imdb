This is a very bad western, mostly because it's not right in the past. It looks like it was shot in the back lot in California instead of where Jack Slade lived and died. Idaho, Colorado and Montana territories It assumes everything that is known about 'bad people', 'good people' that are mysterious in this scary script. There is very little direction and punch display. Dorothy Malone completely lost as his wife It seems that Mark Steven will never know how to portray this mysterious Slade. In real life, Jack Slade is a very good director. He was afraid that local residents would drink heavily. When drunk, he would start fighting and cause other problems in Virginia City, Montana. To ensure that he would not be able to threaten them again, they had to be careful Jack Slade after he ignored the warning to leave town soon This is a scary movie. I can't recommend anyone to watch this movie, in addition to the history of Hollywood, even today.
