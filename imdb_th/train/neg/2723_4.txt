The film of Claire Denis seems to fall into one of two categories: violence and bloodthirsty, or quiet and intimate. "L'Intrus" certainly falls in the first category. But it's not as scary as "Trouble Every Day" or "J'ai pas sommeil" <br /> <br /> Now, since I saw "Chocolat", I made it a point to watch every new movie. That Denise made And I was always disappointed. "L'Intrus" was no exception. She has not created a movie that is personal and animated like her first movie. <br /> <br /> You get Denise very much: Betriz Dale, the elderly.

But watching only once is not enough to understand Is I afraid from questions? For one thing, the score is shaking and obtrusive (like in "Beau Travail").

Oh, there are a few beautiful pictures and if you like "Friday Evening" With images of creases in the fabric and large bedspreads, you may appreciate the beauty of "L'Intrus", otherwise avoid washing. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in French and it's possible. That I missed Important things But the dialogue in Denise's film is not more than five pages, spaced twice as long, and there is ample space in the "Chocolat". Silence is noble in "L'Intrus". It's boring.
