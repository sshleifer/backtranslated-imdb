- There is a miner spoiler - <br /> <br /> I have seen many good indie horror movies such as The Hamiltons, The Love Mandy Lane and Cabin Fever; Unfortunately, I feel that Five Across the Eyes does not fall into this category. From the beginning to the end of the movie, filled with performances that are reflected in the terrible script, God only knows why the dialogue that writers like "Don't go out there. She'll get you: If she gets you, you'll kill you and if you kill you die. "The quality of the movie. <br /> <br /> This film shows very little character development and is straightforward. I can't take care of it. Less about the pain and torture that has happened to them because they are just a group of college girls who are not qualified What they do is cry and groan throughout the movie, and if the girls don't cry, they argue. When they talk about different topics, they are random: about dating a man or the way that a father of a girl was burned recently. (The right subjects when you are being chased by a psychopathic killer) <br /> <br /> (Even if you hear the sound of music that knows that the end is near to heaven) <br /> <br /> Job The camera is horrible and sometimes makes this film impossible to capture. I guess that due to the low or no budget, the director is limited to only one digital camera in the girl's car. I think this is an attempt to attract the audience as close to the action as possible: giving the feeling and experience what women are experiencing. But because the camera is very shaky, images that are too small and close to action are difficult to tell what happens in the action and chaotic scenes. It is one story that has to create a movie as a personal matter. But it is another story that needs to be performed on the screen that viewers can't decipher because of bad movies. <br /> <br /> I understand that Five Across the Eyes is a low budget indie film but doesn't excuse the quality. Very low There is no redemption factor for this movie: bad performances, bad scripts, low camera work and no issues. All this, I decided to make this movie as 1 in 10 because it made me very disappointed. I want the meteorite to collide with the world, making me feel relaxed. It is 94 minutes from a silly college girl crying, arguing, running aimlessly and having random inappropriate conversations. However, how many times have you seen girls defecate in their hands and throw a shit on the car's windshield?
