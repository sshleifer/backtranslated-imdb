The story is a little slow and a little stupid. Greta Garbo didn't look very good and I couldn't understand what she said was half because of her exaggerated accent for this chapter. Meanwhile, Melvin Douglas has a different role than usual, and Constance Bennett looks very good, except for a few screams that are funny. <br /> <br /> Positive side Roland Young The best role in the movie I hope he will have more words while he disappeared in the second half of the story. It is also interesting to see Ruth Gordon looking too young. I saw her in those crazy roles that she played from the late 60s to the late 80s and an old woman who was defeated. The smartest part, the best part, may be the last few minutes when we see the dwarfs doing wonders on the skis, pretending to be Douglas down the ramp. That's an amazing and funny video. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can see that this movie - Garbo's last story - not a box office success. It's just dragging too much and continuously about deception. It's annoying. Garbo also knew and called it a stop.
