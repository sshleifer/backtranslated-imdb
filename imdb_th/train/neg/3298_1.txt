When I heard that the Dukes of Hazzard were going to be reunited with current actors and strong scripts, I was like "Okay, I'll give you a chance. It won't be better than the first, but we'll see what happens." I saw what happened. I saw great performances in the late 70s / 80s that were classic. It was so sad to see that Hollywood script writers couldn't create original things today. It seems that they are performing well with a great audience and trying to "REMAKE" the classic program. Being a leader in Hollywood ... it's not WORKIN !!!! However, more about the show I think they should have been better performers. Sean William Scott (Stiffler from American Pie) came to play Bo. I'm sure John Schneider was absolutely disappointed with his character's presence and exploitation. Get real Johnny Knoxville like Luke Duke How low can you go ?? A drunken, cheerful actor playing a cute look. This makes me sick. In addition, I will give Jessica Simpson a beautiful woman. But her performance was bad Catherine Bach, the original daisy player, is intelligent, sexy, strong, stubborn and a girl in the south of IL. Good. She is all girls who grew up! (I am the owner of the doll and jeep - thank you so much !!!) However, Jessica Simpson plays an intelligent ass. The 2-bit slut is Daisy Duke. Daisy never had blond hair. Why are they leaving her? Jessica Alba will play the great Daisy Duke. She can speak with a great Southern accent and she is beautiful and will do a great job. However, I would like to say that this movie has something fierce. I feel like being torn off by paying $ 8.50 for the ticket and they should refund me if you like Dukes of Hazzard (original series). Don't watch this movie. It will make you upset. CMT (Country Music Program) plays the recurring role of Duke all the time at night. So set your TIVO and go with the real, not imitation on the big screen in Hollywood.
