I watched this movie because I liked Nicholas Cage and I found it strange and completely pointless ... so I decided to flick around a bit and shake hands with the 70's copy. Wow. Something different Traditional is better I want you all to know that it actually created a statement. Actually, its existence has a purpose. It is true that the Christian people expressed fear for paganism. If you dig deeper, it will make comments about life. But I don't want to get into the details, just enter if you feel disappointed and you want to know how it should be. Look at the free, slightly dated 70s version but much better.
