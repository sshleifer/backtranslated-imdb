The Vulpine massacre should be the real name of this film. And the tagline should read "Guaranteed to make your children CRY!" This drama is a natural story that tells the story of the wild fox family in remote areas. Starting with the meeting and pairing the two foxes and the eventual birth of a large family and experimenting with them The only thing that can be said is by describing the tree that stands above the cave to understand the animals that love and live ... The lovely scenery and the beautiful filming of animals sounds good? If so then go straight to the hell and start drilling to the core ... <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler below - or maybe a warning! *** <br /> <br /> First of all, we know that a fox was born blind. But seems to be able to match well enough and has a very beautiful musical score that will go with him ... and then he dies ... Next, we have one of the siblings' adventures And then he died ... one sister took her to the screen at the time ... and she died ... and it was like a horrible slasher movie like a fox after another one was Killed by nature in just traps Up and disappear and even by snowmobile! At the end of the movie, almost all the foxes were massacred. Although not showing mercy death on the screen (Not the least visible version), which is different from the word "Tarka the Otter". Death in this movie is almost pointless and is about sadism in the way that it is expected to be created. One or two losses will be accepted. It's a natural movie after all. But not nearly the whole family. <br /> <br /> Don't go to watch this movie that tricked the garbage box into thinking it was safe for the kids to see in advance that things would not go well and you or Your children may feel terrible depending on whether you are sensitive or not. You may enjoy it Or you may not ...
