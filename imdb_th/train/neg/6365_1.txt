Wow, I know that this movie is not good, but it's not bad. The comments of spoilers happen. <br /> <br /> Roddy Roddy Piper is a sweet retired policeman. Helping everyone to smile like a patient after surgery and lamenting the deceased son. His adoptive son returned from the "Special Ops" army and because he was "Things to see" - demonstrated by his teeth, if anyone talks about anything about the past It's time to clean the streets from another man who once knew Piper and his dead son. (The person who killed the bad boy) and his adoptive son <br /> <br /> Oh, the interest in love is a cute girl. There is no reason she wants to jump the bones of a former army officer. This happened in about 2 minutes from 1 scene. <br /> <br /> The action may help this movie. But it is even worse than the story and performance It was done before, it was much better. (Ong Bak is an important example) This is the worst movie I have ever seen - and I've seen the Water World twice. <br /> <br /> Uh, this movie is called HONOR (misspelled for Americans. ) And the tagline "from the Bloodsport producer and Kickboxer" - see director David Worths. Other matters. You will know why they brought both of these films, even if they were more than 10 years old. Eg, "Sh Ark Attack 3: Megalodon "- Tell me everything. <br /> <br /> I'll give you 10 pounds if you don't go to see this movie. <br /> <br /> PS - Sorry for not knowing the name. character
