** Spoiler ** <br /> <br /> This is a serious BAD movie. The performance is very scary. The FX is scary and the storyline is terrible. But hey, it's terrible that it's fun to watch! The script is so bad that it's fun! You just have to cringe and laugh at such lines. "I guess that's what you call CROCTEASING" while the women shone their breasts at the crocodile. I mean, come to joke, make it terrible! It has such horrible jokes. They are funny! But soon after that, it became more and more when the movie became nonsense. I started to sleep Trust me, even if the crocodile plastic, foot pedal on the leaf and the constant wrinkling of the bullet will make you laugh for a long time. Although I have to say that it has a wonderful part when croc rips a friend at half and he hangs there while finding something to do a movie.
