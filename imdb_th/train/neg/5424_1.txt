Mirror. Mirror (1990) is a lame movie. Why do I watch movies like this when I'm young? Who knows? Maybe I was one of my own punishment by watching another horrible movie. I don't know. I need a hobby in my teens. The Rainbow Harvest teenager tried to comfort the old mirror. Soon she learned about the horrifying power of this ancient mirror and used it in the fight against those who made her mistake. This kind of movie, energy providers have nasty side effects. This one changed her interior and went out if she liked it or not. <br /> <br /> The chaos of movies for some reason was restored in the last few years. They should leave it on the shelf and collect dust. People love this movie for some reason. If you do, I want to know why. Until I didn't like this movie and I had no reason to watch again. <br /> <br /> Not recommended at all.
