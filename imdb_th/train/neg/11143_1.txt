Hello. I am a friend of the werewolf movie, and when I saw the name of the Darkwolf class I was like "Umm, the name is simple and good, at least Althou ... I wonder why I have never heard it before." <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie starts with tits, lots of tits, pretty nipples, everything This movie is a budget. Who cares for the werewolf effect, just paying for the actress enough to get a nude picture! <br /> <br /> So about a mysterious darkwolf character (a little spoiler ahead Biker Not even looking strong But as the wise old woman said in the movie "He's more powerful and dangerous than you've ever seen before." Just explain to you the type of biker, beautiful, original. I've watched twice when they use. "Fiery red eyes" for the first time. Special effects! I mean, my god that uses effects "Helping red trees on the eyes with computers" since the seventies It looks ugly here! And don't let me start with the 3D-CGI werewolf as mentioned earlier, like bad and old video games. <br /> <br /> And eventually I like werewolf movies like I said. They are so beautiful that they often create their own legendary werewolf. Darkwolf also created werewolves about the silly myths of hybrid werewolves and ancient bloodlines. The person that the woman touched "began to randomly hurt Which does not make any sense, why must we tell us about the killing rules when they don't even play with them ... Also, the wolf view shot made by Sony handycam or something, mostly filming is Floor and wall Just add a roar and you'll get the ultimate werewolf effect. Blood OK But when the wolf engulfed everyone with an open hand, just laying his hands on the victim, it didn't fool me ... <br /> True, who paid for it? Make these things a horror story that is straight to the video. They are not a nasty comedy.
