I am a million person who thinks of being a fan of Cary Grant, but I can't imagine what would be the reason to introduce this movie. I do not understand Betsy Drake's casting and it seems that no one does it. will be Judging from the small number of movies she played, then <br /> <br /> Most fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn is great to chase and catch Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby. Here, the director or writer tries. Reworked the idea but it failed miserably. I read the comments about the "creepy" method. How was Drake but I thought the explanation was too weak. Franchot Tone walked through this thing as if he were a person. Hungry. Throwing a disaster is one thing. This movie is totally disastrous. <br /> <br /> This film doesn't deserve 10 comments and I don't know. Why is it a bad claim, this movie is preserved when many valuable movies are in the basement. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to torture someone
