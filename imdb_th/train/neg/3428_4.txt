If not Ethel Waters and Sammy Davis, Jr., 7 years old (here being charged without Jr.), Rufus Jones for the president will be one of the worst representatives of the attitudes of African-Americans seen from Early Talkie era and probably not worth watching because of that. Mr. Waters sang well here and "below our Harlem Moon" while Mr. Davis showed us that his childhood experience in the field prepared him to be a superstar as Adult He danced well. Here for a moment, I think he is a small person with many decades of experience. So if you are willing to ignore the negative meaning here, Rufus Jones for President should give you a good enjoyment. PS This is the fourth time today that I have seen and heard the music. "I will be glad when you die. Rascal You" is shown in the movie by Davis this time. Must be a popular song at this time
