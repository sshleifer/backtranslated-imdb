This is the most sacred love I've ever sat. The perfect movie for a housekeeper who is not in use in a handkerchief, housewife, and high heels, trimmed ostrich feathers to see in the afternoon, lying on a dining chair on the sofa. In fact, bonbons play an important role in the film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can watch to the end is that I can finally stare at Keanu Reeves' dreamy face in almost every scene. He's moving too fast to look good. The quick action in this performance is Giancarlo Giannini waving his hand with a Latin-Italian feel rather than a real Mexican. <br /> <br /> The conversation is as hard as wood. Unfortunately there are no torn pieces - the hero has good manners and is not polite. Words that bore the noble family, the old world, warm like a mountain What if they were Irish or Italian or Mexican? This is the story of the fairy. <br /> <br /> I knew that the title would end here, not the movie I had hoped for. The glowing grapes seem to be the focus of all food advertisements in the Women's Day magazine. I do not see his name in the list. But the art director, of course, was Thomas Kincaid, who painted a million dollar canvas of an Irish cottage that sneaked into the fuchsia. This film is projected through rose-colored glasses. If you like the pink sky and blue dream, this movie is for you! (Ribbons look really good as well!)
