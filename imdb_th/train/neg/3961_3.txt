What the dog of the movie Noni Hazel's performance is quite good. But it is set in the midst of a forest of writing a nasty, moderate direction and a wooden show from a group of actors Many characters are especially tender, especially Colin Friels, who has been overrated. <br /> <br /> Very little work in this garbage. "Character development" is mostly done through vain sounds and anger and often conflicts with the character's behavior on the screen. In fact, it's hard to figure out who is dubbing the voice that is talking about because they describe the characters as we see on the screen! How do we know that Colin Freeman (Javo) means being an unpredictable person, not violent and unreliable? The voice of this voice tells us. For crying out loud, the character of his character is half of the movie and the only thing that makes us know is the flippin sound! The real killer is the character. Everything about them Their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the shelves, despite always being alerted to us. They all talk absurdly for "junk". There seems to be no one who really understands life on canvas or patting. And this is what happens to most people. <br /> <br /> Monkey Grip is not appropriate. Received more attention than television movies on weekdays Rude like this, perfectly shot and presented technical But it is a drama with a clich√© that shows credibility and winding for hours without going anywhere. At least Noni went down to her birthday outfit on every occasion. There is no other reason that there is a reason to endure this garbage.
