Some people may say "Baby Geniuses" with a giant robot baby or "Dumbo" that has a psychedelic drug-addicted nightmare scene to win movie awards that annoy children. You may say that, too, but you're wrong. Behold, and because I bring you: Santa Claus, the most improbable movie in the family since ... Okay. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene that shows children From various parts of the world singing their interesting songs (Seriously, this group is almost 20 minutes free, Saki and nothing related to this!) The conclusion that Merlin popped up from far away and saved the day (Do not pay attention to him, he is from Barcelona) This is the best childhood injury. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many therapists I visit, I just ... can't ... get ... those ... reindeer ... laughter .. . Out ... from my head ..! <br /> <br /> Avoid this junk that makes you feel like you avoid starving whales, sex during the breeding season. Still, if burning a gay demon with a serious case of getting too much flu is something for you, I think you should try it. But actually this movie is not worth your time and mental health
