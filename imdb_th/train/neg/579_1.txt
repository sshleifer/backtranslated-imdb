Listening to the director's comments confirm that I wondered while watching movies: This is a movie created by men who want to play movies. The plot is something that the teenager mistook when they had to pass the time. "I can write books / screenplay / award-winning sitcoms." There are interesting ideas embedded in it. (It may be because it is a sequel to other people's movies), but it is completely buried under the guarantee of poor execution and the script that doesn't think of itself. It's not interesting even though I blame the director. He doesn't seem to consult with the actors about what he wants, rather than writing a script in their hands, pointing the camera at them and telling them to continue. Who knows that with a little training, these actors can make themselves better. (Say what you like about musicians in the movie Jon Bon Jovi, good at Row Your Boat /> As it stands, the actors don't have chemistry at all. A beautiful opportunity to use traditional sex and parallel blood sucking occurs when in order to make the character of Bon Jovi infected with vampire blood from a sick colleague. She should bite him. In your heart, they should be cautious about each other throughout the rest. The true time of sexual tension between the two women was unintentionally led by the director himself. Originally he intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for explaining a plot that was pointless - so I thought that the finished product could be worse but not so much. When the movie goes, this is a bad, stupid and forgotten plan. Even when the movie is worthless But not sexy enough or full of blood for entertainment It may be a little fun and funny. But the director left more humor for the wrong reason
