This film is not charming and yet shows warmth. But in the end, this effort was useless and focused on the actors. No doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knew what to do with her entire screen. But she spends too much time from the rest of the actors. <br /> <br /> Another problem is using too much script. Daughters who sneak out of college, an old woman find it difficult to get a good job (And ended with a disrespectful job) a lazy network executive with his executive toys Depending on her beliefs, etc. There is nothing wrong with these things: they are rooted in reality. But when combined, they are just too much and leave us with deja-vu too.
