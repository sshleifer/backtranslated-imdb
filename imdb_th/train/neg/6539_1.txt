If this thing can be rated 0, it will be from a brutal wooden show to the boring, vain perspective of exploitation and hidden feelings in the added Peleo dolebian style. Come pure for the sad audience. This is a disastrous movie. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, of course, what will happen to every character and start planning? From a dull and unrestricted beginning to a pathetic and bleak end, every appearance in this film will be wasted and the special talent dug up for this turkey is gone. > <br /> If you want to see something Serenely, unceasingly, with coldness like a child watching an Ilsa movie At least they didn't show what they were trying to do. What horrible terrible things that have been rated above 5 are the magic of ways that people without tastes or intelligent standards can sometimes gather for the most suspicious purposes. <br /> <br /> It's not scary. Interesting and above all, it does not stir up the meaning of any word. In my opinion, it is a crime. It is a crime that this disgusting and incompetent garbage has been created and has received the resources and, moreover, the tragedy has been protected from a miserably misunderstood audience. /> <br /> No, even the cheerful personality and the way Elvira's joke can make the sound of the explosion make it terrible. Avoid all costs.
