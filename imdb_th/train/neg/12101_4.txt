I saw it. I agree with him 100% but I don't care about his delivery. He just came out as a bastard in the modified and ineffective smear campaign. Edit a lot of cuts, etc ... The camera will focus on him and you'll see 2 or 3 cuts in one or two minutes of interaction. Added a continuous boom in camera photography, a movie that doesn't have a story. <br /> <br /> This documentary has a lot of angles, many interesting stories, making this film very easy. Choosing a religious fanatic is like choosing a mentally retarded child. It's very easy to be wrong. I mean, how hard is it to make these people look like a bean bag? In order for them to conflict with themselves, you just let them recite two verse. I like when he jumps back and forth between people of the same religion and shows that they are totally conflicting with themselves. <br /> <br /> I just think he can do more creative things. The neurologist is talking about the work of the brain that never had flesh. Is it interesting to show the brains of people in times of religious suitability compared to drugs or sex? He can play with more women. Everyone admires the Passion that looks like the inhaled scene in the movie. Rob Zombie, many others may go into the history of John Smith, the founder of Mormonism with a very colorful past Insights into science v.s religion. One is a methodical and very strict process to increase confidence in the theory. It is made up of itself from the bottom that is hardened as a new layer on the top of the proven layer. Requires a lot of proof of burden at each step The other starts at the top and comes down with a claim that cannot be revenge. Is it so? I say that <br /> <br /> done right ?? Will I say that I changed to the original series of HBO? Hit a different religion every week. <br /> <br /> It's an eye opening about one thing. I have to be very blind. G.W.Bush ... No wonder he was chosen. He has a majority of religions and now ... that is the blind that brings the blind. <br /> <br /> Bill Moyer .. Well .. what do I expect from the man who reaches out to the Sutra in New Port Beach?
