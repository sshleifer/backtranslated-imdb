I accidentally bought 50 sets of "Legacy of Horror" film set and you believe I still look for them to find a good HORROR movie in there. Sometimes you may find it fun. But looks like the Devil's Messenger or The Devil Bat, or one of Alfred Hitchcock's great films (some are not horror stories) That they created movies like The Island Monster and this story because they can't accept the fact that they are easily forgotten and should be that. <br /> <br /> So we are open to the concept of the game Westing. The rich and cruel father played by Carradine. (Those who stand in this feature) died and left a legacy for their children and servants that he still hated. Carradine provides good performance as always. But he left most of the recording and the backward sequence, so we had to sit and watch the show that was horrible / terrible. And the effects are quite limited. It is difficult to create a lot of tension when viewers don't see what happens in certain scenes. Some actors like servants Igor and Elgar tried at least and I was ashamed to admit that I left me at the end, mostly for true ignorance. But still a little happy Obviously being a good person But not enough to raise the quality of the movie You do not intend to like characters because they are selfish and cruel or psychotic. But it returned to a whole new level The death scene is quite bad and the suspense is not there. It proves that you may enjoy 20 movies, "Chilling" with movies like House on a Haunted Hill, Little Shop of horror's with Jack Nicholson and Night of the Living Dead. This is the best avoidance.
