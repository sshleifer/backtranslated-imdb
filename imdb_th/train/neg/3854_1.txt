Julia Stiles is a talented actress who has many potential advice from reputable agents. Obviously, the person who guides her to this imitation is not the person who cares about her career. I sat in a theater surrounded by a teenager who left her in a crowd to find another movie that secretly wondered who thought this movie would attract anyone. It's not well written. Director of casting can use only 1 or 2 minutes of effort in the character and the director is not interested.
