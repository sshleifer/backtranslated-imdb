I will never forget the night that I watched this movie. We were on a submarine patrolling the North Atlantic Ocean and this was a movie scheduled for the evening. We all give up after the second reel. They didn't even try to show it at midnight. Choose to run repeatedly instead ... This is all I have to say. But they have stupid rules that my opinion must have ten lines I'm not supposed to comment with random words, so I'll keep going until I get my BS ten lines. I can't find George Goble whose name is on credit But I can remember in the movie The singing was terrible and the song was even worse.
