I think before starting with these movies that it may be a good story. But when I started with, I found it really scary. They said the movie was being built in Afghanistan, but I think 95% of this movie was filmed in India. You can see cars manufactured in India. You can see lars being drinking bisleri (Indian water brand), Hindi written on the street, you can still see temples in Afghanistan. Was shot in Afghanistan I think it should not be a waste of time to watch this movie .. waste time .. I'd like to recommend doing something else instead of watching this movie or maybe it's a better idea But don't look to waste time
