I just rented this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, which I have never seen in any movies since Rocky IV. Unfortunately, this movie was very disappointing. The performances of all parties are not good, except Mr Lundgren, which is okay. Kata Dob√≥ is a good thing to watch, even if she is dressed nonsense and makeup. The crooks are fully stereotyped and Lundgren's character doesn't have depth. I didn't expect to get a movie masterpiece. Unfortunately, this is not an appropriate action. Every turn in the plot can be very predictable and the unbelievable amount of unrealistic reality and comic books like the characters start to bother me very soon. <br /> <br /> Cartoon-like action But if there is nothing left, <br /> <br /> 1/10 (I guess the current average score of 7.0 and 6 votes must be influenced by people involved in making this film)
