I Am Curious is two films, half of it is Lena's sexual experimentation, and the other half is her curiosity with politics / socialism. The director should be stuck with Lena's romantic side and create a separate movie for politics. There is a mix between a political rally / strange war, Dr. King, serious political interviews, fallen breasts and pubic hair This film feels like a documentary film rather than a movie. In addition to interesting sex scenes, you will be bored with watching this movie. Unlike other critics, I think that nude / sexual scenes are too much for what is. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better options. The nudity that is prevalent is a distraction from what is available. I think the actors do well. They play their parts confidently. There is a little novelty that I have watched in American movies during this time.
