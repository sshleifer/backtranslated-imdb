Seems to have a slight curse when talking about gay movies That is to say that the happy ending is not normal. What excluded the beautiful gay movies is likely to end in a broken relationship or premature death. And something like Come Undone just ended ... During the time <br /> <br /> The creator of this terrifying nonsense story has one or two things to learn about planning, direction and timeline Within the first ten minutes of this film, I found myself a little confused and, moreover, after the first glimpse of Jeremie Elkaim's character with a slight mental condition. It seems that this movie will be combined randomly with little or constant effort. There is no real way to tell when you are watching a gift or something that does not exist. I can only do it shortly before it does not really attract the eye. <br /> <br /> Stephen Holden of The New York Times called this movie "... It seems that Stephen will invest. In beer glasses before watching because it is far from beautiful Because received all the praise that this movie received Sadly, the film is still alive until the name And at the end of the movie (Which does not give any resolution I may add) It is common to see that the writer, director and the film have all Come Undone
