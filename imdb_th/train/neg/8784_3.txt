The idea was great, the actors were incredibly scary. But the writing is bad and there is no depth I can't really get into this movie. I didn't feel the characters had many exciting stories, and the movie ended strangely. Is it a happy ending? I don't know. Is it a tragic ending? Again I don't know You leave the theater, feeling dissatisfied. This movie has a lot, but can't just because you can't fix it. I will not recommend this movie because you cannot tell that you are leaving the film's feeling like it is complete. You will be confused. Believe me. You will be grateful if you don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 3 / 10
