A straightforward plot is an old man who lives outside the main road in the forest, one day, witnessing a man killing a child in the forest. Soft For Digging follows the old man's effort to try to convince the police What he saw was not his imagination. However, there is a problem every time the old man guides the police to the place where the murder occurred. The body cannot be found. Soft For Digging has a small dialogue that reflects the most part of the film. During the movie, I found that I was scared twice, when the murdered child appeared immediately before the old man. The rest of the movie that I have to accept doesn't attract me; I found the rhythm of the movie a bit slow. The limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the development of the story and the conclusion after watching the movie took too long. I can feel more from the relationship with the ghost and the old boy and the old man. Alone in the woods at night, unsure of your own heart can lead to creepy situations. Sometimes children are scary like ghosts. Watch the dark water.
