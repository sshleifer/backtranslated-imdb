This time we have a manufacturer of psycho toys named "Joe Pettoe" (can accept?) That make a living an evil toy that kills people. He went after an unfortunate family, just living in the same house where he and his mutant robot "Pino" (again?) Had lived. <br /> <br /> The easiest, the worst. The worst (and hopefully [probably] the last time) in this semi-series, this movie and the previous film looks like a soft porn. But without sex and nudity It's like a low-rent hybrid of "Halloween III", "Puppet Master", "Dolls" and bad movies. Expected in 2000, they started the sixth chapter in the series. But it was abandoned and never completed We all hope that it will remain like that ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 stars from **** <br /> <br />
