No one is bored with the ancient idea that dead people almost appear in horror movies, give us some information and then shoot their heads without clear reasons? I know I am a person. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that it is used in this film, worthless. If you have seen the first movie (the first remake I should say) then the information provided is completely priceless because you already know it. I can guess that it's not worth the main character. But why does an idiot shoot at the head? Will he not want to live? Of course he would have to die .. <br /> <br /> This is the second movie that has the nickname "The Hills Have Eyes II". The first story is the sequel to the original 70s movie. For people like me Look, I may be a part of the minority of my age who knows that HHE2 has started with less traditional HHE1. And now we have a sequel to the remake and the fact that this sequel has the same name as the original HHE1 sequel ... It makes it worse! But anyway .. <br /> <br /> Wes Craven's original Hills Have Eyes are great. In the end, though, the idea is better than the presentation. But most of them have low budget Speaking directly, Wes Craven wasn't as good as the horror director. He created a few good horror films (Nightmare on Elm St., New Nightmare), Scream) and horror movies (Cursed, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn). Oh yes, he did Swamp Thing as well .. But the original HHE2 falls into the latter category. I saw only a few minutes. But it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Now he has written a new HHE2 and it is disappointing as well! HHE remake last year is better than the original movie. It's stressful. I guess it's related to the fact that the main character is a family, not a beer and a pot and a crazy teen sex. It makes us feel dirty. For the first hour, we were in hell, and in the last few minutes, good people took revenge on bad people and felt good .. <br /> <br /> This new movie has no tension. There is no doubt Things that are violent happen to most fools. There is almost no danger here. Just a homeless person hiding under the rocks. <br /> <br /> I'm tired of horror movies that people die because of the silly mistakes they make. The day before I watched "Dark blue sea" in which Samuel L. Jackson walked around the water while speaking and then he was eaten by sharks because the idiot was close to the water .. something that no one did in the given situation. ! This is the exact same thing. People go out on their own to spill, even if they know that people are dying .. seriously, don't take a break. And when you think that others will learn, others will go by themselves! Seriously, isn't this terrible when the characters bring their games and still lose? I think so ... <br /> <br /> It's even during the delivery. It should be rebuilt for the first time, such as the "The Fog" remake (which is less dangerous than the episode "Becker"). The more bad people, the more time in the cave. More tense More than everything <br /> <br /> But it's really downgraded. Little bad people don't have tension Of course we have more time in the cave. But nothing happened In the end, there seems to be only two or three villains. The latest movie makes it look like it's all tribes. Where is this tribe Who is watching them through binoculars Seriously, these things are what this movie should bring to us. But it ended with the same promise that the last film gave us with the same "watching" scene! I will give the demon its due. The look of the movie is good, but it is good. <br /> <br /> I don't think fans must be like this, even if I'm wrong! There is a gore (although most will accelerate while in the dark) but there are no tensions and characters that you are interested in even the matter that doesn't care about in my book! In the end you are not afraid You don't have to panic (Unless you are an 8 year old girl) You don't feel like seeing new things.
