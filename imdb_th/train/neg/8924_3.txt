It was a disappointment to see this DVD after many years. For me, the main problem is that the script is uneven. <br /> <br /> While some are witty and hip. But some are boring and unreliable and lifeless Many gags sat there and there was no spark and energy. <br /> <br /> The actors of the West Mother and Rachel Welch came up well. Roger Herren in the role of Rusty shines (very bad that he didn't. But for my money, only John Hust is too much and Rex Reed, the poor, doesn't get a chance to fight. His character seems to have been relegated to the surrounding area. Wondering what he was doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Low user ratings should give comments about the public's opinion on the piece. The origin of Vidal has a lot of potential. Not even a 'classic' movie clip can do a lot. All in every effort, sub-par and not likely to improve over time.
