I have to admit that I am a big fan of this program, so you have to know how disappointed I was when I watched this movie. First, the plot is terrible. I think it would be more interesting, for example, to see what happened to Arnold's father or something more interesting. But NOOOOOOO, the madman wants to destroy the house. Arnold Many people try to stop this thing. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the plot is not bad. But what really sucks is the process that Arnold and his friends do to stop this madness. They become Friends of spies; They drive the bus (Depending on the video game for the benefit of God) and make everything worse, they do things that many people have tried and died. But not Arnold Gerald and Helga causing They are experts in video games. <br /> <br /> Actually, my mother, my sister, even though I'm really disappointed after watching this movie. 'Because it's the worst way to finish the best cartoon I have to admit that I've enjoyed "Hey Arnold!" It's one of my favorite cartoons in the Nickelodeon. But after this movie, I'm not sure I will watch "Hey Arnold!" As I have seen in the past. <br /> <br /> Other things. Nickelodeon with an enormous amount of dynamite. I can assure you that There are no simple roads to explode. I think the whole city will explode. Oh and please. If your future movies from good cartoons are going to be like that, don't make more movies. You give bad reviews to cartoons that used to be good. <br /> <br /> Actually, I think. That this is the worst way to finish this program, good performances become this movie
