This is comedy. But most have bad taste and nothing in the distance causes smiles in the movie This film is about a couple trying to be a child and those in real life who are in that situation will startled when they see the image that appears. For example, the scene in which the reproductive clinic is not in the least funny and somewhat embarrassing scene The male lead actor who played the construction worker and in his hard hat found a good excuse for being rejected by the villagers. Female lead actors are trying to look younger than 20 years. Both sales opportunities are not interesting, attractive and completely unbelievable. There are totally ridiculous and ridiculous scenes in the movie, for example, cheap airlines without humor. The only reason I gave this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is the one for Shirley Maclaine, which is a class above all in the picture and one for the half-song (Although old)
