There is not much to say about Las Vegas Lady. It is not dangerous enough. But it is more than a boring horror movie in the 70s. This movie is not as smart or sexy as it is trying to be. This plot is a funny story from the story of an old-fashioned casino robbery that lasted until death. Except in the case of Lady Las Vegas, I think the robbery plan was designed by a 3 year old child. The plan involves three women? One unnecessarily and at an ordinary view level outside of the Circus Cicus building, one that will pose as a waitress only to blow her cover on the first occasion and one that will stand around revealing the rift That is very beautiful Complex, right? Aside from Stella Stevens and her chest above, other women involved in the plot are not particularly memorable. Las Vegas Lady co-starred Stuart Whitman when not striving Steven. His involvement in the film was highlighted by one of the most stupid gun battles ever in the movie. <br /> <br / > I really want to like this movie It has always felt like the 70s I like and the beautiful pictures of Las Vegas around 1975, but the movie itself is too boring to give a score higher than 4/10? And that may be an exaggeration Eventually, Las Vegas Lady lost the perfect break.
