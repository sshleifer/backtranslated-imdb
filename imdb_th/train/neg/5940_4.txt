Look, I'm reading and reading this comment and there are many things I want to say. But I will try to make it short but clean ... <br /> <br /> First of all, forget all. The worst thing in this film is ... It doesn't show anything that is notoriously famous and I agree with most people here as "Hollywood". I mean, what do you expect in real life? When people wake up and see that you won't find the true truth about 2pac and Biggie ... Everything is concealed and buried deep down. <br /> <br /> Second, I'm not against 2pac. Or Biggie, I love them both, but 2pac and Lil Kim DID are definitely embarrassed in this movie. <br /> <br /> Continue for everyone who is saying that this movie is great and doesn't see the truth. also You are too blind to see it because you think you know something about Big or you don't know anything about him and you also like Hollywood movies. Use your thoughts and see how the clouds ... There are many things you can say when it comes to this topic. I don't say 60% of what I have to say because it's a very broad topic. But for my movie Can say only a little that I can do much better But anyway, I just have someone to give her opinion .... no hard feelings ... <br /> <br /> Look, I like hip hop and I live for it. But after watching this movie, everyone with a little Wisdom will see that this is not the way somebody thinks to live. With respect to 2pac and Big, like other artists who make a living like this, should change other pages because you are destroying the youth .... Bring the wrong message to the children and that is: not going to school but Live from the streets of hustle and just grab a paper .... <br /> <br /> The real hip hop should be about love and wisdom. Smart and intelligent. <br /> <br> OK, I know. Many of you will think I'm crazy. But this is just my view Look, I might be wrong about something and I'm not saying it's a completely bad movie because even though I'm in hip hop for 17, 18 years, I don't know anything about the 2pac race or Biggie, no matter how many articles I read How much I support them and listen to their music ... just like all of you There are only people who are really close to them and the only killer who knows the truth behind all of this Will be the greatest ever, no matter how they live But please try in the future to better learn and love others. Think good for people who do not like you because at the end .. ITS is not about how to get money or reputation. U get and how fast. U get to the top. It's about fully accepting your self and blessing your body and your mind ... You will live after death !!!! Calm and love to take all drugs !!!! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LEFT EYE, JAM MAY JAY and others who change in this world !!!!
