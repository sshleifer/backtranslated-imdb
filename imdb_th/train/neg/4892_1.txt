They have sex with Asian melons. <br /> <br /> Okay, first time I wonder if But after seeing a cloud of heart, I changed my mind and eventually believed that they had sex with watermelons and dead or alive. No absolute safe sex (Bring horrid) The man shoots it all into the woman's mouth after he dies. Never heard of HIV? Don't guess. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is mostly boring. But incredibly disgusting In fact, in some parts, it is disgusting. I can't leave my eyes pure. Having sex with the dead! How is it gross? And what is the message behind it? We need water. We need melons. Do we have to die for sex? Sorry but this stuff is foul!
