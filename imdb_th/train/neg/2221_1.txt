I'm sorry, but this might be scary in 1978 when it came out. But in modern times, it doesn't hold The only interesting scene in the entire movie is the opening scene where Michael kills Judith, his sister wearing a Halloween mask. The most shocking moment in this film was when his parents wore a mask to see if their son had killed their daughter. This film fell from there and did not pick up until fifteen minutes ago. But now it's too late for the audience to ignore the whole story. There is hardly any character development, and people are crazy about Laurie, who is always a great heroine when she doesn't have much. I'm sorry to disagree with anyone who is afraid of this movie. But if you want a great horror movie, watch The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. These are the two best horror movies ever created. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. I do not want to believe that Roger Ebert would give four stars because there was no way that this movie would have earned such a high rating.
