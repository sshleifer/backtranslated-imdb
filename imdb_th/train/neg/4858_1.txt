Why in the world that someone will create this junk movie, the first two films of Zombie Bloodbath are very stupid. But it took time to make the cake during the worst trilogy (Sometimes all the time) Todd Sheets is still the director. But not the author of the screenplay anymore, which is not negative or positive because he is an honest person like the one who wrote this script The writing is too dependent on f-word, which is used between 200 and 300 times that of nausea. The performance is close to the last two Bloodbath movies. So naturally, it's the worst thing I've ever seen. Special effects are better than the last 2, but still look good. The story is too complicated because it is a good thing and is about a government trial that is wrong and the zombies are created. Another highlight is the frozen mutant zombies. cryogenically And students who know how to travel across time lead to one of the most silly endings I've ever seen After this movie reached the scene, which is strange because this movie is a continuous scene. Only see this to make it fun, because if you enter this with a serious heart, you may kill yourself. <br /> <br /> My score: BOMB / **** 95 minutes.
