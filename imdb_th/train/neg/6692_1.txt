During the night that I didn't sleep well, I changed through the channel. & Found that this movie was embarrassing. What are they thinking? <br /> <br /> If this is the life after "Remote Control" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, no wonder she disappeared. <br /> <br /> And why David Keith arrived Use this role? It's pathetic! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I turned to watch this movie until the end. But this must be the best part This nerd college boy brought this outstanding girl home ... This scene is straight from the comic book - or cheap porn. She called the mother an anal collection and kissed her father. "Oh, I didn't expect to speak!" <br /> <br /> After this, I have to see how it will end. <br /> <br /> Of course, the bitch from this hell has The past, so the SWAT team is upstairs and yes ... they surround her! And yes yes! The child blows her brain !!!! AHAHHAHAHAHA !! <br /> <br /> This is a must-see TV. <br /> <br />
