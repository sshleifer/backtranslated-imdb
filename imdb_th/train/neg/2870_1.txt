Oh God! Please for the love of all things sacred. Don't watch this movie! 82 minutes in my life, I will not come back. Of course, I stopped watching halfway through. But I think it might be better. It can't be. Anyone who really likes this movie is a seriously ill and distorted person Not surprisingly, we, Australians / New Zealanders have a terrifying reputation when talking about making movies. Everything about this movie is awesome from acting to editing. I don't normally write reviews here. But in this case I will exclude I just hope someone warns me before hiring this disaster.
