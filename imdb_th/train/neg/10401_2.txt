Dear darling, dearest ... I! I have the strength to look through ... but why? <br /> <br /> The first two movies are fun and quite good, but this is terrible. We have trouble seeing all things. This is some Tremors for kids. I can't believe that this movie was all created. It looks like the props that are taken from some bad western dresses (for kids) and they do everything they can. <br /> <br /> What is the audience for this movie? I think only 12-14 years old. If you are over 14 years old, you will experience serious problems with this movie. Not only slow but boring, the characters are overacted (not just a bit too) and so stereotyped. It's fun while .. but not long enough not to make you want to throw tomatoes at the screen You know everything that will happen, right? ... You've seen it a billion times before in a children's hero series. I chose all the survivors and all the shivering animals that the characters suggested. It was terrible .. wrong .. So ... crap. <br /> <br /> But okay, we laughed together. Not just in the stupid plot hole But some scenes that have a replay value or two ... or a scene in which two babies are shaken by themselves, shaking themselves to one of the obvious pet food shakes ... It's a wonderful scene Repeatedly playing and laughing at his best Also makes me smile when I think about it But that happened again sadly .. and that was when the gunman "Damn" appeared and made his part wonderfully ... and one more comment. At this point, we almost cried with laughter. But after that ... no one can do it .. (?) .. So it is quite depressing from there. <br /> <br /> Tops here are trout and demons. If anyone ever told you that this is a good movie ... he may be a "plant" vegetable or a very evil person. This movie must be as vibrant as possible. Looking forward to seeing Tremors 3. It's a box office story compared to this ... This ... * goosebumps * No ... I'll leave it.
