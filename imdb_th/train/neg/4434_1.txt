I rented this movie, thinking that it was a very pleasant historical event. What I got is pure waste. This film creates confusion in most points, changing fast in almost every point and frightening at every point. The image of the queen of Mira Sorvino, who plays as a scholar, the young man is the lowest. Ben Kingsley should be removed from his knighthood because he thinks this movie is one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should definitely play Petunia Dursley. At least the Harry Potter movie is more entertaining than what they call playing in movies. <br /> <br /> The movie looks like some college kids attend school. Cinematography 101 and failed miserably Almost every scene in the movie is shuffled with some effects; The end result of the study is the most magical revision I've ever seen. Jay Rodan is almost as good as Agis; Too bad, he has a bad script to work with. Rachael Stirling gives the utmost effort to wait. In the end, I need a Blockbuster Video that gives a refund. I am very happy that I didn't spend 10 dollars to see this failure in the cinema. If they perform the Marivaux drama since the 18th century, it makes me wonder if there are many people in this era who have the best nap during this event. If I were there, they would not hear snoring. Thank God for the modern comfort of the DVD player. You can skip boring or scary scenes. Guess means that I only see the beginning and the end!
