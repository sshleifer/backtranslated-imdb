There is a DVD published in the UK in 2002, code HRGD002 on the cover. There is no ASIN, VFC 19796 on the disk. There is no IFPI code in the inner edge. <br /> <br /> May transfer directly from VHS. <br /> <br /> No comments about adult movies But this one has the least plot and the characters are reliable It was shown in the United States in a regular movie theater. <br /> <br /> I've seen it in Pennsylvania. Back in 1975, <br /> <br /> It should be in the movie encyclopedia. DVD There are no special features and no subtitles and may use VHS tape as a source of information.
