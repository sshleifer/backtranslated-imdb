This movie is very disappointing. Especially when directed by Priyadarshan. It is a sad story to see such a depressing standard. Poor screenplay (There is no real existence) and the song sequence that contains bad songs every minute and at the most strange time, killing all the movies that offer some funny scenes, but there may be a total of just 5 minutes. Overall, this film was disappointed due to the lack of stories that were too clear. In fact, there are only a few people who live to watch the second half of the movie after the time. <br /> <br /> Nobody misses if you don't watch movies. Not worth spending money on tickets in this movie. Wait until it appears on TV ...
