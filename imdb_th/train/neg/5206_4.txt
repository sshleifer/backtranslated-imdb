Adjusting to play in a movie theater is often a bad idea because it is two different media types. Do you think it's a good idea to make ZULU become a stage? Imagine that the two brave Redcoats were sitting in the open mouth of the tent. "Blimey had thousands of them there." Great movies and bad plays. <br /> <br /> So Will create a great movie. Br /> <br /> 1) A talented actor created on the chemical screen <br /> <br /> 2) Great conversation <br /> <br /> On Paper Cher and Chazz Palminterri will be a good selection option but not in these roles. The story revolves around the killer, played by Palminterri, invading the house to kill the wife that Cher plays, mostly in the house. I can't take these two characters seriously, although maybe it's the fault of the script, which can't decide whether to try seriously or be funny. Since the story is quite silent, it is of utmost importance that the dialogue will shine and again because of the strange tone of the screenplay. If you want to see the excellent translation of the stage plays transferred to the silver screen, let FAITHFUL miss and see 12 ANGRY MEN instead.
