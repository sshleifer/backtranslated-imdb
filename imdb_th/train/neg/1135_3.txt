I did not read Lincoln's biography, so this may be the right image ...... <br /> <br /> And probably because I'm used to being alienated and unrealistic portraits that I see. Unnatural Lincoln is an honorable person and a savior of our country ... <br /> <br /> But why did they create a movie that represents Lincoln as a clown? While Henry Fonda built an excellent Lincoln, he showed that he was "aw shucks. I'm just a normal guy." It looks a little insult. <br /> <br /> [Received, that's all of Bushie Jr.'s campaign To make us think that he is "Just an ordinary person", so we don't care that he is a rich and privileged mentally retarded person - but that's all other stories] <br /> <br /> This film is not only Shows that Lincoln is a simple person (Almost a generous person) The movie states that Lincoln had just entered into law unintentionally and that he was not interested in law with a simple idea. Of laws concerning rights and offenses In this film, he is not a very good defense lawyer. (He sat on the table and made fun of witnesses) and the results were determined by the chance / luck. <br /> <br /> In addition, part Because this has been financially supported by Republicans (In response to some plays that were supported by the Democrats that came out) and partly because of the feelings of the time, this movie is a pity for religion. Don't waste time on this movie!
