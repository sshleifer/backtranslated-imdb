Friday the 13th! There are movies that are worse than the series you hate. I won this film in a college competition and it was a waste of money, even though it was free. Jack Jones is a star as a truly scary singer who tries to find a murderer or something. At least the thirteenth Friday never bored me. I should pull my nails over to see this again.
