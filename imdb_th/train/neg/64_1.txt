This movie is terrible. The ending is really scary. There is no plot about the movie, but the only thing that suits this movie is the performance made by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performance is great! The only problem is that this film does not perform fairly. If the script comes close to capturing half the right story, it will be worth watching. But the performances of Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones were completely lost with the horrifying story of God ... or lacking. This story .... is a real movie ... It is nothing more than a general conversation that will happen during that time. There is nothing special about any character. The only thing special is the way that Robert DuVall portrayed the old man's walking with the old man. There is nothing that should happen between the entire film, including the ending. When the movie ended, I was surprised ... I was surprised that I was watching a movie, both waiting for interesting things to happen, so that the movie was worth watching at that time. It never happened! The actor's character began to rotate clearly, the film ended and I realized that I had just wasted 2 hours watching movies without plot and no meaning. It's not a story All movies took place in a day. That's it. One day in the life (and death) of some southern people on the farm. The story can happen in one day. (In addition to movie practice days) All performances by actors are excellent. But they wasted the disappointment of the movie ... if you could call it a movie
