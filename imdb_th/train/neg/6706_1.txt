I saw this movement many years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival. If I remember, I liked it. It showed great potential. I guess most people here are blasting this movie because this movie seems to be shaky. (By own filmmakers visiting the official website - short, being shown as "rough") <br /> <br /> However, it's a simple joke. I think many people try to read jokes too. What they should do is make you laugh - just that, I do that in the show, so it succeeds at that level, just 2 cents later.
