I have to change my perspective on the worst movies in the world that just saw this movie! <br /> <br /> Don't make a mistake, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> This is a list of reasons: <br /> <br /> Desperate story (even if it's based on real story ). Horrible performances (Judges are considering what they think). Unbelievably bad performances. Children's dialogue, continuity that does not exist, lack of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Get pictures? <br /> <br />
