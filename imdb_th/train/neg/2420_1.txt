I tend to comment only on movies I like to find. "Everyone according to their own tastes" But here I want to exclude The location of this film, which seems to have disappeared in shuffle, is that two self-centered adults have the perfect right to go out to Las Vegas. There is a cultural sanctioned drunkenness. They do not have the courage and responsibility to wake up the next morning and cancel what they are moving at. "Love" is important, right? Go to hell with others or not, things "ultimately work" is not an issue; In fact, it is quite irrelevant. The point is to insult others, especially if they are young people, and especially if they are in a position to rely on to make it lighter and supplemented by this film. There are more terrifying behaviors than these "rulers" that can be shown, which will make the army of social workers fall into their heads in the heartbeat.
