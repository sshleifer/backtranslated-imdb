This movie "Joshua" is very disruptive and completely pointless. In fact, it makes me tremble, thinking that there are people who will enjoy watching it. It's about the reaction of a young man to his newborn sister and that's just a small part of the iceberg. Throughout the film, viewers have to face child behavior that is not as stable as imagined. Increasing insult to injury at the end of this movie has absolutely no real effect, except the result of pure evil that is in the hands of the young, no less intelligent than stupid adults. There is no redemption, no justice, and the whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what happens around them. Frankly, I don't like watching this movie. It's not very stable. Even for those who may enjoy horror movies, this movie may be too much. Despite the fact that this film serves well But the story is a nuisance to watch, it is equal to waiting 90 minutes in the dentist's waiting room to wait for dental surgery.
