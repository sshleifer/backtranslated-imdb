When I saw the cover of this film, the first thing I thought was it was made for the video. The second thing that comes to mind is that it is similar to other horrible movies about "Darkness Falls", the story of a dumb witch who killed people in the dark. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls is a masterpiece compared to the garbage dump and this movie should not be created. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a small story for a witch or more. The pointless introduction of two young children who are going to meet the tooth fairy in the hope that she will give a new bike to their teeth. The release was filmed poorly and, like other movies, it was certainly not scary. At present, this movie is about Peter (Lochlyn Munroe) Peter renting his house and ex-girlfriend Darcy. (West Chandra) and her daughter Cole were there. Cole meets the neighborhood children and they talk about the tooth fairy and how you should not lose your teeth or she will come to you. Unfortunately, a few seconds later, it seems that the Fairy Fairy will steal her bike and knock her teeth away (ridiculously). Will Cole will escape from Fury's heart and her mother and Peter will be able to Help her and will awaken their love again ... This is a bad movie. You might think. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the main problems of the movie. This is the uncertainty of the Tooth Fairy. They say she killed you. You lose teeth, but not you are like a serial killer who randomly kills and if you lose your teeth, you have to go for sure. She stole the bike, so clearly she was a thief. I have already said that the idea of ​​this film is based on Darkness Falls, but they have been inspired in the appearance of the Tooth Fairy where they look. She looks like a prey that has been burned and before this she went. Around the children who were killed. Um ... It's almost as though she was a scam. Freddie Krueger from the movie "Nightmare on Elm Street" certainly, and this is not the worst part of the mess. This This movie may have the most ridiculous climax. (Truly not laughing because I found it scary than funny) that I've seen. Don't see this. <br /> <br /> Just a little story. Lochlyn Munroe is in Scary Movie and Jianna Ballard is in Scary Movie 3 and they both are on this issue. Horror movies <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 from **** 80 minutes R for violence
