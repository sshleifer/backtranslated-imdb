Robert Carmichael's Great Ecstasy is a bad movie on all sides. Scripts, boring rhythms, lack of depth in any characters, pointless subplots, scary performances, unnecessary climaxes make this movie the worst I have ever seen. I didn't find anything satisfying, fun, or stimulating in any way. <br /> <br /> I imagine that filmmakers think they do something clever and gloomy with a light that has a sense of silence. If so, they failed fully. It makes me bored and I hope that I will never watch it. <br /> <br /> Avoid all costs.
