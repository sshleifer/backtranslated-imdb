Such bad movies should be withdrawn from stores around the world. Full of boring and boring characters and with a lead character that has an annoying attitude and constant dry sound, giving a sound without thought for every action and feeling While I paid for ownership, I felt that there was a duty to look through and feel sorry. My head hurts forever because the boring and pointless characters make life less. A group of children who do not have any knowledge about anything. But scary and worst, there are scary conversations all the time, just pondering while the main characters try to date women. Very boring. My friend trembled with hatred and I was red with shyness. I dropped 6 pounds. The DVD was on eBay the following day and I didn't get much money. Avoid like the plague.
