I saw this movie recently in the Video CD. <br /> <br /> I will talk about the good things for the first time. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, at least try to appear. That it is Not biased, such as not showing one character in black and the other being white The two main characters are friends and live together well in the country and the economy is not flourishing while at the same time failing. Their families gather and have a party, and they practice their favorite sports, which is the shooting of a sport companion rifle, not a rival friend. <br /> <br /> But after the first 15 minutes The audience is expected to believe that for some unknown reason, these friends must hate each other. For some reason, Bosnian did not know at this time in the path of conflict. Of course, the script adds to the TV video in which the characters seem to be watching the live news program in English. But the clip came from 1993 to 1992 when the war began. <br /> <br /> 1990 election history. This film tries to accuse Karadzic, the candidate for president and leader of the second largest party of the Bosnian Parliament (SDP). According to the Bosnian constitution, the SDP must have a presidency in 1992, but a coup in January. The Bosnian Democrat Party conducts complete control and organizes a separate referendum in March which proclaims itself a law in Bosnia and declares dissolution. <br /> <br /> The history of IDAP begins with Bosnian Muslims. Alija Izetbegovic, a man with a suspicion of "STTH". He was a student of Nazism in WW2. He also wrote "Mein Kampf" of his own, which he said: "In reality it is impossible. To have peace or coexistence between "Islam" and non-Islamic social and political institutions "<br /> <br >> In 1990, he lost the IDAP election in" Pro-Yugoslavia Moderate ", a Bosnian Muslim Fikret Abdic who worked with Christian Serbs in During the civil war and treating supporters like the Abdic brothers, they were prevented from taking power by Izetbegovic who lost the election. But holding the power position <br /> <br /> The event from the top disappeared from the movie. But it's a real event that leads to war. <br /> <br /> There are problems with props as well. Serb soldiers in the movie wear Soviet WW2 hats which they do not use. One soldier carrying a M-1944 WW2 rifle used by the USSR, not Yugoslavia. <br /> <br /> The director and script writer have a chance. But they chose to write history again
