The only real highlight of this film is the death of the terrifying man and the reaction of the surviving characters. <br /> <br /> In every way, this movie is a mutilated movie of the legs. Scissors, Placid and Alligator lakes with Godzilla (1998), thrown a little The female lead cannot be seen because it is clear that she has a better representative. <br /> <br /> All the movies surround the filming of extreme sports called blood surfing, in which the players cut themselves. And play in waters filled with sharks In this film, a giant saltwater crocodile also occurs in the area. People who eat this movie end up. <br /> <br /> I don't mind bad horror movies. But I hate horror movies that aren't really boring.
