Scary, but mostly in the sense that it would end before I was 70 years old. I saw this as a late night again in 1976 and thought it would not end. Just like Nutcracker, it's better than nothing (just that). <br /> <br /> Ray Millland is a little scary because he looks as if he's being stuffed by a taxpayer. She smokes all the beautiful downtown Burbank Browns. <br /> <br /> It's Roy Rogers's Rosemary's Baby model. This is the only turkey that shouldn't be done. If you have insomnia and are 1:30 am on Saturday morning and have nothing but the 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship play, I think that would be the case. But God helps you if this is your only choice for entertainment.
