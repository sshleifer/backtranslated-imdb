I love the first season The quality is slightly reduced in the second season, with the best players (Pegasus!). The third season is quite exotic and original and it's ok. The fourth season began to fall quickly because they never gave us any explanation. Now we really need them. What is the plan of Zion? Why are there two groups of sylons? What is the thing that Angel-Kara led to the destruction of the Earth-1, the past five Zila, what are the forms of the past and how they survived or were they reincarnated? Every question has no answer. <br /> <br /> Then finish Earth-2 (Our Earth) in the past. Okay. But destroy the navy! Can you stop using technology and stop living in every city and spread thousands of people around the world? That's not just against science. But is against the reason and against life And the philosophy of the show seems that humanity is constantly stuck in a cycle that is caused by nature, seducing the degraded capitalist society that invented A. A. That destroys everything. It has no vision without hope for a great future for humanity and it is the opposite of the appropriate science fiction. And don't let me start with the angels! Religious claptrap of the worst kind! The ultimate disappointment !! <br /> <br /> All "All this happened before and will happen again." Things that should relate to the previous advent of the series, not just to the world as we know Creating a new program in accordance with the old fashion should be a clear rhythm of embarrassing Frakkin genius. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
