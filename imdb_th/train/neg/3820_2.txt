Seeing "speaking easy" is a painful thing for Buster Keaton's fans. Seeing writers, actors, actors, directors and stunt actors with this shameful phenomenon is like seeing Picasso used as a dripping cloth. Or may like seeing the best Camembert that is mixed with whey. <br /> <br /> Keaton is a bad person as a post professor, which is the only word that makes him unable to say that "Tell me about George Rabbit" (The post will say something like "Please inform me of the status of a small mammal in the Leporidae family of the Lagomorpha Order. You are kind, I believe that most will speak with George's nickname.") When Keaton created His own character, they may seem irrational. But they are not stupid They study quickly and become experts in their world. Otherwise, with a post that never stops and fails and those who cannot control his fate more than Titanic's mice And while Keaton's original character is charming, innocent, and innocent, the post reveals that it is a very slow sexuality. If he had been physically stimulated, he would put an ice bag in his bag and ask Help from doctors <br /> <br /> There are a few short moments, such as Keaton, trying to get rid of Thema Todd or his advice about the proper costume for Greek dance. But it is not worth it to endure both Movies to see them. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of the movie, please be drunk. "Speak easily" with friends "Mystery Science 3000" but besides being silent Give them 100% of what Buster Keaton remembers.
