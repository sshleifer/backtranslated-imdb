My wife and I found that the film was not very satisfied. While the plot makes you interested and busy wondering what happened when you leave the cinema, it has a very loose end that is not reasonable. (Front spoiler) Christopher Plummer, wealthy leader of the New York Bank, has a hidden secret, making profits from the WW II associated with the Nazis and stealing items stolen from Jews. He kept the evidence (Including diamonds and documents with the Nazi swastika) in a safe in his bank. Why? If he does not want this to be revealed, why did he not burn and destroy the documents many years ago? And diamonds? Obviously he doesn't need them - why treat them instead of eliminating them? How can a bank robber discover his secret? How do they know they will be zero in this # 232 safety box? Detective Ace Denzel, Washington also discovered bank records showing SD Boxes No of 231 and 233, but not # 232. He meticulously finds time to find tired bank records to discover this strange fact. All the while dealing with the hostage situation, the hot reds and bank robbers threatened to start taking them soon. Wow! Talking about the magical powers for detectives. <br /> <br /> Bank robbers left millions of dollars in loose currency in the vault they opened. They only use the contents of SD Box # 232 for the purpose of blackmailing the bank president. This challenges a rational attempt at logical explanations for what the film shows as criminals or for his associates with less brains. <br /> <br /> Jodi Foster by Use political connections with To enter the bank under the control of a robbery, robbing a bank while holding a large number of hostages She offered the head of the bank robber to buy the documents that he had in his hand. But he doesn't care So what is his point (if any)? <br /> <br /> My wife is invaded by the arrogance of all players. Christopher Plummer (bank president), Denzel Washington (detective ace) and Jodie Foster, gunman for the problem. <br /> <br /> The last movie Jodie Foster I saw "Flight Plan" was filled with holes that didn't mean anything. I think I like Jodie Foster, but I may avoid her future movies. <br /> <br /> Now my problem is that I rarely convince my wife to watch a movie. I disagree with her on this list ... "lose money and waste time". Be warned in advance. A well-built movie, a good actor, writing a punch.
