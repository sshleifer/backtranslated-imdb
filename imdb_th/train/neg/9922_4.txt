As I grew up, Joe Strummer was my hero. But even then I still feel cold with this movie. For a better future and worse, the future is something that is not written as a straightforward documentary "Behind the Music". Most pointless animated footage is raised from "Animal Farm". This movie is consistent. But protracted for about half an hour. <br /> <br /> The campfire theme while touching in thoughts First of all, without a name, it's hard to know who is half the interviewer. Secondly, who wants to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp and John Cusack mouth licking the butt of hosannas about that man? They are not related to the life of Strummer, and their opinions do not add anything to his story. <br /> <br /> This image is the best picture when Strummer goes through. Tape interviews and dialogues about: The suicide of his brother came to terms with the death of his parents, the happiness of fatherhood. For me, these things move the most because it shows that Joe Strummer is not a punk icon that we all know and love. But as a normal human being who has to deal with the joy and grief of life The 90's came to mind) Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten For the Dead Only
