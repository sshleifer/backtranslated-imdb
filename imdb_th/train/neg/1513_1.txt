Herds are not real movies. It was a wannabe movie with wannabe actors, not including Richard Gere. He gave a great performance. But when only one actor truly gave himself to his character and other actors were performing ... the result was pathetic like this movie. You will see that the idea of ​​acting is to hide the fact that you are doing. What is Claire Danes doing now! She is the most inappropriate actor for this character. In the film 99.9%, she looks out of the place very much from everything !! The only thing she did was ask an idiot question like "Do you really think so?" All there .... hahaha and see Avril Lavigne ?! This makes me laugh really .. Anyway .. If you want to feel throwing this movie will work for you !!! I wish I could score -5 ..
