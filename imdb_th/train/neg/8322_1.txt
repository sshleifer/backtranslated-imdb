I was surprised to see that the film had a very good score when I checked in IMDb after watching it. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've watched many bad movies. Seems to be a good movie at first But when he underwent surgery, I couldn't believe it was that bad. This voice will destroy everything! Just think that you are being exposed like that and listen to what he said. I saw the movie in German so I didn't really know what he was saying in English. But such funny things "Yes, right. It doesn't hurt .." ... What is this? Tell yourself, "Think about something else" and forget your pain by just thinking of your boyfriend. Just ... stupid and his mother ... What do you think? Someone told her, her son died from surgery (What she expected) In addition, she also found some letters in the Jessica Albas bag, also "You know the hospital" ... then it takes time. "One second" to figure out? What is hell? ^^ And the ending ... Why did the police catch them? The patient died from surgery, that's all that happened. Drunken doctor who doesn't know anything at all ... and they catch all of them, even the girlfriend ??? why??? Despite all that I think Christensen does not work well But that doesn't really count for me ... mistakes and the stupid things that I write about above are problems. I watched this movie with friends and we all were very disappointed ... as I said, one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... didn't watch it;)
