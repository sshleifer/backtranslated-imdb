This is how you do: believe in God and repent of your sins. That thing should turn around the next day. <br /> <br /> Until fifteen minutes ago, this movie played a bad summary of the crappy life. His mother died His stepmother was b_tch. His father died. He drank. He married. He had a child. He drank again. His wife was very angry. He caused his children to be disappointed. The wife threatened to leave. He called you back late. B / c He wanted to kill himself. Then after the conclusion occurred, that was when we received a delicate message like <br /> <br /> "He wants salary." This is a phrase that I have to say over and over again when the credit starts to roll, so I won't lose respect to Madsen. <br /> <br /> Madsen fell on his knees and asked for forgiveness of Christ When he did, he walked outside and said he saw the world in a different way. He told his wife that he had found God and that was good enough for her. Turn over the scene for four months and the wife is tired of going to church. Ended the movie while Madsen went to the bar and talked about his happiness with Christ and without alcohol The last moment? He sent a little wave to the bar. (Eg sin house) and let gay Miami-Associate after school special congratulations jump on the air while the camera freezes frames See why I have to repeat the phrase? "He wants a salary." <br /> <br /> This guy, this movie is not good. The production cost of grade B 80 doesn't help much. The script is probably the "Touched By An Angel" episode. It's easy. It may be falling in 30 minutes, including ads. The show is wooden and unbelievable. Even Zen Sen, who I am a big fan of and is the only reason I sit here, makes it clear that this is his first performance and he doesn't know the dollar from his elbow on the camera within 45 minutes. This is like homework. I just want to take it out and say it's okay. I see half of it. That's good enough. But no. If I sit in Cheerleader Ninjas, I can sit all the time. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't. Have given this 1 for two issues: 1) I love Madsen. I know it's not fair. But it was great to see the opening theme "Introducing Michael Madsen" suing me 2) some conversations were so bad that classic I'll put quotation marks at the end of this story so you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> That's about it. To wrap it, this thing is a piece of shit that should be washed with the rest of the turds. But hey! look! Michael Madsen! (See more at TILT, EXECUTIVE TARGET, DAUGHTER, my boss, etc.) Now I have to watch the dog in the reservoir again and see the Zen police torture the police for respect from him. Look, kids. <br /> <br /> " This will make me blind. But I will continue to drink. "- Madsen's first cheap alcoholic drink. <br /> <br />" I don't 'understand! Everything seems very beautiful! "- Madsen went outside after confessing to God. <br /> <br />" I will go to the city later and pick up the scriptures and I will have to cut my hair too. "- Madsen after conversion at the dining table Live In your hair
