This movie is messy. It has the worst fix I've ever seen. It's almost like at the end of the scene that the author wants to advertise and the creator has added a black screen for two seconds to fulfill the writer's dream. <br /> <br /> Under the chaotic direction and editing Glimmer of good things Good ideas sparked interest. But some things are wrong. <br /> <br /> A story about a virtual priest who is trying to solve the murder. The first thing that is difficult to bite is that Richard Grieco, as a priest, does not claim that he is a good priest and that he is quite successful. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as a bad guy. He always plays as a bad guy who is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Oh, the idea that happened to me that maybe a terrifying and horrible fix and a plot that disconnected is trying. Add confusion to the character (Grieco) and just to prove that they plan to give credit backwords back is not a good sign for any movie. <br /> <br />
