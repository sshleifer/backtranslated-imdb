This "movie" is the culmination of all the bad things about modern movies. Unnecessary slow motion, flip / jump / somersault, unnecessary characters, unnecessary conversations unnecessarily (Is that the word? Well, it has just been invented by me. Robot) <br /> <br /> What happened to the actual practice? (Eg, parking, spray, skin). The only tool that shows the combination of future functions and realism is swiping the card at the coffee shop. <br /> <br /> What happens to women who show respect? ? (For example, Smith's character doesn't do anything except to make the doctor degrade in the better part of the movie, but she still "wants". Where is he tension? I will tell you that good looks and not appreciated. <br /> <br /> What happened to the detectives who discovered Smith did nothing but sit around and felt sorry for himself, complained to others and when they Say something that makes him think sparkling This is a very weak way to get stories from the point b-c-d-etc ... It's okay once. But not many times (Say many times in a row, what is "I'm snoring and don't listen to you kidding? Twice In One Scene?) <br /> <br /> What happened to the small parts in the movie is quite meaningful? And not just a tool to promote the rescue scene? Shia LaBeouf (boy) is in two movies. We know that A- He destroyed women and B- He knew Smith ....... So of course we should. Focus on him whether he is harmed or not. <br /> <br /> What happened to the hero? Forget that there are people, women and children being attacked by robots and selfish only. People with my view that I have a close relationship and why he has to ride his bike through the air to show, while the doctor can reach the same distance in seconds with a foot. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me, wrong. I am all a picture. But I am a person who is realistic and meaningful. <br /> <br /> I must say that I never laughed at all. Very difficult for my movie for a long time. Thank you Alex. <br /> <br /> I pray for the pendulum to swing back to a technique that is easier, simpler and easier than everything in the movie ..... But it's a much easier technique. <br /> <br /> The big budget action movie: "You have to die."
