Dark Rising is a fast-paced horror / sci-fi / fantasy movie. It has a strange plot that cannot be explained. There is a large hole that you can put the elephant into. Most of the time I don't know what happened. But it's not important. It's a common thing that demon hunters come back from the dimension of hell to record stories of campers with confusing stories about witches and books of evil. Plotting elements and characters that are not sensible or missing without a reason for not performing well, but actually they can't do anything with this script at all. There are two nude scenes, which is probably the only reason this movie was made. (Like other bad movies) Give this password unless there is nothing in T.V.
