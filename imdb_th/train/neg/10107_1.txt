Last weekend I bought This 'zombie movie' from cheap trash and watch with some friends think it will be a budget version of "Land of the Dead" <br /> <br /> The boy I thought wrong <br /> <br /> Looks like they use the budget of the book cover, which makes the fans of the zombies game very misunderstood. /> <br /> We watched, pointing out that zombies chicks are still alive and into the car, along with some yuppies in the middle of the business talking on mobile phones. They spoke to a man before a girl killed him; But when they started driving, I could no longer hold back my unbelief. <br /> <br /> Some people think that this movie "Very bad. It's good." They are liars. I haven't finished the movie But another review says that they became police officers at the end of the movie, which made me glad that I didn't watch it all the time. <br /> <br /> More than "Zombiez" Don't watch!
