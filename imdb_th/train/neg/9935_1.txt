It fully conquered me why Godard was very serious - and One Plus One was a wonderful example of his stupidity, both as a filmmaker and an intellectual controversy. It is difficult to believe that Godard believes in Marx and Maoism. Anyone who has only half the brain can bankrupt those 'isms', and how many people they destroyed and continue to destroy, even though Godard created his movie. As a filmmaker, ask yourself: Are you boring to read with a boring political voice from your audience and when you can't think of something else, make other voices make the audience disappear? After the first 100 words in all cases? Excellent Jean-Luc! For Godard, confirmed to create a movie with Rolling Stones: Of course he did; You will not. It is the only thing that is guaranteed to receive solid waste at first sight: the genius of the stone that obscures incompetent political idiot and babbling with the camera. The bookstore scene is not worthy of the worst side of the theater and is an insult to the ingenuity of young children who have played in this scene before. Going outside by allowing friendly critics to claim that all the unkind shit is the main word in creating movies, not just going out safely to those who see poverty, intelligence. Surprisingly, Truffaut, a close friend of Godard, only once with Nuit Americain, creating the best movie about filmmaking and Godard doing the worst thing with Le Mepris! Incidentally, Godard didn't choose the path of sympathy with the devil. It happened as the track they were doing when the movie began filming at the Barnes Olympic Studios.
