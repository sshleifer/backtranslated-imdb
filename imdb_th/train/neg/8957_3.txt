Incredible, can it get stupid than this? There is no chance of stupidity in this film, even the infamous Ed Wood, De Palma and Woo. If the first part in the series has moderate conversations and another chapter has an amazingly bad conversation, this time the story is reduced to the level of Conversations as well Despite the performances and conversations, I liked the first two movies, but "Cube Zero" would kill the franchise. The most sharp plot is clearly caused by a left-handed left-handed pen. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder if those left-wingers know that they are against democracy. In this movie, they set goals for the United States. Democracy Why don't they target Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe and others in anti-military movies? Of course, most of these places are hardly able to create a cube like this all the time soon, but that is clear: the garbage writers like this really admire this regime, no matter how they perceive. Or not I will go as far as to say that anyone who insists on attacking US foreign policy all the time has faith against democracy in his core. <br /> <br /> Go back to the movie: In addition to the history That it will not be funny anymore, this movie has a lot of irrationality For example, for some reason, two men who take care of the cube do it for a while and ignore the pain and sadism that the project created. But the first one, more than the other, immediately turned to the system! Everyone who has any idea about human nature will see this foolishness. Or how about the characters that cretinous, one-eyed servant who evil one said as if he were in a bad Mel Brooks comedian. In fact, as soon as this creature appeared, the movie would lose all seriousness And for this reason the opportunity to be excited: it becomes really funny
