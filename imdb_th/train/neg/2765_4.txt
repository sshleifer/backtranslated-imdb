This film was created with a budget that should be $ 70 million and without being completely modified beyond me. The story and dialogue are beyond expertise. The characters say things that no real person would say and almost never respond to what they had said before. It seems that no one will land in the real world. The leader's performance is good because the writing is disgusting ... but many actors in supporting the role really drag the production down. The hero's hair should have received his own credit. It's very interesting - catchy ... Don't mention that it's one of the better performances. Finally, for the movie about L, which is surrounded by giant reptiles, this movie is horribly boring. Shame! If you see this, your heart will always be racing. Think of ways you can shoot SFX scenes and make better movies. Sadly, it doesn't use much.
