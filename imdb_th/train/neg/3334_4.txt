This scared me when I was a teenager. Now I find it more amusing than scary. But with a rather unstable time and unbelievable quality like I liked And try to think that the story is really disgusting ... but there are some flavors If there is a problem with this film, there is a big gap that is nothing exciting or interesting. In addition, the ending remains forever, causing the tense climax to look silly for a while, with Barbara Bach crying and screaming. "Monster" after being found, it is not scary. The dull look of the movie is applicable to it, making it look more like a television movie than what was created for the cinema. But it is an example of a movie that is not created today, so I want the horror fans to see and feel nostalgic ...
