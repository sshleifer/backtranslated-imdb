For me, it is an unreliable and unbelievable robbery movie with A-List actors, especially the three leading actors and experienced directors like Spike Lee. I expect more and eventually feel what Delivered to subcategories of this film For the beginning, I didn't like the pacing of the movie, beginning with the part of Clive Owen's mastermind raison d'etre, which was repeatedly filmed with unnecessary camera at the end. Then found himself jumping into the scene that you felt had already begun Of course, the operation of the camera is constantly flowing while traveling and incorporating a lot of mobile cameras together. But the director Lee failed to deliver the excitement or paranoia by failing to do important things in the movie. Denzel Washington weighed down on the clothes and badly spoken of the movie "Shaft" thirty-five years ago. (He has even said "No one understands him. But his woman "is going on with his" hot ", her girlfriend seduced her in a rude and inappropriate way" dirty - talk ") and tenderness "In the Heat of the Night" riff with Willem Defoe (Almost as a part - a little bit) raised. Clive Owens plays his character with a strong English accent, even though we believe that the gang is an Arab. But had to prevent 90% of the film from using his face mask Jodie Foster delivers her patented ice girl, Claris Starling, turns into a linked bounty hunter if you want. Overall, it is the true mistake of the movie with distorted light. But clearly at the end, in fact, the title made it far from the beginning. The spoiler fans, the worst scene (from many people), is without a doubt an interview with Washington. Convincing with street children aged 8 years, although Owen's conversation with the same child a few minutes earlier During the movie reference, the joke was created by characters in classic movies such as "Serpico" and "Dog Day Afternoon" - but without the honor of self-praise like "The Hot Rock" instead ... and even it. Good for a few laughs
