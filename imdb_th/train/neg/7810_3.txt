Against All Hope is a movie that is not very good, sometimes very painful. This is Michael Madsen's first movie, and it shows that he's not that good. Some people may find that the story is ridiculous. Alcoholics realize that his life and family are falling, so he called the preacher as a last resort for help. After telling the story of the preacher, he accepted that Jesus Christ came into his heart. <br /> <br /> I met many religious scenes, such as when Cecil Moe (Madsen) went to church. But went out of here, it was very realistic I like Cecil knowing that his life is broken and trying to get help. But realize that only God can help him At the end, he realized that with God's help he could live without having to drink again. <br /> <br /> This film was not created well. The performance is not good, the script can be used for something and looks worse than my home video. But with good messages Now, just because you become a Christian does not mean that you will be able to automatically stop being addicted to drugs or treat your broken family, and Cecil is aware of this and works hard to follow. Overall, if you are a Christian, you will be impressed with the film being a Christian, and if you are not, you may find yourself being called to find out more about faith.
