"These Kids Like" may be a good movie from the topic But it turned out to be a television movie that was screened below the weekly average, which didn't happen much The show is old and predictable and without direction. For better movies on the same subject, try "Le Huiti√®me Jour", a great movie that focuses on people with Down syndrome in "Kids Like These". They use it as an excuse to express sympathy only. Very scary 1/10
