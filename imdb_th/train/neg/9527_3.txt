I tried to follow this movie using a bad phrase about "a teen tempted and killed a man in his house." Where it is running through the cable It was very impressive! It's a kind of movie that kids know that they shouldn't watch and change channels when their parents come in. When I see who is an actor, I can't believe that. They were killed. This is an interesting movie. In addition, if I remember that there were some very interesting moments in a deceitful lesbian. May be the most dumb ending, but still ... memorable.
