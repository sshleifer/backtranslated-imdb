"Diary of Sex Addict" is a pitiful attempt at serious drama about sexual compulsion. This may be a marketing scam. This flick is a stylish style with good actors and others. The bottom line "Diary ..." will make us believe that our sexiest characters have the most stupid wife in The baby world is stable on the side which has nothing to do better than letting him pants when he wants. No job, even though it's a restaurant At best, this flick may be a good drama. The worst, cheap softcore "Diary ..." is not the same and there is no place in it. This one is for the trash (D-)
