The first movie Cube is an art movie. It sets the world with all the important prototypes of humans as agents and shows that they struggle to understand the hostile world they don't understand. It is at a level that is not a character. "A man with a cruel nature" plot that a person representing innocence and goodness comes through in the end, succeeding to face a new world, determined not beyond the human squabbles; A world without a fight, but peace. I give Cube 10 out of 10 points and it's a movie that has never before had any sequels. <br /> <br /> The second movie, Hypercube, is very disappointing. Some ideas are cool. But in the context of traditional movies, both the story and the scenes are not reasonable and meaningless. Still, for being fairly entertained, I was ranked 5th out of 10. <br /> <br /> The third film, Cube Zero, while ignoring the second story, played as a B movie. -movie, the commercial that is worse than the first sans symbol, there is no "homage" or "tribute" here; Only ripping out The same type of plot with some elements changed silently. (For example, there is a letter instead of a specific number between the cube - the idea that is clearly displayed than anything else here is something that is torn without initiative and nothing to say) br /> <br /> We see some The thing from "behind the scenes" does not mean anything because viewers are part of the Big Bad Experiment, an architect that we do not hear. And in this movie, those who passed to the exit (Like Kazan doing the ending of the first movie) Just been killed - that * bleep * has that meaning?! That is just folly. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this thing. <br /> <br /> The production value and performance in Cube Zero is not bad. But the stories and ideas do not have any inspiration whatsoever. The film received only 3 out of 10 points from me.
