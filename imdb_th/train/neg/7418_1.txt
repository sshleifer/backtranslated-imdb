Oh God is a scary and scary movie. Means to express opinions about the state of society, it is just a reflection of the worst of reality in reality television Interstitial ads prepared by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most nasty parts written in a tone that is meant to be reflective and profound. Rather, these moments are numbing thoughts as they talk to the camera with conversations written by people who are fond of insulting words that push the "meaning" of this movie to the neck Issues that filmmakers want: scenes that take a long time and quiet scenes, unlike art. Do not make extreme angles or logic to the point of being ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If anyone interested in watching this movie, please do not do that. Seriously. Please. You have better things to do.
