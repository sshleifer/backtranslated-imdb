This self proclaimed that "Very talented artist" easily directed the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of feeling, connection, rhythm, skill, humor ... It repeats the same situation over and over again. It does not show character development. It does not show violence and / or sexual content and will not add anything new to the psychotic killer subcategory. Then should be screened at the movie school as an example of "Things that shouldn't be done" in the first movie. <br /> <br /> BTW, where hell is "talent"? There are scenes shot almost the same. There are scenes with two or more original images, and it is quite scary to see the movement jumping from one prototype image to another without reason The camera almost never moved as though "A very talented artist" is afraid to show that he lacks visual skills. Actors who play the main role act like an amateur and an actor who supports almost unbelievable. There are more channels in the story (if available) ... <br /> <br /> Horrible movies and talented directors.
