Synopsis: When his wife, a journalist, was kidnapped and replaced by a pair of robots, Eric Phillips, the secret agent, tracked her down and revealed plans by the arms dealer to create an invincible robot army for Kill the world leader. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much when I saw the sequel of Pepi-Sci-Fi / Action on "Cyber ​​Tracker". That movie had nothing special. Talking about The "The Terminator" & "RoboCop" the sequel to the film is the same as before, with the action of the full release. There are many explosions, huge cannons and bodies, including some martial arts, courtesy of the stars of the movie Don. "The Dragon" Wilson looks like the whole movie is an action-packed scene with the smallest scene. Wilson is a bad actor. He wants a true personality transplant.
