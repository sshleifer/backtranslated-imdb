Note for horror fans: The only thing here is horror when you know that you only take 95 minutes to watch a movie that is worthless. <br /> <br /> <br /> I watch it because <br /> <br /> The place sounds a little promising: No, it's just an excuse to use the same set of pieces from other low-cost slasher movies as well. <br /> <br /> The promise of the wood nymphs. Sounds good, although this movie looks amazing. Lois: It's not like that. Amateur movies make sure that "Falling Angel" is sexy like a typical homeless. <br /> <br /> Tom Savini's name has a long history in horror genres: He is the king of budget effects. Low And low budgeting. Think of it. Savini is probably the reason not to watch this movie. Not that he is not good But he is often in bad movies His only good role was from Dusk Till Dawn and he had milked with a terrible meeting since then. <br /> <br /> But pay attention to the positive story: Forest of the Damned as an example. The good way of not making movies. <br /> <br /> Everything is negative. Obviously, the author lost the creation. The script is terrible. That's all received after the first 10 minutes, but the clueless pacing; The way the director treats "plot" and "character" is annoying. He thinks no one is interested. And driving, walking and the natural sequence that is exciting and amazing (There is no doubt that it will increase the work time for the film to qualify for distribution), showing the lack of film and storytelling in general. <br /> <br /> This is another example. Well, one of the ways you can tell that this movie is not good: if it's written and directed by the same person, expect the garbage.
