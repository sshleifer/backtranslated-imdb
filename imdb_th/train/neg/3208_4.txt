This movie is very disappointing for me. I've been waiting for this movie for many years and I am a faithful disciple of Chaos Comics until they are bankrupt. They not only But cut half the story away But they changed the information The statement that Lucifer is the father of Hope is not true. He damaged her father. But he himself is not her father The sound is not suitable for the character, and when you hear the voice of the beloved character, the sound you hear in your heart cannot be restored I can't remember everything about this movie. It's wrong. The most important thing is if you love Lady Death. Don't watch this movie. It doesn't make jokes at all!
