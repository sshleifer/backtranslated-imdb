This movie is really bad. That performance is the worst! It's worse than student movies. It's wonderful and I think the worst actors are old women. At first I thought to myself that it was an old movie. I remember that was not an excuse! I used to watch old movies that had better performances and so <br /> <br /> The music was very scary. (Most conversations don't sync.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie doesn't deserve. 1 I watched it just because I was bored and the movie didn't entertain me. It's ridiculous. My dead grandmother's left toe can create a better movie.
