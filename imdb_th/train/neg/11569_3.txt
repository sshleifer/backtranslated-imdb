Even if you subscribe to the anti-free trade of this film But it is also a tedious note that has been played over and over again Clink, clink, clink Even if you can get a preacher with peroxide hair that supports the return to the first principle, Reverend Billy is quite difficult to see as a serious person. A funny person is a type that wakes up every morning without ambition, without identity, rather than watching his face on the TV before he climbs back to sleep on the bed that night.
