"Virgin 40 years old" exists in a world that I do not understand. The world in which an electronics store employee can tell his boss to "f *** off" and broadcast his naked ass videos throughout the store and not be blamed A very funny world that is drunk and driven into other people's cars. A world that seems okay for the boss to harass her followers. A world full of madness and discontent among minorities And a world without jokes! I was really shocked by the audience's choir who liked this movie. I think every scene is like a bad sketch of Saturday Night Live - it's not a joke to start and expand beyond rational thinking. The waxing scene continues forever. <br /> <br /> The characters other than Karel are all single notes. And the romantic elements were completely designed, especially the scene in which Kinner found pornography in Carell's apartment that was lame And totally too much I hate hating this movie!
