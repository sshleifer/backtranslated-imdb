I will admit that I only watched a few episodes. But each person looks completely different from the next episode. It seems that after the first season, the producers decided to adapt the show, place the characters, introduce new shows and write a whole new dynamic Which did not move with her high-ranking sister Valerie in New York City The place is good: odd couple + fish from the water + bad luck <br /> <br /> While I miss the sitcoms of the past, this performance is a pity to miss the funny jokes repeatedly and it's sad. Because they have the right talent. <br /> <br /> Above all, they insist on changing the performance. (Val is with one of the regular actors of the season, then he suddenly disappears, so what is her bakery?) When things change, you get the feeling that even the program * knows it's not good. I mean, a complete new set, cut-out characters and new items regularly! <br /> <br /> In the side note (This is just nitpicking) I know this is a TV show and not all real, but Val and Holly end up living in a large loft duplex (with stairs) with a balcony ... in MANHATTAN! Are you serious ?!
