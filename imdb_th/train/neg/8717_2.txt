This is one of the worst movies I ever received from watching. <br /> <br /> I watched it on DVD with many friends on Friday night and we couldn't stop laughing at the beginning. <Br /> <br /> The story is simple enough: terrorists hijack the procession they think of carrying weapons-grade uranium. But actually it has a lot of dinosaurs to eat. It's easy to mistake. The shocking incompetent team of the special forces corps to deal with prehistoric animals. They were led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; People who seem to have a perfect performance, 'Smell the the Fart', which is supported by Joey in Friends. <br /> <br /> There are lots and lots of shooting. Unfortunately, Rance's team seems to have trouble aiming. Their weapons go in the general direction of a giant monster. In addition, the fire always shakes and goes out every time the Velociraptor attacks (presumably so we cannot see that the creatures that have bad effects) <br /> <br /> Say all That we all have Of fun to bet on who will be bitten by the next bite. <br /> <br /> As Jusassic Park / Aliens, an action-adventure style action, this movie smells worse than the dinosaur target. But ridiculous Entertainment. It's a roaring success.
