When I heard the plot of this movie, I just saw it. I mean, the whole city was washed with killer tomatoes! Sadly, the name is as funny as possible. <br /> <br /> Lead by Detective Dick Mason, special military and scientific teams (including Greg Colburn who never took off the SCUBA and Lt. Finletter series that never Have before The image without a parachute dragging in the back) 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes' is a parody of the B movie, especially the Japanese horror movie in 1950. The movie begins with a standard sized tomato that was discovered by a laundry woman in the kitchen. Before you find yourself at the scene because the tomatoes kill this woman and let me tell you that it's not healthy When the movie continues! For fairness, there are a few funny moments. For example, whenever Japanese scientists, Dr. Nocio said his voice was dubbed with an American accent or when an expert disguised Sam Smith penetrated the tomato. This movie would be more fun in 1978 with all good ideas. Unfortunately, the movie 'Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes' poses like 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' has been released and has made a lot of jokes like this since then. <br /> <br /> Performances That is cruel; There is no continuity in editing and just feel slow and lack energy. For a parody movie that needs to be used, you must have many things going on together. Singing in the movie seems useless and the ads for furniture stores that are screened through the screen are strange even in this film. However, in the end, you can see why this movie is a cult. I can't see many people who don't care about it. Unfortunately it is the way I will summarize this.
