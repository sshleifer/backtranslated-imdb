### Spoiler! ### <br /> What is the movie proposal? Control the editing and movies that do not match the bad plans. It's a sad story to see Denzel Washington's ability to waste in a trash like this. We have been clearly hinted that Mexicans can't help themselves. And we know that Father is a shady character. He is a Mexican, unlike his wife who admires Creasey more because he is an American. He kills them all, thinks that she is dead The exchange scene is the only thing that makes me unable to score lower. "Unbelievable success" (as some critics point out) 'Take' nausea of ​​the movie takes a long time. It is in the ratings of such movies that we have to doubt the reliability of IMDb 7 for such movies and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho to think! I will be in the range of 3.5-4.0.
