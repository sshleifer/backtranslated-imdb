When Ritchie entered the film industry for the first time, his films were praised as funny, well-directed and original comedy. If anyone can compare the ads he created with his first two attempts and the almost universal contempt he had created, then should consider - Ritchie has been discovered? Is he really good? Does he have any original ideas? Or is he just a pretentious director and a man who has a habit of thinking like being a Fincher, Tarantino and Raleone all being a huge and disorganized pile? After watching Revolver, did anyone think it was wrong? What happened to his great humor? Where did he get these diverse and complex ideas? The pistol tried to be clever and succinct. It tried to be a wise psychoanalyst. It tried to shake the complex and complex. Ritchie strives to achieve many of these objectives and invest good scripts into existing songs and tweak the plot. However, in the end, what it serves is to create a film that is severely separated, unstructured and unfriendly to the audience. Mimicking it is sinful and blatant. At least Ritchie tries the least to spin his own wheel. He should be punished even when trying to pass on his own work. So what the audience will eventually receive is a scary movie script involving many emulators and clumsy scenes. <br /> <br /> Revolver is an extraordinary and innocent movie. Fiction It has a high aim. But the shooting that there are many gaps inevitably that Revolver deserves to bear, blaming it as a truly poor movie disguised as a wannabe inventor's masterpiece. However, it fell on the face of a hasty and failed everything that it needed and achieved.
