What is needed for the creation of this film is complete ignorance about the work and personality of Nietzsche, psychoanalytic and historical analysis techniques of Vienna. Use a famous genius that you haven't read yet. Explain that he is a madman, including a mad doctor who will treat him. A good-looking woman has his role in acting by an actor with a huge mustache. Every drama speaks the strongest. The accent represents a ridiculous dream, including another famous person who has no connection with the first person (Freud). Speaks of a few words that are used in the genius work until everything you can do, especially music And you're done The audience please stay away.
