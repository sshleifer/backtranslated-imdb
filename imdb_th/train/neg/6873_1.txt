Television program production in the early 2000s is between weaknesses and weaknesses. Before being marked, such as (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives or Monk), the TV didn't have the correct attack which was able to attract the attention and interest of the audience. In the 2000s, titles such as (Relic Hunter) , (Mutant X), (The Lost World), (Sheena) or even Baywatch Hawaii doesn't encourage you to watch and follow, or at least not all interesting and interesting. Time is something that preceded them (Special Unit 2). There are no exceptions. In fact, Men in Black met the scams of The X Files! (As if this is a special unit 1) but still, according to this wonderful formula It doesn't work well. It's a contract. At that time there was saturation of the case. "Supernatural" After a decade of X files, so much of Lamphun's natural spirit is also worthless (imagine Mulder being a flirt!) However, (Special Unit 2) is not the strongest in This story or a strong person in the creation of Sci-Fi comics is extremely ridiculous. For example, every situation that is sexy must become disgusting. the It is unhappy about the taste that is not good. (Michael Landes) is not a charming and unbearable person as a comedian. His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee) as well as the sexual interest that should be all languid Of course, acting is funny. But overall it is an unsightly job Obviously there is nothing more interesting than the main idea. Among other works of (Evan Katz) as co-writers and producers such as (seven days) before or (24) later, this thing must be a low point! Despite having a distinctive personality But it is the most stupid joke So if that is the goal, so they make the most stupid person! And actually it will be one of the most difficult times to thank for canceling the show after its 19 episodes!
