(Spoiler) <br /> <br /> I was very curious when I saw that this movie was smart and witty. I have to stop halfway because of the boredom that I can't tolerate. <br /> <br /> The idea behind this film is acceptable: showing the relationship between man and woman, evolving through every problem and opinion. difficult Where two people living in large cities can experience What makes me not like the whole movie, there are two things. <br /> <br /> First, this movie is a very strange story that looks as though explaining the problems that couples have to solve one day. It became common and boring every day. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the total negligence of production, along with the difficult conversation. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
