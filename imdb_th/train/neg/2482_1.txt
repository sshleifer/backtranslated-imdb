(Many spoilers) This is a very scary movie. First of all, it has you from the media. I guess he made a career out of playing the ultimate father. It's okay, the first time he tried to make his son afraid of being a monster. But after 10 minutes, they did it again. And it is like this movie is moving in real time At one point, I started shooting for a few days later until I was warned that the next day only ... in the afternoon! I'm not really sure who this couple should be in real life. First of all, they are presented as a pair of Manhattan couples who grew up and have children. But they drive the old blue Volvo Those types stopped driving Volvos decades ago. Today they drive the prize, but in 2002 I'm sure they haven't driven Volvos. <br /> <br /> Ok, then there is Wendigo, "the mysterious Indian man" giving Wendigo the statue to the child. Little magic and telling him of powerful magic. C'mon ... We still make mysterious mysteries of ancient India. Just driving home, they crossed all the Indian statues in the northern tourist trap of New York City. The American Indian plays in a manner that has not been seen for decades in this movie! Oh and about Wendego He is not the cause of horror. He didn't kill the father of the boy, which is the most terrible thing in this movie ... He was just killed by a ruthless villain and a powerful rifle. Oh, but hey, it seems that before this, Wendigo would be angry at his father because he killed a deer ... so Wendigo had to be happy that his father was killed ... but ... <br /> <br /> and It goes ... insulting, boring and ridiculous. There is no reason to watch this movie.
