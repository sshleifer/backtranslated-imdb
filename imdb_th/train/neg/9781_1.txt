I don't think I'm too far to say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I work on a list of my favorite war movies: "The Longest Day," "To Hell and Back," "Bridge on the River Kwai," (all black and white) with good plans, various characters, performances at Well, I've seen better conversations and performances in high school where students are the authors of one play. PTSD, however, is not a bad assumption - badly implemented. It's like a traffic accident. But I can't close it! The movie does not require a lot of money or large sets such as "Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifeboat" ... so the budget doesn't have excuses. What are they thinking
