The only thing that appeared in my head often when I wrote this review was that I would not have received that second half !!! To indicate that I am not just blowing the wind, I will compare movies and other films of the TriCube. (Cube and Hyper Cube)! The cube is not excellent. But it's original and it's built for technical flaws! Is a sequel that loses its creative advantage But it came out looking good and I liked it more than a cube. (Better story)! But the center cube compared to the previous model does not have sh * t! The lack of a good fx script, complete script f * ck * d and old bad performances are not compatible! Example: All the time in the movie, I think it will be incredibly stupid. If ... should happen then it will happen, so it's not the original! My advice: Don't waste that time half an hour. I'm lost !!!!!!!! Oh and I hope this movie will fail and burn !!!!!!!
