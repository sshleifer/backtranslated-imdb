This is a really scary movie and takes 2 hours of your life. It is gentle and nasty, with many nudity and violence. However, the nudity is not exciting and the violence is repetitive and boring. The most delicate story, the character is unrealistic and not developed, and the performance is the worst thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I heard that this movie should be a joke But it's not. I didn't laugh once while watching and I didn't smile as well. The creator of this film tries to incorporate funny movies into action movies and both of them fail. <br /> <br /> Some badly created movies are funny because it's terrible. But this is not one of them
