Less ripping characters You've seen all the characters in other movies. I promise. The script tries to be frustrated and nasty. But failed miserably It throws in some hangover. Meet a great comedian. But the joke went out of the field on the left, completely forced The hot chick is old and doesn't have a personality. She's just a thirty-old blonde chick with a few smart asses that aren't funny. The attraction between Molly (hot chick) and Kirk (interesting love) is almost no communication. Attractive things that do not find a completely peaceful relationship until they are embarrassed and predictable seat belts Doing this, they are in a full and incredibly lame relationship. The main focus of this movie is not about relationships. But is a failed attempt to create a bad movie that has an attractive storyline I can compare this to a hangover in a forced manner. I won't go in there I can go on But it's pointless Don't just pay to watch this movie.
