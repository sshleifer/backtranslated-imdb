Although this is not "Great movie" has something that is interesting and memorable about it. Like other reviewers in the movie, I saw this in my childhood. For thirty years since 1952, but I have never forgotten about this or the name that is ridiculously difficult. See if you have a chance You will feel like a voyeur of life in a small town that has evolved for decades. More than other movies, this movie leads people to the historical story of "Progress" in the early twentieth century It is attractive enough for young and memorable audiences enough for older people. In addition, it's easy to like characters and see the time passed.
