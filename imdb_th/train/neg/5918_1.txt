Carl Panzram lived an amazing life and wrote his memoirs on paper to be the only person who had done unselfish things for him. The book "Panzram: A Journal of Murder" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O Long, which came out more than a century after Panzram's death, made the historical context a story of the first generation of Americans who fled home. To go west and be a cowboy, thrown into the boy's house, repeatedly escaped and thrown into prison over and over again, all the time being tortured and sodomized. When Panzram grew up and strengthened, he tried to avenge the wrongs he had done. With him while traveling to South America, South America, Europe and Africa and does not matter whether he raped, robbed or killed people because we have no equal value. <br /> <br /> The film is handsome James James Wood. Is a rough grateful man who is the son of Karl Panzram, who is bad in this movie is "drunk", amazing and aroused with the joy of sodomizing men and women. This film does not describe anything in particular. About world tourism and professional prisoners (Such as robbing former President Taft or being released from Oregon prison as long as he still can't speak) in the short term I don't think Carl will be too happy
