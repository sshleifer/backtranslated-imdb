I am very disappointed. The man <br /> <br /> 1) Adam Archin is a gangster rather than Ross Geller from 'Friends' <br /> <br /> 2) Actors (Kenneth Marcus Alan, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) With this expert script, <br /> <br /> 3) The film suffers from walking. Went to walk that scary It jumped in a confused and confusing manner. <br /> <br /> 4) The story is not reasonable. Why would he want to break the football line? Stupid violin song? No explanation. <br /> <br /> 5) It's not funny. It's like many accountants trying to do improv by saying "See me! Look, I'm funny! "This is a bad attempt to create" Love At First Bite "again. <br /> <br /> I like the movie Larry Cohen, but the guy he failed here. I can't wait for the credit to spin. Very disappointed
