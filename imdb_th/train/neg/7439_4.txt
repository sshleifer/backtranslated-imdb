See the difference that horror The style differences between American and Russian movies are interesting. However, from my American perspective, this movie wasn't that good. Donna Marie's character, played by Anastasia Hill, is not an admirable character, and I have difficulty with her. She is not satisfied with most of the time and is confused about the remaining time. It also takes too much time to bring her to the main location of the movie. Then for a long time before the real doubts were created When it happens, it seems that the amount is used as the main effect, which is more annoying than anything else. This concept is more exotic than movies. Direct-to-video Most of them and they do not use sex in creating a storyline. In conclusion, I would recommend renting. But not for the drama audience
