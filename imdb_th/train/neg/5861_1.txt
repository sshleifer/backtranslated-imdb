I saw this movie when it first came out in 1978 when I was a second year student in high school. I took the day to watch. I didn't "get". No need to say because this movie is terrible! Joan Rivers's career has never been as bad as he should after doing this terrifying and scary nonsense. In fact, unfunny is not a strong word: this movie is ANTI-FUNNY! You walked away with a feeling of laughter that might have been beaten by you before it happened. This is not worth it to be aware of any curiosity or feelings of it. "So bad." Even the gang that MST3K can't make worth watching! The fact that Billy Crystal's career survived the first suicide attempt was a miracle.
