I have a 5 minute rule (sometimes I will leave here for as long as 10). If the movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes, it may not be better than this. I have not yet been exposed to a movie that has proven to compete with this theory. Dan in real life is no exception. I watched this turkey and thought; Wow, it's not funny, don't touch, not sad, and I don't like the characters. <br /> <br /> The story of the columnist, advice / widower, the three daughters who fall in Love with his brothers and sisters I think the slogan will be "Recommended columnists who can use advice"? I do not know the character in a way that has never been lost. I am a qualified person to give advice. I guess that is irony? I don't know. He meets parents, siblings, sisters and their children in the escape of a family that seems normal, which looks very cute and is a potential animal food for good jokes. Story ... Nobody ever Appear before The main story is that he loves this woman but without her. Anyone who has a pulse knows that he will eventually receive her. But you have to suffer through the dialogue of the movie network throughout life. "The murderer of love" is repeatedly painful to go to an end that is inevitable happiness. Is one of the worst movies I've ever seen
