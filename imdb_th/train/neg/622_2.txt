This movie is very exciting. The main character seems to be 35 years old and I've seen young peas that have more balls than this guy. The distorted plot is predictable, so it's not worth it to look for humor. <br /> <br /> In addition, the worst conversation I have heard in 3 years is br /> <br /> Huh ..... I can't continue to look at these garbage dumps. It was created in 8 days. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is important is Maui. Friends call the main character fagot for drawing. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, can't be caught.
