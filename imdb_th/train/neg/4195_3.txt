Considering the people involved, it's hard to see why this movie is sloppy and boring. David Ward, the author of the dramatic thrilling movie "The Sting", two years later, Jane Fonda has just won an Academy Award for Clute and Donald Sutherland. Visited in movies such as "Klute" "Start the Revolution I" and "Kelly's Heroes" Plotwise. This movie is a story that jumped with a small gang of mistakes, planning a big robbery. At the same time, this film would like to be a hip-hop song, a type of comedy sketches on the NBC TV show "Saturday Night", which will perform well in the next two years. The bad result is a plot that makes the comedy bits look awkward and forced, and the bits of the disconnected comedies destroy any suspicion that they can steal. The character itself is different, like the car in the car in the scene that has been destroyed. <br /> <br /> The only thing I care about is Jane Fonda. "Iris Ken" should be her version. Softly of the drama Bree Daniel in Each Cor's "Klute" but no one believes her laundry room. Jane Fonda pretended to be a prostitute that we always watched. It was a very bad performance as her performance in "Klute" was great. It will be a good lesson for actors to perform two films together to show that the same actor in the same role is excellent or pathetic. It shows that the actors are as good as writers and directors.
