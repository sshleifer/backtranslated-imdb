This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only But lacking the ability to perform only But the script is also incredibly shallow You hear a serious conversation that "I love you more" "No, I love you more." I stopped watching movies (online). After the first half hour I couldn't get it again. "South charming girl", her work is not really annoying. Her efforts on the subject were slumped and she sent the script as if she were reading the script outside of the page. <br /> <br /> Poor Luke Wilson. This or he fell in love with Papa Joe's father (Jessica's father and filmmaker) promised to give a big profit? Hopefully he will now know better than to sign a contract with another movie like this. Luke Wilson is a really good actor - I hate seeing the painful face when he suffers from a bad conversation. <br /> <br /> Also, I think the previous reviewer gave This film from 8, whether related to the movie or hired by Papa Joe to give better ratings No one in their right mind will find this movie to be involved. <br /> <br /> Jessica has a lot of money, right? May buy some acting lessons
