First of all, the plot of this story is an exaggerated way - women want to make it. Everybody loves her. The girl snobby intervenes. All the lost look. The girl pulls through everyone, loves her again, etc. The heroine includes the parent problem Singles and can predict that you can go along with it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I hate that they continue to perform classical music. They sent messages that everyone involved in classical music was shocked and stupid and intimate - in fact, I couldn't remember the words. But I remember at one point in the movie, Holly said it would scare ... classic? "It is an insult that this kind of classical music will be wrong. <br /> <br /> Third, I have gone dozens of times. But the only reason I think to create this movie is It doesn't have any issues. <br /> <br /> And yes, while the actors who show Holly (I'm not sure if she sings or not). Sounds good enough. Not surprisingly, as they made it out - especially when she was belting She takes care all the time. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars
