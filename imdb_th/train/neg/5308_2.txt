Nothing can prepare you for a flea bimbo outing! This time it was brought to you by Fred Olen Ray who never avoided! As far as this exploit movie doesn't click! As a science fiction, it's original! What we saw was an ugly female robot wearing a bikini to destroy the world and showing that those things were almost naked to resist! Please stop before !!! If this kind of entertainment is yours, why not dust the old SI swimsuit from the attic to change it ?! This would be a lot better if it didn't set a very scary factor. But still does not make it better I want to point out another film called THE ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Wynorski, which is similar to the identity of the ALIENATOR. It shows why the number one action movie "femme fatale" is no longer translated. Good in America. Sorry, friends!
