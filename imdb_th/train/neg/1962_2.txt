The only scary thing about this movie is the idea that anyone who created it might be a sequel. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, "The Tooth Fairy" is quite bad. It seems that the movies of children with bad behavior are also confused. "The Wizard of Oz" The witch melts and the happy kitten ends with a wound and swearing effect. <br /> <br /> Half of the actors seem to be unnecessary. Except being there comfortably to be killed in some form The two brothers and sisters are Cherise the aura reader and Mrs. McDonald has no point in this movie - they may include them in the main plot for interesting stories. But doesn't seem to care People who watch movies know that the characters are there for the bloody death scene. But come at least try and have a little planning for them The story is generally weak with unpredictable behavior from characters that make you want them to eat witches. <br /> <br /> Add weak outline and weak performances together. The movie ends with all the failures. If there is only MST3K going to go here ...
