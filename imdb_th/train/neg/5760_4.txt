Hmm ... I will wait until this video will come out to see and I hope I can. I actually catch 2 horror movies on the cable the other day and it makes me yearning for the same thing that I am. Get is the plane on CRACK ... I mean, if you like planes or other vehicles of Leslie Nielsen, then you may be in heaven. But if you are used to WAYANS, you will be very disappointed. This time in the eye candy, which will make the young teenager hormones raging happy, which may be the reason why it was the box office hit the first week it came out. I enjoy movies that are 2 times more scary from this animal feed and another part is 5 times weird. Better than the 3rd is the second part, but then again I like the Halloween 2 better. The funniest part of the movie must be the way Aliens Say Goodbye, but that's not worth the 11 dollars that I use to pair this with my fiance. Save money yourself and catch the second part again on the cable until it is released on the video tape. Then rent. Don't buy it.
