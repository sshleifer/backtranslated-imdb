This show seems to be good. Kyra Sedgwick is an actor. Okay and I like the police series. But there is something wrong in producing this program. <br /> <br /> First of all, the author should have more than one suspect. That makes it boring The main characters are incredibly annoying and unbelievable. In any way, I know that they want her to be strong. But she means stupid and bad boss The crime is uninteresting and polite and it is weak all the way. As stated above, I hate it .... <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a big disappointment and really bad ...
