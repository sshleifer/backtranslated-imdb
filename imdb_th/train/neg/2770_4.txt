Hollywood Hotel is the last film that Busby Berkeley directed for Warner Bros.. His directorial style has changed or developed to the point that the film does not have his unique overhead image. In the last few years, the big band Swing has recorded the most popular songs of this year. The Swing Era, also known as the Big Band era, has been a variety of dates from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949, although it is impossible to identify the time when the swing era began The end of the summer of 1935 was one of the first indications that swinged into the consciousness of America's main youth. When Goodman presented his dance music instead of the social dance music that his band had played That is the beginning But because of radio, live performances and word of mouth are the main ways that exist in spreading phenomena, it takes a moment before swinging to do enough penetration before it creates a lot of popularity that appears on pop charts in Hollywood Hotel The presence of Benny Goodman and His Orchestra and Raymond Paige and His Orchestra in the film indicate that the film industry is ready to take advantage of changing musical tastes. (This film has only been produced for a year and a half After the participation of the Palomar Ballroom) there are a few interesting musical moments here and there in the Hollywood Hotel, but except for Benny Goodman and "Sing, Sing, Sing" of his orchestra there is not much to praise Otherwise, the most interesting musical sequence is the parade "Hooray for Hollywood" and "Let That Be a Lesson to You" at the drive restaurant. This film is the most interesting to see and listen to the songs of Benny Goodman and His Orchestra and Dick Powell and Frances Langford sing.
