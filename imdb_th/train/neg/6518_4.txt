This movie is quite funny and involves about four days. Then it becomes a blatant advertisement for some men that you (and even his "friends") can't really stand. It's an interesting concept. Date of the movie in the quest to find true love in modern LA. The problem is that it feels incredibly (and badly) sometimes scripted and blatantly self-promoting. It is difficult to pay attention and be drawn into any character because the writer / actor is a person who has rude habits, not talking, not true, not true and unique. You feel sorry about his date.
