I saw at 22:00 the show and had to say that this movie was nothing special. Even though I didn't leave the theater wanting my time back (Because I don't pay for movies anymore) I didn't really find the reward redemption feature. <br /> <br /> There are a few lines and so makes I laughed softly, but most of this movie seemed to contain rampant fan service for the younger. (In my heart, more than the age of this film was rated R) The male audience, the service of the fans, seemed unbelievable and annoying as well. I know you all want to hear Samuel L. talking about his shameful streak. But honestly, it is a lot of hype for paying very little. The only truly scary part of this film is the CG, which looks digital and doesn't match the live performance on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now I'm a rational person. That I will not see "Casablanca" and at least I have to thank that this film is a traditional idea (albiet inane) and not a creation or franchise However, if you are not part of a cult following you should be better to spend your money elsewhere and watch movies either in the second movie theater in a few weeks or rent in a few months.
