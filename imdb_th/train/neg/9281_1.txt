There is only an anti-God group that can withstand such a disaster. There is only one hope that this irony is the motivation behind the "movie"! This movie is terrible. I forced me to register with IMDb. Finally, I can leave it. What makes this movie more sad is that it has such great content! I have never seen a movie in which all elements are moderately uncommon to get results that are less than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> It may not seem important. But I want to start with the score. As a proud music owner, I have to register my indignation! I was torn between laughter and hoarse voice while I listened to what John Scheffer did with the goldsmith's excellent score. It was more frightening than the comedic and almost unintentional death scene. It's the most inappropriate score I've ever heard since then. I can't think of a worse thing. Could it be JAWS 4? <br /> <br /> For the point ... I'm sorry, a new age of magic? ?? What happened to the true realism of the original trilogy? In those movies (More than two-thirds first, but still !! Here we have black crystals (called Skeksis and all Mystics !!) and many inverted crosses, although in some scenes the cross will be completely normal. But for the camera angle Lost is a delicate mental manipulation, touching the discomfort that exists in our minds as a whole: in places it "slap in the face" boorish of the clich√©, recycling and transparency inability. Add to that the actors "actors", so it's unbelievable that you will thank the director enthusiastically for those scenes that you are not. I have never seen this annoying little girl before since Stephanie died in the family. <br /> <br /> Besides that, I don't have a strong feeling in the story ;-) Good luck in the movie. The first three stories are fluent. In order to make the train wreckage caused by celluloid malformation, it is wasted or, most importantly, education that will not make the movie. Watch out! May cause vomiting if you are lucky
