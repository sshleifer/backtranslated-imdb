{Start ranting} I don't want to believe them at first. But I guess this is what people are talking about when they say that South Korean cinemas have high peaks and may fall. After a surprisingly fun and animated monster movie, "Gwoemul" (aka "The Host") in 2006, which succeeded in creating a sharp friction from the type B movie - the Korean movie, the continuation story became Is increasingly common, even though their budget (Mostly used with special effects) is becoming more and more popular. Do South Korean filmmakers really want to destroy the audience and popularity of investors, which their industry has built since 1999? The film "Shiri / Swiri" by creating a mid-level movie, a big story like mainland China? {Rant end} <br /> <br /> "The only reason" that I can understand for creating The film is convincing investors to invest money with animation and digital and digital information flow most of the dragon Korean / Asia. To the present for the last scene Now, if they introduce that dragon at the beginning and make it more personal and purposeful, for example, in 1996, "Dragonheart" movies may qualify for a few more exchanges, apart from having many digital dragons. "Dungeons & Dragons" in 2000. Does anyone know how trickery is not the special technique you use? But how do you use it I hope there will be more (and better) Korean myths that they can use because they have just killed a lot of international interest in the legendary Korean dragon with the way they shoot this story. <br /> <br /> In short, I agree. With all the past negative comments and wondering how Koreans feel about playing their folk songs "Arirang" at the end as a living thing, I'll give it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the effect Special events or action scenes are worthwhile. But I've seen many video games that have better camera and script functionality. (Just a little dragon)
