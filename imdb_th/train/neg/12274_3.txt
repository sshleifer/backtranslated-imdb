I am not usually the only one to say that this movie is not worth watching. But this is a suspicious situation The only real reversal of this film is Cornelia Sharpe, which looks attractive and the fact that this movie is really short. <br /> <br /> The story in this film is boring and unbelievable. There are no characters that are interesting from a distance and there is no reason to be interested. I'm not sure why in the world Sean Connery agreed to do this movie. But he should definitely pass this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can see watching this movie is if you're dead - a hard Sean Connery fan and just want to see everything he does. Save this for the last time. <br /> <br /> If you're surprised to see this, even with my review. (Or other comments on this website) I hope you enjoy it more than I don't appreciate reading.
