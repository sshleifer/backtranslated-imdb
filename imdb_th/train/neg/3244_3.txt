While the film contains elements of the Noir movie (Except that it is a color) The method is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a joke of the kind. <br /> <br /> Because the presentation is At least unexpected Usually I would rather slow about absorption when it comes to the story by twisting the plan. But you can see what comes here within the first fifteen minutes At the time of "Gee, I forgot $ 80,000" as I thought to myself that this thing was truly ridiculous. For experienced psychiatrists as specified in gambling to behave foolishly beyond belief If you act like an intelligent person, no matter what stage, the whole story will collapse. <br /> <br /> This production of wood makes me cold.
