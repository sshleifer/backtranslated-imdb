I won't waste time writing anything more than this, how bad it is for every aspect of this movie. Which has been done in great detail already many times. 'Plot' started out as a gangster, male Bernie / gangster gang - with an unimaginable number and quickly stepped into chaos. Anyone who pretends that they can see the masterpiece hidden in this terrible mess is just kidding themselves. It is now 7 or 8 years since I watched it for a period of 1 week at the cinema before it was pulled. But it stuck in my mind because it was the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I just expressed these comments and the only reason that I went to watch movies is because of the fact that That my brother Eddie appeared as the second 'heavy' in the pub It was his hand that pushed the lighter zippo towards the Rhys Ifan in the bar in 'Russia' (actually it was filmed at Butlins camp in the past at Barry Island). Just joined the extra agency and this is his first part When watching this movie, it seems that nobody wants any acting experience. <br /> <br /> I remember there were about 8 people in the entire theater - and this was only a few days after it was right. Released. I have never heard other things that are not popular and disappear quickly and accurately. In the event that you are thinking of renting this movie on a DVD, I suggest you put two pounds in a fire until they are red hot, then compress it into your eye socket. This may be less painful than watching movies.
