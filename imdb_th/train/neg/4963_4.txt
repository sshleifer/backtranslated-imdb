Became an attempt again that failed by the ridiculous sci-fi channel I'm not sure who wrote the script and interpreted the poem. But I'm sure it's a 17-year-old teenager who thinks it would be great if there are scaled faces in the movie AAAAAAAH! When I saw that part, I lost hope. Then ... they set out to go to the heorot in what appeared to be a ship that Christopher Columbus entered! When they arrived at Heorot (which should be Norse Meade Hall), the sci-fi group of the fool decided to make the heorot look like a large stone castle. When I saw that part .. I wanted to scream. I want this movie to be good, but sci-fi hasn't created a good movie, so I don't know why I have hope. Oh .. and Grendel and his mother are as stupid as well. (This comment closes the topic about "Grendel"). If anyone from the sci-fi channel is reading this .. there are good suggestions. Not every movie you do about the big monsters that can tear people in half. That's not what science fiction is talking about! And still stop performing low-level actors like Stephen BALDWIN to be in your movie! It doesn't help the movie, but it works well !!!
