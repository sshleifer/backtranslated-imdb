This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is (I think) the story of a college basketball player who is stubborn, tough coach, but fair, his girlfriend and fellow students Where to go, no character development, no one is interested and acting, except Bruce Dern as a scary coach. It's hard to believe how talented people like Jack Nicholson can direct such great films. Make sure to avoid this turkey.
