Wow, what can I say about this movie? It is ridiculous nonsense. I was surprised to get the highest score. What happened to this movie? This is a better question: There is nothing wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> The story itself is just a nonsense and an ancient thought. What is it about? ... Some stupid children who have no friends are chosen to kill and come back like a scarecrow for revenge. "All" The stuff packed in a worthless movie 86 minutes. If you haven't watched this movie, don't waste Watch time The second thing is not so good, so don't watch it too ... I rated this movie three stories because I like the scarecrow dress, not because there's nothing good about the movie. I think you get the picture
