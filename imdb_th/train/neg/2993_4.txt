I think Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 is a great horror movie, when the terrorist body that is infected by the stolen chemicals is recovered by the US Army. The bodies are cremated and released into the atmosphere on a small island. Soon the infected villagers will become hungry zombies and soldiers from the group must cooperate with the tourists and the group in an abandoned hotel while they try to Fight to the dead to life offensively. I didn't find this movie to be as good as the original Zombie Flesh Eaters, but it's still a good horror movie. I don't think it's one of the best in the 4/10 series.
