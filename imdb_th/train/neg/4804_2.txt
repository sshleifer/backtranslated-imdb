I didn't watch TV much and found this item. Show reality? I'm sure this is not true. If I was a man and had this kind of nagging and marrying someone who was very bad, it would be a divorce. I think she is a good example of how people should treat their loved ones. That is one thing that is wrong with our world at this time. Many people in bad relationships, selfishness, and do not know the meaning of what it truly loves It is to sacrifice yourself and not what should be Merritt. That does not give a good feeling to see what should be in personal counseling. If his personality in the show is real, he deserves a better person who will show true love and care and admire him for what he is. It shows that it's true or created for scoring ???? I really want to know Sincerely, GB
