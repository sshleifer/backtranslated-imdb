This anime series has a great start: interesting stories, exciting events, interesting characters. Not everything that can be explained immediately. Hanging the carrot that is a proverb in front of the audience to entice the audience to watch each episode successfully But imagine the disappointment that the sci-fi robot / giant robot adventures are just a backdrop for the exploitation of pedophilia. If you want to hear the word "Nevermind. It's good for you." After being battled by negative characters and negative emotions of the characters, this is for you. If you want to flick the science fiction that is fun to watch, forget this. Both the original and the ending options were very disappointing to me. All that and this movie preached too much
