The Ballad of Django is a winding song of the movie! This western spaghetti is just a set of scenes from other movies (and much better!) Tied together by "Django", which says that he brings out the outlaws. Django's skip this story unless you have to create all Django movies and even that may not be a good excuse to watch this movie !!
