This is just an ordinary rubbish of India that has become a movie theater. As an Indian, we are proud that we have the largest film industry. However, it is the worst. <br /> <br /> Other poor countries have real movies. how The characters that challenge the perspective of their society and we just pump the garbage indefinitely. Take a look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America. Watch the great movies they have and we get shit like Kisna! <br /> <br /> Get real people. No doubt that the international community is laughing at the Indian cinema.
