I can't believe how popular this item is. I consider myself a sci-fi fan. I have read countless sci-fi novels and many sci-fi movies and TV shows. I don't think this real sci-fi really is every episode that I watched as a weak episode of Star Trek. When removing anything that might make it interesting or exciting, <br /> <br /> It's a group of people. Standing around in the fatigue of the army Talk about the boring things that sometimes have to go through Stargate and end up on a planet that looks like the world with people who look and listen like humans! It seems that the budget is very low. All characters are memorable in one dimension and many attempts in humor are depressed. It reminds me when you see an ad with a famous athlete in it. Try to be funny, but he's not. It's sad. <br /> <br /> The movie is also very bad. There are many things you can do with a portal through space, but everywhere that the army of people is boring! This shows that there is no imagination! I think actually, the TV series Alien Nation from a few years ago (From the movie Alien Nation) is much better The show has the appropriate story and characters. I'm not crazy about "Alien Nation", but compared to this exaggerated story, it's great. <br /> <br /> Also different from the new "Battlestar Galactica" series. "Stargate" copied the image. Look and feel Of lame movies too! At least they should receive a special effect of the magic "flush flush" whenever someone passes through Stargate.
