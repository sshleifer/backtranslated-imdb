When the movie was released, it was the biggest hit movie and soon it became a blockbuster. But in truth, this movie is a ridiculous clock with a plot that praises the loser. The movie has a tagline - "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara" which means Love's Sweet. But sacrifice is immortal. In the movie, the hero of the movie (Ganesh) sacrifices love for the heroine (Pooja Gandhi), although both love each other! His reason is the meaning of tagline. This film has an influence on the broken minds of many young people as they find their attitude. "Sacrifice like a loser" is very thoughtful, and hence becomes a cult movie when they can move on with their lives. Ganesh's performance in this film is Amateurish, Crass and Childishly stupid. In fact, he looks funny in the song (Onde Ondu Sari ...) when he should look stylish and cool. His face didn't help in leadership. His hair style is mostly bad in the movie. Act on the POOJA GANDHI CANT. Her costumes are scary in the movie and not very consistent. <br /> <br /> The good part about the movie is the great movie and the beautiful song by Mano Murthy which is true Of this film, Jayant Kaikini's lyrics are also written. Director Rock Rut Bhat must praise the image of the song in a tasteful manner. <br /> <br /> Anyway, everything except this movie's movie is very common !!!!!!
