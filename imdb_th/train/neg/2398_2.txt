Being a fan of movies such as "Fire Sale", "Where's Poppa", "Airplane" I saw this because it was well mentioned in the context of comedies and real satires. <br /> <br /> Not only is this not funny, it makes you angry because it's not bad in schlocky way, satisfying but in a bad way. Quite in the way when you try to entertain your audience with humor. <br /> <br /> Obstacles to Adam Arkin's speech can be the most annoying thing in this movie. This cruel nature does not prevent him from being satisfied with this film and he is difficult to look at the camera. Amateurs that do not have this talent are suitable for continuous, continuous mistakes and mistakes according to the story - if you can find <br /> <br /> Ed McMahon - I have to miss. Jay Leno, who performed late night talk shows Who always refused to call himself an actor I've seen some movies from Leno and he is Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Mars is a good story. In a few lines he received I'm not afraid of comedians easily, so I watched and looked funny every 5 minutes or so. <br /> <br /> This movie became a joke as soon as Alan Arkin replaced him - he did. Truly: Start 75 minutes with every movie he is in. But it's too little too late. <br /> <br /> When the movie tries to fool you into believing that their lack of professionalism is the reason you should like them because they have the right intention. He reminded me about students that Have not prepared the exam In these cases, you must be strict and must be a grade 'F' (but please don't think I am a teacher that is a respectful career between politicians and child abuse) <br /> <br /> If you look Find a horror movie / sci-fi movie Have fun watching and having jokes. Try "Man with the Screaming Brain" by Bruce Campbell or see Sunshine / Core. If you like the sciFi schlock, which is loud and modern. That is equally funny even if it's not intended.
