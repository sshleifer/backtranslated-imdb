Followed better in 1973. "Cleopatra Jones" has an elegant black actress Tamara Dobson returning to play her unique role as a chic and chic drug agent here. Catch heroin in Hong Kong. Pollination of blaxploitation action-flick and kung-fu B-movie is fun from the beginning The final scene of the shooting ended at the assembly line and Dobson himself was more active than before. (She's still sexy and she spins a funny conversation. But these environments may be one thing that is too much for her - she is boring). Stella Stevens performed the villain this time. She is a good person but can't match Shelley Winters in previous versions ****
