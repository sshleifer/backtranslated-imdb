Howling II (1985) is a complete 180 films from the first part. While the first film is full of horror The second is not hard and wonderful. The production value in this one is quite bad and the show is cruel. The brother of a wolf female announcer from a part wants to find out what happened to his sister. "The scene" from the first movie was badly rebuilt. The young woman looks skinny with a brother (Reb Brown) to the old country (Romania) to reveal the mystery of the murder / change / death of the older sister. Christopher Lee appeared and disappeared now, and then when the wise man / guide led to both Sybil Danning and her two largest assets appear as Stirba, the head of the werewolf of Romania. She still has to suffer from the bad case of the morning face. Ewww! <br /> <br /> A bad movie. Nothing good about this smelly person. I was surprised that Philippe Mora directed this picture because he was always a good filmmaker. This movie is so dark that you have to use a flashlight to watch. (Not not content In rounding out the movie, you will receive a punched "punk" show from Babel "Damned". Perhaps if they split a few extra dollars, they might get a real deal instead. <br /> <br /> The best to avoid if you're desperate or you lose the distance and you're too lazy. To change channels
