I didn't get a big place now - Miranda is very outstanding and there is nothing ugly. It will make you lose consciousness. Someone here makes a note that sometimes it is the frequency of light waves or something more than being ugliness. Miranda is just a jerk. Now slow, not consistent and talking too much I also don't understand why Kolos was an ambassador - why the council didn't just let Madonna be mad There is a part that I like when Kolos speaks through Spock about the loneliness of human experience. Overall, I love the TOS, and despite being the worst, I always adjust it now. Although - mmm, I will not buy except copy that is already under $ 3.
