This movie is terrible. At the end of it, you will know that many hours have been stolen from your life that you cannot get back. The ending "twist" is planned very much. Character development that leads to this end is not consistent with the final action in the conclusion. Ninety minutes preparation - with evidence that the character Rob Lowe would die on Christmas Eve - was described in ninety seconds of "No, we just fool you. Then the character Rob Lowe didn't feel sorry about it! "I will forgive you if you can forgive me" is as upset as he gets. If someone spent weeks convincing me that I was dying and said "Don't apologize. Just fool you." I will make the hell serious. I didn't feel bad about giving spoilers because I might help you. Some people can't see it. Please help yourself and don't watch this movie.
