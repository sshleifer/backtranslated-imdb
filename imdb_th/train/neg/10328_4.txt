I think the show has a reasonably good idea to work with. But the operation is not good The script is not good and serves badly. There are many issues that may be shown in a better way, such as protests against gay marriage or cemetery searches. The performance cannot be called a comedy that lacks humor. I should say that this program has been very successful in making some Muslim communities live. <br /> <br /> Until now, the second season is worse than the first. I have high hopes about this item. But I was disappointed Still, I still admire the CBC that brought such ideas in front of the audience. However, I wish you good luck in the future.
