What I can say about this film is that it is good to see many Asian faces. What I don't like about this movie is that it is full of stereotypes of typical ethnic characters to do in their roles. An Asian woman who has no confidence to play with others to go ahead. White people are fascinated by Asian culture and choose to leave the white world behind for the land of yellow and black taxi drivers "Make it true" plus coke, Shanghai Tang Tang and Dunkin Donut. The product placement is too clear. The story itself is fun. But quite a lot that I think the story will be solved Then again, when watching a romantic comedy, you can't expect much. But then again I will be surprised at least once Parents are the best part of the flick.
