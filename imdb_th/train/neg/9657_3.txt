1) I'm not an expert on weapons. But even though I can see the difference between the US Army in WWI and WWII riffles in the film, we can see the private armed with "M1 Garand" (invented in 1932!). "Silent Death"), which was used until the Second World War. Difference - M1 can hold more than 1.5 times the ammunition and 3 times more fire rate! M1 is semi-automatic. Springfield requires repeated packing after every shot. Slightly different! 2) The German military uniform has also been borrowed from the 1940s, especially - the German helmet, until the end of the First World War. There are important spears on top, we can't see even in the movie And if we do additional searches in the archive - "true story", how is this true? I was very surprised at "Truthful" can be a movie director in seeking cheap releases.
