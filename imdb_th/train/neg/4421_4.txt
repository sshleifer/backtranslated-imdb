This story is definitely interesting: a group of people who love to play one more game by creating a medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and wargaming castles is an interesting phenomenon that delves into the common needs We in "escape" from reality and sometimes our existence - something almost everyone can relate to. The character is a predictable mix of those who love the Lord of the Rings and Star Trek is enough to get most people to watch. However, the movie quickly became an insider's view of wargaming by using the thumb of the audience who "didn't understand". The filmmakers seemed to be a matter of wargaming and this was especially waaaaay. Too more than once to realize the humor and fun in making movies about adults taken in the Middle Ages It is quite difficult for anyone who doesn't sit on the computer for 7-10 hours a day to play games or desiging the latest star destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we must pay attention. However, the filmmakers are not interested in choosing to focus on the game itself rather than creating a strong story with a clear story that everyone can understand. Moreover, the character itself is not interesting and you are bored of them quickly: don't be afraid when you try to make people interested for 90 minutes.
