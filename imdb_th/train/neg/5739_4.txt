A small town was attacked by bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is the lonely avenger and a group of survivors of rags. <br /> <br /> Released in 1993, "Darkness" gathers some things of the cult after release. It's easy to see why - it's loaded (and I mean freaking to load) with Gore and it's energy and enthusiasm, just like those found in cult horror movies that don't have other budgets like "The Dead Next Door". And "The Children of Ravensback" is actually quite infectious. <br /> <br /> While it may be true This film was filmed in Super 8, so the picture looked grainy and dark, making it very difficult to see (it would be good if it obscured the horrible protagonist character). With Casio annoying keyboard and metal death that is even more annoying (Seriously, what is it with these things that don't have horror, budget, and bad metal death?) While nobody expects Oscar's precious performance instead of being afraid or threatened. <Br / > <br /> In the end, I'm sure fans of gorefests without a budget will love this. Although everyone wants a little more loin
