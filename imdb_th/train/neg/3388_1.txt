I agree that it's a big fan of creating original scenes. I have never seen the movie version until recently on the cable and watched with anticipation to see my memories come back to life again because I like the original performance. Imagine my disappointment. <br /> <br /> This will be the worst translation of a Broadway show in a movie that had been created. They changed the story. They changed the music. They lost their souls. I expect to travel along the channel of memory, singing for a special touch of music and glass at the ballet and Hello Twelve. Not only will they mix the music until almost can't remember But they make the story messy, add music and an external storyline (Hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) Not appearing in the original and injecting unnecessary "drama" The original has enough pathos in itself. If you're a big fan of the original Broadway show, don't worry. I'm sorry that I wasted my time and made my memories dilute this rag.
