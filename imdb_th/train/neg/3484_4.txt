I remember now in the movie theater. Critics say it's scary. I don't think it will be that bad. It's fun and has lots of humor about the family during the holidays. <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck is a rich man who wants to find a Christmas family to please his girlfriend. He visited the house where he grew up and agreed to rent a family there for Christmas. I like the lawyer scene they signed. That is a joke. <br /> <br /> So he sent a stupid request to his family and even wrote a script for them to read. Of course, the family has a hot daughter for love. And he learns that the holidays are not bad. <br /> <br /> All the duo-daha performances are funny, especially when they change the first one with blacks. Do not say anything about it and the parts that Doo-dah hit on the "daughter should" button. Final decision: I think it's worth checking whether you catch it on the cable or not
