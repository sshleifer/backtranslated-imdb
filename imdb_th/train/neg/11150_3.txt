I watched this movie alone in the dark and it was a full moon outside! I didn't intend to do it, it happened like this. So all the elements are there for this movie that will scare me !! In fact, I don't want to turn off the DVD player after only 8 minutes, but I think that will give it an opportunity. The only terrible performance with good performances is Samaire Armstrong. The plot is not original. If you are a horror fan, then it's the same thing you've seen many times. Some scenes are not reasonable, and you feel that the director wants to make this movie longer! The monster is the biggest disappointment of the movie. The scene (scary) looks like they are in horror movies from the 80s when there is not enough technology. But some good movies were created at that time! I was surprised to see the name of the major manufacturers at the beginning of the movie. I think they can't put money on this and make it good, right? !! I disagree with the score that the movie received. It's my rating with 3 out of 10.
