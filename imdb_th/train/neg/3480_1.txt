This movie is terrible, scary, one of the worst movies ever. I can't imagine that Gigli is even worse. For example, we said "No" but then looking for something in the wreck there. Now, we decided to go ahead and shoot it. <br /> <br /> STUPID US <br /> <br /> Affleck is not an actor He is a good image and looks good when exploding. But not even Bruce Willis is still in "Die Hard". If he takes off his shirt and runs around to fight the villain, it will be a joke. <br /> <br /> The good part. The most is Catherine O'Hara - she is always good. Gandolfini fails again (if not The Sopranos, he will be washed) as he did in "The Mexican" <br /> <br /> Affleck every pig As others say - no characters have any motivation for their actions. <br /> <br /> Avoid images. This matter with all costs
