I don't want to believe my eyes when watching this movie. There are no issues with blood and violence. Different from other horrible movies that have blood and its meaning, this movie is just a bloody and suicide This movie is not interesting. There is no meaningful story or story. Blood looks very fake and this movie overall is pointless. Don't waste time on it. It was an illogical violence for just one or two hours. It has many bloody scenes that are not scary. But it's disgusting This may be the worst horror movie I've ever watched from all the horror movies I've seen.
