This film is about Sir Christopher Strong (MP - Member of Parliament - played by Colin Clive) and his relationship with the characters like Amelia R. Hart, who played the role. By Catherine Hepburn Until they met, he was a very dedicated husband But when he met Hepburn that was strange But fascinating "Can't help yourself" and they fall in love. You can tell because they stare at a lot of space and talk endlessly about the unrequited pain of love. Frankly, this is an old and impossible movie to watch. Part of the problem is that in the pre-code period, movies about adultery, watching movies is very common. Moreover, even if you accept the moral suspicion, the kindness of the conversation will make it look like a love novel in the 19th century ... and it's a terrible story. Sticky and like difficult characters (After all, Clive's wife is a good woman and no one is doing any harm). Regarding the only interesting aspect of this movie is the Hepburn outfit, wearing the first scene in which she is dressed with a moth! You must see to believe it - and she looks like one of the Bugaloos (vague But with appropriate references)
