When I saw this movie for the first time, it was called TERROR ON A TRAIN and was the second half of the double feature Glenn Ford. The weapons specialist was summoned to defuse the bombs hidden on the explosive train The tension is slow and stable. And this black and white film takes about an hour and twelve minutes Many years later on TV Tensions and plays have lost the most impact. This is a movie that is as good as the early 50s. <br /> <br /> Along with Ford is Anne Vernon and Maurice Ham, the villain / saboteur. Played by Victor Maddern.
