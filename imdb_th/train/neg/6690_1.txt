I sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations. My expectations are not just close enough. I can't tell what kind of movie this movie is from, and if it's funny, humor will be completely missed. The plot does not exist, and the show is horrible. My friend and I managed to see about 30 to 40 minutes of this film before we closed and asked the video store to take it back immediately. I don't recommend this movie to anyone unless you try to watch the worst movie of all time. I do not know whether this film lasted more than one day in the cinema and I can not understand why everyone is willing to watch because not only But it will be very interesting This review is not a joke and I think this is probably the worst movie ever created. It's the worst movie I've ever seen.
