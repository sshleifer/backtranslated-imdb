Thank you for killing the franchise with Turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This film sucks many levels. It's pathetic. The first vampire was fun. But this low compression gave me yawn. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi (Kevin Bacon's poor man) drives around Mexico with a surfboard hidden in his house. Is a vampire killing tool, Antonio Casey, Banderas's guitar on DESPERADO. He picks up the weak "hunters" at the same time. (Including an infected girl, a drug addict woman who must be careful not to become a vampire) and they travel to stop vampires, some female experts who do not have a backstory. Less about her or her quest (Walking in the sun by stealing blacks and doing rituals for her to do) If you have seen the first VAMPIRES, you have seen this and done much better. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter is responsible for Many bad movies in the latter Frankly, I think he passed his prime and couldn't make the horror classic again. The only good movie he has done since THEY LIVE (1987) is a vampire. Everything is complete shit until an incredible look and retard GHOSTS OF MARS ... and now this celluloid is broken. The only one that is even better in verse 13 Halloween (1) Can you escape from New York and other things? <br /> <br /> Wallace Xu, a carpenter, proved that he didn't. Can write a way out of a paper bag with his paper - some scripts are filled with yawns, groans and gags that are recycled from the original I mention that I hate every character in the movie? There are no memorable characters in the entire movie. how did this happen? This movie has nothing to suggest. Not even the DVD presentation is good. The menu looks terrible. <br /> <br /> By comparing JASON X: "Friday the 13th in the area" is a masterpiece. Now is the way you create sequels and add power to ladies and germ franchises and create exciting DVD menus.
