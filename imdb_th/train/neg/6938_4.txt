In this film, Amitabh Bachchan, the old man, falls in love with a younger woman again. He finds her in his restaurant. The young woman Tabu flirts with him. He doesn't know what to do and asks her to leave. Her reaction to his invitation was rather strange. Should be a joke. <br /> <br /> And that bothered me with this movie. It's not funny. Funny stories and terrible scripts! The only joke I like is about the waiter's teeth. But after many times even getting bored <br /> <br /> Amitabh has a small girlfriend called sexy. This is a strange relationship! A little girl with the mind of an old woman! It is scary! I know that some people can attach to children. But this guy has a conversation with an adult for this child It doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He must give Amitabh a difficult time. But we all know that Paresh can't do it. So even at the end of the conversation when they were sitting around the table, it should be a joke. <br /> <br /> I like movies that are really funny I think I will not watch this movie again.
