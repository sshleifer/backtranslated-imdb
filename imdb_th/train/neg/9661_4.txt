I want to say that acting is not good. But I think it is the directing that makes it so I never thought that the Highlander (the same director) was a lot, but that person might have been blamed in the 80s. <br /> <br /> However, there is no excuse. People were shot while leaving the trenches. A man in front of him!? Such mistakes include clear timelines, strange fighting strategies, sub-cuts and bad visual effects that make this movie a sub-movie. <br /> <br /> As well as commenting all American bullshit The German generals feared that the Americans had been captured personally. Prepare to swallow it very much, even in small sizes. <br /> <br /> To conclude, the movie is not scary. But still sub-war in all aspects
