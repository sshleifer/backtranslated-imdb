I couldn't help laughing at the people who watched this show as warm and torn. For one person it is completely unrealistic that these people will have a perfect life after their new home. <br /> <br /> How can these families maintain these large houses? What about their poor neighbors? Real estate taxes will certainly increase after this event occurs. In addition, the noise will disturb me. <br /> <br /> How are two things that reality television programs can become? It's actually the same every week. Junk is repeated after a week. We were introduced to a suffering family. They improved the house. Then made the family surprised and everyone separated from the box. Kleenex <br /> <br /> Don't talk about improvements. How boring is that part? The only interesting part of the performance is to see what the house looks like. But even if that part is destroyed by fake confessions and sobbing "The survivors" are excellent and can move far.
