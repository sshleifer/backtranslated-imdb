I will keep this short. Thank you Greg for helping me to be strong: being booked, a story about a woman taking drugs, imprisoning and torturing her, then posting a captive with her That is the twist and the single punch of the movie. Torture is an intimidating, slow-moving day. And it is not a good movie at all It's not that bad. Well, it's not good. <br /> <br /> It should be said that among critics there is "Spoiler code" that they don't dare to crack, although some people are tempted because of this. Why no one has cojones to step up and say "This is garbage, and this is the reason" is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Don't give your money to poop poopers.
