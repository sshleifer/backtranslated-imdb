I am thrilled to discover the comedy of the sixties that stares at my favorite person - Maggie Smith, Bob Newhart, who is very young and of course Peter Ustinov. This does not work, whether it is a comedy movie or a perfect robbery movie. Ustinov plays a little crook just out of jail, locating his site in a large American company based in London. In the past, Karl Malden made the Newhart CEO lose consciousness. Ustinov passed on himself as a computer expert and immediately planned on the part of In order to do this, he needs to get through a proven security system that protects the company mainframe and this is a problem. His perfect plan works because everyone in this movie is trustworthy and stupid. His weak excuses are used in the face and this is the only computer center that everywhere does not have to worry about video cameras. The second problem is robbery. (Real fraud) occurred within the first 30 minutes of the film, robbing the rest of the image that showed a lot of tension. Maggie Smith felt very sorry while the neighbor / secretary of Ustinov was located next to Neighbors who can't work I love Maggie Smith, but she seems to be together here, too calm, the part that calls for a more bizarre comedic actor. In addition, Ustinov and Smith do not have a common chemical reaction. Age differences But the romantic relationship that was later without romance, as had been before, Ustinov co-wrote the script and it was a good idea at that time. But I found that it was not offensive, crooked, and sad from the great actors
