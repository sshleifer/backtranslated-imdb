It's a scary show. Science fiction fans seem to be watching nothing anymore regardless of quality. It made me shocked that there was something special like a firefly lasted one season while garbage like Battlestar Galactica created new memories. Performing as a child and not affected The character is an ancient cardboard of everything that has been in a bad sci-fi series. The story is not good. The conversation is worse than the social time drama. That direction is low and the scene is terrible. Caprica is a waste of movies, a waste of time and effort. This is one spin that shouldn't be done.
