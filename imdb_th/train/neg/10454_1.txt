When talking about the movie We should point out early that the snake is quite important to the plot. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a very bad cgi snake like a real snake. That was scary because it slipped and crawled These snakes do nothing. They glide like in video games. They are cartoon snakes. I will go too far to say that even those who have a major fear of real snakes will not find these people scary. <br /> <br /> Why on earth then you want to include Failed these cgi very much? Why not rely on suspense Or better, why not make it look good from the beginning? Then may continue to use them as needed. <br /> <br /> Look at the 'things' of John Carpenter. Here we have a real slime and a creepy proportion 20 years ago and we got a pile of stinking snakes on the plane. When will these people wake up and smell the coffee? The effects are going back. <br /> <br /> Can you be sure .. but the movie is funny, right? Sure I have that idea, but well done! In addition to the above, this movie has shit dialogue. And the sound and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way. <br /> <br /> I can handle all the other actors who are part of this movie except Jack. Ridge What is he doing there People who starred in the pulp fiction about 10 years before this career advancement? Do you give people value for money? No, I want to know how Tarantino thinks when he is half way from the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The current generation seems to have very low expectations. And Hollywood seems to offer what they want When leaving the theater, I saw a number of ads for a truly terrifying future release, including ... DOA: Dead or Alive (again), cgi animal movie called 'flushed away' and Another funny movie called In addition, I saw a horrific trailer, including one for (another) English shit. Horror / jokes. I didn't see the movie industry like this for a long time. <br /> <br /> Expect Will watch this movie for sale in the bargain part of the DVD for Â£ 1 in 6 months, and if you expect to see black comedy with many good-looking snakes and cool conversations that come From the lips of samuel l jacksons forget it
