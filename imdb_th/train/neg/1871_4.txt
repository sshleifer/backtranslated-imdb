Despite the extravagant production numbers and excellent costumes, this movie is a remarkable work. The plot of the murder-mystery is just a vehicle that is attached to the music. But it often causes litigation to be interrupted and is not related to this matter Although it is obvious that there is a lot of money to spend with them. But those numbers have been staged and shot badly Obviously it's a pre-movie movie because girls often wear very little clothes and still have songs that sing hashish praise! The whole performance is a single note, although it is good to see Carl Brisson in the musical, but when Victor McLaglen, as a police agent, looks for the last time in finding traces, you may want to throw a towel Fast forward at least to the next number. Pity the patron who was locked in the cinema by release!
