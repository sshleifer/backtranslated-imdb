I will be short ... This movie is a shame for everyone except the movie. The fact that it is a criticism of the sex tourism industry seems to be correct until we "Treated" with lingering dance scenes No nonsense plot, besides the most crazy fan of horror movies, BAD will get anything from it. And for God's love, please stop saying that this movie is a story of lost innocence or even empowerment of women because it is quite clear that it is not This is the worst movie in the Edinburgh Festival. (I've seen it already) Some people even fell halfway through this movie, probably because they couldn't get it again. This may seem too harsh criticism. But I can't really find the redemption feature of this movie, except maybe if you think it's a pure joke In short, this film will look best in the cocktails of class drugs.
