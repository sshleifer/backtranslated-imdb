First of all, I didn't come here to watch this movie. I find it completely fun, even with low production quality. The performances here are disgusting, like the monsters that follow them, even though the creatures are doing well ... Well done, impressive. Actually, he looks like everyone else in the world like a foreign family in Holidays in the Himalayas and while the father is away ... join the natural call. Spot loose and they don't have time to chase him. That or he is the Wishmaster's Caucasian brother. I haven't decided which one. <br /> <br /> Actually, this seems to be taken somewhere in a country with snow. But probably more than Canada anywhere in China Trees and scenery speak to Canada with me, and it is ok that the designated area has never looked or felt the cold that anyone would expect to find in the Himalayas of China. It is a Sci-Fi Channel movie so we can forgive the lack of position. <br /> <br /> Next, obviously (As we have just established) Sci-Fi directors don't travel often because they don't know Commercial aircraft fly over the air as it appears here, and subsequent mistakes will not occur. But as I said it was a Sci-Fi Channel, so we had to forgive something. <br /> <br /> This movie has many beautiful graphics. About aliens in the jungle and bad wushu movies that they fly with wires Obviously, Yeti can jump like Spiderman ... or Super Mario ... Remember? "Run faster! Jump higher! It takes longer! "<br /> <br /> Yeti still missed his teddy bear. He searched high and low for it. But seems to be unable to work the terrible remains of the Yeti! You can't help but feel sorry. It survived and evolved for thousands of years only to give up on the loss of a teddy bear. He misses his bear. Or maybe it wants to breed But the idea was suspended! can you hear me Looks like it's a man who doesn't show up. REBANISHED! <br /> <br /> And it's superhuman, not human ... It's the ultimate Yeti! But then again, what is normal? Yeti? I don't know, but he has the exact qualities of Michael Meyers that is completely unstable. And he has a wonderful way to clean his FABulous Dahlink fur! It is sometimes white that should not make him meticulous, superhu -... super-Yeti. <br /> <br /> All right? It was a lot of fun to watch, with great killings and a slightly honest planning element. In spite of the form of production like pebbles that are scary, it's really fun I can't help but wonder if they plan on another one? <br /> <br /> Rate 6.0 / 10 at the M4TV level. <br /> <br /> Rate 4.4 / 10 at the movie level from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend:
