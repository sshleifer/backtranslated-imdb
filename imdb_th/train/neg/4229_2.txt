I'm a big fan of this low price horror movie, but come! This must be the worst monkey that S @ # t I've seen! I ignored the review posted on this website to see that it would be in my taste with horror. But I'm bored and close it. Let's see: <br /> <br /> Wardrobe: consists of a cheap pendant set from the mask house station made of what looks like tin foil. <br /> <br /> Gore: Gore Pretty well i have to give it But the burnt moon of Ittenbach is better for low-cost movies. <br /> <br /> Acting: Terrible! I'm not interested in making copies. I found this humor as it was in Ittenbach's "Premutos" (the best movie). The sequence of battles and actions was terrible. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Don't watch Schnaas's movies. Better than Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach, with movies with similar content. Check Premutos, House of Blood, Schramm and nekromantik.
