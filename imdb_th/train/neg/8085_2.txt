Oh hilarity! Oh happy! Another movie, terrible story. It's good! Or so i think In fact, this one missed the "terrible, good" range and went sadly, "That would be terrible, but they frantically came up and made it bad." <br /> <br /> For the beginning, take time. Too long Reduce half an hour and may be more durable Then put in a laughing plan like "The person who sabotaged the mission to save the world because he had all the food stored and he would be rich if the mission failed!" Duk !. or the "Talking bomb" plot device that was last seen in Dark Star. That .... as in the Dark Star, there is a strange explosion ..... hmmmm "We can't go out to play in kindergarten" and you have a short-lived Crisis <br /> < br /> Relief light must be in the form of a jack palace (or a pair of pants As we call him in this flick), whose sole purpose in this film is to drive around the desert and phone the child's father to come to pick him .... Finally, during driving and talking on the phone jack Eliminating a lot of floating things and layers and cackles In short, he is the best movie. <br /> <br /> My reward for "The Most Ironic Line Delivered Straight-Faced" went to Charlton Heston at when Meet his oldest son for the first time in the era Commented that his son looked a little "deformed" while he was standing there with his bowling lashed to his waist and wanted the captain Kirk Corset horribly > <br /> It's fun too High-class henchmen with bright white hair, which reminds me of Andy Warhol for some reason. <br /> <br /> In addition to these hilarious The ending is the sequence that is copied from (But shorter than mercy) The end sequence from 2001 <br /> <br /> Tips for enjoying this movie more if you're stupid enough to watch it like I do: <br /> <br /> 1 Whenever the bomb speaks out, imagine that it's called Tarquin. (Believe me, it's ok!) <br /> <br /> 2 Whenever Chuck Heston is on the screen and is talking Prepare him by reading one chapter from Planet of the Apes, such as "Take a dirty paw "/> <br /> 3 or similar Whenever <br, the actress looks stressed. (This is the most time) still hope that you will have the ability to see and will die soon. <br /> <br /> 4 During the scene "The boat capsized again" endlessly. Technology / engineers will spray Scotch like "You can't change the laws of physics!" Or some shit. <br /> <br /> In addition to doing things that will get you through this I slept half way and woke up to recognize that I didn't miss anything and didn't have any plot, so don't worry about some adjustments, you won't miss anything.
