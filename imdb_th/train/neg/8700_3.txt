I hope Concorde / New Horizon doesn't try to make serious horror movies or even action movies when they create Carnosaur 3. This movie is simple from beginning to end. Even the humor in C3 is funny because it's bad. Absolutely high water marks in the 'So Bad It Good' category. If you enjoy the worst of the worst, this is what you need.
