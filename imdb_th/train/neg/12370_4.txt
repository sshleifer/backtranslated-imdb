They should call this movie The Map because most stupid movies revolve around the cemetery map. Not to mention that there are many boring images in the map. The only thing they showed more than that map was the tiny sweat that was created continuously on the forehead of our main character. Of course, this is the way the filmmakers showed us that the incredibly tense things happened on the Immortal Hills Cemetery. We heard a lot about how everyone on the map on the map fell like a fly. But we don't see anything Some of the ways I bury The Living depends on my interest, so I'm quite kind with the ratings I give. But I will not recommend this movie to anyone If you do not have a passion for maps or sweat, I recommend renting a better movie, such as I Spit On Your Grave or drinking your blood.
