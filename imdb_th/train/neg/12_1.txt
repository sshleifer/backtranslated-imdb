All I can think of while watching this movie is the B grade fall. Many people have said that the quality of redemption is that this film shows the realistic expression of the effects of drugs and people and the spiral that Followed them into their own immortality, from an unfortunate event But actually the technique used (As many people have already mentioned) is used too much and is unreliable and is not related to the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, it lacks incredible clarity. You can read most other reports about this film and they will say the same way that I want. <br /> <br /> Get some interesting actors and actresses. But when faced with boring actions ... just carry a film The action is terrible and discrete: there are a few punches thrown here and there and the final clash ends. There's nothing to write about at home. <br /> <br /> As others say, 'BAD' is great for watching for the reason that they are 'bad'. You are very happy. However, this movie is void. <br /> <br /> In addition, if someone wants a movie for education to keep people away from drug use, I will introduce many other movies out there. The effective way 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' and' Candy 'are just a few examples, although one should check out some more lighthearted movies in the same story, like' Go '(Including both serious and funny) and' Halfbaked '<br /> <br /> in the last record, one line may be redeemed in The film was sent by Vinnie Jones to be stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels' in thinking that the best movie, a small story that has been mentioned by 'Loaded' is a terrible story. <br /> < br /> Overall, I suggest you save your money and time by not watching this movie.
