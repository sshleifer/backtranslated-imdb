I can say no doubt that Going Overboard is the only worst movie I have ever seen, and yes, I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is a nasty thing as a comedian Schecky Moskowitz. Working on a cruise ship is a plot. <br /> <br /> That's it! There is nothing in this movie that is reasonable. It is everywhere, like a breakfast of a madman and not in the form of a strange naked gun. But it is even more frustrating. Even General Noriega still appears for whatever reason I can understand, adding to the mix of Miss Australia, who has the worst Australian accent I have ever heard and you have something I do. Will not be called the worst movie ever made because Going overboard is not suitable for the basic definition of movies I suggest watching this movie because it will help raise the status of all the bad movies you've seen. I guarantee the first thing you will say after seeing a bad movie is "At least not as bad as Going Overboard"
