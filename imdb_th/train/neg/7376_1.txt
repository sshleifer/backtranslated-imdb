Steven, what are you doing? You've done all the new things. It is strange since Steven, Steven's last shadow director, directed by the same director who made this trash. Shadow man is good. This is terrible. Very bad. It's not funny that Steven is almost. Not in this movie and felt like he was in the form of a pendant and when he was in the movie, he dubbed half the time anyway. For good deeds, assuming that the Wizard of Oz has more action than this trash, there is almost no action in the movie, and when it comes to it, it is boring. Will kill everyone, unlike the movie in which he goes to the army. A man is under attack 1 and 2 and leaves the wound. The story is confusing with the plot of the plot so sometimes it doesn't create a scene. The flight of anger is better than the shameful thing. I lost 5 pounds with this garbage 0 from the next ten luck better.
