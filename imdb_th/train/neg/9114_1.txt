Because 'cruel' is the only word that exists to describe the intentions of these filmmakers Where do you start in the gym of b * tchiness? I'll start with the great performances of almost everyone in this movie. Scratching is almost not in that sentence. I can't think of even one character that shows up well. Although in all fairness it is impossible to describe these center-dimensional characters in a successful way. Still, the girl who played Katherine (whose name I didn't intend - I pretended that she didn't exist) remained one of the worst actors I've ever seen. The story is a terrible god. It tries to reflect the ability that is first. But failing in many ways, rather, every part of it is pointless - even though I accept (Reluctantly) that the twisting plan is quite good, it is a surprise And at the end, at least have a little sense of humor But this movie depends on the worst thing I have ever seen. Don't look. It can't be done. There is no value to watch. It only takes the first enjoyment.
