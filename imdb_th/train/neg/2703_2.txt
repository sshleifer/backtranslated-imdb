Minor SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I just woke up and watched this movie, mostly because I liked and rated the previous singleton's work, like "Boyz n the hood". However, I must say that this is a disappointment. The big time and everything I hate about the movies that are created lamenting, or "messages" <br /> <br /> Most performances are bad. (Pop stars and models do not necessarily have to be good actors ... take notes) difficult situations to swallow (Rape victims become overnight lesbians, right? Please! ) But the worst is that it reinforces the attitude you think In the second half of this film became a cartoon like in its nature, giving you a lack of understanding you may have for one-dimensional players. <br /> <br /> Not the right issue. The true cause of racism and culture, political and political ignorance So it became the result of these problems. It is a conflicting message causing confusion and a lack of general plot links. For the conclusion of the movie, I found that it can be predictable, embarrassing, exploiting and gentle aggressively. For a movie called "Higher Learning", I must say that all I have learned is to avoid seeing this thing again. <br /> <br /> If you want real opinions on some issues in this film Can not explain completely Then hire "American History X" .... unless you watch the Tyra Banks and then hire a life
