The conversation, the historical accuracy is terrible. For example - Stacey Dash and the suspending scene are correct. (As far as I can tell), but that kind of snare broke the person's neck. Ms. Dash was released at the end of the rope without any effect until the rope was shot. This type does not strangle people. It kills them at the end of the fall. <br /> <br /> And before they go to rob the bank (in the past), they stop at the road for a hug-like group Their bandannas hide their faces - which will be visible to the people on the road. <br /> <br /> Poor corrections - that is the battery pack under that shirt and clearly the clip. of "Long distance riding" shows that they ride along the path and then forced the film. <br /> <br /> I don't like the fact that they collect scenes with horses. Take the shit - it looks like a symbol. All movies crap
