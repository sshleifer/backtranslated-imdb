The so-called prequel is just a bad remake to a better version of dangerous Liasons. The plot is the same with most of the scripts. I like books based on and I like the first movie. But I don't want to go to see the third movie The absurdity between the two main characters in the prequel is predictable and not original and ... I just can't emphasize how bad this movie is. If you don't want to use my word, just watch it and you will see what I mean. If you have read the review that says 'If you like the first person, you will like the second person' The only reason is because that is the same movie! Although the plot is not good They spent many lines in the first film, hard to tell which movie you were watching.
