The only thing that prevents this flick from being a total disaster is the interesting style. <br /> (Moderate Spoiler Alert) Death by comic is part of a scene in the Twilight Zone: The Movie. That gives death by cartoon There is still a good deal, especially watching the bleed ink and the isolated color. <br /> <br /> There is also a good scene with a devil motorcycle. <br /> <br / > Having said that, I'm glad to get a cheap DVD at the store because the business is terrible. I bought "Soul Survivors" at the same time and both movies are annoying as well as the continuous perception that you have. Get to watch the dream. However, at "Soul Survivors" there is nothing to redeem or give any feelings, at least there are some stylish notes mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Interesting DVD lets you go. 8 'Nightmare', which has something really happening, which is the only way to watch. Scripting during the creative period is quite unbearable. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
