TV pilots, don't you love them? Quinn Martin tried to make this film after being successful in other TV detective films. But this story went anywhere, except in the MST kingdom Tree sucks as a bad guy, despite all his disguises that make him look like he normally does. There are many unnatural clothing fibers that you can imagine. (Necessary in the 1970s) and acting on his own was against the climate Why doesn't it go to the series? You think it is quite blatant. Again, it's fun for MST, but not so much !!
