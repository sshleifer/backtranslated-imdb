I'm a good friend of Lon Chaney, but writing the screenplay doesn't work for me. The story jumped strange (since I learned that this film had no category). The character appeared and suddenly disappeared. Some descriptions too (such as "Why are you no longer a kid!" - Slowly cut the image - "You are a woman!" Yes, we understand first.) But there is a sequence of speech. A few things that ask for an unexplained explanation (try listening to Luigi and his blonde girlfriend, please!) The story that deals with the desire for illegal sex (Figuratively, if not using the technique) is interfering with difficult points. For the author's credit, this issue is considered a problem and the match in May to December is not described as an inevitable and good inevitability of the Mary Pickford movie (such as "Daddy-Long-Legs"). Kane gives good results as usual. But I think he is a better director in the past - he has been overdue for a couple of times. Here, IMHO, I enjoy the sequence of clowns and are very impressed with the sensational performances. The movie has its time. But until now it was my least favorite image
