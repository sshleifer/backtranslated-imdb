I was amazed at everyone. (Even critics) seem to think that this is a good movie. It's the most strange thriller I've ever seen. We have 'bad guys' who want to force them. 'Good men' (or girls in this case) do something or face the consequences. In the film, she must use her intelligence and skills to overcome the 'bad guys' and save the day and people she loves. Using special abilities, courage and luck helps save the day. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Well, a young woman named Lisa Recit met a young man named Jackson Ripner (Dee) at the airport. One coincidence leads to another, and soon it seems that the fate will bring the two together. together Sharing drinks, sitting next to each other, seems to be compatible all the way ... Is there more strange? Are these two things meaningful for each other? Is 'destiny' the reason for their strange and random encounters? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, right? Jackson wants Lisa to help him kill the Director of Homeland Security by moving him from one room to another so that his people can attack him. Oh, if you don't do this thing, your father is dead. Although we have never learned the exact reason why and who is behind this madness, Jackson further explains how this will happen and why Lisa gives the best interest to help him. br>> <br /> His evil plans with her wise men and in the process of stabbing him in the neck caused him to travel across the chair and hit him with a hockey stick. Oh, and before that, she took him out to hunt wild animals through the Miami airport, where she was secured and stolen the car that she used to run away. The man who was ordered to kill her father <br /> <br /> Yes, <br /> <br /> First of all, I think it's strange that men like Jackson who can handle high-tech weapons need help from the hotel manager. Can't he sneak into the building? Wouldn't that be safe for him and his team by leaving a third party? And why the characters like Jackson explain everything they are going to do to the people they are threatening That doesn't make it easier to stop them by the same person. <br /> <br /> Actors are trying to fully consider the movies they have received. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still actors beware In addition, I believe Jayma Mays (the 'cute' Cynthia player) will be the person we will see more. It's terrible that everyone is stuck with this story. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
