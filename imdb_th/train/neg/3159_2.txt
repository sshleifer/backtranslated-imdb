Sorry, I have written my opinion about this movie. But today is the first day I watch other reviews. There are many people who agree with me. But the scary thing is that there are some people who seem to really like this movie. I don't like to write offensive criticism or criticize other people's opinions. But I think it's fair to warn someone who might argue whether or not to watch this movie. This is not a good movie. I like movies a lot and I can watch anything. But this movie made it a short film program that I watched incredibly and enjoyed halfway through. If you are incredibly tempted to look at an example ... that's the mistake I made because this movie is an example in the movie trailer ... After that, there are no surprises. And hated to criticize him But I think it is my duty to stop others who have wasted their lives in this movie !!
