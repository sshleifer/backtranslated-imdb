What's this ? Low budget comedy movie? However, it describes the people in Spain perfectly. They can create better ideas. I mean, they made this type of movie since the 60s .. and people like them! This is not a joke for teenagers or families. (You can't let the 12-year-old child see 2 people on the kissing bed. He won't want to go to Spain.) Should be ranked "R" because there are only 35+ people who laugh. gay (Which is an important part of the movie) <br /> <br /> Humor from abroad is terrible in the movie (except Kusturica) next to the drama! If you want a new comedy, try Talladega Nights.
