After watching just five across my eyes, I must be honest ... I don't like it. I have read many good reviews in this movie. But I do not understand where these reviews come from. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of time for newcomers to make movies and I 'I'm sure the director will do well for himself. But the budget they have is the main problem. There are two cameras that are used in all movies (which is ok) but they seem to be really cheap cameras. Another problem is the sound. You will get screaming and shouting of all women at the same time. All talk - it's impossible to hear what they say. <br /> <br /> There are thoughts. Good for it. In summary, they hit a parked car and drove for a moment. After that, they were chased by the cars they were bumped into by crazy women who wanted to kill them and had many opportunities. Will do that! ... and on the other hand, girls have many opportunities to escape. But don't! <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ... I just got through this!
