Based on Michael Chabon's novel Mysteries of Pittsburgh, a story about the young son of a notorious gangster who spent his teenage years in the past summer with two friends, the year 1983 and the young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster). intersection In contrast to the way of life of the father entirely, the art plans to become a broker. In a painstaking attempt to create a hip indie movie, this film feels like a director of dodgeball as a joke when commercial commercials - looking for indie credibility by sprinkling stones together. Suvari , Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte, as well as the premiere full of celebrities at Sundance this year, it feels like this is a vanity project that has Playback support from studios to assist directors earn credibility indie - it failed.
