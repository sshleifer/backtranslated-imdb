(aka: DEMONS III) <br /> <br /> Created for Italian TV, although it is taken in English and does not refer to the sequel of the previous DEMONS movie, it should be a simple matter: THE OGRE The way the director Lamberto Bava released <br /> <br /> The American family rented an Italian vacation home in the summer. that girl (Virginia Bryant) A recurring dream that he was a young girl down to the villa's old wine cellar, found a cocoon-like structure suspended from the ceiling. It glows and is covered with spider webs and there are things that look like legs, spiders or insects hanging from it. It drops what looks like green. <br /> <br /> Of course, the husband doesn't believe this. Villa just got old and creaks and caused strange noises at night, and she should ignore. <br /> <br /> But then OGRE appeared in the Centaury series 16, it looks like the wolf's head is stuck with it. And attract attention to the smell of orchids. <br /> <br /> The film is not bad, and at least now the conversation is halfway. There is no real blood other than some skeletons that spin in the pond. Underground Like a modern swimming pool, OGRE itself faded after being taken over by Jeep Cherokee. <br /> <br /> The DVD copy of Shriek that I watched was flawed with a black image for a few seconds. Half an hour into this movie, I hope Shriek will fix the bug. The special features include a short interview with Lamberto Bava, which he explains that this is not a sequel, etc. ... along with some examples to other versions of Shriek DVD. This is a pretty standard thing. <br /> <br /> 3 From 10 <br /> <br />
