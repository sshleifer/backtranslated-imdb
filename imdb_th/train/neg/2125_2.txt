If I wasn't forced to watch this thing because of work reasons, I wouldn't make it through the first 10 minutes, and then I accepted that I was quickly passed on through various parts. The movie version of '63 is extremely superior in all matters. Yes, I have read this chapter, being faithful to the more original plays. But the smartest thing for writers is to change the script in '63! It is too long. It dragged the songs that are in this version and not in the film version that is boring and unimaginable. The "Kids" version in the '63 version is very funny and is a true classic humor of the ironic parents In this version, Kim is too old. Conrad is really scary. (When someone ripped off his shirt, I felt terrible ... This director didn't know what was sexy. This dance is not singing. (He can't be adjusted) and offensive. If Elvis Presley is like that, his career will probably end before it starts. For other actors, I still waited for Alexander's wig to fall as he danced and Daly acted like a mother. See Stapleton's performances in the movie to see the same role that was executed by those who understand the timing of the cartoon. This TV has nothing but a waste of time.
