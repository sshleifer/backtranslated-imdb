Michael Jackson is claiming to be the most-charged character in THE GOLDEN CHILD and because he loves children that doesn't work (and why must be so), so instead of Eddie Murphy Go out to help the world with the help of "Midas Kids". I would like to recommend every screenwriter in the future to study the ridiculous dialogue of actors in strange fantasies - adventures - comedy near ISHTAR. that Murphy's to say, or likes best. But don't let me misunderstand about his great funny ability He wasn't in this movie and he went to find DR with Dolittle! The violence and the whole picture is the reason for it to become a classic camp cult, and that doesn't make Hollywood and the movie enthusiast stay with men. When talking about the image, they were miraculously drawn out at the time of the reputation of President Ronald Reagan. Murphy did better than coming to America and 48 hours, but this old movie didn't touch my golden honey for a crunchy taste.
