This movie is just nonsense. Although the director claims to be part of traditional culture But it is also a very bad director launch. The topic is very interesting and I accept bad performances because they are But is an amateur and has never been shown before But the worst thing about this movie is the dialogue and governance that is inexperienced and innocent There was no time in that movie. I felt like a director out of this movie. (It's their first feature) In fact, they never really ask themselves what they want to tell. I met Ben (One of the directors) many times and he is good and generous But that didn't make him a director. I think "American History X" is full of ancient ideas. But able to convey the story <br /> <br /> If you want to see Strange german movies But great. Watch the movies of Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel: <br /> <br /> Funny videos of Benny Die Unber√ºhrbare Mein Letzter Film. <br /> <br /> *** From ten because of the topic and photography
