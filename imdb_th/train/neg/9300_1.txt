Spoiler Alert I think this movie is probably the worst movie ever created. Probably the style of Edwood (without heart). Lightning is terrible. The music is not very good (piano and orgue ... come on!). The performance is ... no show. <br /> > There was a man who entered the forest to search for his lost wife and spent time having sex with strangers. <br /> <br /> The killer is a clown that is fat, unsightly and can't. Run away from the turtle. <br /> <br /> All the actors are stupid and the director brings all the slashers in the movie. In the movie without effort, <br /> <br /> The end is the most stupid thing ever created. Think about it: people (Ken Hebert) with the ability to perform are similar. With his writings (He was the brain of this failure) invited two of his colleagues and friends to his cabin at the weekend .. On Monday morning he returned to the office as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> The tragedy is that Mr. Hebert tries to make us believe that he is a family of descendants. <br /> <br /> So of course, no police will ask him after his co-workers disappear ... <br /> <br /> What <br /> <br />
