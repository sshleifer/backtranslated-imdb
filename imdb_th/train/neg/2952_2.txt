From watching only trailers to Theodore Rex, you would think that this is a bad police comedy with Whoopi Goldberg and the men in the dinosaur costume. That's true But mostly the future, which looks like Batman Forever with style, navigation and strange character design, it is incompatible with the market and should be marketed as a future story rather than just a police comedy Regardless of whether this movie will be released to the market or not, it's still a terrifying movie. <br /> <br /> In the future, the dinosaurs come back to life again with amazing technology and they talk and walk. Going around like a human, Teddy is a dinosaur detective who has never been serious. But after the murder of a dinosaur, he received a case to work But he must be a partner with all of their most brutal police, Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg). It is up to this unmatched partner to solve the murder problem and it is up to the audience to wake up long enough. That will make it through this rough piece. <br /> <br /> Teddy starts the picture as a normal character. At the end he couldn't bear to listen. For some reason, including being a detective, he is a comedian and a bad fake. He mimics famous people and accents and has some truly scary lines. Whoopi blames him because he falsely says that "It's not the sound of my butt!" Wow! It's a ridiculous and innocent thing, even for children with this ability. Whoopi is annoying and rude to everyone. I hope Teddy will bite her head for the entire length of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie never knew what it needed. When the scenes and actions of the future happen, there are no jokes or jokes. In scenes that are not action scenes, the characters try to be as funny as possible, which causes boredom. Action scenes are not working because they are too strange and not violent enough, and as stated earlier, the comedy is just a joke that has been massacred. Nothing works here. <br /> <br /> Having a detective pair of dinosaurs / humans looks like a very beautiful original movie. Nope! This movie is a very opportunistic story of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Just replace the dinosaur with the cartoon and put it in the future and it is the same story. Men killed, dinosaurs were killed. Dinosaurs and detectives solve the problem of murder. Jin and detectives solve the murders of bad guys in Roger Rabbit, Christopher Lloyd and Weasels. The bad guys here are those who look like Christopher Lloyd and those who act like weasels. The scene of the club in Roger Rabbit, where Jessica Rabbit walked onto the stage, imitating the dinosaurs. This is a much better movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a bad movie, not worthy of the VHS. <br /> <br /> My score: 1/2 from ** ** 90 minutes PG for violence, language and rough humor
