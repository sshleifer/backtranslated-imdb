I don't really know what this movie is about when I go to the cinema to see it. (Advertisements about Satanism, etc. and so on) because the trailer in the latest movie I saw looks quite interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh, dear Roman Catholic legend? Not my thoughts are scary, and honestly, I just feel like watching a good movie, scary, not planning a religion that is trying to score the cheap excitement by allowing the chicks to receive blood every minute. br /> I will try to get away from the spoiler (!) but I find it very strange that there is no god who has received the rosary beads from the deceased priest. (Should not be branded) will be deeply religious Come on! <br /> <br /> Her crucifixion scene was hurled, screaming, blood everywhere became boring after seeing dozens of times. It's not scary or just scary, nasty. However, it makes it very painful to watch the scenes. Those flicks are very annoying ... Conclusion: If your Catholic challenge doesn't see this thing If you haven't seen it yet, don't see it.
