"Drawing Restraint 9" is a movie that loves or hates. Fortunately, I left it with a strong sense of wasted time and was thoroughly stuffed with propaganda. "The killing of whales is not good." The film is impressive, especially in the first half, until it is unclear whether all the actions shown are symbols of various aspects of whaling. Until that time, it may be fun to watch the daily work of Japanese people. But later it became clear that anything that appeared on the screen was propaganda and there was no exception to the single frame. I used the word "propaganda" because the movie uses the old virtue playing equipment that "good" and "bad". Not being deduced during the operation But set in stone Maybe just me But I found that this type of art is shallow and preconceived, even though it is about the nobility's quest. When the film material is stretched out without any reason for the purpose of stretching only In my opinion, the "Drawing Restraint 9" should fit easily in 75 minutes, but with a length of torture 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there is an interesting shot. But there is not enough to let the space be empty for 15 minutes without notice This film has no standard situation and no character evolution. But not a documentary film, it is quite an installation concept That's an unusual pattern for movies. But still can be viewed as an art, although the concept is simple and innocent, like here OTOH I still believe that the director should be honest and not pretend to be able to deliver within no less than 135 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And most music scores are like whale sounds. Surprisingly, <br /> <br /> 2/10
