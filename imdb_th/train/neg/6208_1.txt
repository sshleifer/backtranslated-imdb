There is only one word for this horrible film. The director is clearly capable. But like the character of Robert Carmichael, he left it all. <br /> <br /> Carmichael has the potential. But like Cray, he can't use it. Being led into a small crime and then going down to cruelty is Cray's vision of an English youth. Like the British tabloid, this film represents young people without inspiration or respect. Cray cried out for attention, but it was not appropriate. <br /> <br /> I was shocked by the violence that Cray chose to hide in front of the audience. He considered the audience unaware of the cruelty of the world. Like obscene paintings on the bathroom wall, he showed us the decline of male sexuality and the fun of teenagers. <br /> <br /> Some quality actors have a small part in this film. Danny Dyer And Leslie Manville appeared briefly. The performance was not an amateur. The young man Joe and Ben were cringe. Carmichael was played by Daniel Spencer. Creepy Celebrity chef Jonathon (Michael Howe); The way she can control herself in pain is beyond belief. This film was never sensitive and Monica was treated for illogical violence that had been cut off from the war. War images are used to convey the idea that young men cannot help themselves. Violent acts will take place in a "civilized" country. This is absolutely true and is a symptom of our changing society. Males have less important positions. But Cray went down to the level of barbaric males he tried to reveal through the use of cruel and violent images. The female characters in the movie didn't help anything. They are both victims or in the case of Manville. The mother washes out. The community is shown to be unusual. <br /> <br /> This is Cray's first movie. I listened to what he said while asking A question and talking at Edinburugh and he wasn't smart. He lacked his experience and his movie revealed his innocence. This film will be released later this year. But I hope that the company will be truly publicly disclosed. There is no need to have such messy content.
