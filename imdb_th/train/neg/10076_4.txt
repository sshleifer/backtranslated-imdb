The light link between the film and the first Grease was created at the beginning of the film when Didi Conn, one of the four actors who played their roles, approached Maxwell Caulfield, an English exchange student. Although in the previous film, Olivia Newton St. John did not explain the form of speaking a foreign language. But explained here. Caulfield is her cousin I think she just likes to hang around Rydell High. Even though she is now a beautician, <br /> <br /> Caulfield is a smart kid, so of course the type of hat brought by Adrian Zmed makes him label a fool. And that was a particularly bad thing when Zmed's girlfriend decided that she liked Caulfield, but being a fool was not going to cut it. <br /> <br /> That's when Caulfield decided to take on the role of Zorro. New, he gets a junked bike and It back together and taught himself to ride. He wore a leather biker suit with a set of glasses to hide his face. If receiving Michelle Pheiffer not in the card, Caulfield would not have any trouble finding a friend at any gay movie bar in the way he dressed. <br /> < br>> Grease 2 introduces Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield. Both successful career paths are happy. If you see the first film of the movie Grease, much better, as you have thought, of course, this movie will happen. <br /> <br /> In addition to Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar and Dody Goodman all The professors from the original grease came back in their roles. The music score is not as far away from the original song. <br /> <br /> Not that Grease 2 is not good. It's not everything.
