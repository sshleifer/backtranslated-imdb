I saw this movie with low expectations and not disappointed. It's terrible that it's really funny in a worthwhile way. <br /> <br /> Gael is really bad. I mean, he just can't. He should give up now because the performance is not what he saw clearly .. His co-acters are equally capable. I'm sure my 5 year old cousin can work better than all of them! The director is ashamed to put his name into nonsense .. Anyhow, I don't think Oscar will be on the card for this guy. <br /> <br /> I never wrote comments about IMD, but this movie is terrible, I feel forced to do it. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, do not 0/10 if there is 0.
