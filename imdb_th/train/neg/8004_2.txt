First of all, let me say that the first 20 minutes are excellent. The monster looks very good and CGI can do it reasonably. It's a shame that the rest of the film is disappointing. <br /> <br /> ******** Spoiler below ******** <br /> <br /> From the opening scene, we can see that this movie is an American anti, usually this image will not disturb me. (We have enough food from Hollywood) But here it is not detailed about making American mentally retarded people. It passed the point of your realism and left. Wondering how Yank raped the mother. <br /> <br /> The sad scenes were really bad and part of the movie that started to fall. <br /> <br /> At Here we were introduced to the winner of the Olympic Games, Aunt and Mau, Uncle who went into memory and began to blame his father for his daughter's death. Then, press him before they start rolling. Crying on the floor The true bond is barely in crisis! <br /> <br /> All of the virus hobbies are ridiculous. If Americans know that there is no virus, why are they wasting time, money and resources in the investigation? The US government agent ordered the brains of naive Koreans to do anything that made Americans look evil (or stupid). It didn't help anything from the fact that this man was overlooked for comedy. <br /> <br / > Movie about hunting monsters Special forces of the United States and Korea have been assigned to search for life, even if they are not seen in the movie. The only one who is hunting monsters in all over Korea, is the main family and some random homeless people who appear at the end to save lives! Usually, US / Korean agents try to stop them along the way. <br /> <br /> The elder sister is included in the movie only so that she can be able to take important pictures at the end. It's a clich√©, you know it's going to happen. But to make it worse, she will use the bugger until that part! And my last annoyance, how the boy survived in the end The monster swims by the head under water for about 5 minutes! Why did the monster not eat from the first child?
