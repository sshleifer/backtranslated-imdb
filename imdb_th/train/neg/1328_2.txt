This is a very stupid movie in the 80s movie: Action movie Conceptwise. It is similar to Rush Hour but lacks laughter and chemistry action between the main characters of the film Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand and a talk show host. But he couldn't He was scary when he tried to do something difficult - he almost refused to allow the trademark to hide his face while he said that anyone who doesn't like jokes And seeing him running (Even backward) is not a satisfactory image. In addition, I have the feeling that Pat Morita - at least according to today's standards - does not give the correct political sense of Japan. Don't let me start the story even more. I give 2 out of 10
