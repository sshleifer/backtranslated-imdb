Giving the class a look at this thing in English is a bad idea. Serious and educational movies will have more impact. But it seems that this film will not have any effect in the class - whenever the teacher leaves the conversation quickly - and I don't hear the word "Shakespeare" or "Chaos" is used at all, and when you look at this, it's easy to see why. The show was nothing special - everyone seemed to be bored just by reading from the webpage without even ignoring the world. Shakespeare often likes conversations about actions and death. But I do not understand who said anything The costume is not too bad and there are no special effects - the class may not like the movie. But they didn't use p * ss, but it was difficult to play in a movie that had no inspiration or joy The scene on the boat at the beginning of the movie was not too bad - even though the rain seemed unrealistic. But everything was good and good But where the head is cut and the mast is bombed Where is death Where is the inspiration Ariel's character must be more serious if he wears clothes - but when everything appears, he is an excuse for another joke. This film does not attract any sexual interest. Women and girls will not have any love or humor and there are many naked men and lack of action or death that will make most men and boys go away. The storm didn't do well. But this gives the impression that it is something that the producers have to do, not what they want to do. And general boredom and lack of inspiration in the show 3/10
