The plot is reasonable. But boring, such as the beautiful and abandoned wife of a well-mannered and powerful man, is going forward with psychotic lumps and trying to conceal it as her mental stalk and blackmail But things that developed from there were unreasonable. Despite the resources available for general couples with money and influence But our heroes and heroines are the only people in their country, their lawyers and local police. (Which says that they can't do anything) to manage terror, they don't have personal security personnel (There are only fancy security systems that they make mistakes), home or office staff, drivers, etc. Not even clear that the funds for hiring a nurse 24 hours a day to take care of the hero. Injuries that threaten life by allowing men and wives to be alone and weak in their mansions Our heroines show that there is a brain of a doorknob and our hero, who behaves in a way that is not possible and the most irrational. Production is an insult to the audience who wasted time on this and the crime that lost the talent of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what they were thinking) and embarrassed for a lifetime TV for insulting the audience's intelligence Offering this tepid sale
