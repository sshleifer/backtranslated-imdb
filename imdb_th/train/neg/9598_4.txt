Robert Colomb has two regular jobs. He is known around the world as a television reporter. Taking advantage of him is a well-known full-time flirt. But equally. <br /> <br /> I saw `Vivre pour Vivre 'in English, with the name' Live for Life '. Some lives! Robert always seems to have at least three women in his life: a woman goes outside, a woman traveling and a cheating wife at home. It helps Robert to be a liar. His most useful lie is 'I will call you tomorrow' and `My work takes longer than planned '. He spends a lot of time and money on planes, trains and hotel rooms for liaison. You wonder when this guy will wear his pants. <br /> <br /> Some people may find that his life is exciting. But I think it's boring His companions, including Catherine, his wife are all attractive and desirable women. But his lifestyle is very busy and he is a scam. Do you wonder if he enjoys this story? <br /> <br /> Adding to the monotony is a lot of pictures that don't add to the plot. There are additional sections that do not have conversations or conversations in French only. We saw a documentary about war, torture and military training, alternating with live performances. When Robert's flight came back from Africa, we waited and waited for the plane to land and taxi to the airport. <br /> <br /> Annie Gerro is a great actor in this movie. She is the most interesting character and she plays for perfection. It was good to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career. I can't find any mistakes from Yves Montand's acting on moral matters. <br /> <br /> I enjoy Claude Lelouch's novel technique in the hotel room scene, the camera around the room while Robert. And his mistress arguing We watched them briefly in each round through the room. In another scene, laying on the train's sleeper car, Robert is lying on a bunk bed while his wife is below. Robert gives important wife news But miserable to his wife But we only heard a portion of it because of the impact of the train I felt that his wife couldn't absorb every word because of the shocking nature of the news. I like the exciting safari scene in Africa too. The movies of those scenes and in Amsterdam are great. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie as part of a project at the Library of Congress. I named the FIFTY project: 50 great movies that were forgotten within 50 years. As I can identify, this movie is the same as the others I've identified forty-nine, not in telecast videos or distributed in the United States since the first launch. In my opinion, it should be done again. <br /> <br />
