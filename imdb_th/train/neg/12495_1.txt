Ok i love bad horror I love the horror that is bad enough to make fun of Demonicus or House of the Dead - it's terrible to make fun. I can't cut it. <br /> <br /> It's worse. <br /> <br /> ( Spoiler - Who cares?) <br /> <br /> My friend and I sit and watch movies both and I have a lot of opinions, both in the form of "This is bad" and in the real extent of criticism. <br /> <br /> Plot (in order) - There is a man in this city. Comments below) Those who are running around and cutting their heads do this for over a year. (I will not go back to find the exact number - thank you very much). May be two or three years. One head per week And the police are calling "Expert" (once referring to himself as a psychic But that never happened again) <br /> <br /> Schya Yes! The Fed has been following what has been linked to the murder three times? After hundreds of similar killings, we will be under a terrible martial law !!!!!> <br /> <br /> However, this "expert" advises the voodoo chicks that the police are not interested all the time. And both Their arrival came to the conclusion that it was Baron Samedi. The Voodoo spirit cut off the head to gain enough power to turn himself into a body. (And then should be the world ruler - or maybe just going to Disneyland) <br /> <br /> Well, <br /> <br /> settings - where will this happen? If you are not from Seattle, you may not know that at the bar / fanatic (occupied by movie staff and their family members, about ten people) have posters for fun local radio stations, "Pulp Fiction" esqe dialogue box. (Eg IF) between two policemen (Yes, the person who was beheaded for about 15 minutes in the flicks) They talked about the "new field" which may still be a problem when this thing The movie was created. <br /> <br /> Come from Seattle. I'm sorry for the name of the movie and put my head in shame. <br /> <br /> OK, here is a very important point - Is a horror movie writer (not published, don't find my name on IMDb) I do research There is a lot of research. And different from the writers of this film, I know that Baron Samedi - as in Voudon Loa (soul) that protects the cemetery and has a traditional relevance. (By many Christian oppressors) and "Satan" - actually a "Loki" God. <br /> <br /> In other words, he doesn't cut his head. <br /> <br /> In addition, The important religion of Voudoun is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants. Their religious rituals are centered on the possession of various members of the congregation by Loa. <br /> <br /> Not to mention if he has someone already, why should he create a new body? <br /> <br /> If Baron Samedi had a body he would not cut his head, he would have rum and cigars and a good stamp. <br /> <br /> In summary, the only thing they can do is ( Surprised) is correct in the tarot reading. Unnecessary (Used to show that Voodoo's chicks are "scary"). They do not make the interpretation of the cards in which most movies do. I do the research again. (Everyone remembers the old-fashioned ad for reading tarot cards by phone - "Lovers - you will fall in love like crazy ..." and all this nonsense?) <br /> <br /> If you do this Through my comments, I congratulate you. And I'm sorry again I will be more sorry if you feel the need to watch movies because of me, so please don't
