I saw this movie last month by watching the free preview and I walked away. It's quite scary In the process of trying hard, they performed and made horrible movies. I was disappointed because I felt that all the actors had a respectable choice in the past, so this thing should not be beyond the mark - but I'm wrong. I will tell them not to release this movie. I was tempted by a free preview. But it turned out to be a waste of my time - and normally I was really fun. It tried to create and create with shock, ideas and filming. But since they combined many ideas at once, it failed I am usually not picky about movies and I usually don't feel the need to express my opinion about movies. But I have to warn everyone not to watch I registered in IMDb to tell you all.
