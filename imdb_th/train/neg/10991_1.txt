My brother is an avid DVD collector. He looked at the cover one time. (Two models in the bathroom) and must be added to his collection I was with him to see which movie would be the most cruel. (I use that word loosely) I feel that I need to sit through. I didn't dare to make eye contact with my brother. Of course, he had to scold the receipt in his hand. The biggest name in this film is Michael Clark Duncan, which appears in one scene. "The filmmaker" decided to show everything. (Including about four) throughout the story In fact, this movie is quite behind this set. The fact that the DVD has videos that have been deleted is a shocking thing. (I went to bed without looking at it). No wonder I found this disc without a box behind the TV about a week later.
