DRACULA 2000 is a horror film that has been screened in Sky Movies in the UK continuously, and considering that it was screened about three times a week throughout the year, I didn't know I would miss it until the first broadcast on the network. Tonight tv Seeing really, while I'm not a horror movie fan, the reason would be based on my theory that this would be a rag. My theory proved to be the most accurate. <br /> <br /> !!!!! Minor spoiler !!!!! <br /> <br /> What makes DRACULA 2000 a bad movie is the number of scripts involved. For example, in this movie, the bad guy is flying Dracula's coffin from London to America. (In a twin turbo engine, turbo engine!) And one of the bad guys was left alone in the luggage room where Dracula had lived There was a fight. There was a lot of noise. But the villain in the cockpit didn't hear the sound until the script demanded It also appears in the climax of this segment that Dracula can control the weather. But this seems to have been forgotten when the movie went on The writing of the script was sloppy and there seemed to be a problem with the structure that had scenes of many characters in the New Orleans Mardi Gras. Then, the characters that were in places such as the police station in the next scene, they would come back. At Mardi Gras, the scene after that means that the lack of credibility in the plot increases. <br /> <br /> There are some things that make my chain tamper - product placement. There are many scenes with logos for some music / retail stores in full view. I will not dare to publish the brand of the company (except to say that they are also a railway company, which is a national joke in the UK), but I feel that this type of advertising is contrary to the British broadcast approach and I am surprised. This movie, if so, <br /> <br /> There is something in DRACULA 2000 like a preview. Actually, this is a good-looking movie with good-looking actors and boys that are hot girls vampires. But it's something we should expect from Hollywood in the last few years - movies that look very good.
