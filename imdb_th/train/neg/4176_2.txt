Maybe I missed the meeting when the meaning of "Movie B" was explained, but what I just saw was ridiculous. Do you want a good summary of this movie? Take the aliens to replace Zeno Morph with vampires and take everything that is about it and it's pretty. <br /> <br /> 5 minutes in the movie "Team V-SAN" (it Is the most stupid acronym I've heard) Check the "base" that was massacred by vampires and then they climbed down (down? What?) The staircase that is clearly attached to the billboard, along with the current train that is clearly visible. When will this happen? 2210. Okay ... (Wait a minute, I'll go back there.) <br /> <br /> Yeah, the character Wow, there are Asian chick, lesbian, Token, scrambled cowboy, redneck captain German vampire weathering / Hot Topic Part time cashier All actors play without the same ambition. It almost makes me hurt. See Micheal Ironside in this flick. Did he get enough money to be Sam Fisher's voice in Splinter Cell? The only thing that is original about Vampire Wars is how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a lot of fun that I received from a weak effort. Since when touching the PCI computer card on the wall is the room ready to use on the spacecraft? The money required to make this movie may be used much better.
