This film is an attempt to present the Jared Diamonds theory of "Guns, Germs and Steel" explaining how much Europeans have power over the world. <br /> <br /> The version I saw in this documentary There are 2 sheets covering 3 hours. I think the information will be presented in 20 minutes. There is a completely useless scene: Professor Jared Diamond watching birds through binoculars. Professor Jared Diamond failed to use the bow. And the arrow correctly. Professor Jared Diamond shoots the muzzle of the muzzle badly. This documentary should create heroes from "Professor Jared Diamond" or not? This part of the documentary is very bad, can be a trick. The worst thing is when Diamond was destroyed and crying when traveling to the malaria patient department in the African hospital. This didn't help me understand his theory, "Guns, germs and steel" BTW, "Guns, Germs and Steel" are said to be about 100 times. "European guns, germs and steel will help them escape from the situation Can this be bad? Finally, when he did business, his theory had the most interesting and boring part. Europeans conquered the natives of other lands because they had good guns and blades with stones and wooden weapons. Do I need a professor to convince me about this? Various parts of his theory that explain that Europeans have an advantage that makes the conquest interesting. But the news report is some paper. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think the documentary is just trying. Convince me that non-European people are equal to Europeans If I am not a racist, I know this. If I am a racist, Jared Diamond will not induce me to use his native tools. <br /> <br /> I don't think adults are viewers who intend to do this documentary. Children may enjoy more things than me. I have already read that this book is a much better documentary.
