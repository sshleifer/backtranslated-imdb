It's hard to add comments after reading what is already available here. But I feel that I have to say something I'm not looking for 'a splatterfest' for sure because someone has placed it or even 'Blood and courage / blood' I have respect for the victims' relatives, even though I can't really feel like a filmmaker - they are nameless, faceless and meaningless. Just a boat for Dahmers sex comedy. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with curiosity that made me think. 'What makes men become serial killers', including the specific doubts about the Dahmer story, which I know very little. People here seem to think that this film does not cover the story of Dahmer .. I.E. What was his history when he was arrested as a result? But it's very important! You see, I think if you are an American, you know all this. We are not all in America. To tell the story about this man, as he wanted, clearly that at least some of the history and actual events will tell / show this. It does not mean blood and courage. There is a way to show things. Scary in an implied movie or a clever filming without having to turn to attention Without having to touch what he did (I found more information about him, read user comments on this website!) The movie felt like a void. A moment in time with very little substance I would like to know if there is a movie about REAL Dahmer because there is no direction, very slow pace that has never changed the strange image of homosexuality and the misfortune that is lacking in the end. I will not recommend to anyone that they waste time watching the course. 1 out of 10 (for performances!)
