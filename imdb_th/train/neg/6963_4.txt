Japanese people are incredibly ambitious in their fantasy movies. They are ready to destroy the city by large plastic monsters that come from space and elsewhere. The problem is that they never have the money to succeed in creating reliable special techniques This film was released in France under the name Les envahisseurs de l'espace. There are no exceptions. Its ambition is to show three living things from a giant octopus to a giant lobster that tries to have a human upper part. It's very awkward and laughing. But also fun Finally, we like these creatures and all these movies, right?
