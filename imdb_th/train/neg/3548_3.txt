For movie enthusiasts with lazy characters and bad stories, this is for you! From the cold atmosphere in New York City, which became a scary and hopeless place, until the characters brought two people who were immensely immoral, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> Why can it be? Received an Oscar because it was so shocking at that time that the new Hollywood brand of freedom to express what it wanted with all abandoned morals wanted to celebrate that truth. The filmmaker is like a six year old child who doesn't have an expense account at a local candy shop. Hollywood to the theater audience (For the first time) the amount of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homelessness and other great attractions and sounds like a distorted brain only work. <br /> <br /> Hope to impress the main audience. It achieved that level. The audience was stunned by what they said and heard, and the institution was proud of the ability to show dirt and make money at the same time. But to honor this waste. <br /> <br Forty years ago, as a young man, I found that the film was charming as well However, seeing it again in 1990 made the taste worse in my mouth. I never watched it again. <br /> <br /> The performance was good. But what? Performances performed well in many movies. No one talks about Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight. Hoffman is a good person, especially during his childhood. He is like Johnny Depp in his era, playing the role of "Ratso Rizzo" in this movie and will be "Rain Man" later. Yes, "Ratso" is a character that you will never forget and "Joe Buck "(Voight) is something you want to forget. But the story is terrible. It's a good show. <br /> <br /> This movie is not "art" and it's not worthy of many awards. It only pushed the big envelope in 1969, and that's why it is remembered by the love of the hearts of people in movies and critics. For two hours of vulgarity and great price, religious cheapness, glorifying strangers (Andy Warhol, even though he was not surprised) and the nasty people in general. <br /> <br /> I like music. The ears "everyone's speech ' "Harry Nilsson helped make famous. But even though it was a hoax because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang better than before, Neilson did it .... and there were a few people who had heard Neil and - as mentioned - The name "Ratso Rizzo", being with you <br /> <br /> This movie is an important place. But in negative terms, I am afraid: this thing is said to be "official" that Hollywood has in the bathroom and it is still in the drain since
