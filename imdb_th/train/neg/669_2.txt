I am a person who always expresses my opinion. But I just came back from this movie and felt the need to comment Let me start by saying that I'm a horror fan. But what makes horror movies I'm sure that I want to see even less of a good script and character development. I know that they are often lacking in horror movies, but the Prom Night seems like it doesn't take any effort in that department. We all love anxiously. At the edge of your seat with an unpredictable surprise. Yes, Prom Night doesn't have that! Of course, we like the horrific killer. Prom Night is there? Nope has a cute boy with a cute Lil 'knife and when everything fails ... at least the horror is pleased with the guilt Make it fun like blood, gore and occasional nude scenes! Yes, when you have a horror movie, rated PG-13, like the Prom Night, they release it as well. So when these elements disappeared, I asked .... Is this still a horror movie? Nope, I'll call it more funny. People in my theater laughed a lot more when they saw "Semi-Pro" that should be really funny (which sucked, but that's another story!) I thought I had to give up on New horror A good horror movie every day of the good old days has been rearranged into garbage so that the movie studio can make money. People I watch with don't know that this is a remake! Which makes me crazy! I wonder what happens when there are no movies to create anymore ??? Where will the horror movie go? ???
