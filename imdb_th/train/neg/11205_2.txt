Yes, I am absolutely sorry for the Saturday night break, watching this strange little movie, but very long. Clearly, the main character didn't steal my life for two hours. This is a clear example of an antihero. In 'No regrets', we are disturbed, confused, lost, selfish, pointless, and do not like it. It's very difficult to pass this place to get the new son who is strengthening Jaemin unless That it will attract attention He claims to be something else that is love. But after watching this thing, it's like Charles Manson who loves because you dig a beard. (Okay, he's not that bad. But there is still no real redemption.) I can't get past the reason that Sumin's Sumin is endless. It has never been shown just saying that Jaemin loves Sumin. Maybe it's a culture that flies over me: madness / stalking = mad love in Seoul. It must be due to more than half the movie. This is one of the other traces and the last part is manipulation to the point where I think this is a joke. I waited for a tiger named "baby" to create a look. Okay, so Sumin worked for two jobs while going to school until now. It's good for people who try to make themselves better. But after he had tasted the interest of Stalker for the first time, what was his day off with the prostitution ring? OK, as already mentioned, passion doesn't stop due to work / career changes and if you throw a lot of angry characters into the movie, you will get one incredible movie. Basic movies are not 100% scary, but you can do better with foreign gay movies.
