Slash the temple for a few days, so when I hear about Cut, I have high hopes and hear good things about it. Those good things that I heard were all wrong. This flick is bad and I mean bad. It's just plain stupid. It's all about it. Especially the origin of the killer and the way in which he is still alive and how he is eventually cared for Nothing original or striking about this flick. Just another person who warns "hip" "Those who know themselves" characters "understand the movie" I'm tired of that shit. There are people who do different things because the type of shear really needs new blood.
