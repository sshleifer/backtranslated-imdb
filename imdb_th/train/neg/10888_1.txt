This movie is extremely scary. One of the worst movies I've ever seen That story doesn't exist. The characters are full of patterns and Special-FX makes you laugh only. The only amazing thing about this movie is the presence of Rapper Coolio guest as a police officer. <br /> <br /> If this movie should be a comedy If you want to watch this movie: Please be drunk first and get ready for laughter ... especially when the first Special-FX appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> But if you like the junk movies created Up at a cheap price: This movie is something that shouldn't be missed for you.
