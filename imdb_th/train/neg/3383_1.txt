I saw live music for the first time at the Denver Performing Arts Center and it was incredibly incredible and had continuity in planning and dialogue that I liked more than the musicals I saw on stage The interesting thing is that you don't have to see Zach's face. He is always in the dark. But his presence is powerful and directs the direction of all production When I heard that they were making a movie, then I waited with less breath. But when I watched this movie, I was so disappointed that I felt cheated. The movie lacks an attractive mood to produce fresh and never makes you close to all the characters. Personally, I want to see the live version again and if it should be refreshed again, I suggest you go out of the way to see it. It will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy.
