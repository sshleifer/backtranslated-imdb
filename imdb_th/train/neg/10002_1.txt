Sorry everyone, I know that this should be a "art" movie, but wow, they should send a gun to screen the movie so people can blow their brains Although the scene design and shooting direction are excellent But this story is too painful to watch The lack of a sound track is cruel. Loooonnnnng too long. How long can you watch two people sitting there and talking? Especially when the conversation is about two people complaining I have a difficult time just through this movie. The performance was excellent. But you can get dark, dark, dark, nothing? The only thing I like is Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dance scene. Otherwise, this is a shortcut for Bergman and I am not a fan of him as well. I think everyone who says that they enjoy this 1 1/2 hour is a lie.
