The rich, about 1,800 stupid people want to go to a nearby mental hospital to see how a famous doctor cares about his patients. Despite the unfriendly retaliation, initially he was invited to see a good doctor. And while the doctor showed him, he spoke and talked and talked !!! And while he said that the madman ran rampant here and did nothing, especially production While there are some actions here and there (And some things are quite disturbing) It's amazing, boring and whole-brainy - Lack of life and energy, which is strange for a horror flick. Even those who think he is a chicken and dress like anyone The next trip will make the guests more chaotic until you finally realize that the inmates have entered the hospital and tortured the caregivers. This movie is amazingly lively in many places - especially when it moves very slowly due to strange occurrences or people are obsessed with this scene. Only when the workers from the hospital found in the cell were starving, this movie had a real impact. Considering this plot, it's hard to imagine how to make it boring. But the person who created this movie was exploited! Now with the plot and writing that is capable of acting and direction, this COULD is an interesting and worthwhile movie. <br /> <br /> Now I know that this is a plot. From the original "Star Trek" TV show! Did you know that those who have "Lord Garth - Master of the Universe" and Kirk and Spock are taken prisoner by his crazy and mad followers? <br /> <br /> Last record: this movie is quite Nude here and there and including rape scenes, so please be warned in advance - not for children In fact, considering that this film is worthless, it's not for anyone! However, with the models included in the "50 Movie Pack - Chilling Classics", typing is incredibly bad, so it's hard to see all of this because the print is very dark.
