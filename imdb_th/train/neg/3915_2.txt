This film is not only But not only writing and directing But still extremely disgusting A beautiful novel has a huge distortion in this film. There are many changes in the story which are expected to improve the time frame. But what caused confusion The acting cannot overcome the script that eliminates the character's motivation for their behavior. In addition, conversions in English do not work when everyone refers to the elderly. EsTEban is an awesome ESteban. Please, please read the beautiful novels in Spanish if possible Didn't see this movie It will destroy you in what could be a wonderful experience.
