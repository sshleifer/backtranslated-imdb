I saw the movie last night at home. But I think it is too long before Secondly, what I saw in this movie was more than I could think of in the things that I thought would be funny movies like the rest. Things that are not funny in the movie: fianc√©e beats his girlfriend dancing This film is too long - talk about the need to go to bed and wonder if it will end when you wake up and continue to play! Some things gathered together were more than enough to catch - like the singing of women - I felt like I was watching a spiritual performance here! Come to Perry, you can do better!
