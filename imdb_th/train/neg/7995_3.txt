I remember watching this movie when I was young. But can't remember the title and watch the horror movie that I found and thought to myself "That is the title." This film is a film that combines the catastrophe / movie, attacking insects with fewer stars in it. It is also quite boring because it has the feeling that you can watch this movie disappear for advertisements and others. The story has this type of resort that has been invaded by ants. I think they are a little disturbed by the construction or something that happens nearby. But don't claim that The most memorable ants for me in the whole flick is the first thing that involves a child falling into the pool after being besieged, and of course the summer has an attack scene as well. What is outstanding now is the stupid ending that the survivors use cardboard tubes to breathe. Ultimately, although most television movies, this movie is very tame and not scary, at least in the event that you don't have to be shocked when you see the ants.
