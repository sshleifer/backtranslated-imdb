Why is this item so popular? It's beyond me, why people like it. I think this is one of the worst sitcoms. <br /> <br /> Because it's very popular, I tried more than once to see it and I couldn't do it all the time. For one thing, acting is scary. Everyone is doing a lot to the point where it's annoying to watch. They speak with unnatural sounds, use strange sounds and have unnatural body language. I saw performances in kindergarten better. <br /> <br /> For other things, it's not a joke. Boring conversion They do not have creativity, clever or funny. Com, not funny, right? Why don't I laugh? <br /> <br /> What's the seventy in the end? It's about authenticity in the era of "Happy Days" to the 50s. <br /> <br /> Oh and what will happen to Ashton Kutcher? Who made this dweeb that is not patented? And now he is making a movie ?? Oh, help us all. <br /> <br /> If people think this is a quality television
