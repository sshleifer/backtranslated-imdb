This list is not as good as laughing. Writing is sucked. The dialog is sucked. Men who play as Craig cannot leave paper sacks. On Thursday night it was great to watch with beer. Cool music, bad performances, bad writing all come together for my enjoyment. <br /> <br /> It's an unintended drama / comedy. I don't care what happens to one of the characters. They are boring and silly. The first five were the worst because they could not reveal who was the victim. They had to write the conversation around which was very scary. I mean the praise at the funeral is ridiculous. In fact, all the scenes that are happening today are the most scary. <br /> <br /> So, let's review it. Everything that happens at the present time is sucked. In the past, only the writing of the dialogue and acting of Craig sucked. Ruled music though
