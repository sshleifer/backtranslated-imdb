This is the only movie I have ever seen that was created by Uwe Boll. I know that he may be the worst director to ever make a movie from a video game. I still want to watch it because I am a big fan of the game and I want to see which movies of the series make it terrible. After watching it, I admit that it is nonsense. The movie does not matter in the first 15-20 minutes. There is nothing but a teenage girl without a brain. (At that time, I wondered whether the zombies were dead or not, or were they?) At night, zombies emerged from where & started to attack people. Later, a woman started shooting them. Then every 5 minutes should it be a joke? Or both? Before I knew I slept in the second half and woke up at the end of the credit, so I couldn't see all that was a good thing! This film is a real insult to the classic Uwe Boll game. Please do not create a movie anymore. Thank you!
