I felt it was my duty as a horror movie lover to warm others about this terrible and terrible "horror" movie. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. Bad performances The story is just one of the worst things I've ever encountered and the script is terrible. There's nothing about this. You think to yourself why I watch this shit. This plot has a lot of holes and they never get rid of. At the end, it's terrible. I don't know how to make a horrible movie. As I said before I loved horror and I was disappointed, it was 18. But you saw little blood and no fear or jump. The thing that bothered me was the stupid thing that happened in this movie that didn't point to the story like a brother and sister. Why kiss each other? Is all I can say Just don't bother having more horror movies than that. Don't waste your life too short.
