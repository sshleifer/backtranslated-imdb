This week, I just thought it would be fun to follow Corey Haim, who had just watched two movies "Lost Boys" last week and everything. Not that I'm a fan - not far away - but I like these two Coreys in some movies during early teens. <br /> <br /> So I prepared for three movies starring him. Unfortunately I chose "Dream Machine" for the first time (never seen before) and it was so scary. I just decided to lock Corey back into my closet and let him sober again before me. Will appear in his other things, but I struggled through this movie first I have a feeling that it wants to play in the same league as "Ferris Bueller's holiday" (1986), but was caught up in his own delusions. Ended The only good thing about "Dream Machine" is evidence: bodies in the trunk of Porsche. All the rest failed badly. It's embarrassing. Even the most for Haim I can dig him as a child with enthusiasm. But at least when he came up with some guidelines Obviously not in the Dream Machine, so we have the perfect car. Yes, Porsche. Black, Haim's perfect girlfriend? Just a blonde chicks that hardly have any strings in the movie. Perfect murder ... almost? Some friends who fell on his ass as the villain of the movie tried both movies to steal the body back from the chest. Never really succeeded. At the end of the movie he thought he was Michael. Ersk Shatner's mask) and Corey Haim's mistakes for Jamie Lee Curtis Don't think that they can make this kind of animal film if they try. A stupid and ruthless movie with stories directed to directing by directors who don't know how to direct his performance. Great success! <br /> <br /> One last question for Haim: Who's the idea is to give you a smile directly to the camera in the last picture of this movie? Are you or the director? So don't do
