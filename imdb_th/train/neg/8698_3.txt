Ok, I remember watching the first time and the boy sucked it. After watching, I laughed and told myself that "Oh, little boy, movie B, another low price. I won't see the second episode of this story." It sucks more But I just laughed again and said "There is no way I can see the 3rd part of this" then about 1/2 years later, part 3 came out. God, I never knew how much movies can suck today. Just save yourself $ 7.50 and don't rent the whole set. Trust me, it's worth every penny.
