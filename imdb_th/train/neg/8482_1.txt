Some of my old friends recommended me to watch this movie. But I have a chance soon I cannot understand what is the message except the revenge of Hinduism. I am like many types of religion. But I feel that Kamal Hasan is a person with a low personality in dressing up like this. He should have created more horror movies than crap. He tried to increase the type of Hollywood virus and God forbid him not to convert the man to mutate and eventually to take over the world. This is a movie that is suitable for schools, movies and is normal. The disgrace for him that does not depend on the ability he has. The story begins with Chaos borrowing ideas from Butterfly effects. Then, during a little religious reconciliation at the expense of insulting Hinduism (Again, I insulted more Hindus This film is about intelligence)
