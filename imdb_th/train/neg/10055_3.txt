I grew up in the drama version of 'Superman II' ("S2T") and as a child I love it more than when I was because not only But there are only Superman characters and three villains? The ultimate Clark Kent to Superman and the scene of helping children, no longer having to wait for Superman to be anxiously appearing on the screen. In Episode 1, now, as an adult, I can see how great How can I fall with the S2T? (See: My review) I've always heard about the latter. Stories about the way they did, Richard Donner, the original director from the second episode (It must be a rarity after that, in the filming of two movies at the same time. It is now common: 'Back to the Future' and 'Matrix' 2 & 3, etc.) Unfortunately after finally seeing Richard Donner Cut (or "S2RD") I still can't fully recommend. Gone is a wonderful Superman change scene. All of Paris's help, as well as the great summary of Region I in the S2T debut, in fact. May All of them But wrote the words: "Previously about Superman ??" In S2RD, special effects are not great either in my part or S2T. But most S2RD are they laughing seriously? For example, Lois fell from the Daily Planet window. I would accept some new scenes to work, and some people came out to welcome departure, such as any scene in the "Honeymoon series". Overall, if you grow in the S2T like I do. And love it when the child is not nitpicking. As I do as an adult, you should definitely see S2RD because it's a new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler notification) Unfortunately, the worst change occurred when: lost. It's a strange memory from the S2T that was replaced with the ending like 'I.' This is not just Copout. Lazy and unfounded But there is no reason why Clark returned to that restaurant if those events hadn't actually happened and he would "go back in time" to every encounter?
