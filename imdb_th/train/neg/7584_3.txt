I just saw the Broadway revival of "Blithe Spirit" starring Angela Lansbury, Rupert Everett, Christine Ebersole and Jayne Atkinson. It is a great work and shows that a good actor can play anything perfectly. Angela Lansbury is an extremely funny person as Madame Arkati. <br /> <br /> It may be a mistake to check the movie version of the drama starring Rex Harrison. The movie has no energy or laughter from Create a scene <br /> <br /> "Blithe Spirit" seems to be one of those plays that works better with live actors in an audience full of people who have laughs. Come to experience and differentiate the performances and plays, and relate to the audience at a personal level that you cannot enter the cinema or show the DVD, which the audience separated from the story by "The Fourth Wall". Condomine (Rex Harrison) A successful writer lives with his wife Ruth (Constance Cummings) in a country house in England. Find information for his next book, a book related to supernatural things. Charles invites Madame Arkati. (Margaret Rutherford reprising her role from London production in 1941) Local spiritual medium Charles believes that demonism is a hoax. But hope to get "Techniques of trading" but then Madame Arkati brought the ghost of Elvira back. (Kay Hammond) Charles's first wife, who died of pneumonia seven years ago. Elvira refused to leave and develop an opponent with Ruth over Charles (complicated by the fact that there was Just Charles who can see or hear Elvira) <br /> <br /> On the stage, the actors can give a laughing act in this situation. But on the screen, the actors in "Blithe Spirit" Tearing down the line as if they didn't know anyone was listening He is They muttered a line designed to laugh on the stage. The performances of Harrison Cummings and even Kay Hammond were simple and lifeless. Only Margaret Rutherford seemed to still maintain her sparkle and humor as Madame Arkati. <Br /> <br /> The award-winning visual effects in this film are not impressive - not just the standard of today. They mostly consist of Kaye Hammond that walks around in a glowing green dress and makeup is photographed in a special light to make her look like a glowing ghost. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers deserve credit. For light creation But comparing the boring visual effects of "Blithe Spirit" with the truly innovative effects in Disney's "Song of the South" - which is eligible to receive the prize in the same year in "Under" human and animated characters share the screen smoothly in several minutes. Compared to "South", the Oscars that "Blithe Spirit" received for that special effect were completely unreasonable. <br /> <br /> In any way, I suggest you watch Revive Broadway of this drama with Angela Lansbury. Before closing it for Rex Harrison, skip it.
