I tried to watch this movie in the barracks during my overseas missions and let me tell you what you will look under those circumstances. Not this piece of sh * t. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes set the tone by showing weak porn movies, plot quality, strange stories, blue and unbelievable situations and behaviors. It got worse after that. This film has no single saving grace. But it's not bad in a way that makes it funny It was really scary. I have seen many movies in my life and I am not one of the snobby critics who know the whole thing. I mean, I will enjoy most movies to some degree, even if they are not good. <br /> <br /> Steer _well_ clear this story, my friend
