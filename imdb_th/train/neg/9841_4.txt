I really want to like Julian Po. I think the Slater is lower as an actor and a lot of supporting players here, better than they have been given the opportunity to perform in this movie. I know this is a short story that I haven't read. So I do not know what I saw as a mistake in the movie that originated from the story, or was determined by the director / screenwriter. The location is fantastic and I love the voice-overs as confessions in open lectures But then...? Nothing! Many local characters ask Julian pointblank to explain his intention to kill himself. Everyone argues that he doesn't answer because it's not about business. But Julian was a person under the pressure of Token, blurting his intentions to the public. Then, both Julian and the director / author, despite the fact that Julian's characters kept daily records for the sake of God, seems to give anything other than the initial information in Julian's life. He said he was an accountant. He said that his family moved around when he was a child because of his father's work. What, then, had many interactions with the local people that seemed to have been designed for Julian's purposes. But none of them went anywhere because Julian looked like people in these communities looked as if they were aliens from other planets, as if they were the most intelligent people. This may be used as a comparison symbol if Julian Po has characteristics, assignments, or anything that approaches wisdom to convey The closest thing he will reveal about himself is in the scene in which he deliberately sells his innocent and religious wife. And what this scene shows is that there is nothing that will inspire Julian. I see only Julian's character - as selfish, petty, and totally posing. The type of movie that matches the attitude of the film director who is manipulated. And Michael Park, the poor, many promising actors, didn't receive anything here.
