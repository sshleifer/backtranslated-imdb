Guy Ritchie's lofty efforts were beaten, raped, kicked around, stabbed, pierced, spit, punched, sodomized and abused. Her performance is reminiscent of Al Gore's drama and public speaking graduates. Guy Ritchie strives to do this new thing and if you separate all the scenes that his wife is in The best movie I think the best acting job is to be a man who comforted his wife that her performance was good enough to not be filmed again. If you have a chance to see Swept Away or cut your toenails for 89 minutes ... go for a long pedicure.
