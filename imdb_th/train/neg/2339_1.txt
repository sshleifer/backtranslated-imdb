This turbulent movie looks like a mix between MTV music clips rather than real movies. There is no real story and when the movie asks you: "What will happen?"; But nothing happened. The frustrating story of Eric Cloeck is a good thing. Others seem to have nothing in common: then why bring them together in the movie With music, you can create the worst movie. When I opened the tap and had the water flowing out with Bach's music, most people would like to see it. But this is not a movie The director should learn how to write a script for the movie for 100 minutes or more before starting to direct the movie.
