This movie is a joke and Quins should be ashamed of himself trying to pass this issue as Modesty Blaise Film. If you are having trouble sleeping, that means renting this movie. The sticks they call the actress should be Modesty Blaise. Must be the most boring person in the world. Maybe she was used as a hat, standing in the back of the real movie, nothing in twenty-five minutes. Thanks to those who had invented the fast forward button. If you see this movie, if you can call it coming up in your own way, RUN I can't help thinking of the 3rd world that can use the money lost from this shit. This movie is boring, boring actors lose color, breathe if you want to see Mostey Blaise Film. Watch the movies they did in the 60s. Maybe the director should do it.
