The third episode of the "Carnosaur" trilogy consists of a quality military commando, Keystone Kops, trying to kill two Velociraptors and two T-Rex sets. I give 4 my sympathy and relationship with the dinosaurs. This movie is definitely the worst ending. It can't be serious. However, more important is watching this movie. I can't help but notice the similarities between "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" trilogies. The first installment in both franchises is a dark and annoying movie that turns out. Is a classic cult. The second film is the movie "Alien" and the third film is a movie that looks like a cheek tongue. You rolling with the floor, laughing. Like the "Xtro" franchise, all movies "Carnosaur" are completely unrelated. They used the franchise name only to hit the drums. Interested in "sequels", I guess clearly "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" have two groups of producers working here. But if you've watched all three films of both franchises, you'll find yourself talking about it.
