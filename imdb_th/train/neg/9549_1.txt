I wonder why John Wood doesn't play Dr. Falken until I watched the movie BAD plot. Bad science, bad performances and overall a bad movie. Please do not watch this movie. Rent a traditional "war game". If you feel nostalgic, <br /> <br /> I don't like the curves of plans to overcome the thoughts that threaten terrorists In the first movie, W.O.P.R was created because Russia had 1,000 warheads pointing to the United States. In this movie, the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorists in training before becoming a threat. Politics One of the good things about the first movie is to emphasize that even stupid computers can finally understand the pointless thoughts of war. No such insights are presented in this film.
