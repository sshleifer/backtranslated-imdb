What do you say about this movie? It's not scary But it's not good! Two days ago I watched the Lillies and that was one of the best gay movies I've ever seen. So this is not the best time to see a normal Gay flick. <br /> <br /> The story is stupid and the performance is ok It's not bad enough to close. But it has a bad time and has a very bad map It didn't come out well. <br /> <br /> Would I like to recommend this movie? No, you will waste your time and money. I do not understand why this movie happened and who raised funds. Spend your time watching Arkah on the logo instead. I think this is where this movie tries to go. But never go there
