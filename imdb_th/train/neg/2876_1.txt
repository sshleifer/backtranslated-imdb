I asked the motivator of the creator of this character about the motivation of the killer. BTK, are they trying to show the animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who is responsible for this? Do they not think that the people involved in this monster are harming the body? It's a disrespect and exploitation of the victim! It's like a personality experiment: What bother you more than a slaughterhouse or human murder? They use the real names of some victims .... This film is disgusting, insulting and insulting! The creator of this film uses this tragedy as their own agenda! People have to wake up and draw again!
