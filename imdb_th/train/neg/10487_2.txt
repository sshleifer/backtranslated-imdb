Oh God! The only reason I gave this movie to 2 instead of 1 is because Tom Hanks is a funny person like Elvis in the box. In addition, the right contract for this half to do lame movies? Maybe it was a good idea at that time ... There was no laughter to talk about. The pathetic pathetic, the actors would lose direction. Now I miss it. Most of the offenses should be with director Joel Zwick. He didn't show anything except the show from everyone involved. Don't waste my time. But then I enjoyed the good train wreck. Geez. Now the system is telling me that I want more rows - let's go: this movie should be called Return to Sender. .
