I think this is one of the most depressing holiday movies I've ever seen - other films are THE Christmas WIFE and JACK FROST. All three films about death. If you want to be thoroughly depressed by all watching this movie or others in this movie, the performance is good and has some scenery. (Apart from the dead) is cute, but I am worried that people with depression in the hospital may watch the movie accidentally and do it themselves! Even though there is a "happy ending", the majority of the film is another great disaster. And for some crazy reason, I do not want to regret when I watch Christmas movies (I know this sounds crazy - after all, doesn't disturb your eyes?). <br /> <br /> For a higher viewing experience, try a forgotten house without a Christmas tree, a Christmas tree. Of George C. Scott or CAROL Christmas
