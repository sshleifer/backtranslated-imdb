I must say that I was quite disappointed with this "horror" movie. I wasn't even scared once while watching it. Also, there is no doubt too much .... I can guess at the end of the half of the movie ... so .. there is nothing left . I hope other movies will stop copying. (Eg trademark: long hair) please give me initiative. <br /> <br /> will not recommend this movie
