There are some movies that you just know that they're going to get worse from one frame. Even if you have forgotten all of Edwood's work, everyone is looking at that reviewer from "Plan 9 from Space" and you know that you won't see the next movie masterpiece. As such, when I saw the first shot of the Uwe Bolls masterpiece "House of Dead" with that man sitting at the front of the house, started his advice while trying hard to listen. Sin City m for trekking. <br /> <br /> So the movie started like this - the lead character first said that everyone was dying. You know that will make you lost. Then he began to introduce the remaining characters with the script, such as "Karma .. think she is Foxy Brown" or "Alicia..my ex .. We just broke up recently .. I have to study and she must close Block "No, I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a group of 20 people who can't get out of the wet paper bag is going to the" Rave of the century ". Port and low platform located on a small island in the Pacific Ocean Our gang missed the ferry. But fortunately looking for a way to get there, the way to be a fishing boat operated by Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Do you understand any man who wrote this script as a genius) and his best friend who is an illegitimate child of Simpsons' Cpt McAllister and a hook killer who knows what you did last summer? <br /> <br /> To make the short story shorter, the gang came to the island to find someone, except for a thin t-shirt and blood. Then decided to expel the hell from there. No need to wait for them. Actually, they are happy and like drinking free alcohol. <br /> <br /> With the scenes that hit the movie at the bottom, then compare with all the odds to continue down. Some men in the rubber suit began to run around, screaming and shooting us to the house to meet other gangs. They went out of the house, met with Cpt Kirk and the female police (between them, about 500 pounds of weapons). And decided to go back home Somewhere along the line they changed to S.W.A.T. The team entered the matrix. The rubber sets began to multiply like bacteria and I started to cry because I paid to see this. To increase insult to injury every few minutes with images from video games, this shit is based on and has a cute game editing scene for a few characters when they die. <br /> <br /> I hate. This movie is serious. It is not suitable for the category. "Very bad. It's good." Famous. It's not good at all. The script is bad, the zombies are terrible, no tension, bad lines, bad actors .. The list continues. <br /> <br /> You might want to Watch this movie because of it The reputation of being scary is not a bad movie that should be viewed. This is not one of them.
