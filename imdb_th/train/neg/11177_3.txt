In what seems like the longest 1 hour 35, I have to endure for a long time. Al Pacino delivers a precise performance to make sure Not his usual typing, which is good But his character is really pathetic There are poor people as he stumbles upon forgotten appointments when we realize that Hollywood social life gives him life energy. But in this movie, we need someone to like And for some reason all the characters in the picture say "I don't know why I like" Eli "to Al Pacino's cunning and I can't come near him. <br /> <br /> Other actors play the usual style. Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff and Bill Nunn did nothing to change their accepted personalities that developed on TV or in previous movies. And Kim Basinger is not in this movie long enough to deliver all the performances. <br /> <br /> The story of this film is not driven Most scenes never drive the story forward. But just collecting facts about the characters that later came to play in the ending that was against the climax It has the potential, except the unwillingness to extend the story. <br /> What is the point of this movie? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz will make you believe that "When Hollywood has you, you can't go out." Yeah! And that's why many people are fired in Hollywood
