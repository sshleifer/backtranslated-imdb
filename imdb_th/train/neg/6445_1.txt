When evaluating a documentary that focuses on a group of small, right-wing, ugly and conservative groups like this in the United States, you must consider the following: The United States has a population of 270 million and has a complex history as a preferred democracy and hope and desire to preserve human rights as a failure and disadvantage. It is expected that, of course, the extreme right wing groups and the most conservative groups are very special. But relative to the size of the population that is small and isolated Based on the population, Europe, the UK and Australia have similar right-wing groups, in fact, on a per capita basis. The actual size of neo-Nazi groups in Australia is actually much higher than in the United States. It is the reason mentioned above that it is not fair to make Americans despise and comment on American society with fraudulent education and fraud. This group represents the American society. By doing this, Greenstreet deliberately chose a small and lonely group at the opposite end of the spectrum to create the image of America, which is a deliberate and scandalous lie. This film is clearly designed to infuriate and distract the view of people hidden in the subconscious and the hatred of the American people and the way of life under the guise of popular ideals. This film was created for profit, not to promote the truth about American society and human condition. Green Street can create a documentary that focuses on the right wing collusion, especially the military industry. But failed miserably to present intelligent and balanced discussions The film was revealed to be against America with support for this trash. SENSATIONALISM That is against the worst USS garbage
