I don't think I've ever felt this way before from movies. After I loved Guy Ritchie's previous two movies (I didn't count Swept Away - he was a blind pussy). I'm looking forward to seeing this. <br /> <br /> The bad comments then again. Do not trust the media at all The more worrying thing is the fact that the internet has rumors that this is a little foul smell, so with concern, I delivered Â£ 4.80 yesterday afternoon. <br /> <br /> I won't try. In order to explain this movie, mostly because I still don't know what happened and at one point I was close to standing up and asking if it was just me that didn't understand at all! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think Ritchie seems to fall into the trap of his wife who takes himself too far seriously. It seems that it's not good enough for him to make a movie that Well, the character. It's almost as though he had a checklist of movies he wanted to fraud. Here are some that I noticed: The Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, the usual suspects, Vanilla Sky. . <br /> <br /> I think The most frustrating thing is the performance from the two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta. Very good. In fact, it is really a self-indulgent story. The big one came down from me.
