No doubt that this is the worst thing I've ever spent. I feel dirty, accepting that I rent this movie and pay to watch it. This does not rank the trash. No, not. This is the juice that is collected at the bottom of the industrial trash, located in a foul neighborhood, especially after a special humid summer. If you want to call the trash, it will reduce the amount of waste everywhere. It's terrible that I feel I have to register at IMDb and remind my friends. This luvahire character claims that this movie is very good. We have to question his truth. We come to see his opinions and analyze them. <br /> <br /> "The actor who plays Ricky (I forgot his name). Works very well. "<br /> <br /> I see if the director imagines his audience, flattering and meticulous in every sentence that Ricky said or alternately laughs at. Unable to control at a time when most directors want more nondescript reactions from the audience. Ricky works well. <br /> <br /> "I am an actor who needs a character at the school. Me and I have to play where I am. Crying and it is not easy to be emotional in the scene so I give the props to the actors who have to do the emotional scene and can pull it out. "<br /> <br /> Wow, I have to give the props to the actors who can pull out the emotions. Luvahire Might want to look at other work lines that have friends if you think that these chuckleheads pull out Even so, they can help you if you want to train to cry. <br /> <br /> "BRING ON THE SEQUEL" <br /> <br /> If I was a drama teacher at school, I would make you fail from this comment alone. <br /> <br /> I'm tired of continuing Now I will flip the movie that beat my colleague, Bangla. <br /> <br /> Howdy! If you continue to read this book, I agree that you have watched the movie and you are now looking for one of the two things in this comment: 1) The reduction in receiving more comments from what you see are Very poor movie 2) Additional sulfuric acid reduction of what you feel is a good film effort that requires protection from defamation as well as yourself. Whether you need clear help in disgust or ammunition for an exciting response, if I say something good, it will only disappoint you - so let me assure you that there is a little disappointment. <br /> <br / > Other negative comments here at IMDb have identified the failure of the movie. (Such as acting, soundtrack, director, dialogue, editing, etc.) However, all these mistakes Can be forgiven on its own There are only a few people who will rent the movie "Hood of the Living Dead" if they want these elements to be the best. However, the final failure of "Hood" is a failure to deliver a promise that has a lot of "Hood of the Dead Dead" names leaping from the shelves at the video store. liners-liners That mourns and gruesome creations This is an opportunity to blend the blood of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto so that there will be zombies, thugs, thugs, zombies, bombs in innocent lives, while rockings make rags. Lice that are too insidious to ride that trick. The combination of both types can be a joke. But the movie is like watching the children in high school deliver the plays they are performing, but don't understand. To avoid feeling betrayed in the audience of their rental videos, I recommend the Quiroz brothers to publish new movies. With the following new names: "Hood of the Living Dead: The Horror Videos Do We Shoot A video camera with some friends over the past weekend during the past summer because we were bored "or maybe they might release it as a documentary" The Day Creativeivity Died: Exploring how low-budget movies still Can be completely clever or original, despite the lack of ties with important movie studios. "<br /> <br /> Tenants with an interest that are not suspended should find things Here on the back of the video: "The Quiroz brothers have once again proved that watching things you can do is not easy, very interesting." - Mr. Bangla
