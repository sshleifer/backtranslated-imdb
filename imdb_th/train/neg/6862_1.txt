The inferior inferiority for the original "Dead Dead" movie is another waste bin. A lot of people tricked into these movies until I didn't want to believe what they were talking about. Since I was a child, I have heard about the horrors and greatness of these movies and I see them all and are very disappointed. Everyone about drugs from the 1970s or they don't know it's boring.
