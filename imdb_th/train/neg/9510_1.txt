Sugar & Spice is one of the worst movies of 2001. This film tries to cross Heathers and Bring It On and fails. When I saw last January, I felt disgusted by the movies I walked and talked on my mobile phone with My boyfriend during the last half hour of the movie I heard that the DVD has a director's supervision. Maybe I'll try it, but this junk movie PG-13 is ridiculous and is the worst. Maybe if this movie has T&A to make it ok But the jokes and performances are terrible. Worse than Troma film
