What we know that such treble is something that is overlooked and haphazard is the mystery of the universe. We present with a clear parade of experts. (No one has a name) that walks and the pontiff in a manner that does not have a thorough science. Their interviews were severely subdivided and dispersed throughout the flashy cgi and mini-plot. <br /> <br /> The film contains science, philosophy, philosophy and politics. And then split the boring and ridiculous conclusion We believe that quantum physics is telling us the purpose of our existence and anything else that is difficult to answer questions that filmmakers want to point at. <br /> <br /> It's a mistake. Missing complex, non-sequiturs. We start at quantum mechanics and end with a pseudo-scientific spirit and mysticism. It's like 'Two plus two is equal to four, so I can move the object with my heart.' <br /> <br /> Nothing is original in this movie and almost nothing is right. Any discriminating audience will be disturbed by hand-correcting, intrusive and pointless special techniques and without general content. Educated audiences are frustrated because of tears from the violence that has happened to science and everything that this movie has touched.
