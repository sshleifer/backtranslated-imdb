If this guy can create a movie, I am sure that hell can create as well. <br /> <br /> Actually, if you hire me to make a movie for you, I promise to do the following:> < br /> 1) I will add more naked women. This movie does not exist at all. I think the Class B horror movie should be able to be rented only because of the traditional female body exploitation. I don't want the audience to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 2) I won't do many scenes that the hero wakes up to find out that it's just a dream. I think HorrorVision has about 4 scenes and considering the film. This length is only one hour, the length per dream ratio per movie is quite high. And if I decide to follow the sequence of dreams, I will make sure that the person will wake up without clothes I mean, who's sleeping in leather pants <br /> <br /> 3) I'm not going to cut a movie like Star Wars or Matrix because I know my budget is small and I don't want to cover my mask. Insulting for the cheap Hollywood movies by adding sarcastic references about them in the mines. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, I will not mix modern technology with death. I mean, palm pilots must be very scary ... At least they turn them into evil monsters before the screen explodes or something. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking at find Beyond the features of creating your next horror movie. Count me: Film director. wanna-b-movie
