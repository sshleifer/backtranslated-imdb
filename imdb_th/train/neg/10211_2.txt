Except accepting good movies, I can hardly say anything positive about this movie. The only real problem is the embarrassment of the protagonist, whether with his childhood friends in the world of adversity or allowing them to live their own lives. Went with this plot and due to poor performances, they failed to create the desired atmosphere Just director But managed to introduce Anthony's dilemma and eventually bring a simple solution The characters do not seem to develop, although it is difficult to talk about any characters ... maybe except Sonny. Beside him, the actors do not play much, and when some people have to play, they fall out as amateurs who indulge themselves. I wonder if this movie will be ruined anymore: superficial scripts discard the potential of the plot or poor performances to disturb any potential appeal.
