For checking this, a list of good scores and bad scores, I'll start with a bad rating. <br /> <br /> Bad score: Selection options. (Especially Burt Reynolds as Boss), poorly chosen actors, stories, concepts of modern movie setting, direction, editing, soundtrack, and above all The whole idea of ​​creating a documentary film from a television series that is not excellent for the beginning. As well as being popular <br /> <br /> Good score: Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ............ That's it. <br /> <br /> Can create Similar here in the scene in which Jessica Simpson, while Daisy Duke walks to Michael Weston while Enos and asks the question "Where is Enos Boss and Roscoe?" In his verdict May also ask "Enos, is this a good movie?" The red bikini would probably make his decision to be yes. Even though in his correct heart he would say "not true" as she looked at Nabi Gini, she can do Has been totally naked, and even without helping this horrible film piece from Hazzard!
