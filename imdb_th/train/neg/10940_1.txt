First, let everyone accept that Lorenzo Lamas may not be seen as a skilled performer, even a bit of a normal punch. However, this section of @ *! ^ Is called SnakeEater. The film industry as a whole has to deteriorate. <br /> <br /> First, start with the plot. Vietnamese veterinarian Jack Kelly, known as a soldier (Which should be as strong as some leather straps, which you can believe that when he pushed the nails of the palate of two men and pinned them on the floor), he received the words that his family had been killed and his sister Kidnapped So he went on a solo mission to help his sister. Have some potential But still quite a bit to start. <br /> <br /> Now, acting As an actor, I have the qualification to say that this is the worst performance in the history of art !!!!! Lamas is a good person. Jackasses who play Clampets / Deliverance should be frustrated and shoot for an act called insulting actors everywhere, especially those with special abilities that never stop at great <br /> <br /> Finally, action The gunfight is fairly good and the fist fight is a pity. I saw a more realistic battle in the Renaissance Festival (and that's a fake thing)! <br /> <br /> Readers listen to me: Avoid this CACA at all costs! If only existing movies, you still want to avoid! For the sake of counting your brain cells, don't look at this!
