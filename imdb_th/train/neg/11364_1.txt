The first ten minutes of this movie about making a foreign movie in Belgium is good: You see the actual chaos in the director's scene on the edge of bad stars, etc. You've seen everything. Before But very well done! The rest of the time in the movie just repeat yourself: the same ten minutes over and over again. There is no climax, no dramatic developments, no good performances, even bad performances, it happens. Mickey Rourke has a good two minutes when his character talks about his career in the scene where True and fiction meet All of this takes a good 12 minutes. <br /> <br />
