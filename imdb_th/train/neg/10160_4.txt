A typical example of Lanza with limited audience with a weak story that just gathered to show Lanza's MGM contract at that time. <br /> <br /> According to the Lastliberal member report (above), Grayson couldn't. Can stand because Lanza from his obscenity towards the camera (And sometimes) her. In addition, the courtesy of using his gutter and the smell of alcohol continuously in her face in the scene that they do together is unbearable. After making the second movie (and finally) together, "Toast of New Orleans", the quiet Grayson broke into Louie B. Mayer's office and told him with words that were not sure she would. Don't work with Lanza again? Meyer felt that Grayson was more valuable to MGM than Lanza, so Grayson's speech was stuck. Grayson performed in a widely accepted musical. (And more profitable) with Howard Keel and others later in life when asked to compare Lanza and Keel. She replied that there is no comparison between them and the excellent keels to work with and has a lot of appeal. Depends on "real people" in the audience
