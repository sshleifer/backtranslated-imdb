I can't believe this is a DVD. Even less is available at video stores in my area. <br /> <br /> Some people argue that this is a good movie. If you consider that having a budget of only $ 4,000, I find it funny I will find it very bad, depending on how much the budget will be. <br /> <br /> I'm still funny. Read on in other reviews: "The drama, if you love horror. Updated with a little story and a beautiful girl thrown in. You will love this movie. "<br /> <br /> What ?! This is a shame when compared to two movies. <br /> <br /> I give "1" because I can't give "0". I just don't see the way this movie will entertain.
