My wife and I watched movies every night without distractions and most of them are art movies that require thought. I have a lot of patience for movies that slowly bloom. My wife has twice as much interest as I do. Everything is said - this film is empty and boring! It's nowhere Never blossom It started quite strong with a promising plot ... then she baked cookies ... went to Spain .... She was sorry. Uneven, full of holes, wrong start and wrong ending We have gone through many scenes that extend to her that just stares out into space. The artificial depth is implied when she plays with mud and cries Zzzz ...... It's like a chick's flirt that pretends to be deep or art You never know or understand Morvern about half way that you don't care anymore. We just want to see at least one plot developed. Don't waste time on this. I'm shocked to get a very high score.
