Rating: 4 of 10 <br /> <br /> When this mini-series approached and we knew that in the last six months, because the Sci-Fi Channel still uses their performances in BG advertising continues. I agree that I feel more uneasy when I learn more. <br /> <br /> Just like the movie art that has been tested when people see things in this story when people think of Battlestar Galactica. Remember things. For some people, it's a chromium warrior with red light shaking in the sun visor. For others, it's a favorite that they have for special effects that are quite evolutionary. Playback time Many people forget the status of special effects in the late 1970s, especially on television. For some memories, revising around the story, others still remember how their relationship helped overcome the challenges they faced. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I'm from The latter group, the essence of Battlestar Galactica, is the one who gathered to help each other from the evil kingdom. Yes, the Cylons are nothing but the destruction of the human race. But they do it While the base star is spinning around, men and women gather to face the enemy with unlimited resources, and they try to survive until the next show. They do not survive because they have better technology or more power. They survived because they care and trust each other in order to pass on to the next list. <br /> <br /> The list is defective and sometimes looks bad. But they are the ones you care about. <br /> <br /> The author of this action today doesn't seem to understand this. In some ways, he uses the least important parts of the original show, the name of the character and receives the story arc and creates what they call less than the invention of science fiction on television. Since it is their goal, they can judge how well they do: Failure is far from being re-invented. In fact, it is in many ways one of the most enduring attempts of science fiction in a long time. It borrowed freely from ST: TNG, ST: DS9, Babylon 5 and even Battlefield Earth. I find that unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Ronald D. Moore is a contributor to popular science fiction for over a decade. And participate in the most famous television science fiction that you hope to see. One of the difficulties he seems to have is that there is no conflict in the bridge team of Enterprise D & E. Editable of ST: TNG of Roddenberry Like many people who live under the rules of others who use the opportunity to break the rules when they are not under that authority, Ron Moore seems to have forgotten some lessons he learned under the science fiction master. Known Stort Here instead of writing the best story possible, he created unusual actors like I had seen with the intention of creating as many conflicts as casting the actor as he could. In addition to being unusual, some parts are unbelievable. Anyone who has been in the army knows that someone is incredibly remarkable that high-ranking officials will not receive just a few days "in hacking". They will be executed and they will Never leave It will not happen, especially in times of war. <br /> <br /> What I remember that most of Ron Moore's previous work was that he was the writer of the death of Capt James. Kirk He killed Capt Kirk and alas for me. He killed the Galactica Battleball.
