This is an arid and interesting film filming in one of the most interesting events in World War II and in the history of the battle behind the front lines. Organizing bad drama elements is the worst thing about this movie, as there are plans to kill Hitler. It should be a very dramatic event. There is no character development at all, and thinks that Tom Cruise should play a high-level commander who questions his deepest inner thoughts about patriotism and betrayal. I believe Mr. Bin will play better. In general, the movie seems to be a good German television movie. "Stauffenberg" in 2004, but could not get close to that movie However, the movie received clear financial goals with popcorn audiences that cherished Hollywood's temperament quickly and the value of shallow art.
