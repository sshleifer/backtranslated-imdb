I confess - Emma, ​​in my opinion, is the greatest novel ever written. It's close to the perfection of any mortal creation. Jane Austen reached the peak of her art here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the best. <br /> < br /> Comparing to the Gwyneth Paltrow model is inevitable. Faithful to the sharp spirit of this book and enjoying more viewing Raymond Coulthard makes Frank Churchill appropriately decorated. Production is handsome But the interior is too dark. <br /> <br /> However, there are several important problems. The first one is Mark Strong - first, he doesn't look right for Mr. Knightley. Famous victorian It's not good enough. <br /> <br /> The second problem is one in length. The movie is too short - to get the right feeling, it must be twice as long. <br /> <br /> Finally, and most importantly, the quality of the adaptation. Austen was the dream of the adapter. All conversations were there, just having to trim and arrange properly. Andrew Davies seemed to think otherwise. First, this is a rather dark movie, and the last thing Emma should be gloomy. More importantly, Davies deemed it appropriate to write a new ending as a country-related celebration. This is the planet or the small work of Thomas Hardy. Where does this come from? It is full of style and spirit of the novel. And I believe it is difficult to assume that trying to improve - perfection. <br /> <br /> See the Paltrow version or watch Kate in the Cold Comfort Farm.
