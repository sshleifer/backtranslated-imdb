I hope Spike Lee chooses his movie titles. "Summer Of Sam" expresses the impression that this movie is about the infamous serial killer David Berkowitz. It's not. It's a clay drawing of life on. The streets of NYC in the summer of '77, when Berkowitz threatened that city. <br /> <br /> The film follows many little girl characters in Italian-American neighborhoods. Sam's son threatens Vinny and Dion. na his wife; There are Richie and Ruby and many other characters. <br /> <br /> The problem is that these characters are not a favorite. They are both annoying and sometimes unbearable. Then Lee showed their chaotic life, filled with anger, desire and general chaos. There are at least two protracted fighting scenes between Vinny and his wife. The disco dance scene is redundant, countless gabfests ... I'm still wondering where the movie editor is. <br /> <br /> At the same time This film gives the opportunity to convey the true feelings or fears that arise from the threat of Son of Sam behind too much. Lee is more successful in showing various types of threats that arise from a group of neighbors. <br /> <br /> The performance is good too. When combined with the 70s disco music and attention to clothing and production design make you feel like being in the Italian-American neighborhood in New York in 1977. <br /> <br /> The authenticity of the atmosphere. Of this movie Not enough to compensate for the tour, an exaggerated script about the lives of people that are annoying without being reduced.
