This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. This is the thing that immediately jumped out to me: 1. The forest is like a hill in Los Angeles with trees and a few brushes. It's not scary. News flash If you're shooting in the Southern area California. The big bear is only one hour away. They have real trees. <br /> <br /> 2 Writing. No doubt that the worst dialogue I've ever encountered. Every possible line in the movie is not about the old idea or just stupid. For example, the name of the camp is "blood camp" (weak). The name of the clown is "Killer Clown" (weak) What are the clowns doing in the forest? Is that the only mask they can find? 3. The last thing, but of course, is acting. The group of actors and actresses that were the worst that had gathered together Virtual abundance of shit lines and bad performances The worst part is that, then randomly go back to this fat foreign girl who is naked to take pictures. It's a very long scene and I think she should be sexy. But she is not Also, and this is one of the few fun parts of the movie. For me, this tool is supposed to be an "athlete". For example, when he's bored in a movie, he grabs a pair of stones and starts to curl with them. Then later he should run to the joke and it was immediately clear to "girl like" running him that he was quite far from the sport. Oh and for girls who play Cat, he stopped singing well. The song that you sing with credit makes me want to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you see in this movie, I at least would like to suggest a special feature. A group of stupid people who made this movie spoke about it as though it were a traditional story. In fact, a woman said that she let her friends read the script and no one could predict the ending. Obviously she went out with special children.
