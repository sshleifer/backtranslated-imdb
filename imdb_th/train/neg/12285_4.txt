The story is ridiculous and lifeless, including acting and conversations that are difficult to open your eyes. I advise you to have a friend who has caffeine to wake you up in time to find a pair of effects. Why are they bringing Alcatraz in this case to become difficult to swallow? All the time, I wonder if the film is intended to be filled with sub-weakness (such as Cannibalism US Army-Captain). This is a low grade in all aspects. This movie is banned in Germany !!
