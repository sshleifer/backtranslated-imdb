I'm a big Seamal's fan. Hell, I'm probably as hard as he does, even though I don't have credit on the road to play sports. Ponytails, pony-tails after mentioning their own bias and fondness in America. With the stage performance and America's favorite fake hero, it's a very troubling story that I have to declare this to be his worst movie I'm not sure if he can create a worse movie. <br /> <br /> In his defense, the main problem of this film seems to have occurred in the post-production period. Obviously it was very painful that this movie should have a different story. Resulting in a diligent sound, which Steve's voice doesn't almost match with the voice Editing is a tantrum, and overall, this thing gets worse and worse, and eventually you hope you can watch The Da Vinci Code instead. Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> After this I don't know. What to expect from Steve My friend still laughed at me listening to his CD. Is it time I started checking some Van Damme directly to record a DVD nutty? If you are tempted to watch this movie, tear your eyes out and wash them into the bathroom. The life of darkness is better than 89 minutes.
