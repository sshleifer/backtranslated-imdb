Like most people, I draw to buy this movie because of the great image of Bolo Yeung, plastered around the box and assumptions. (From the above picture and the name of the movie) that the movie is about the beast from the east kickin 'for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, for my disappointment, China's Hercules is Bolo Yeung in what At No Retreat No Surrender does not give up. Jean Claude Van Damme and Fearless Tiger are ... erm, Bolo Yeung - Maximum exposure in the video box, minimum real screen time! Oh well! <br /> <br /> The story is basic, but well done - a peaceful kung fu fighter. (Performed by Chen Hui Min) Killing people inadvertently and promised not to fight again He then ran away to work as a harbor worker, where he impressed his colleagues with the courage to lift the sack, causing him to wonder if he was a formidable fighter. (I don't know how it works but I don't care.) At the same time, the chief of the port that made a deal with the gangsters made them take advantage of the port. As a result, the workers were thrown out on their ears and forced to live on the beach where they reunited with their boss, boss, villain and his cousin. Bolo Yeung <br /> <br /> At the moment That the film is quite watchable (mostly through waiting for the next glimpse of Bolo). I have a little problem with it - firstly, bad scrubbing. But of course is an old kung fu movie But this film tends to drag between various fighting scenes And for that fight scene, I found it too long, poorly designed (Obviously by Jackie Chan!) Shot badly, and sometimes played by people who don't seem to have the ability to fight martial arts .... In fact, most of the battles in this film are not 'fighting'. So only those who were attacked without any resistance. <br /> <br /> Finally, the hero of Chen Hui Min, played by I have never seen any other movies with this man. But I never knew this before. Not only did he look scary and tears almost all the time. But I found that he insisted on not fighting off anger! I understand his reason But he can help many people get a lot of pain. If he did it before, what we all know he will have to do in the end and fight! The greater mystery is why all the communities of people pin their hopes to men they have never seen before! <br /> <br /> Actually, the great grace in this film is the presence of Bolo Yeung. He's not just as big and cruel as ever. But he also has a great joke and makes other master-level actors able to fight movies. The guy appeared on the screen and you can easily see that he became a star. Men fear life out of me But I'm sure I'm not the only one who has watched this movie, which is the foundation of Bolo throughout the fight! <br /> <br /> All of the lower-than-average kung fu movies lift many large notches because you know someone. I never met someone who didn't think Bolo was great. This man is a legend !!
