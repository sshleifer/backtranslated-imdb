This is one of the great B movies and having sex that can't be played anywhere near the theater. The woman ran around in the "rabbit" dress. The little goose was very fat, the intensity of many jokes, and they all worked at the restaurant of a dirty old man with a strange son, Tom's brother) that man. Want to "get" hangs a good person But this movie has nowhere and no issues We have to wonder why it happened? However, due to the show's hangs and a few entertainment moments (But not more than a few) so it gets the protagonist "2" from 10. I think I'm a good person
