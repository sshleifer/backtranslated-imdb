I read reviews of this movie and they are quite good, so I think I should watch me as a Francophile lover and a great art film. But I believe this is another case where critics create something that "arty" or "wisdom" is something that is not me to be blunted: it has a scene of sexual perversions that I never want to actually see Obviously, the piano teacher has some important psychological problems. But I don't want to see them graphically. This film is a disgusting essence. I mean, when I saw the Requiem dream, I was tired of the last scene of Jennifer Connelly. But that was not close to the disgust and disgust that I felt in this film
