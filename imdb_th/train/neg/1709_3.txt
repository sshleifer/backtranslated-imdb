I received a copy of this movie, thinking that it was a 1964 movie with 'Zombie Bloodbath' as ​​one of the alternative names. This movie has better ratings than this website than the names mentioned above. Which may mean that the other one is really bad! This movie is not too bad. Obviously, you can't go into a movie called 'Zombie Bloodbath' and expect to get a masterpiece, and in fairness it depends on the name with the amount of blood displayed ... but it feels old and very tired Which was not helped by the brutal and foolish performances It's just your average nuclear leak, causing people to become zombies, etc. etc. The movie begins with a sequence that sees people dissolving and that makes you know what you are doing. Low-quality zombies There is a lot of blood in the movie and it is a really good job, otherwise this movie is really boring. Zombie Bloodbath looks very cheap as well and is clearly collected from the inexperienced filmmakers! The main influence seems to be Romero's great death day, even if it is anything that has zombies and gore. Everything has to go through until the predictable and pointless ending, and overall I can't say I'm impressed with it!
