I like Batman: Dead End. The dark film noir setting for Batman is perfect. Batman: Dead End is good. This is not <br /> <br /> First, let me start with the show. There is nothing really good. The best thing would be Clark Bartram as Batman, but that didn't say much. He is a good person at first, and then you know that he is what he is the creator of a body that becomes an acceptable actor. But the most problem is that Batman isn't in the middle of the day. He looks like a madman running around in a bat suit instead of a scary guy trying to compensate for past mistakes. The day also revealed an annoying scowl on Bartram's face, which was never left and cannot be described in Batman: Dead End. It may be due to the darkness of the short term that is needed. In this example, Bartram seems to think that Frowned and shook his head stubbornly, acting not opposite. It's called posing, what actors actually avoid, such as plague. <br /> <br /> What I never understood why Collora was casting a bodybuilder as a leader. It's more reasonable to give a role to an actor who can manage it instead of being a bodybuilder that can handle it. But he looks very good like a cartoon! Of course, they may do better if Collora's calling is not very desirable. <br /> <br /> All examples (Yes, the trailer does not have full length movies) as the center rather than Batman Superman But everything on the side of Superman is monotonous and amateur. Michael O'Hearn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He stood around, smiled and said About it. Although I was not surprised because he was just a bodybuilder they hired and may have received some acting lessons, I spoke to Collora again in the casting. Not a bodybuilder The actors will be much more interesting until we forgive the fact that they do not look like comic books. <br /> <br /> Costumes are what you expect Superman to wear. For the Batman series I guess it only looks good in the dark. I say this because in some shots the suit looks like what you buy from a Halloween souvenir shop. <br /> <br /> Superman flew in this movie. But that's not a good thing These images are especially amateur. This is the whole "movie" and it looks like it was shot in their backyard with a camera. VHS <br /> <br /> The best picture is the image of Superman. Holding the car in his hand And the last match of Two-Face and Batman at the end. For those of you who have seen the example You know what i'm talking about Now, if only he could stretch that bullet out through all the examples, <br /> <br /> Finally I asked. Why if you are trying to show your ability as a director, can you create a short movie trailer? This doesn't prove anything when talking about being a true story director. My only suggestion for Collora here is that there is a difference between being able to tell a story and being able to work in marketing. <br /> <br /> Batman: Dead end, don't feel amateur. I can't know what happened.
