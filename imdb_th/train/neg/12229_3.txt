This movie started out well. I felt like watching a mature version of Seinfeld. Often I started to question the situation and actions of the main characters and didn't find the answer to why they did what they did All performances are excellent. But there are only a few scenes that have a short time that they are really funny. Dan Cortese is amazing. I love him in this role His representative should show this film to select agents. See the first few scenes, then find something better, otherwise you will find yourself completely lost. I found this in the trash at the video store. It cost me two dollars and due to the rarity of this movie I feel it is a good price.
