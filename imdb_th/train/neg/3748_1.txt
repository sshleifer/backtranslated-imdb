... but this is not working and I was surprised to see how many people think well in which area there are loose suggestions here and there. But all the content is self-reliant and unreliable. Lynch's movies are often interesting because they are confusing and still have a lot of playfulness when doing so. There are feelings, images, some parts, characters, ideas, etc. But it's boring and yes, pointless. Because anything that has been explored, whether "small", whether it goes too far to understand or tell this wonderfully, it is just Lynch that explores DV. Nothing more, so should be treated like this 1/10
