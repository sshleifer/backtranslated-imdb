I still try to decide if this is the worst movie I have ever seen or not. The very disturbing problem of this movie is the interview with a real scientist, but their video has been modified to look like they support. Many BSers concepts that create this movie The signal to signal ratio of the interview is about one thousand per one - at the end, the interviewer seems to say that "We want you _think_ !!" But they are too lazy to do simple research about what they confirm according to truth. <br /> <br /> If you feel like you are open and want to Expand your consciousness, please be wide enough to read real books about quantum theory: "Einstein's universe", Nigel Calder (some books, not challenges) "Universe code" by Heinz Pagels. Please go to read the book, please do not Complain to the investigator about being "generous". <br /> <br /> To conclude that this movie is not good, unbelievably. <br /> <br> You know what movie is really good at Ask the nature of reality? "The Thirteenth Grade" directed by Roland Emmerich and Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio, clever, sexy, provocative
