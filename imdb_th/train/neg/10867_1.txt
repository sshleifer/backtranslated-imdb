This is a movie that makes you say 2 things ... 1) I do a lot better. (Performing, writing, and directing) 2) This is terrible. I have to comment and warn others ... <br /> <br /> Looks like it's been filmed with my flip video. I also believe that my friend who told me to see this thing is spiteful to me. I noticed that there are positive posts for this home video. Must have a crew member or someone who is involved with this movie. One of the three worst movies I've ever seen. Hope that the writer and director leave the business Not capable enough to do advertising !!!!!
