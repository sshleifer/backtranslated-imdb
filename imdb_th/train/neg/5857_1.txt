WWF Survivor Series 2001 <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst events of 2001. Perhaps its biggest drawback is the fact that it is not suitable for previous Survivor series models. Only one survivor pair And the Survivor Series competition continues for 45 minutes. Moreover, everyone with a working brain knows that it will end at The Rock with Austin and The Rock on his team. And don't let me start in the preview before the event No matter who wins, it is obvious that no one will die. No need to have all ads that are pointless. Whether the story is a wrestling event, <br /> <br /> And for the rest of the competition: the first match is Christian defending his European title against Al Snow. It's a fast-paced and good match game that has seen the heel winning a fair match. William Regal and Tajiri are boring and we've seen it 2 or 3 times before. The Edge and Test tests are good but nothing good. Tag name matching, steel cage is the best match in the evening. The royal battle continued for 10 minutes and no one was interested in winning at first. Women's name pairing is not great. Not at all The main event must be the most cunning competition in history. Allies disappear But guess that after 5 months every single superstar partner will come back The competition was not good. The Rock eliminated 3 of them and Jericho got rid of 2 The Rock was caught too much with his performance to be there when the attack began. Jericho is at risk of all competition. If I want 2 people to be eliminated at the beginning, it will be them. Everyone knows that Kane, Big Show and Undertaker fall in love with them. 7 matches aren't enough for survivors if there are Survivor Series at Not as good as this
