They drunk this story! Finally, Nell is a hero and joins the team to save their entire ass from Hillhouse and ridiculous like that! They added the chopped head, the cord, cut the face of the man and the ceiling became a giant hand! What about it? I own and love original movies. I read books and I love it! The reason why the original movies and books are great because it scares you without showing ghosts without gore It's just a ghost advertising that ghosts can truly kill people They can't kill us. They can't throw us about a room or a knife flying into our heads. No, they can make us angry. Take all safety away Nell is a selfish woman. She needs only good things for herself. Yes, she cares about others But not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont bring bad stories to tell this story! I hate this remake!
