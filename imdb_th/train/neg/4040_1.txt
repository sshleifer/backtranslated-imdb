I think myself to be a little bit taller when talking about everything and even though the cinema experience is more suitable for explosions than high drama. But I'm still stuck with the movie. <br /> <br /> However, the art movie is better than King Kong. I might give the two stars of Hong Kong twice as much as this movie. <br /> <br /> I guess people are very excited about this because it's the same way you see in playing. For the less intelligent art-buffer movie, the movie that looks like the play is 'great art'. However, <br /> <br /> This film is not useful. <br /> <br /> There's almost nothing So it depends on the drama The only drama in this movie is whether the cat will shrink from the roof or not. So the deep and meaningful dialogue? No, almost no <br /> <br /> For justice too: some scenery is interesting, but: Communist flats, city views (Petersburg?) And the Soviet tram still in service
