I want to love this program very much. I actually do it. <br /> <br /> For the first time, gay viewers will receive "The Bachelor" in their own version. With the help of his compulsive "witch", Andrew, James, who looks good, can do thirty things with the opportunity to love 15 couples (or "friends" as they refer to in the list). The only problem is Half of them were straightforward and James didn't know about this. If James chooses one gay, they will go to New Zealand and if he chooses the exact person, he will receive $ 25,000. This is not fun! Hold my hand to walk: <br /> <br /> The most obvious problem in this program is the bachelor's degree. James is a successful and young gay man with a good smile and body. You may give both eyes to your local bar before you graze the green pastures. Why did they choose to remove James as a leader? God knows that there are many hot and cheerful homosexual men who are dying on TV. <br /> <br /> In addition to his rather plain appearance, James is also interesting and exciting. chalk Even so, he had an arrogant aura that gave him an aura. However, if James stands against an empty white wall, he will fuse with it. I can't remember what is interesting or memorable. Frankly, James spoke during the show. He is boring and forgotten. In fact, one of the flatmates said he didn't feel the connection. I think that's the best part of the performance. In addition, James also speaks with an almost annoying tilt. Give voice to women or male voice But do not act silly in the middle sentence ... very painful to sit I hate him a lot throughout the show. I always thought that "Please choose someone who is straightforward and upset your self and your unlucky witch." <br /> <br /> Then we have a partner. A group of polite people who seem to ignore what happened. Nonsense, they seem to be separated from one man to another, except "Hey, that guy who has blonde or oh highlights with curly hair" again. The decision to cast the actor is surprisingly inappropriate. While it may have been hacked to type the actor role, it would be more fun to watch than these amorphous drones. However, in their stubbornness, they still deal with James (which is not difficult to do), which is, you know that you have problems when some of your spouses are hot and interesting than the top men. And the fact that the spouse seems to have more fun with those around him? Very sad. <br /> <br /> In addition, I just thought Id pointed something that was mentioned in the message board that I felt was true: the straight guy is hotter than all gay people. <br /> <br / > Don't understand me wrong, I don't say that all gay guys are really ugly and boring. I find them very cute. Overall, they are just BLAH compared to the men you see on the show, such as A Shot At Love and Tila Tequila or The Bachelorette. <br /> <br /> I don't know how many times I move forward quickly. During this show I can get an interesting lead character like a cardboard box. I can accept spouses that are not ordinary, indifferent. But please let God's love entertain me a little. There is no such luck. <br /> <br /> If you expect drama, attractiveness, sexy or excitement, you will be greatly disappointed. "The biggest drama" comes from the fact that one of the spouses continues. Have a girlfriend in New York (Scandal!) That is the only thing that will be similar to the conflict in this list from a distance. <br /> <br /> Of course there is a distortion. But if you have the appearance of the Gaydar inside you will easily see who it is. (Not difficult at all. I am wrong once.) This item piles a lot of chips. When the twist can't be sent anywhere. <br /> <br /> We have been watched as James & Co, carried along exciting activities like Learning how to dance in Western style, the process of buying gifts, visiting a pet garden and gay karaoke, yawn. But who cares when everyone is bored That is one of the main problems of the show: no one seems to be enjoying themselves - they're going through a movement that is trying to appear to have a good time. And you can't blame them because the events are in no direction and innocent. <br /> <br /> Finally, the physical appearance isn't there. No hugging, no kissing, no kissing (!) No love at all It's just "Okay, that's a boring day. I'll go back to my ugly house - Sydney Opera House to live. In sydney (Quickly biting on the lips) CYA "This performance is very ridiculous. I can understand that they do not want to play in the nature of a homosexual man who knows, but come to ****. Next, people who watch reality television programs will want more than an uncompromising hug and kissing bluntly This show refuses to compromise. <br /> <br /> Sorry if this is protracted. But I feel that this is a problem that needs to be solved. I praise Bravo for the first time to demonstrate this style. But the characteristic that is not capable of handling this list is an incredible idea To summarize my three points: Boring + Boring + Boring = going to do something else You will have more fun waiting at the doctor's office to make an appointment, at least they have an interesting magazine there.
