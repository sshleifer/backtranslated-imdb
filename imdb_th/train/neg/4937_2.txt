This is a 30 minute show, about one joke, a joke. Cavemen aren't treated fairly. Hahaha !!! He couldn't dial the phone because he was a caveman. The caveman is not as intelligent as humans. Oh, jeez, those cavemen are not complicated. There is no humor in this program. They can run away from this joke for a long time and they already have it with Geico ads. This show doesn't deserve a time for the nation. When watching this program, I think I'm trying to be like "Bachelor's Gone Wild Show", meaning that they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women. The caveman crying is annoying. The caveman wearing glasses is too smart to be a caveman. (Hahaha !!!) All three have personalities. But I can't understand why I don't care about them.
