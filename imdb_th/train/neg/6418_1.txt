Let me start by saying that I'm not a horror movie fan. I never watched them. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about my experience ... <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched this movie is because of my girlfriend and friends. Her wish to see it more than Happy Feet. <br /> <br /> ... I've never seen Happy Feet before, but I'm sure it's better ... this movie? However, we didn't expect it to be a good thing ... We came to laugh for it. Cool to me ... I had a problem with breaking movies for other people in the theater, but because it was just another lover. Saying and doing it is not important. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, 2 others go to sneak into Borat, the movie that I will see again with joy. This movie is not scary and not stupid, so it will be funny ... it's boring. It's not scary like "Baby Genuises". Terrible. It's terrible ... not fun. I have no expertise. But it seems that the problem of the horror industry today is that you can have PG-13 horror that is boring and not scary or you may have Scary horror movies that are too scary for people or blood. <br /> <br /> Do you want a PG-13 horror movie that sucks but is a joke? See "regret". Avoid this movie like a plague ... because it may cause you to die. <br /> <br /> 0/10
