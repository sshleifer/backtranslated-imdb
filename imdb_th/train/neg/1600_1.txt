The largest Lamphun national attack is still "Animal House" and rightly so. It's a funny, groundbreaking joke and a good habit. <br /> <br /> Opposite to the national film of Lamphun including "Class Reunion" <br /> <br /> Please don't be fooled by the combination of Stephen Furst ("Flounder ") From" Animal House "or by the fact that John Hughes wrote something confusing This reunion is about as hilarious as the root of the canal and more than double the pain. <br /> <br /> One star and that is kind. Then again, I tend to think that most of my old classmates are demons, vampires and serial killers as well.
