This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I watched it with a large group of friends and after that we didn't understand us. In addition to the lack of a plot, the performance is cruel. "Special effects" are not special and writing is extremely scary. The only rewarding factor for this movie is that it is incredibly bad that it's quite funny. You can't help laughing. But there was a zombie running in while the actors were talking crappy I will not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie. But it is something that a group of friends can gather together and laugh well Now it's a joke among my friends and I 1 out of 10
