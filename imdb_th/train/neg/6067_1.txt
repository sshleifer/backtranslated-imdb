SPOILERS slightly (but it's not important) <br /> <br /> Exercising about the disaster that is not worth the line l0 I have to put these words on the net. This is the worst episode of the Masters series to date and is the first scene that has features for treating the mysterious science theater. Although I spent half an hour to understand the intended angle Its value lies in the view that forcing people to realize that in addition to the ugly masks and the type that succeeds only when the classic movie ideas of photography and light, dialogue and acting, editing and Determining the time to use Here they disappeared, and John Carpenter had no time, and there was no repeated analysis of simple social opinions here to change that. The carpenter has never been anything more than director B, but at least the movie 'Fog' and 'The Thing' have a great atmosphere. (The latter is one of my favorites.) <br /> <br /> Nasty. The camera angle is stuck in the cement. Tension rhythm But perhaps the most terrifying element at the moment is the story, of course, JC can't be blamed. (Unless the author is a friend of Cody) the first two minutes of a girl running through the forest to be almost Scully-Mulder's partner Be the first and the last person to work in this movie. But come, a girl hurled into a deserted forest, especially when accidentally aborting abortions, along with the fender of the MD 'women' rights, which the clinic just happened at the end of the corner road. Oh and I won't say anything. About how the doctor hit the car into the car and accelerated at 0 to 60 in six seconds. Do wonders for broken ribs or possible concussion. <br /> <br /> from That things will truly break down Absurd conversation "I just want to help you." Endless stagnation at the door. Great battle tactics like cutting the phone line. (In the age of mobile phones) followed by a shot: born-director of the Ramboesque clinic again with Ron Perlman and a high school sponsor kicking off at Easter Another lovely line: "So what do we do?" From a child who just sat on the assault rifle pile on the back of the van. Uh, it's not a season for the pheasant. So who needs those teenagers? Things about the good old and correct methods of the insanity that penetrated the door with all his American SUVs. <br /> <br /> For the exchange of ammo scenes by yourself as staccato of DC Comics What is missing is Wham, Bam and Whiz of the balloon name. And all this is the soundtrack that is worthy of the old Mannix story. <br /> <br /> At one point, we know that Dad is not really a father, but at this point, we don't care much about anything. From this drama is a conflict between a professional father and a pregnant daughter who is grateful only that she doesn't have twins. However, there is no single scene in the past or they will actually meet. <br /> <br /> All of them are still abstract, each and every time, all the characters do not like it. Absolutely gentle, hysterical, dull head, perfectly flat like a human background. There is no doctor who seems to have anything about medicine. And having a father who quarreled at the train with his daughter, his stomach as if he was a stressful boyfriend He was lucky to have There are funny moments. MST Two great moments: the ringing of Angelica's tap water goes off and later the newly born lobster with the baby's head stuck. Lovely is Angelica's rugby belly, before she pokes a little monster from hell. For the abortion scene, brave men ... They should keep Miike's episodes and do not do this instead. <br /> <br /> In summary, Rosemary's Baby met the aliens on the grass of MASH. The only foul odor that is visible to people under the age of 16 is that people will say here that this series will not be renewed in the third season. The real shame because there are many great productions, including good counterfeiting, such as Dante's 'Homecoming' or McKee 'Sick Girl', which is dashingly delicious. No need to mention the great picture of Malone's 'Fairhaired Child'. <br /> <br /> Sorry, John Carpenter, I believe your directing day is over. It's time to apply for president.
