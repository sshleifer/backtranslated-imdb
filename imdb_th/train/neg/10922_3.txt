Worse than the score received This is a typical SciFi movie today: bad to poor performances, poorly written scripts and low directions. From the opening scene at Demil, he buried his scene until the end of the movie. In the beginning of the movie, there is Moses. (Which is Charlton Heston in the movie DeMille), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxter) looking at the boy who buried the box in the sand The characters that represent the three icons are horrible and must be similar to the people they "should". The fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone gets hurt and they All shouted for an ambulance. The screenwriter is clearly not interested in the fact that there is no desert hospital. I am very disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to make low quality movies.
