Probably not, but it's terrible. Even the great actors can't record. OK, I agree that it started quite funny. But it seems to be falling down the hill as soon as they jump in the house of the generals Bill Murray changed from being a witty and funny person to an arsehole that shouted things that people on the street that aren't funny, unlike him, tried hard to be funny His character steals weapons (with RVs ...) and becomes a national hero after invading another country and killing God knows how many soldiers laugh. One good thing is that this film demonstrates the inadequacy and incompetence of the US military and shows that they are arrogant and thoughtless, even if not intended. I was really disgusted that this propaganda shit would be released.
