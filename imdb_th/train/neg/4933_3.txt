This movie is not bad compared to the first two sequels from the first part. It was directed by Martin Kitrosser on Friday the 13th. But the blood and special techniques help make it interesting One of the things I like about Screaming Mad George (make-up artist effects for movies) is that his effects line up the walls and are so strange that they will make you watch bad movies to see if they How crazy he is. This movie is not full of blood. But there is a very nasty scene about the eyeball - chewing in the middle that is related to the worm toy (what?!) Micky Rooney makes the guest that he may not be enthusiastic but wants money at the time may? If you like the odd 4 (My favorite 5) You may like this one. I like it more than Matrix! Enjoy.
