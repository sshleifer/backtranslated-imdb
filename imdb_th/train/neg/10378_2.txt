While the location of this house, where evil may rely on interest I'm not even sure how to start because I have many problems with this movie. I think I'll give you a few numbers: <br /> <br /> 1 Actions When you see Edward Albert, Doug McClure and Susan George (and her teeth) are the stars in your movie, you know? Whether you are having problems? Not that it's important to me. But these names are hardly a list. Susan George is probably my favorite movie. But I never thought that she would be the best actress I had ever seen. And in this film, her performance is embarrassing For the other two people, say better. <br /> <br /> 2 Ghosts, ghosts or spirits, or whatever you want to call them, reminds me of ghosts in a haunted mansion at Disney World. And they are scary stories And why they must be clear The intelligence is not unique to The House. Where's the Evil Dwells? <br /> <br /> 3 Synopsis One movie can be predictable. The result of this movie is painfully clear when you meet the three main characters. If you can't see where the movie is heading, after about 15 minutes, you'll have to watch another movie. <br /> <br /> 4 convenient monks? The chance that the haunted house that you bought happened to be located across the street from the Japanese monk group Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your home and comes back to knock on the door and ask if you need help getting rid of the evil spirits or not. Nonsense is the word in my heart. <br /> <br /> 5 different things? It's very difficult for me to think positively to write about. I think I will give a point for the opening scene and the point for the architecture of the house. That is the exact sign of the winner ?? Observing the architecture as a highlight of every movie, not really talking about it. <br /> <br /> I'll stop. You should get the idea from what I have said. And I have not spoken of the annoying little girl or the invasion of crabs or many other issues.
