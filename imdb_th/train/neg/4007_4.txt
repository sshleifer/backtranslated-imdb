I hope anyone who is a trainer for these losers with their accent will be fired. Only a few high marks that support 3 out of 5 of my favorites are killed at the end of the season. (And one of them is a cat to give that view) <br /> <br /> The whole story focuses primarily on sex and nothing else. Sex with vampires, gay sex with vampires, gay sex, gay sex with vampires straight, sex to score vampires, blood, sex after drinking blood, vampires, facial sex, vampires, vampires, vampires, vampire sex, vampires that are not vampires, sex Because we are afraid of vampires Sex because we are crazy about sex vampires because we have just become vampires, etc. <br /> <br /> There's nothing compared to sex. It would be nice if it had a little more depth when being pepper into the story. Sex story But they are not interested in doing so ... and Anna Paquin is a female dog No matter whether you suck or your character, I can't think of <br /> Another part of the story that I find very unbelievable is the reason why a 150 year old vampire seems to have Common things Interested in someone like Sookie, she flew away from his hand to him all the time because of things he couldn't control. He left for two days and then decided that he "didn't come back" and had a feeling with the dog owner? Let me take a break. She should be a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old girl. The people near her are about to die and she has the brightest smile on her face because she just sends her V-card. To some friends because she can't read his mind? As the main character of this story, I hope that acting will make you more easily understandable and someone who will pay attention to you is not the one you secretly hope to be killed or put into a coma. I can't find anything about your character that I like and even the fact that you can read your mind in an impressive and uninteresting way. <br /> <br /> I won't waste time with Viewing Season 2 comes June
