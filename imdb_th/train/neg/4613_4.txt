If so, what is it! I found Nicholson's character superficial and deplorable. Angelica Huston's character drained my energy and Kathleen Turner was a dirty man. Not that I "didn't understand". Not that I didn't think that Some ideas may lead to more things. This is a movie that has nothing but the idea that we should accept these ideas and that is what the movie did for him. Nicholson falls in turner with nonsense but after that again However, this does not make me a.) Funny or b.) ... even interesting from a distance !!! This is a waste of my time, so don't let your best ads ... it's a waste of your time! The opening sequence of the church is quite beautiful ...
