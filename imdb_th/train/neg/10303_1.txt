*** Comments are spoilers *** I hardly hold this program as a TV appointment when they start annoying songs under every scene when Don Epps is almost almost filmed every time. (But we didn't notice) and when Colby was FH ***** g Triple Agent But now, right now, David's night is now paranoid with an amateur OBVIOUS with a gun in the elevator and ... he can't disarm him. Field agents who have been trained and trained for the first time through the door several times and have experience in close combat can not do the knot mission. Not when he said that the blinking work looked out, dropping his head, closing his eyes. Not even when he looked up at the optical fiber, twisting around the ceiling like a dancer on the pole for 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the scene made me realize that as much as I enjoyed. With learning from Charles Epps, fat, but very charming, and his best friend / sexy love. Interested in Amita, my Friday night will be better if using something else. Don gave David and the word "suffering" which is the code for "Those who are going down"; David is ready. They kill the light, lift the elevator, be shocked by the bolts and ...... <br /> <br /> David can't disarm / kill / kill. Join the NUT JOB. The bad guy ends with a gun. The pair of David ended SHOT. <br /> <br /> I finished. Hopefully NUMB3RS will be fun.
