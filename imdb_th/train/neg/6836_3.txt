Please, even if you're in the worst mood, like watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't think there's anything right with this movie. According to my friend's advice, I watched this and I spent 1 hour and 48 minutes cleaning the closet. Poor acting, stupid direction, weak storyline and pathetic action scenes - and when you blend this together, you get "Double effect" Even a little expectation is still not true real!
