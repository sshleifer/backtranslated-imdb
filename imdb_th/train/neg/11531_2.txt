The plot is completely misappropriated in an unbelievable decision and cannot be thought of by adults in each parenting decision and every time, the children are extremely charming and charming. I say the whole plot depends on each adult who is a complete idea, and therefore in that case, understand more about their actions. (And at the same time Is the only way to explain the actions of all distrustful boys). Why is the charming little boy having to take his children out of the shore? How can children come to shore and at the same time it is the last place to search? Why did the two boys not be informed at the same time that the children disappeared? No one gave their pictures to run around with food and diapers that were turbulent and everywhere they searched. It is possible to ask the audience to believe this. Requesting to believe that it will be tested (Even informal settings) are too insulting to be naked.
