I have to walk out of the theater. After one hour, everything I saw was that people were cheating on their wives, stopping to behave like dogs in the groove and using the word f as if they were diabetic using Equal <br /> <br /> No thanks <br /> It's especially frustrating because this movie can do a lot. One of the characters may be interesting if they do more than do the talking and swear by each other. <br /> <br /> A few times it seems like it is going. Is the development of some characters, what happens is another sex scene The plot development in the 1st hour can be concluded that 1) the murder occurred several times 2) Vinnie saw the murder scene 3) Vinnie staring across the Atlantic / East / Hudson River 4) Vinnie cheats with Wife and 5) Joey list) was kicked out of his parents' house Moreover, I don't wait to see. <br /> <br /> The shooting and the interaction between the characters is great. But there is nothing they can do Floods, sex and vulgarity are hardly worth the wait for another hour to make things happen. <br /> <br /> Sorry, interrupt. Study lessons from Notting Hill or Shawshank Redemption. Both are better education in the community and interpersonal relationships.
