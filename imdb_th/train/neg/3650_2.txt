No laughter. Yes, I watched all the wrecks of this train. But later I would not doubt later that Cleese had touched him later. (No, he doesn't have it at all.) <br /> <br /> This may be an interesting story in the past for the kids there to see what England's "humor" includes such "black" jokes thirty years ago br /> <br /> The thing that surprised me more was reading the opinions of other investigators who acknowledge that this is not very good, then turn around and give a high score. If the majority of the comedies you see are much worse, I will show your suffering. <br /> <br /> The humor level of this program appears for small children, but the content is not. So who is this for? Those who enjoy playing twice, conversations, jokes about drugs (Interesting, just a short trip back to '77) and other "low" jokes. Three Stooges are still funny and I am a kid too. They use the effort to make jokes work. However, this story will be released from the schlock. I am afraid that it will be the end of civilization. If this thing is accepted, it is worth it.
