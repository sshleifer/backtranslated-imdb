It is very popular with Australian audiences. It is still a joke today. But the political inaccuracies and the bluntness of comedic stories that do not match the truth can make the audience feel uncomfortable. It's too long. <br /> <br /> Some parts can record content for the sequel to the story. His Own Holds, which wants new things, gets his Aussie Oster's attitude as a joke. But became annoying when the movie appeared Some people say that Crocker's music is the best bit and of course is original but "hilarious"? Barry McKenzie's adventure will become a landmark in Australian theaters. But we should do everything in our power to make sure the audience from abroad will not see most Australians as Barry McKenzies (or Mick Dundees!). Score: 5/10
