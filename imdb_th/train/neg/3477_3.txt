Not as bad as you have heard. Actually, there are some funny parts and effects and apple gates that have fairly good chemical properties. Especially Applegate is attractive and is a favorite of Affleck James Gandolfini's love and Catherine O'Hara is a complete professional. They are quite good in all things. In the end, "Surviving" is not the worst holiday movie you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it doesn't focus and is forced to joke. The effort of dark humor came out as grief. Affleck tried hard to be too aggressive and conscious. But was disturbed The nature of his character is very relaxed when viewed next to Gandolfini and O'Hara. Quiet and convincing. Even according to the standards of a relaxing holiday movie, you have never bought a full set of Affleck "Rent" this family for X-mas. <br /> <br /> There are also scenes with borders on Sir. Rial in their strangeness. The X-mas eve scene consists of incest humor. (The son who was discovered to look naked, provocative image of his mother) that not only is not funny or convincing But only disturbing. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse The color in this film is almost mud noir. This house is located at the majority of the film. It seems to be a stage and cheap. <br /> <br /> "Surviving" is interesting as the fourth largest box office movie (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl and this thing) For Affleck it remains to be seen that the damage will be sustained.
