Everyone who is a jazz composer in the 1920s, 1920's series, Charleston and luxury yachts. (Like all of me) will want this movie But the sad truth is that that's all there is The plot is repetitive and clear. Most of the performances are scary or play outside of the goings-on. But the impression of glass and smoke This is a beautifully made movie.
