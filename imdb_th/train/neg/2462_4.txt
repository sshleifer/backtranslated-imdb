I like the blood in this movie - it's quite unbelievable. Anyone who has been to the dentist will know why. The story is not that bad. The character's motivation for Corbensen makes more sense in most horror movies. <br /> <br /> I have seen worse acting, screenplay and other things today Probably a bad horror movie So if you enjoy that thing or not I tried to watch the sequel. But it is the same thing as this movie Just remember that if you enjoy being tortured at the dentist, this is the movie for you!
