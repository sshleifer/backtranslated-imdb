I like moving items I enjoy the fare. Nick is quite good, including Hey Arnold. But moving the TV show to the big screen isn't easy, and this doesn't feel big enough. It was like the episode of a long show and it didn't move there. Judging by the behavior of the children we have with us, it's not a good score for them as well.
