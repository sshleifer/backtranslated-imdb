Wow what is included! In truth, people think that this movie is scary, ridiculous. This special effect is a direct cut from the "ring" story? Is there any? Not in my opinion .. just take a bunch of pictures. All movies are boring, stupid and cluttered. I guess there will always be a market for bad movies with a good marketing campaign. However, this is the worst horror movie I've seen for many years. And that Buffy Chick? She's a bad actor! Like a plastic like a Barbie doll and has the ability .. don't have to wait. That would be an insult to Barbie's ability! I think many kiddies helped this movie in the box office as if it were PG-13 and had been rated R then it would explode IMO! Stupid movie!
