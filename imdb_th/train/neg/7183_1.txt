This is the worst adaptation of the classic story I've ever seen. They do not need to make it modern and at some point, just sick. <br /> <br /> The music doesn't move according to the story. It seems that they are randomly drawn to the flight scene with Marley, ridiculous and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's not just one of the worst movies I've seen. Classic because "A Christmas Carol" is a classic story. Just because the original story is a classic, does not mean that some adaptations are correct.
