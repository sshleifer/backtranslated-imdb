The writing was terrible and I was not surprised that the author was responsible for the worst Australian film in recent memories of Honerable Wally Norman. <br /> <br /> There's nothing about this TV drama. -Never even mildly amusing It's tired and bad, and the worst is thinking that it's funny. It's embarrassing to see <br /> <br /> There is something about this item that gets 10 out of 10 on IMDb. Try searching for reviews (real) by Australian viewers (real) of the program.
