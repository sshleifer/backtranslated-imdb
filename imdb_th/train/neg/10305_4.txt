As an engineer, I must say that the first season of this season started very bright. Most applied mathematics are reliable and the relationship between Eppes' brothers and sisters shows the interest in the show. <br /> <br /> But after the first season, the performance began to decline dramatically. Most of the mathematics and technology used to solve crime are now gibberish and laughing for everyone involved in science and technology. For real, <br /> <br /> Participation from actors continues. Feeling okay and I can imagine it fairly. The amount of money is still being produced in each episode. But in the end, this thing is reduced to a very unpleasant dish that is a combination of action, thriller, action C and CSI style police show. <br /> <br /> If you Will watch it for the first season and some parts of the second After that I will not waste time. I gave the show halfway through the 3rd season. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars <br /> <br /> Come together at 4 stars. When Charlie no longer knew his mathematics, I would ignore my accuracy as well.
