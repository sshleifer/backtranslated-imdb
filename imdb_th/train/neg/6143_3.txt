This is a really strange movie ... First, we have a former US gymnast trying to change actors. (Or something) and it seems that this is the only role he gets For good reason While he took the role well enough to pay attention But it is a polite and quite flat show Secondly, we have the worst sound effect ever used in movies !!! I'm not kidding. This alone makes the movie very funny. But in an annoying way Hehe and third, while we have generally good supporting actors (Including the hot chick that you want!) Really bad stories, dialogues, scenes about gymnastics (hilarious!) And the overall action of a weak plot This movie is probably better as a television movie on the network. (Fox too bad, not in 1985) is one of the bad movies. But you can't resist watching and enjoying it when you're familiar, especially now that you have found the perfect home on TV and cable
