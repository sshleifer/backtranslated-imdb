The film was written by Charlie Higson, who had previously performed the legendary Fast Show and his own performance based on one of the characters of the Fast Show (Tony, the car dealer). He also wrote James Bond's books for children. < br /> <br /> Actually, I've seen Gordon's movie, the only story that is based on Lovecraft's story, and everyone is amazing. Here, Gordon tries to do different things. The appearance is "contemporary", all of which means camera shake, fast cutting and bizarre, cool cool music in the background. It works well here, I guess. But still pointless and cheap Often I think the camera technician who is shaking the camera to record the image in front of the actor / actor and trying to move in style in the image. (Hopefully there is something that can be tolerated). Casting is good and the overall atmosphere is the result of good governance. I think the main character, the young man at "Zero", is quite interesting in his "zeroness". The fat person is also good. And the guy that looks like Alex Baldwin, but not him, but soon after the start of the movie became an interesting thing: in this case I mean the scene without scenes of sadism and illness There is not much humanity in this movie: It is completely pessimistic and everyone in this movie is disgusting and desperate or dies soon. Needless to say that there is no sense of humor. It's 1'40 long. Vomiting without feeling relieved at any time. However, Gordon is still one of the most interesting filmmakers working today and I think. That this movie is an experiment and a failure in that matter Everyone has to suffer from getting lost at times to learn and find a way again. This is probably Gordon's most remarkable and worthless work.
