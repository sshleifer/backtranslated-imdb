When I went to the movie store the day before, I went through Blonde and Blonder. But something about it seems like it might be a cute movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure most people beat Romy and Michelle before they saw the blonde and Blonder could be another secret treasure that has passed. But when I started watching: producer Pamela Anderson, Wow, I knew I was afraid of something. Not only that But both things are considered to be the culmination of the heat: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards to not harm them. But they are not old and they play a role that I think is more meaningful for women who are Should be in the 20s, not the 40s. The story is normal, bad and nasty. <br /> <br /> Dee and Dawn are their brave blonde girls. Which happened in the world, sorry, but when the girl was mistaken for a murderer, killing the police in their story and calling the genius of the girl because of the attitude "Ignorance is happiness" They are prepared to "strike" with a man and they think they are going. "Show him a good time." But the real killer was sued and wanted a lawsuit and killed a woman. Previous day I know that this should be a silly joke, but it's more than a fool. It looks disgusting and unnecessary. Will I recommend this? Not one million years ago, these young girls tried to maintain their status as "sex kittens". It was a sign of despair and blonde and blonde and Blonder was a color BOMBshell Big blonde 10
