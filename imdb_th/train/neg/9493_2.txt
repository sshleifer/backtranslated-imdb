This movie is ridiculous. "The hippie idea", the standard of the 1970s in the nut shell and makes us bored in the process. It is an attempt to rationalize the absurd marriage of innocent women who have sex in old age and wash up. The innocent girl, played by Kay Lenz, travels and sleeps with the wrong man, and then one day she meets Holden, who is ridiculous in old age. And she decides that she is in "love" with him. If you think that it is superficial, the whole movie encapsulates the scene. Very thin and fast I can't help but laugh. But throughout the story Apparently she used him as a food ticket. But the director is not old enough to think that we are going to buy that there really is love. The disgusting scene is where both are naked and have sex. Inspired me to vomit The presentation of music from the 1970s was repeated throughout the film. Avoid this if you do Grade D.
