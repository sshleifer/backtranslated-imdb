How is Rick Sloane allowed to make five films more difficult than cold fusion? This movie is definitely a crime. Before watching this movie, I think Manos: Hands of Fate is a shit that's worse than I've seen, but at least Manos is moving slowly, so you might fall asleep The biggest tragedy of this movie is the old man who makes Hobgoblins "locked" into the final scene. The time I spent watching this movie was a waste of my life.
