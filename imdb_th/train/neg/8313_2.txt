I watched this with intention because it was ready to use and I heard that the movie Thumb is a joke. This is not a joke. Most jokes are based on the geranium's body, and on the other hand, Kate Winslet. Really pitiful of the creator of "Thumbtanic" who fell low so that the jabs in the actress would be respected just because she (heaven forbid) not starving in the form of an ideal modern beauty. <br /> <br /> My favorite is a similar style. "Hey, I have a great idea! Try to swim to the raft, which is a temporary vehicle that no one sees. "The fun, thirty seconds from the movie, 26 minutes, doesn't exchange its value.
