I have seen it. It's not "good" but interesting in an uncertain way. The boys in it are quite natural, but ................ The gang's final rape scene / the culprit is disgusting. The way it tries to compare true horror with hateful planning The real cruelty is true - this movie is very cruel. However, this movie has a look that can attract you. But for me it is "Emperor's new clothes" but actually back together This movie looks good. But the direction, story, content and the final feeling you get from this film is ridiculous If the feeling is empty - this is it
