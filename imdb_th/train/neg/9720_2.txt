This movie is boring. <br /> <br /> It tries to mimic the effects borrowed to the creative director Jeunet in "AmÃ©lie Poulain" but it's too much. The conversation was terrible. Some of the worst stories I have ever heard of Guillaume Canet. Unbelievable (I almost never met him.) His father in this movie played badly. This is difficult. br /> <br /> I think I don't like movies much since "le pacte des loups" (Brotherhood of Wolves) from Christophe Gans (and I watch / see about 80-100 stories per year) but at least the movie There are many good action and actors. <br /> <b r /> I never comment here. (Just rated) and when I see the ratings and reviews I think I have to write There are some problems. <br /> <br /> I guess we won't have a problem selling the DVDs that we offer: not bad movies in our large collection !!! <br /> < br /> I am open minded (I see SF, Western, drama, comedy, quiet, horror, fantasy ... movies!) But this movie is so boring that I feel like I have wasted half an hour.
