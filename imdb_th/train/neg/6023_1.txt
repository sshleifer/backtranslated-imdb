This reminds me of being a new-born believer who is going to be a minister. I never thought that I would be a minister or even graduated from high school because I was almost positive. I would be accepted to heaven before it happened. That was before I discovered that Christianity was a lot of garbage. Now I am an agnostic and that proves that "Once salvation has been saved," the Christian doctor told us was not more true than the elves. If it is true, then why am I leaving after many years of being a believer born again? Yes i really survived I pray that sinners are stupid with all my heart. <br /> <br /> If Christians have to read the scriptures, they will discover that their God thinks rape, genocide, abortion and Other cruelty, they may be surprised to learn that there is no "forgetful" word.
