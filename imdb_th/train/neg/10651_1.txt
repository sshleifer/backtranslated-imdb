Want to know the secret to creating a slasher movie at the fitness center? Just take the film out with the lovely ladies in the tightest workout clothes and let them bump and crush the floor like they are at the gentleman's club That's what this awesome slasher filmmaker made and that little trick made me look bitterly finished. This is the worst slasher movie I've ever seen. But every time I am ready to change the channel, they will add another scene with the fitness girl and I will continue. As a slasher killer workout movie failed in every category I thought of. As a showcase for beautiful women who exercise, it is a success. Good advice that should be avoided unless the idea that half of the movie is an interesting proposal for you.
