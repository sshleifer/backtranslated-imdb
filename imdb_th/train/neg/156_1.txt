Zu Warriors, of course, should be an animated series because, as a movie, it's like watching an old anime on acid. The movie starts from nowhere and people fly around, fighting metal wings and weapons. Other idiots, her lover on the cloud or something, whether this princess is a god or angel above me. But not long ago, there were criminals flying in and killing her, while those with razor-winged fights, other mysterious things. Plot lines, whether or not difficult to follow, you need to be insane. Frantic to get this movie, plot this Chinese man whom God called to fight with the evil flight. The princess killed the bad guy. We have a bad design like Uwe Boll, such as a fight scene filled with scary martial arts on the mountains or something, even though the pictures are weird. Some people may say that they are amazing and colorful. But I will say that they are blurry And acidic travel such as (Yes, that's the word!) I watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were not as good and hard to understand .... I was who I was joking. I didn't understand at all. It felt like me. Looking at the 30th episode of some anime in 1980 and completely missed that the story began or just as I started reading the 5th series comics at number 4 because I had no clue that this was starting from where it was born. Up or how to end All the time, I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever experienced, like watching Inu-Yasha in episode 134, drunk ... Yes, you don't know what hell is going on. Brain trying to figure out
