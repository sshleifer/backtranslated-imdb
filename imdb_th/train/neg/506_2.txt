(aka: The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance) <br /> <br /> Many naked babies in this scene, with two lesbian scenes thrown in, this movie should take place in Ireland. But looks like Rome and Adrian and me <br /> <br /> Gothic lesbians are invited to the castle on the island's Count during the weekend. They seem to disappear one by one because the madman runs around. <br /> <br /> It's not scary or bloody, and the rooms seem to be spotlighted with spotlights. The candle will light to think ... (sic) <br /> <br /> The reproduction is worse than usual and the plot only acts as an excuse for sexual feelings and nudity. Directed by Alfredo Rizzo, a European horror actor, a fancier. <br /> <br /> Very boring. 2 out of 10
