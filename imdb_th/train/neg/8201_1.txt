Sit down on your favorite chair and turn on the PlayStation while you throw it into the 90-minute waste disposal unit. Live your favorite game. Disjointed - taking bad pictures - not directed, takes a moment from the movie Other "science fiction" and trying to join the various parts is a pathetic story that is poor. There is nothing new here. Filmmakers don't seem to realize that providing simple entertainment can achieve financial games. But requires skill, intelligence and flair to transform into a good movie The money used to watch this is a waste and I personally want my life 90 minutes.
