Unlike "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai" or "Big Trouble in Little China" or "Conan the Barbarian", which is a horror film that is cold and has a sense of humor that makes them a cult child. <br /> <br /> The location itself is not working and there are some funny moments. But here, Eddy Murphy's "reversible attitude" just adds to the feeling of tension or danger. In regard to And the special effects are stupid enough to do more damage to that tension "The mysterious secret" of Tibetan Buddhism is Lamphun rather than being forced. <br /> <br /> Without feeling that there is something that is betting or the character must face the real danger, why should we care? </ br> <br /> Who should watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - Eddy Murphy's big fan who can't help herself. <br /> <br /> - I can't miss other people. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie 4 out of 10 occasional jokes that work.
