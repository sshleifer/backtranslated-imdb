This movie was never screened in our local theaters, so when it was available on DVD I was the first person to rent it. One time I should listen to critics and pass on this matter. <br /> <br /> Despite the great actors But this movie is very disappointing I can see why it's straight to the video. <br /> <br /> I think with Bloom, Ledger and Rush, it might be worth it. Everyone has done a great job in the past. <br /> <br /> The movie is slow-moving and has never pulled me in. I have not developed much attention to the characters and have to fight to urge to move forward quickly. br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, even if you are thinking of renting this movie for 'eye candy' purposes only.
