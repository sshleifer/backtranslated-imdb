The story seems beautiful today. Adapted for the TV from the book of Rona Jaffe. We travel and stumble through the existence of imagination. Four students are deeply involved in playing board games, live versions of Mazes and Dragons (based on dungeons and dragons). One player, Tom Hanks, enters the world of fantasy that is too deep. His co-players will have to save his life and save him from the dangers of self-harm. David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace round the game four. Supporting actors include veteran actors such as Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. <br /> <br /> Today seems to be a forest and tame. But the highlight of the show is seeing Tom Hanks during the "Salad" with his salad day and splashing water in SPLASH on the silver screen. The youngest audience will get the most enjoyment.
