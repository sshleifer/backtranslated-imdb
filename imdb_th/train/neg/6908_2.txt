This set has potential But I think the budget will not allow to see that potential Interesting settings are no different from "lost". It is depressed after episode 1. All 6 episodes can create an interesting 90-minute movie. But the manufacturer chose to drag it continuously. Many scenes were slow and unbearable without moving forward. The music is very annoying and doesn't work as a whole. There are a few characters that we care about because their characters do not grow up at that time. --- One character increased slightly. The ending is terrible, like the other series. The only glory here is the art and the dressers. They create interesting looks, writers and directors who look forward to doing interesting things with that element.
