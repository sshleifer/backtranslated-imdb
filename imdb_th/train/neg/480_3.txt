2 stars for Kay Francis - she's great! And she does not deserve this awesome rag at Warner Bros. throw away! <br /> <br /> Two evidence that this movie was created is ridiculous and unbelievable. Kay is a wife and mother in a small town that wants something greater than she wants to be an actor. When the big actor entered the city and invited Kay to his hotel to talk about the possibility, Kay told her husband that she was going to see the movie. The chaos of Mae's mother placed a bug in the husband's ear, which Kay was not honest and he set out to find her. He met her with the actors in the hotel. (They are talking only!) And he undermines the man who falls on the railing and faces the pond in the lake for the first time and dies. Now, here are the two unbelievable places in which this movie is used. Reference: <br /> <br /> 1) The judge told the jury that if he considered that the man had died * before the head His will go into the water They must find the guilt of the first level murder (Whaaaaa ?????? I think the approaching man in anger will count the killing or murder 2 very much. But the plot requires him to be found guilty 1 so that he can be sent to life in prison no matter what. <br /> <br /> 2) hubby's lawyer after the conviction And the trial told Kay that it was all her fault His reason is that if she doesn't go to the actor's room, her husband won't have to follow her and then take the bullet to kill the man and kill him. He told her that she was wrong, not her husband, and she nodded and agreed. What the hell?!?!?! The rest of the film is Kay's story, trying to build a reputation and money to allow her husband to be released from prison and do the wrong things she did by causing him to kill fellow actors in the first place. br /> <br /> I can't continue with this review. This movie is too painful. Four years ago, on the day of the advance code, you would never have been caught playing horribly Kay! Although in the real Kay Kay fashion, she tries her best to make us believe that this woman is a convincing character. I give her a lot of credit for trying to breathe life and credibility for this unappreciated role. This character is a far way from the previous chapter. Kay and Kay Francis have to open in real life. <br /> <br /> How to steer clear of this chapter! There is a much better Kay Francis vehicle there! (Based on personal experience, I can recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Jewel Robbery as well as Dr. Monica and One Way Passage. I'm sure there are other great flicks, Kay, but I only talk about what I am. Have seen and can recommend)
