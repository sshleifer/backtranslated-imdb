Scary movies that should be independent movies It relies on dependence on something. <br /> <br /> This film is completely miserable with the interactions between Irish people. Do they try to imitate the great movie "Crash"? If that is the case, this movie is totally broken. <br /> <br /> Too much happens here, with the rest of the kids running around.> The film is too fast to work. A woman lost her husband for another 14 years while her sister was confiscated by her boyfriend. This caused the older sister to become a bitter vet and walk around in unbelievable clothes. The sister is bitter but finds love soon. <br /> <br /> Then we have 3 losers who bought the mask to rob the bank. Obviously the robbery was wrong. But it seems that there is no punishment for the thief. Perhaps punishment should be at the author because he cannot create a strong film.
