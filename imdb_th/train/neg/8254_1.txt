I see better production quality on YouTube! I pity the actors because the writing is terrible and the direction is shocking, not sure how they will get this chapter - I really doubt that any actor will be able to save the movie no matter how good they are. Whichever The characters have not been developed at all, and there is no real gathering in the plot, which doesn't seem to go anywhere. It is really a shame because the place for this film is good and has better production quality, direction and script. It may be a good movie. Of course, it's not a joke, unless you laugh loudly in the voice acting, which is a matter of skill, even the British actors listen to strange things.
