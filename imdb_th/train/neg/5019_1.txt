This movie wasted time even renting a DVD. If taking pictures with a high-speed camera sooner than this, we may pay twenty dollars to enter the washing machine, pick up popcorn and watch the Jet Li spin better. Slowly, recently, to create a movie with repetitive content, such as The One. <br /> <br /> If there is a movie that you should avoid.
