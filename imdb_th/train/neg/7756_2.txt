I remember watching the attack when it came out first and caught it again. Recently, fi sci channels worked worse, but not so much unscrupulous cats of Jurassic Park, ATTACK used to replace cats, sabertooth for dinosaurs And they are in a loose state, swallowing as many special things as possible. CGI is quite bad and the prosthetic cat's head is ridiculous. We received a little blood which helped. Wait until you see that the mad scientist who started all this mess. How did it get? In addition to Robert Carradine, whose work is very small, the actor is not yet known. Obviously this was shot in Fiji. Well done if you can. Remind me about low-budget STV monsters that are popular in the 80s and 90s.
