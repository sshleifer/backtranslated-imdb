Front spoiler But is it really important? Have you ever read a movie review that contains all the questions? Is it possible that ancient civilizations buried the artifacts around the world? Why this question never answered Why is the message in the collection of information not consistent? Why is the nun (she sure looks good!) Giving 20 orphans to the madman? Have you ever had a gold mine in Vancouver? Why was one beam in the gold mine going out to the front yard of the orphanage? Why did the character of Tara Reid appear at Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or am I just answering my own question?) Why not even some archaeologists who have clearly opened the precious gold chest with a sledgehammer? Why do modern computers still show the outline of objects in the pre-Proton era, with the green "little bleeps"? And all movie burst timer must have digital display or not Why is there no reason for this movie?
