I sincerely hope to see Planet of the Apes, but it is a big objection. <br /> <br /> The settings and masks are great. Acting he is just in a movie that looks silly. The other actors are not very good. <br /> <br /> But the worst issue is the story. It's absolutely ridiculous! For example: Monkeys are lying unknowingly on the ground. But humans don't attack them, don't wait until they get up again! This is just one example for stupid stories, but it takes too long to tell them all.
