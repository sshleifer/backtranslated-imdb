I think it's time for John Rambo to move forward with his life and try to make Vietnam behind him. This series is getting old and Rambo is not a solider anymore, but is a cold-blooded killer. All the time he appeared on the screen, there were dead people. Vietnam is not a fun place to live and, frankly, I'm tired of Hollywood making it look like it's This is not Vietnam's worst film related to that honor. Go to John Waynes Green Berets. In any case, John Rambo holds a 50-calm machine gun that does what appears to be half the army. Many Viet Cong and Russians insulted Finally, the worse thing is the words of the most wonderful Rambos ... please !! Oh yes, I heard that they are creating another ...
