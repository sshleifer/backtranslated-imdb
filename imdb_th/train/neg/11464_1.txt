While I am not claiming to be any type of expert in marine life, I must say that anyone with intelligence cannot buy whale ideas. It is a testimony of his life with abortion forced by men! I really mean! This is the whole story. Richard Harris is probably very difficult for the role to accept this garbage. This is a very bad movie. If you pay 50 cents to watch it, you will feel like calling for a refund.
