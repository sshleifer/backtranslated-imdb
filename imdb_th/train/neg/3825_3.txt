I saw this film over the weekend and while I was impressed with the beauty and shadows of the movies produced by the church, I was disappointed that this film was very short, unable to notify members and leave. Investigators with unanswered questions> <br /> This film is a 70-minute vignette from the life of Joseph Smith. It is not a true biography because there is no telling story. True consistency Most episodes involve Joseph's actions, playing baseball, running and laughing with children, often moving slowly. What is so cool that Joseph is right? See him there, dancing to Emma, ​​his wife. So how are the carpets of his 33 wives? Not talking about things made from many husbands The negligence that stares <br /> and it is in ignoring such a stumbling block. It gives too little information and makes members of the audience think important. Why did Joseph be delayed and have a feather? Why was he thrown into prison and why that group wanted to kill him? The focus of this film is of course Joseph and Hiram's journey to Carthage prison. (Riding through the face of the UN, seen from the door of Nauvoo) but there is no mention of why There is nothing about Smith in the crackdown on the Nauvoo newspaper and the newspaper commander who destroyed it to demonstrate the secret teachings of many husbands. The audience was left to wonder or thought that it was a more unfounded church. There was no mention of Joseph who was charged with treason in the declaration of martial law and called on Nauvoo's militia. <br /> <br /> Of course, I didn't expect that the film produced by the church would be Presenting the latest rough history of the Joseph of Richard Bushman, rolling, but I was surprised and taken aback when there was a presentation of a little substance. <br /> <br /> And worse, the substance presented is not always cheap. must Two examples jumped out at me. First, translate the Book of Mormon. This film shows that Joseph is reading a gold plate in their two binders, which in fact are hidden far from the site. It is well known that Joseph made his translation by burying his face in the hat, looking at the stone of the seer there. The second inaccuracy occurred at the Carthage prison, where the crowd came into the cell. The history of the Church reported that Joseph had six athletes and shot a few rounds before jumping out of the window and signaling the distress of Masonic (as reported in Times & Seasons). <br /> <br /> Probably the reality of the gunfight will cause the emotion to break apart as the creator created. But by ignoring it, they are not faithful to history and fail to show Joseph as he is true: useful with guns and able to defend himself In fact, the impression that the film gave to Joseph was a good man. But it is a very delightful thing that everyone is attacked, thrown into prison, and finally being murdered in cold blood He is far from that; Joseph is a disciplined person who is determined to endure the hardships and struggles to bring the results he believes. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie but know it's a cotton candy. Then pick up your meat and potatoes by reading a copy of Bushman Smith's biography, Rough Stone Rolling. <br /> <br /> PS: Movies produced by the church do not have credit. But experienced eyes can choose a familiar face Rick Macy's is excellent as Joseph Smith Sr. and Bruce Newbold, who is loved as Thomas in the search for faith in Christ. Here plays the Methodist priest. Failed
