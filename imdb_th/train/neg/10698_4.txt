The Darkling is an interesting and entertaining movie, while F. Murray Abraham is in there. Spoiler: About half way, F.Murray is zapped because Darkling is a monster-like creature that enjoys life as a representative for him. Take bums and losers and distort them further while giving them all they need in terms of success. He draws pleasure from their seven deadly sins. However, part of it is that he needs someone who might be defective. But not completely evil Otherwise, he cannot "distort" their natural goodness. That is what the little man spoke with his Barry White voice, which I found both charming and amusing. Most fun Just like imagining Barry White, if he is a small dwarf, then he tells Aiden Gillen "Dee Plane, Dee Plane, Bos, come here, Dee Plane!" Robot) Talk to Aiden Gillen with sound. Barry White says, "It's okay to be bad. You know that you need it." "You've now committed a murder. You are moving around the world." It looks like an advertisement for "Being Evil" or something like that. It's a joke in a bad way. <br /> <br /> However, Aiden Gillen is not F. Murray Abraham and the movie tank as soon as Murray gets an ax (or a knife?) F. Murray brings joy. Very pleased to come to his role in this film He is a good actor. Aiden Gillen has a happy smile on his face and he looks like his English comp might help. I never hit a legendary character and he can't imagine what this movie is about. The ending is creepy and almost funny. If this movie is a joke, the ending is perfect. If it's not a parody, it's creepy. But using a small girl at a cheap price to present something that can't be done The people who created the movie disappeared, regardless of what they wanted to do before they ended. It ended as if they had just realized that they had no money and had to shoot the scene quickly.
