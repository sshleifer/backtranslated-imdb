It seems that this is the only film that John Saxon has directed and he has a good feeling to stop after that and is in front of the camera. This movie is a dog from beginning to end and it is boring and made of wood without anything going on. The Vietnam War hero is given a job for the mob-friendly leader of the wife. The leader's wife is killed by himself & the war hero is framed and sent to prison. Now, this prison is experimenting with inmates and is testing some formulas that will turn humans into the most advanced killing machines (zombies). Change into zombies and others who don't want to be there anymore. This thing continues and there is nothing special to show or speak for myself, and I stopped it before, which seemed to come a few times, but it was not a different and boring route. equal If anyone looks to the end, they may become a zombie, so don't risk 2 out of 10.
