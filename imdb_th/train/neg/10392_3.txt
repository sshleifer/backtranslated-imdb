I will ignore the synopsis of the synopsis because you know what this movie is about and almost no story. I have seen many investigators call ISOYG as 'anti-rape' or even a feminist statement, and I have to spy on the hypocrisy of these claims. <br /> <br /> First Other things to do Which we see on the cover of this movie? Right: The shapely young woman behind. Whether it's Zarchi's efforts to resist rape or not, and I don't really believe that, this movie is about sex marketing and intimidation, sexual assault and that content is graphics (every Like showing the actual penetration) that no one but the crowd taking advantage of the hard core will enjoy it) in this film uncomfortable, cruel and cruel Look hard There is something to say that it is a terrible crime presentation in this cruel light. But there is no reason that this scene will continue for 30 minutes. There are also minor character development of the victim and only one of the rapists has received little development. (The time before he was killed) So the scene didn't involve emotion at the emotional level. Actually, it was just a presentation to show violent sexual violence and you could tell from the movie that ISOYG relates to in IMDb ( Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) that attract attention from the crowd only. <br /> <br /> Finally, some critics admire the style called Zarchi's documentary and lack the soundtrack. But considering what is inappropriate in the movie (Acting, scripting, and others) I think these are financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he is stationed on the camera and let the actors do good at those things. <br /> <br /> I'll Do not sit up on my high horse to talk about the content of ISOYG. I'm all for exploitation / horror and love nasty videos. In fact, I gave this movie with three stars because it pushed the envelope far beyond any other movie. However, it still did not work well and after the rape happened, it was just bored seriously for the rest of the movie while We watched a bunch of Ho-Hams, mostly murdering less blood and waiting for a roll of credit. <br /> <br /> This may be worthwhile to watch once if you are a fan. 70 But I tell you that this film is quite poor and not worth the reputation.
