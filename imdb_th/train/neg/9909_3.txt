This is not a good Westerner. You received this bean, riding around in the blazing sun in a horse carriage with a shade above it, killing people for his own reason You have the same person sitting in a snow cave during a snow storm. So then you have a woman in the house that is in the middle of the shooting location of a wolf that is not there. What is the point of this movie? Bruce Dern did not find anything better to do, right? This is a waste from the movie.
