Soldier Blue is a film with an excuse: pretending to be a profound statement of human inhumanity towards humans in the interests of whites and cruelty to indigenous people. An unimpressive and miserable comment on the horror of Vietnam. Sorry, but it failed miserably to do those things. Soldier Blue is real, dangerous, disgusting, badly done, junk, dishonest. br /> <br /> Other investigators hit the nail on the head, saying that it seemed to be a hybrid of two completely different films. The basic thing is weakness, ancient thinking, love, "newlyweds" who do badly - Strauss and Bergen overcome prejudices about the ways of life of others and fall in love. (Blessing ah) - was booked by the massacre twice The place in the flick Lucio Fulci flick <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for a nasty climax, scary, bloody, drenched smoke, which a cute little Native American boy was shot, shredded and sliced ​​in love. And close-up graphics and Native American women, big breasts, raped, raped and stressed - without excuses, that is, except for the box office (The massacre itself, while disgusting at the wrong intentions, was staged and shot poorly. A group of actors lay surrounded by bright red stained signs. They intercut with a special effect sequence. Of cutting heads / cutting organs, which are really useful in filming. Now that's what I call exploitation. <br /> <br /> Forget all the stories you've heard. (Including ridiculous reviews that started and ended the film) about this as a protest "The indictment of the cruelty of Americans towards the natives This film does not give anything about Cheyenne's fate. If done, there will be some strengths associated with the Native American characters, allowing us to know and care about the innocent, unnamed faces that were killed at the climax. But what we get is the romance of Bergen's stupid white bread and Strauss. (At least there are punch actors like this) with a lot of blood, courage and the head that has been thrown away to attract attention. Want to know. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that is scary because there is a movie about The Sand Creek massacre about all real life massacres in the United States. (And the United Kingdom and every country called "civilization") joined this century?) This is not that movie
