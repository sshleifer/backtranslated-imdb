What you need to know about this movie takes place in the first five minutes: It looks good, but there are original soundtracks that reflect light in the late 60s and all except two different characters. When you receive a message, you may switch to another movie. <br /> <br /> Davies' protagonist doesn't care about his beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in his life who cares about him. Then, according to the time he introduced her to the real world - instead of living in a fantasy movie he was an imaginative director - he did so by pushing her out and pairing with the actress. Couples, laughing and prudent art direction are the only things that should be worth watching here. <br /> <br /> This movie is also interesting when Jason Schwartzman's papers fall from Mount Rushmore in Rushmore. Schwartzman is something that must be overcome. But here is the quality of his character only Schwartzman's family relationship made him a clear role in this role. Hope that his choice will improve
