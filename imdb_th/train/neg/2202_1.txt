This movie made me think that other people I had seen with the comb were an accident. The story has more holes than I thought I had seen in a movie claiming to be something more than a movie. "B" The performance is a laughing story, so even the memories of the past victories of the comb are enough to help. have Considering the script, I must imagine that there is not enough budget for things such as continuity and original concepts. I am very upset that I paid the price of this blockbuster for the trash. The fact that it was made for television is something that will help me avoid this cruelty and something frankly that this poor man should have to warn you. Avoid this movie, no matter what happens.
