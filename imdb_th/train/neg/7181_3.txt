Now don't understand me wrong, I enjoy Christmas movies. I love it. It's a wonderful life and I enjoy Christmas songs with George C. Scott and Alistair Sim But this movie is scary I think I love music. The ghost life of Christmas presents is particularly painful. Albert Finney sings quite well in Annie. I don't know what happened to him in this movie. But it seems that someone is trying to sing Jerry Gill. The only thing that recorded this movie for us was to mute and see the dance numbers that came with the South Park Christmas CD
