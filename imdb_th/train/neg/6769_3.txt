Failure. This film is not good. It has a sense of humor that a 5 year old boy will not laugh. I mean, of course, some amusing. But most can't. Lindsey Lohan is a great actor. (And a bad singer) and she should work in a better movie The movie should be aired as the original Disney movie for free. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is good about this movie is music. There's nothing like a remade soundtrack that will brighten your day. These songs are very good. Especially Alyson and Amanda's Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter's, Beach Boy, Fun Fun Fun. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 If I give ten, 9 then it will be a song and 1 movie. Not worth it. Your money But is a soundtrack
