I can't stop laughing !! This movie is funny and incredibly stupid! But it's okay. It's so fun! In this movie, you don't have to pay attention to anything! The same show - LAME! That dinosaur is the same - RUBBER (Oh, I saw a bar holding a T-Rex head for a moment). The raptors are the same from Carnosaur. 2 The T-Rex is the same, but in some scenes his head looks cute and seems Failing some of the projects from kindergarten Actions are fast, sometimes too fast. Actually, I'm talking about a quick fix. They fix it so fast that we can't see the rubber dinosaur, but it's OOPPS! Until late, they are tires! Now, the interesting thing here is to see Rick Dean in this sequel. <br /> <br /> What do I say ... Don't rent it ... watch on TV with friends. Have fun!
