Unfortunately, both animals and Eddie Murphy have nothing to say worth saying. This movie is not boring. <br /> <br /> Movie for kids? If you try to give them a nap It was just 90 minutes of some horrible animal mouth animation. And synchronization makes the old Godzilla movie look fantastic by comparison Meanwhile, Eddie "Pluto Nash" Murphy muttered with delivering a suspended image that was painful to the experience. Obviously he tried to fix his old manic personality, but for nothing in the short term, the miracle and miracle of the original edition of 1967 will disappear in a new fantasy or what it is The city wants to bully wild animals and blame them for not doing bad things. And Pluto Nash can talk about them. Things come with old jokes for conclusions that are not boring and not surprising <br /> <br /> Rent movies '67 or old yogi cartoons
