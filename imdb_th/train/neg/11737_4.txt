I do not think the image is not as good as most reviews do. .. But there is no denying that there is a problem. <br /> <br /> Most of the problems are in the script. There is a story - but not so much and certainly not that anyone can call it possible. It jogs out a number of strange characters and / or stereotypes, characters, lines, moments, whatever you have, and at the end it doesn't increase in this department. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I don't care about what "bad society" in Tentsworth might try to talk about; There will be a part of the population that is willing to do everything to destroy their brains, even if they have to run around the corn fields trying to steal ammonia or whatever they do. So in the movie, you won't find me called "Iowa". "Important" But at the stylistic level, the image is more interesting and some options of Farnsworth to show the status of Menghua's wig-out. Beautiful, hilarious, disturbing, and yes, I would say it's inspiring. /> <br /> The performance is uneven. But that may have been the death of the earlier acclaimed rhetoric See Sirosa Arquette is a great actress - but she's not very good here, so the members of the audience who have chosen to ask must ask "What's wrong?" It's strange that Diane Foster manages the simplicity and elegance that only a handful of other actors can approach anywhere. For example, I might seriously consider any explanation that Farnsworth can prepare for Michael T. Weiss's top reversal as a probation officer. But I wonder if I've bought it. It doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Then again, it's the most alive thing, and at the time I saw John Savage appearing in many years. > <br /> This is a tantalizing work but not a contract - and it's okay. No need to have Farnsworth and others to create movies. Therefore, whether or not there is any other movie left in him, look again or not. But if he does, it seems impossible In an era when people are planning their lives about the latest part of "American Idol", maybe we can allow illegal movies and undeniable flaws. <br /> Maybe more. We are able to welcome, not stubborn, energetic and sometimes strange in his imagination.
