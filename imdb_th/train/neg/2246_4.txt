I have never seen the original 1954 version with Judy Garland, so there is no comparison method. Many years ago But I found that this tale doesn't attract attention or love. This film tells the story of two lovers whose career musicians are heading in the opposite direction. John Norman Howard is a rock star that has deteriorated and degraded, starting with a romantic feeling New with the ability to sing Esther Hoffman. Her remarkable achievements only emphasized her depression. Chris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand lead actors are appropriate in their roles. This film is only important to me, the beautiful meaning of Streisand of the song that won the Oscar 'Evergreen'. She has a truly powerful and beautiful voice.
