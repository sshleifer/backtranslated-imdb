What is the sky? Is it a plane? Is it Superman? Uh, no? ?? It's TURTLE!?! Look, that's what will happen during the Cold War! Nothing except bad news and other problems! The Americans shot down the Russian fighter plane somewhere over the Artiker's land and the subsequent explosion caused the wake of the prehistoric turtle's creature named Gammera. He / she is not a ferocious animal. Because it will destroy everything and everyone on its path Finally, the controversial government decided to kill the ugly bastard with a new and advanced ice bomb. But Gammera is surprised again in the store? The cursed turtle can fly! The first time this happens will result in a strange and hilarious sequence! Gammera was placed on his back and looked at him when he suddenly came out of the armpit and he jumped into the air. How do you not love that? Then there was a scary sub story about an annoying child who could communicate with the telepathic monster. But that is not interesting enough. The turtles fly people !! There is very little to write about the sci-fi efforts of Japan (and the newly edited American). In addition, it is a clear and unscrupulous classic copy, such as Godzilla and The Beast from 20.000 Fathoms. And the design of the monster is very strange and unlike the movies mentioned above, it has never been successful in creating a bad atmosphere A respected actor like Brian Donlevy ("The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") doesn't seem to know what movie they are filming and even the original Japanese assault scene is unlikely. Very convincing. The theme - the music that is Gammera's own and personal, is quite good, but it only gets one extra point.
