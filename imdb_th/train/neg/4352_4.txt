If you see friends, writing will be very familiar. Especially during the 3 or 4 seasons of friends, often sharing the same funny settings. <br /> <br /> This list about the people who are connected is that they share the same class when they He is still a child (about 10 people). I think the age of the year). Now they are in the mid-twenties and they meet again in the classroom. This is the beginning of the series. <br /> <br /> General episode with many stories at the same time. They are usually not connected in any way. Each story line is cut into several parts, which are displayed in a mixed order. <br /> <br /> Sketch is my problem with this series. In later seasons of friends is often a situation that is quite stupid and difficult to believe the situation. One of the main characters made really stupid things that were hard to believe. The situation is more exaggerated, as if it's not smart enough. If you like humor like this, you might like this series. For me, it's a great closure. <br /> <br /> The reason I started to see my friends is because the first season has an interesting story and is especially reliable with the romance in it that makes you. Deep rooted for the character I don't have this thing. The character was too forced and the pattern was pushed too far. So it is impossible to relate to them and like them. <br /> <br /> At least with friends, it takes many seasons before it runs out of steam. The water will run out before starting.
