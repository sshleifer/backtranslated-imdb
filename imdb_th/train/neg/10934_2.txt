First of all, let me say that I am a LDS or more. I am a Mormon. So when I watch this movie, I automatically benefit from doubts. I often find things that are exchanged in every movie I watch. And this one is no exception It has a redemption period. But they are not far apart. <br /> <br /> One of the first things I noticed that caring for me was that Halestorm was ashamed of our church! In the LDS church, the congregation is called "ward" and the basketball court is in the "Cultural Hall". There is never one of these two names. The church has never been called by name and "standard" as far as talking about what our church believes. <br /> <br /> Does it really make me wonder if the director is LDS or LDS? This film has great potential! May show our church positively and help the public to see not only But what we offer But also what we believe But it is only mildly entertaining and left to be desired If I am not a LDS, I will leave the idea that Mormons are silly and ashamed of their beliefs. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie that I would recommend to my friends. <br /> <br> Sorry, Halestorm. You can do better!
