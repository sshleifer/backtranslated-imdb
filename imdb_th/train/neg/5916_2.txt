The slow pace of the film might be the director's clear intention to convey what life is like as a teenager in China. However, I found that the combination of 'plot' is glacially slow and the general filming style therefore does not exist to be alienated, especially to Western audiences Sometimes I have a problem telling some characters from each other because they are taken from a distance. Two hours and I was completely taken care of. As a person not only But interested in music But also the history and culture of China (And it's no stranger to Chinese movies) I can't share with one character. It's a question: If I don't like anyone in this world to like? Let Zhang Yimou give me Chen Kai Let the work of other Chinese directors I've seen. This apology effort was not measured at all. I'm sorry to see the Chinese cinema decide against this standard.
