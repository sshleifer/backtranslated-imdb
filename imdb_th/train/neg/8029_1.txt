My friend bought it (very cheap) and decided to give it to me as a birthday gift. I think I've never watched it because I know it's funny and the cover of the DVD looks pathetic. But then my friends and I got bored and watched it really. From beginning to end! I know quite successfully. But it's really a masterpiece It's hard to explain You should see it as a real lesson about what people can do when they believe they are creative and intelligent. "Performing" is a bad landscape. (You can see laughter, "female leader" can, on occasion, she is the worst) Please pay special attention to the "sheriff". This man is an adult and has no excuse for this. He's very bad as well. What it has a hilarious moment Try it. Haha.
