The SCREAMING SKULL (1 outta 5 stars) This film has a great debut credit. (Outside screen commentators warn that movie sponsors will receive a free burial if they die in fear of watching this movie. Swimming and scary music are prevalent). Unfortunately, this movie fell from there. The widow took his new bride to his quiet mansion ... Remind the servants and friends that the new woman had a very fragile habit due to the tragedy of the past. In a short time, she began to see and hear mysterious things that no one could do. Her husband confirmed to her that it was just in her heart and ... well, you might see that this will happen. You will know what happened before our unfortunate heroine ... because you may have seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and do better as well) to increase. A lot of abuse of the movie, cutting the majority of the film (In compilation of many cheap DVDs) seems to be missing in some important scenes You see the heroine walking slowly to the window ... She opens ... You know she's going to see something scary ... and then ... Suddenly the scene makes her cry in the arms. Of the husband Then what do you see I guess we will never know
