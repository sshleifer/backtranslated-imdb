Not much has been seen since the opening of the drama in 1970. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has become a poem for destruction in the theater in legendary proportions. Now, finally, the DVD on an unexpectedly handsome package is unlikely to win the hearts of many audiences, just as it was when it was first released. <br /> <br /> The best-selling book. Of Gore Vidal in 1968 is a cynic Most filmmakers feel that the story, structure and overall tone of the novel is not translated into movies, and the industry is surprised when 20th Century Fox not only But only granted permission, but also hired Vidal to adapt his novel to the screen But the studio executives had a cold foot: Vidal's alterations were repeatedly rejected and director Michael Sarn was brought in to bring the film to the screen. <Br / > <br /> The executives in the studio hope They saw that it was the goal of this film, but Sarne proved to be more consistent with the content than the executives themselves. Rewrite according to repeated writing Recognized actors and disasters have begun to fight more and more in her DVD commentary. Raquel Welch says she doesn't have any idea that Myra's motives come from one scene to another. Or even in a single scene, and each person involved seems to create a completely different movie in the accompanying "Back Story" documentary. Rex Reed says that MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is a movie created by many people who Significant weakness in their dressing room while waiting for their attorneys to call them back <br /> <br /> The precision shown by these films. The basis of the story of Vidal is there, but not only will there be a broader interpretation of all the meanings. But it seems that there is no point in itself Everything flows in many directions. There is nothing connected and there are many scenes that undercut, no matter what the previous scenes have logic. And while director Sarne repeatedly said in his opinion that he wanted to make this movie a pure joke, the only laughter that happened was a coincidence. <br /> <br /> The chief among those accidents This is the western mother. It is true that the West will be treated very well unexpectedly and she does not lose anyone with a single airline. But without the fact that she was in the seventies and was convinced that she remained silent The sexiest trick in leather shoes is that it is extremely insecure to say the least. But worse is the fact that the West is outside of her era. Her efforts to translate one's self into one of the most embarrassing things ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors are mostly lost. Raquel Welch, a low-key actress, evaluates the role of Myra as a Barbie doll on Rex Reed steroids, which is not an unexpected performer in the role of Myron. Only John Huston and player John Carradine, Jim Backus, William Hopper and Andy Devine were injured. Yes, it's an uproar that everyone is involved in this film for fear of being: fast when it should be slow, slow when it should be fast and not stop relentlessly from beginning to end. It is true that director Sarne has inspired the idea from time to time - using the movie clips of everyone from Shirley Temple to Judy Garland to make a difference to the action - but most of all when Whichever Sarne offers, he will do the wrong thing. <br /> <br /> The methods and reasons clearly in Sarne Sarne's voice do not like novels or for that matter. He doesn't want to write a screenplay. But he needs money He emphatically didn't want to direct the movie. But he needs money He made it clear that he didn't like the author Gore Vidal and Rex Reed. (At one point, he said smoothly "Not a good person") and to this day he thought that Vidal and Reed worked together to sabotage He refused to play in Their 'homosexual plans' - which, when you come down here, seem to be their desire. In fact, Sarne will film Vidal's novel instead of thinking of himself strange. <br /> <br / > Although he took some time to express his opinion, claiming that the film was a favorite of the gay community, Sarne never understood the attraction of this film for gay audiences. Along with the movie, Sarne appeared more than a little homophobic - and was quite the worst choice of writers and directors that could be created for this project. <br /> <br /> In addition to Sarne's comments And Welch and making documentaries, DVDs, releases, and many trailers and two versions of movies: "theatrical release" and "restore" versions. The only difference between the two is The final version of the "Restore" is printed in black and white. The amendment that occurred before the film's general release was not resolved. But is the details of the documentary, how they are Both widescreen transfers are excellent and the sound is quite good. But to end my starting point, this is the most interesting movie for film historians, film lovers and cult movie fans. I gave three five stars for selfishness alone. But everyone should go through it. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
