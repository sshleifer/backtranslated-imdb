I saw capsule reviews saying "Great performances" in my opinion, these are the two great actors who give horrific performances and with chemistry that is not centered on each other for excellent directors in the worst endeavors His tense Robert De Niro must be the most intelligent and illiterate person of all time. Jane Fonda's performance caused discomfort on the map because she was not clear in the character, mostly because the character was not well written like Molasses. It is too fast. Come Although the intention of this film is to raise the level of maintaining illiteracy But watching it is real "Sluggish" I gave 1 out of 10 truly one of the 20 worst movies on the budget level I have ever seen.
