The complete clutter of the film, directed by Bill Rebane. This man is responsible for the monster that resists the classic Monster a-Go Go. When I get to the end of The Cold, I come to the conclusion Unbelievable that this movie is in reality even worse than the 60s story ?? Like it is ?? A three-person millionaire who invited a group of people to a remote mansion to play horror games. Anyone who can endure and survive to the end will receive a prize of $ 1,000,000. It is a very simple plot, but Rebane can continue to follow the law without being able to understand. Happening The characters were completely forgotten. Nothing makes too much sense. And it ended up weirdly. I mean what the hell is going to end for sure? I guess you are left to draw your own conclusion. The production and performance values ​​are free from questions about pornography standards. In fact, Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) wasn't that good. She was so scary. Sadly, the same thing can't be said about this shit. Overall, it's just a bargain basement.
