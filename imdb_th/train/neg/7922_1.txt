In a distant galaxy is a planet called Ceta. Native people worship cats. But the dogs are at war with those who love these cats and they have no choice but to go to the world and crush people for food. This is one of the most stupid f # @ k! Ng ideas for movies I've seen left at Ted Mikels to make movies more incompetent than the low standards he set in previous movies. It's like he's enjoying Limbo's celluloid game. How far can he go? The only loser in this situation is US the viewer Mr. Mikels and his stupid little mustache. There are people who still buy this shit. <br /> <br /> My grades: F <br / > Special DVDs: Description by Ted Mikels, the story behind the creation (9 and a half minutes), 17 minutes, 15 seconds of behind the scenes videos; The works of Ted Mikels; And trailers for "The Worm Eaters" "Girl in Gold Boots", "The Doll Squad", "Ten Violent Women" (featuring naked), "Blood Orgy of the Devils", & "the funeral bodies"
