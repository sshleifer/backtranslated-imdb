I do not recommend this film because it is wrong and misleading. This should be in the Algerian territory. This Berber was shot in the Tunisian desert in the south. (A completely different culture, I know that I am from both Tunisia and Algeria.) Another shocking element is the character of her friend Aunt. Speaking in the film with a very fluent French, a French university scholar, while The character she plays should be a disturbed person, never leaving her mountain personality at all. The Bedouin that has studied that context is not possible. The most embarrassing and impolite scene, especially for people in the region, is the segment "femme repudiee" which is a pure invention from the writer / person. Directing Algerian society ever !!!
