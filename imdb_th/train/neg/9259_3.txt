'The Omen 4: The Awakening' is a sequel to the movie created from the movie 'Omen'. Instead of being a devil with the body of a little boy, he has the body of a little girl who is a wealthy parent who is bullied School and ended up taking revenge on those who did wrong. It seems that this movie will fight with horror factors and events that happen to be funny rather than particularly scary and it's hard to believe that this little girl is Satan. I did not find this movie very suspicious or scary, especially when compared to the original.
