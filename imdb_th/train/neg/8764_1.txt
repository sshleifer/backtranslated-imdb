This movie definitely tortured. First, it's 4+ hours long! In fact, the Kargil War may have many points that have been captured and fought, but every battle does not have to be shown. So this may be a documentary, not an advertisement movie as advertised. Of course, it doesn't seem like that because there is not enough background information and there are some bugs. The battle sequence was executed very badly. I am very disappointed by the people who give the order that works well on the Border. Each fight is exactly the same. It's very predictable. (This may be a spoiler) The army marched up the hill, five or more soldiers curse five thousand times at a time. (They use the same name every time) One of the leading actors was shot. Some people shouted at the cradle, saying, "Don't get a hammock. That will take 6 men from the army." The same thing happened over and over again. Oh and the music is terrible and very long. The actors of the movie are too big for their own goodness. Even if it is a movie that has a length But the character is still not developing Female actors have the least role. They all dress and show that too. The two of them are crying together. It's very funny. They move their hands and heads at the same time. Then slowly put their dupatta together. <br /> <br /> The program will continue. I know. I still forget something However, I think I have beaten this movie enough for you to get a picture.
