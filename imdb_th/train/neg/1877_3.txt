I do not see "Henry Fool" but after watching "Fay Grim" I'm not sure I want. Perhaps Hartley aims to be a director. "Anti-thriller" - He is sure to be successful with this yawn. From the official explanation --- the young woman found that the manuscript of the dead husband had content that could be a threat to the security of the country --- I expected to be a tense political drama. But I received a subtle structure, stupid dialogue, complex character traits, and "changing" tones. It showed that Hartley changed the script according to his mood at any time. I can hang for a long time with a frustrating and difficult to follow plot (such as "redundant") because I think that will eventually come together. Even if they can't or they do But they let the lingering question (such as "redundant") writing and acting clearly be able to attract attention But halfway through "Fay Grim" I went to realize death - I didn't know what had happened and I didn't care. Too bad because I like Parker Posey. Drop here to work with the ridiculous part that asks you to change from an unconscious and estranged wife and an insensitive mother. In addition, the casting of poor performers Jeff Goldblum can do very well. But he couldn't overcome the ridicule as the CIA He seemed uneasy in the role I was watching him. His close friend, CIA, is worse. He looks like a refugee from the semifinals of "American Idol" (there is a really young CIA officer with large hair on their foreheads). Then there are tough questions for the era. Of the characters Goldblum, 54 years old when he created "Fay Grim"; Thomas Jay Ryan, 44-year-old "Henry Fool" player, was not seen or looked older than their actual age. Even so, the key issue in this regard is that they act as CIA agents in Nicaragua. "Back in the 70s" Goldblum's character will be in his 20s. Henry Fool will be a teenager. Hartley is "strange" or lazy? Many problems beyond the list ...
