Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book "Requiem For A Dream" and co-wrote the screenplay for Aronofsky's film. The film was successful at all levels by offering a frightening and independent persona. From the horror of living characters and the evil that destroyed them, "Last Exit To Brooklyn" still has many secondary characters and characters that have a sad life. But it is not what Aronofsky did the same. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be anti-gay at times. Especially when in homosexual movies is equal to death One gay character was stoned, turned up into the sky by a fast car and parked on the sidewalk. The other was crucified and there was still much to be beaten Another exaggerated shot that might be interesting if it's done well is the scene of a union that waged a war with the strike-breaker. Who thinks that the drama about Brooklyn has a scene? Action and explosions of trucks <br /> <br /> Director Uli Edel has the same level of talent as TV director. But he is actually lower than the movie. This film is a nonsense that seems to be unable to set in the genre The lake received a useless role which any model could fill and Baldwin seemed to know how stupid it would be. In his equal part, Jennifer Jason Leigh became the leader of We hooked Tralala (believe it or not, I'm not joking). Her performance is great and the fate of her character is very dirty. Improper use of colors and elements makes them look cheaper and uses the "real" edge, leaving a bit more provocative failure.
