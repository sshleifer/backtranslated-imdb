I should use this preface by stating that I'm a fan of Dolph Lundgren. This man became the most fun thing possible and the detention should be what I liked. Dolph's spoiler, because the script is very ridiculous to begin with: the chase scene with a disabled child who carries a revolver with a man on a Harley with a sub-machine gun. School halls and kids win? Good game Oscar goes to the detention center. Thank you for the old friend's laughter. <br /> <br /> In summary: Great movies that guarantee laughter. I suggest inviting friends to find this and force them to sit and watch.
