I started watching this movie with high expectations. However, after one hour, I gave up on this movie because it instilled a question that had no answer for me. This started in the opening sequence and worse. <br /> <br /> Why are they buried Hollander under the statue? Why is there an Italian comedian? Why did the farmer's wife help the people of Holland? Why, when he was saved, did not run for life instead of starting to love the farmer's wife? Why did the farmer's wife not help the Hollanders at the time when the farmer would not? Why do these illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why do Italian comedians know about Holland's gold? Why did he hide it in the storage room among the evil farmers? These and many more questions appear, and it seems that no one answers the question in an acceptable way. So I think I lacked the issue of this movie and I didn't connect with the story in any way ....
