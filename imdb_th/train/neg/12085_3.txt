There is no need to really start this small review with a summary. I mean, it's a small village of Shakespeare for the sake of goodness? May be one of the best known plays ever written I'm not ashamed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet in the way most people in IMDb have ?? Through the Mystery Science Theater 3000, while acting may not be the best place to use to judge movies But in this case, I can't imagine trying to watch without comedy. The German version of Hamlet produced for this TV is boring. 152 minutes. No way! It's too dark and depressing to be anything I want to spend almost three hours. I've spoken many times But entertainment is what I want And this wrist splitter is far from entertainment However, I will give you a few points for what I feel is a fairly good performance. The 3/10 sound is correct for me. <br /> <br /> As much as I enjoy MST3K. He didn't help Hamlet be satisfied anymore. There are a few good riffs here and there, but overall, Hamlet is just the wrong movie for Shakespeare's MST3K. Talkative, too, will allow funny movies to have rhythm Or The flow any pains me as much as I need to Hamlet in the fifth grade, my MST3K.
