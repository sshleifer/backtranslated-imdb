I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival with a high expectation. This movie has excellent actors and is about to close the festival so it must be good, right? I am wrong. <br /> <br /> I know that we are having problems before the film. The director is talking about when he directed the episode of wiseguy. He met an unknown actor named kevin spacey ( The director / writer of wiseguy acts his debut = blah) ... Edison's writer / writer must have a photo of the spacey kevin that killed the homeless because I didn't see him. (Including other actors in the movie) will agree with this story. Disasters <br /> <br /> This movie is really scary! It is a mixture of old-fashioned boil every time the police. Nothing new with Edison. The performance is not good and that direction is worse. It looks like the wiseguy episode. This is the best screenplay about the story I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> An example of a bad time in Edison ... Morgan Freeman dancing around the apartment. His reasoning without reason to rock and roll music ... Justin Timberlake received creative criticism from Bell by candles ... llcoolj Ancient firebird driver ... 3 people were right Shoot at the head ... <br /> <br /> This movie is opposite to a good story. <br /> <br /> Stay from EDISON!
