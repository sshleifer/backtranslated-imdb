Oh, my ... I think CBS primetime television program is the worst thing that Gerald McRaney appeared in ... <br /> <br /> Four people were tried by mind control. > <br /> Computer, just don't rent it. <br /> <br /> I saw this under one of many names, "Gray Matter" and it might be one of the worst movies of Latest memory. <br /> <br /> Comments. Others are correct. It's terrible. There has never been a lot of pictures created. <br /> <br /> Never appear on the screen. Actors feel very bad. <br /> <br /> Terrible and terrible script. I can't stress how bad this is. <br /> <br /> Avoid as you are smallpox. <br /> <br /> This is rated (PG) for physical violence, Violence of the gun, <br /> <br /> Light, blasphemy and some situations for adults.
