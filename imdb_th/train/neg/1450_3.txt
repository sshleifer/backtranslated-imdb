If anyone really wants to understand Hitler, read WWI's history, not WWII history. Find out what happened during the war, how the soldiers had to live around the remains all the time The number of soldiers who lost consciousness from what they saw during the First World War at the time they called it "gunshot" now calls it stress, traumatic stress. If you learn the true horror of WWI, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how humans can become dead, not because of their evil. But just because it's the only way they can deal with the horrors around them. <br /> <br /> This movie, unfortunately Many others do that. Read some books about this and you should watch the movie. "The Way of Glory", the only good WWI movie ever made You will see the frustration of the soldiers in that film, the useless feelings and degradation of human life as nothing more than a bullet. <br /> <br /> That's what this movie is missing. Point to understand Germany The lost war, where millions of Germans died without any reason Then the most economic collapse after the war. These are the factors that make them crazy. <br /> <br /> The loss of family members and great poverty will always cause extremists. Unfortunately, this movie does not care about these factors and has just become another scandal to leave. With real value, there isn't really a movie, a character from a character, a character that can give you a better idea about Hitler. They just threw the Hitlers name on this issue, so it sold more.
