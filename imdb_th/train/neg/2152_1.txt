This film tries to be very smart and like Tarantino. <br /> <br /> Before you try, even if you have a strong movie background These include good sound, editing, design settings, etc ... <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the sound in this movie. Certainly I never distracted from the audio track again. <br /> <br /> And before we talk about low budget, movies produced in Chile, etc., remember that the sound you want today is more than ever. Received everywhere and more information about that technique was seen before. <br /> <br /> The sound in this movie is terrible. Foley is special, out of place and not always right. Atmos is equally awesome. I heard at least four clicks in the movie, which were the result of a bad sound correction. The noise inside the car is terrible. The sound of the car door is very poor. The woman's voice is singing the wrong song. Foley may be in the water or not there, like a person who is just bored and gives up the wrong space, everything about it wrong. <br /> <br /> And don't let the limitations of creativity. Came in the way while the movie was trying to be smart For example, the sound of an aquarium is used in the following street scenes. We hear when it shouldn't be done. Audio editing, prefix, image trimming There is a trick in every book. <br /> <br /> We have scenes that are used to cut, jump, hard, we have to fix with time lines, etc., etc., yawning all these techniques, imitating excellent standards, very low <br /> <br /> Overall, the mix was bad. So this movie is a shit Movies with many basic flaws can be considered for the rewards and high praise. New wave of Chilean movies What is the best creative work that Chile has to offer? I hope not and I don't think. <br /> <br /> My theory is that Chile has the ability to select and better avoid this film, such as the plague that may be caused by the content of the poem. This film received a lot of unreasonable acclaim called world movie lovers for the same reason. They are very happy about worthless things. Of course, film critics don't pay attention to technical and quality details. <br /> <br /> This movie is rubbish. It is the mouth and without pants and never deserves a score. 6.8 This film has all the quality of Tarantino's cheap, new wave inspired porn!
