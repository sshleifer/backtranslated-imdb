So they used violence and were labeled sick. Violence is the best thing that I fear. Unfortunately, the characters have not developed enough to let us understand why they are rampant. This film has a truly scary script. We never get the chance to get to know Robert and his actions at the end are pathetic. That performance was not better than this. The worst thing is to be a television program leader and school teacher. Clumsy direction enough to send you to sleep How is the school film project? Comments about the movie itself may be? Using movies, news during the killings, the climax is a laughing matter. Obviously these people are intellectuals. But deeply desperate Why do they have Yorgos Arvanitis that is great in lighting? I will never know. And the way they get money to build it at first is a bigger puzzle Terrifyingly beyond understanding
