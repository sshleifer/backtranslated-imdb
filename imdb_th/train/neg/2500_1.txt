Van Dien must be blessed with shame in the memory of this ridiculous movie. Everyone must be involved. To be honest, I'm quite embarrassed to admit that I watched it from start to finish. The production value is somewhere between the original series of 'Crossroads' and 'Prisoner Cell Block H'. Most five-year-old children have more realistic conversations and possibilities. For performances, if you imagine the junk porn that you have seen - one of those actions is filled with endless 'stories' to explain that the old peroxide blonde boilers were presented by the second tent Three things with a mustache - you will have an idea about the acting standards in 'Maiden Voyage'. What's worse is that you can't go ahead with the sex scene because it's not there. Scary horror movie
