"Dominique" is one of those films that show that "Slow molasses" must be invented. The order is endless and too redundant. (We saw Robertson walking down the stairs a few times because he heard someone playing the piano.) It was almost redeemable at the end with a surprising twist, which, unfortunately, followed with a twist. The second that succeeded in leaving bad taste in the mouth Not a very fun movie
