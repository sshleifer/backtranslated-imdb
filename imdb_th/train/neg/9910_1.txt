One of the worst movies ever Not a joke, bad TV movie genre, poor performance. Sad to see many famous actors hardly be able to walk. The heroine, Nancy, is not able to show a terrible direction, digested by bad TV movies The occasional weak joke falls flat. Even the basic evidence of the movie is not reasonable. In any way, they should stop the wedding that happened. But there is no reason behind their actions Slow walking makes my wife stop watching. But I can pass it The old man should act like a child and have him. But it turned out to be pathetic instead of a joke How do they get money to do this?
