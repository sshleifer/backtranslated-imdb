.. Oh, wait, I can! This movie is not intended for general movie snob unless you want to understand your general movie definition, such as "Continuous editing" and "Geographic matching" I can't tell where I am in this movie. One second, they are present. The next minute they predicted in the 70s, driving a modern SUV and wearing what seemed to me in the 80s style clothing. It's scary I think it gets attention just because it has 3d which I didn't watch. If you are a movie b-movie and by b-movie I mean the movie BAD shows that this movie is for you. It is a movie in the house and an unreasonable style will make you laugh as long as you are still awake. But if your taste is better for Goddard and Antonioni, just skip this thing.
