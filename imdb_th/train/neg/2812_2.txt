I saw this movie recently at the film festival. It is the love of an unemployed non-alcoholic man who has just come out of a big depression and a middle-aged woman working in an employment office (INEM). I find a simple story full of ancient ideas using themes. 'Society' of the movie and transformed into a romantic joke The actor works well, he looks like an alcoholic guy, but Ana Belen is not convinced that being a karma class, she looks, works and speaks as much as a 'enduring' woman. What I mean is Ana Belen playing herself. In all her movies The whole scene of this movie is very bad. Ugly photography. Don't use a good panorama ratio. The dialogue listened to the script and was almost boring. Comic situations are normal from Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny and cannot be solved well. In my opinion, this film is not worth watching. Only if you love Pereira's previous movie, you might enjoy this movie a bit. However, I walked out of the theater because I felt that I was wasting my time. The filmmaker is at the door. I wonder what the director's feelings will be when he sees someone walking out of one of his films.
