I want to make one thing clear - I love Michael Vartan! But this movie really disappointed him His performance is still excellent, he is still charming as always, and he still looks good. But the movie itself is rubbish! Natasha Heinrichridge, I'm sorry to say that it comes to manhood ... You wait for her to escape with her best friend, a sub-story of himself. My (Sitting down and watching movies with me) was taken away by the soundtrack in the movie; Sometimes the song is not suitable for what happened in the scene. However, this is not the worst aspect of what I found to be a very disappointing movie. I can forgive the leading women of the world. I can forgive the strange characters that are thrown into the mix and I can forgive the bad music choices. And jump to the end ??? Obviously, the ending is planned from the beginning. But the remaining method tells If you are a Michael Vartan fan, skip this movie: buy a poster for yourself.
