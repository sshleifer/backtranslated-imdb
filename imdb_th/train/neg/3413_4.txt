1st Watch 12/26/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): Cordy's funny murder puzzle with very little laugh This movie seems to be based on previous Italian films based on credit. But was rewritten by two romantic comedians who are popular in America But this by Charles Shyer & Nancy Meyers didn't cut it when compared to their other efforts. A story about a few Americans traveling by Richard Lewis and Sean Young. Stumbling upon a lost dog and hoping to make a huge income after receiving ads in newspapers When trying to return, they saw the hand stretched out from the garage door at the house of the woman they believed was attached to the remains of the women who should give them money. They freaked out and instead contacted the police and told them the truth that they made as a homeless person from the scene. It is expected to be framed for murder. Other characters in this film will meet on the train first. This page and around the resort, gambling, Monte Carlo doing things to pull into the story. Other actors include actor John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. After the police discover their death, they start to question the main characters and of course they have to work through. Their folly lies to know what really happened. None of the actors, the characters mentioned earlier, can take the film out of mediocre status, even with funny moments. Most ironic is provided by a pair Belushi / shepherd's not a scary movie. But it's not good There are a lot of average movies, and this is another story for the division. Try, maybe you like you probably won't.
