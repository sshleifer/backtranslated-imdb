If you like watching Mel Gibson in Million Dollar Hotel, you may enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in another movie that is so bad that it cannot be published. I can apply to the DVD version only. Therefore, it may be a better quality VHS model. But the night scenes and the dark scenes of the movie were not good. I first thought my DVD player was confusing. It's not. If you insist on watching, I suggest you adjust the color on your TV until it's a black and white image. If you don't do it, you won't be able to pass this movie. If you do that, it will remind you of a poor movie student trying to improve the style of Pulp Fiction.
