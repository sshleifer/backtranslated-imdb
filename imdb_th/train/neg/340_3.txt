I guess the reason for this movie was very good at the box office. Of course, Eddie Murphy. I think this is his first movie since "Beverly Hills Cop", so when he was hot When considering that there are more than two hundred million in income, and it is R, and this produces about 80 million, and it's pg, saying it's not all that is popular. I've never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy, so this may be another reason I don't care. This one has Eddie as a search engine for missing children. He must find a gold child or the world is in danger. The story is terrible. But also bad because it does not compare with special techniques I've seen things that were better in the 70s than what was offered. Ray Harryhausen did something better. Still, the main reason you see this movie is because of Eddie. Unfortunately, he is not very funny in this movie and it seems stupid that he made the scene of "Raiders of the Lost Ark". Let the fish out of the water But for me it doesn't work
