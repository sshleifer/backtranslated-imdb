This film is like Homer Simpson to bring it. "More boring than the church." Maybe I didn't understand it well and I think it started out well, but after (starting a spoiler) Hermann Brown was sent to prison and Maria Began to work / sleep with her boss in order to wake up. Maybe it was a symbol of something But the explosion at the end seems to be forced and out of place. (The end of the spoiler) In the end, I didn't see why others thought it was great because I found it very boring. Anyway, I didn't watch this movie with my own intention because I had to watch it in the movie class.
