In the way of it, Mister Enemy (Originally and more appropriate than Hallam Foe ?? I do not see the address of the character name "Mr.") as a tribute to good performances. Both Jamie Bell is Hallam, a creepy / creepy body that is physically attractive and Sophia Miles as Kate, his eccentric partner in sex and romantic fantasy, is credible. The problem arises when you try to connect their roles to what is happening in real life. A young man who spied on the details of the lives of people in the way that Hallam was hit by a pitiful hit And the woman in the situation of Kate is relegated and frightened - she may call the police. <br /> <br /> These things are not, however, what happens in the movie. Hallam's mother, the poor, died and his father married the woman he had a relationship with. Hallam certainly hated his stepmother and let him know. She has sex with him Kate is a type of worker who puts Hallam in a dishwasher and sex game. She looks like his biological mother. Everything ends happily with Hallam, "correcting his" problem ". <br /> <br /> Forty years before the play, and the movie that was a great show Optimistic And better after tearing apart The problem is that it doesn't always work like that, especially when nobody cares. In Virginia Woolf, the trilogy is credible because of the severity of the emotional revelation in Mister Foe. Emotional revelation never actually happened.
