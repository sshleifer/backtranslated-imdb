This show made me feel sick and separated from the British society as a whole. It's a list like this and Blue Peter who pretends to have / doesn't have a department in England. They often say things like; "Go into your attic and you may find this thing .." or "Go into your backyard tonight and ..." - something about us, the working class kids that never had "Attic" and "Backyard" "What is more than 1 square meter balcony on the 14th floor of the council building? Public Broadcasting - Yes! And more than that, it was very depressing when seeing a middle-class stupid child, a boy in the back of himself busy with old plastic with 'fun' ... I like and why. Your wrist or make a coke over size with the money "Mama and Papa's" ... You make me sick.
