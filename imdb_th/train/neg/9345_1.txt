I felt like I had been resisting on not falling. After reading glowing reviews (The director is a film critic for Sky for many years, so there must be a lot of friends in the media ready to do what he likes by writing good reviews.) I expect a stable performance, a suspense atmosphere. Developing a tragic storyline and period of poetry that 'sixteen years of alcohol' does not pass on most contract critics, sacrificing these qualities instead of the super low budget effect. (That is the scene of a clichéd spider web? Yes.) Unrealistic dance moves. And irrational thinking, numbing, fixing ancient views and camera angles. <br /> <br /> 'Sixteen years of alcohol' begins with an interesting picture of some beautiful places in Scotland. Unfortunately, instead of spending time creating an atmosphere, creating a character that we might be interested in or creating a suspicion - the director chooses to start driving you in a frenzy by yourself. The lead character is a person who is not sympathetic and behaves very badly - the audience doesn't care what will happen to them. Desperate actors do hopeless things ... like this movie! To make matters worse 'Respect' (as typical of the director who tried to pay the fees to the previous teacher) has a cliché or is not fully credible. The soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me and put me in the cinema. But even then, it failed to support other remarkable storytelling that linked a period of time and action. <br /> <br /> For some reason And will be quite honest, annoying I'm still watching all the terrible things. <br /> <br /> I guess I like trying to use realism in this movie. But even if they were destroyed when they were often cut with strange scenes and pointless scenes You don't have to spend a lot of money to create a truly animated film. There is a talk about a small amount of money that they have to do in this movie. Sometimes I wonder what the actors ... or their agents think. <br /> <br /> Go through this turkey if you are not a man of insolence or do not care ... not something. I think <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
