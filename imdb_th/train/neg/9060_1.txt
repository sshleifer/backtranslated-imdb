Surf the box and catch this on the logo. It is one "I have to watch this thing because of the very bad times" such as Roadhouse that is not happy. Writing is bad. The stupid actions and performances are not good. <br /> <br /> There is a low budget and there is a hell where this epic should be thrown and never seen again. I mean, the main character goes to the ski slope in some rental houses and the house is normal, which is not a big deal. But they chose to show that the mansion was poured down like a Sistine church I guess they didn't learn anything from Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (see the scene checking the hotel room) ... wow the bathroom !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I didn't buy everything at the top. If it smells like ... and it looks like ... well, you know the rest. <br /> <br /> Avoid like a plague. <br /> <br /> Edit: Obviously others Believe that because I do not like this movie, I am "Clear hatred" which I think can only mean that I am a fearful person, of course not true. I decided to do strange things, crazy and judged movies based on the actual content of the movie, not by its appearance. (That is refreshing to see ...) <br /> <br /> Of course it may be. Refresh to see But that doesn't have the advantage of being a great movie, just providing better materials to work with them and a more rigid direction. In fact, I applaud my efforts. Frankly, I should listen to the Kitchens of my Distinction catalog more than once again.
