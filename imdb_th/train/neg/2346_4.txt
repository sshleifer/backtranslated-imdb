I saw this movie for the first time in TCM's "Essentials" series. The eyes of the lamenting audience have never been more about this. This audience sees little value in this one. I was baffled by the endless attractions that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. In fact, Bacall is a beautiful woman. But in this film, her character is freed from temptation rather than charm. I think men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley tend to ignore Lucy more than falling in love with her immediately. In Baal's defense, this film was created at the time of Humphrey Bogart's final illness and the weight of his deteriorating health could affect her performance. Of course, part of this mercy in the part of Lucy is the comparison. She and Marylee coolly play with the handle and Dorothy Malone. The scene in which she is dancing fiercely as her father wears a ladder climbing up to a heart attack that is far and away the best scene in the movie. Malone's performances showed the rest, even though the fatigue of Jasper Hadley in the disappointing behavior of his two children was demonstrated by Robert Keith. In general, I must say that I am not a fan of the melodrama. The character's cartoon behavior makes it unbelievable for my taste.
