The only reason I give 1 out of 10 is because I don't allow to choose to make it zero from 10. This is the biggest time I've ever endured for about 75 minutes. You will be shown the worst. (And I do not mean well, like in KILLER NERD that has a very scary performance) and the plot is not only ridiculous, but nothing is the same What to do with the massacre The reason I rent this shit is because there is a massacre in the name. That said, there is only one kill in the entire movie and it's quite lame at. You spend more time watching children, quarreling and doing more housework. Speaking to children, the actor, the little boy, is probably the most annoying child actor since Bob left the house by the cemetery. I'm talking about it being shot in the video as well? If you want to throw away money and spend an hour of your life, look at it. But if you try your dollars and hard times, get lost as far as possible.
