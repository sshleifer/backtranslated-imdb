When I first started watching this movie, I was looking for some delicate metaphors. But soon I found this film about people on the train The interaction between people is like you see every day on the road and when there is a chance of a slightly more interesting situation, the conversation becomes boring and boring. It's not that I don't understand how this movie tries to convey the way people interact. It's just that in this movie, they're very boring. If you want to see and analyze these relationships, you should go out and buy a train ticket and see people on the train with you. It's like real But you won't go to the movies to watch movies about you sitting there watching movies
