Okay, just read the name. You will think it will be a good movie. At least I do It's a good start But it was very boring after the first half of the hour want The only problem is that her daughter's friend is a woman in the way. She often wins the competition, therefore pushing her mother to "get rid of" her. After talking to "the killer", the mother decides that the woman must be rough So the action took place. But eventually she was caught. <br /> <br /> The actors were great and the movie looked too long with nothing going on. Don't waste time watching this thing. <br /> <br />
