I came from the Dallas / Fort Worth area and lived in Arlington for a couple of years. This movie goes so far that it looks like Arlington. I saw mountains in the back of one scene! Texas has no mountains I guess that will happen when the movie should be in Texas. Filmed in Canada. The accent is not good as well. They should get actors from Texas to play the role. There are many aspiring actors from Texas in Hollywood. Although this movie is really sad because it's true. I pray that the killer is found and judged. One of the advantages is her death. Now we have Amber Alert to help find the missing child quickly after being kidnapped
