This item is unbelievable .. what it means and what it focuses on ... and words cannot explain how ET is crazy. What will they report? If a celebrity even indirectly connects with the story, ET will report that. If the poop dog in Tom Cruise's house, they will report this. If celebrities lose their lives .. they will talk about this for weeks, at the point that people generally envy that celebrity. If celebrities are in the process of trial... ET will report for MONTHS at the end. There is no end to what this item will report and there is no time frame to determine how long it will pay attention to the story Is it considered a legitimate report? Such reports are annoying as well, with a harsh voice and ending with unnecessary pauses to convey important feelings. I cannot see this program without asking questions about the existence of humanity. ET is one of the main reasons I avoided the list before the night. Zero or even negative For this show, deserve -10 stars
