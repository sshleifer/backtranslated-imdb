This movie is absolutely ... I can't find the word. Oh wait ... shit! I mean, when it started, I was like, yes, this looks good and after that it was boring. I almost fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that I was acting because it was the most dirty. Ram Gopal Varma tried her best. But the actor can't live with the original Sholay actor. I mean what he thinks to do remake. He tried to do something like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and won all the prizes next year, like he did for blacks? Ajay and other men are good, especially those who play raj because of all of them. He is the one who has to see Amitabh. What are you doing? He destroyed his own dignity by making these stupid movies. At first, Nishabd then Cheeni Kum. Then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now I mean you have to gather a little bit of his money and move away from Bollywood. Finally, before he completely lost all respect, and I told you that. I mean, all this is good for other actors, such as Shahrukh Khan, who has received a really good name. Amitabh's I never really liked him because he thought he was God and I just knew that Abhishek was going to participate in that movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save 17.75 pounds and use it with things. It's good to watch Hey Boy because it's the funniest movie that has ever been and is number one on the charts!
