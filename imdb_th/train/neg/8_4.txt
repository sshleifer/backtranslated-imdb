6/10 The show is not a great thing. But it's a good show. <br /> <br /> 4/10 The director makes a foolish decision for this movie. <br /> <br /> Writer 2/10. No reason. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Overall rating of the movie <br /> <br /> Don't waste time with this movie. I give 4 for this movie and it may be a lot. too The character is beyond the truth that they can get in real life and something that cannot be explained. "Storywise" is not a good way. With the style in which this movie was filmed, making you bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motion and camera shake and fast forwarding). It's always good that movies use music to make Smooth story But there are too many tracks in this song In the first hour, there were almost 50/50 conversations and songs.
