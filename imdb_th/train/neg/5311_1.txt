This is the worst movie you will see! 2012 Doomsday is currently pulling the carpet from below for me. The props are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa used to be called 'cheepnis'. It seems that the space scene was created in a powerhouse in 1950 before being destroyed. The song is really bad. The show is made of wood and ham. The characters that they show are shallow and unreliable. The storyline can be predicted. It is clear and clear immediately when copying techniques and ideas from other films. The quality of the direction of faith. <br /> <br /> But you must see it, if only to experience what must be one of the greatest garbage of a small budget that has ever been. Precious of stupid movies!
