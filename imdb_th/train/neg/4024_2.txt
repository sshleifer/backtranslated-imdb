This movie is really scary. Poor John Savage has to bend this low to be in another movie. He acted as a rare type of vampire who helped the girl who seemed to be washed out and thrown in a slow street, a dancer at a local club. She tasted a drop of blood from another dancer, a rare vampire, when they were taken to the dressing room floor. Savage was assigned by a short leader of a rare vampire species that seemed to Is a hybrid between punk rock in the 80s and a twins in Olsen with purple hair This movie has just been crazy by rapping and dancing with dwarves and tattooed spiders on his head, which is one of the rarest. He talks about Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante and I just have to laugh. This has just received rediculas. The most special effect they can do is Corri hurls her organs and pulls them out of her mouth. And you can tell that it's all fake Her son does not know what to do with the mother's new identity and becomes an enemy rather than an object of peace. I enjoy a good vampire movie. Believe me. But i just hate this movie Even the photography began to fade away with the camera switch in this way and tried to make it seem that the vampire moved quickly to keep the camera up and suddenly the camera turned into light in the scene of the son's chase. Corri around until he blind himself Avoid this !!
