I know that 'evening' is a girl movie, so I expect to be bored. An evil parody in IMDb said it was 'Chicks flicks' but your friends will survive. <br /> <br /> Can you survive? Yes. I'm still here. But when the two of us came out, we were surprised to find that it lasted only two hours - it seems to be much cooler than that! I think for Yanks it should be elevated or interesting because it's about the rich people who live on the beach - well next to the beach in the house with a wide terrace and lawn. But there is no clear mower If that kind of story impresses you, it may be a short movie. <br /> <br /> There is a movie about Monty Python about a knight who just doesn't die. He became a twisted person (why did Yanks add the third syllable to the words that I suspect)? The body in the street still shouted the threat of his nemesis. This film is about dead creatures. Vanessa Redgrave (The name that is not suitable for the grave shown here) continues and is dying while the guilt is inappropriate. She didn't worry about being a brainless person. <br /> <br /> Obviously, it's a girl's movie. There is a chapter that should be a character. Mr Darcy / Heathcliff I'm not a woofer, so I can't. Claiming to be a good judge of things, but boring people who mock in this role seem to have But the name of the servant in his favor only. He is a Cypher without blood. <br /> <br /> While you may gather the main character, not being a cop But a small character has a friend who is only responsible for responding to the news that his girlfriend is a fraud. Fair enough, but it's not the role of Hamlet - why the ham is terrible. Forgetting that it was a girl movie, I thought he would be thrown out because one of the good girl friends would tell him that the face fungus didn't flatter him. But then I realized that she had to encourage him to grow 'beard' because he looked worse if he didn't have it. <br /> <br /> I woke up by noticing that any actor and actress had a lobe. Stuck or free and observe interesting scenery if you are dragged to watch. If you can see a buffalo head stuffed with what you expect in a beach cottage, <br /> <br /> In addition to the wedding that needs to be done You think they will make it right. Unfortunately, a car accident that failed to run When the accident was discovered, the actors had to shout out the characters they didn't know were nearby (but we did as an audience) if they had no clue that the person was within a few miles of that location. Why do they shout for him aimlessly? I think the director's excuse is that it should be a half-remembered dream sequence ... <br /> <br /> Another view of my attraction is the copper bottom pan. I do not think that the technology to do this was developed until the 1950s.
