... and I keep zero in my personal level 1-10 I joined the movie since 1952 and have seen more than 1,000 theaters (I don't rate movies that I see on TV only). This is the only movie I ever gave ZERO points. <br /> <br /> My wife Me and I bring our four children (ages 15, 11, 8 and 6) and even children think it's terrible. In fact, it is my daughter (now 26) that reminds me of this website. (Surprised that this film has been rated by 4+) <br /> <br /> The animations of the dinosaurs are not very skilled at that time. (And even worse when looking back) The performance (especially Sean Young) is bad and the story is ridiculous. <br /> <br />
