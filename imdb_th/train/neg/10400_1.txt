Enough ... Sometimes they just have to stop creating a concept movie that has died a long time ago. The first film of the Tremors is excellent. The second is ridiculous. The third is disgusting. The TV series is terrible. And this film pushes deeper funding. <br /> <br /> In general, the excuse for cheap computer and puppet effects, we now have a series in the Wild West in the year. 1800 and they fight with graboids as well as the new updates of the first person. They have to learn how to beat them again. I think fun Otherwise, releasing this video, like Tremors 2 and 3, will go too far. Oh and I still wonder if there will be no record of these events ... They just forgot to record an event that had never happened before? I think this will make history, so our friends in the first movie will not be prepared. <br /> <br /> This kind of movie that destroys the original just makes me mad. Avoid this garbage
