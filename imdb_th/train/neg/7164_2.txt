This movie is more deceptive than ever, using actors who look scary like Walken to play in this junk, making it seem like he doesn't have anything better than playing boring characters like this! And the fact that this movie should be about witches and you don't really see until the end of the movie But at the same time, you have to sit and watch a boring movie while receiving or trying to understand. And you have to go through the entire path of the actors and actors who are constantly boring how you go through other movies and decide on this and how you spend your money just making the whole time without having to sit there I want to watch cartoons for the sake of goodness. Leave it alone, please!
