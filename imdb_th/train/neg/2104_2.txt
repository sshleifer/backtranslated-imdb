I bought this video at the $ Walmart trash. I think I paid more !!! In 1940, Bela Lugosi created the 3rd longest movie for a small studio (in this case, Monogram - a movie made mostly from the Bowry Boys movie), while the cruelty of most of these films did not approach the level. The horrors of his last successful film (Ed Wood "Classic", such as Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 from Space). They are poor movies and should be avoided. The most difficult death <br /> <br /> I'm a old junkie movie, so I try it. In addition, some movies that are less than good are really good - not this movie. <br /> <br /> What is Lugosi, a mad scientist who wants his rather wacky and violent wife Live in serum He cooks from a young bride. They have never explained why a bride is or why a woman is, or even a disease that his wife has - so you can see that the plot has never been hacked. <br /> <br / > Next, a really annoying female reporter (a type of Lois Lane without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to go to the bottom of these obvious murders in which the bodies were stolen! So she followed the clue to Lugosi's doorstep. Lugosi's house was complete with his raging wife, two female assistants and two strangers who clearly became the assistant's sons. (Ugly humpback monsters and dwarves) In nature, this brave journalist has repeatedly faded throughout the movie - it seems that bad news writers and good journalists have to go hand in hand! Eventually all the maniacs die - mostly due to their own hands and all is well. In summary, reporters and doctors that she just met decided to marry. And by nature, the photographer who was a mute of the journalist when this happened If you don't notice it, it is very faint in this movie. Or it may be because it is a slow and boring movie, they fall asleep!
