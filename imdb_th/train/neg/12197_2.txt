Beast Wars is an over-hyped, overpraised and overrated program. We meet the characters of the terrifying act that the creators have to endure the acid to try to show like this. <br /> <br /> Cheetor- Seriously. He must have a sensor bar with this man. Why did he not escape the audience with the same voice that loved Taz? (At least the Razzoff from Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is voiced by Slip & Slide) Action Blast - If you want the show to be absorbed, get the G4 Tranceformers Cybertron-a list that should go to the bathroom. Good Job Builders (Sarcasm) Myself slow and boring (At least the Super Mario game is better) This list has many followers saying that it will bring it back. But I believe it was canceled because of my own goodness
