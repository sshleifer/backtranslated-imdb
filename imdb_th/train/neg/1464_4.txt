I watched this thing, hoping to find something I never knew about the most embarrassing modern man in history and could not help thinking that history was rewritten in HITLER: RISE OF EVIL Hitler. Obsessed with his niece until he threatened to have a lover of one shot Hitler appeared in the gun in his hand, caught Ernst Rohm. Forgive me by asking. But not yet. The author confused Adolph Hitler and Tony Montana from SCARFACE. That was terrible. But what really offended me was that all of the historical content was lost in this mini-series. Germany lost World War I and the Allies had to pay a large amount of money to do so. It's an economic environment that makes German people - everyone - to return their pride and that's why they turn to Nazism. German humiliation in the 1920s caused by allied forces seems to have disappeared completely, so there is no way Hitler: RISE OF EVIL can take serious action as historical documents and I have not mentioned that Himmler <br /> <br /> There is one good point about the mini series and that is Robert Carlyle in the title role. Okay, some of his gestures are wrong and his voice is too loud. (The permanent record shows that Hitler has a soft, seductive), but Carlyle is a charming actor and he manages to communicate Hitler's charm on the screen. Comment in the British media that Carlyle is similar to the synth synth from Sparks than Adolph Hitler is unfounded and he gives a better interpretation of Hitler. <br /> <br /> I like Robert Carlyle's performance, but I hate everything. Other About this mini-series and wondering why it was originally created There is nothing to suggest to serious fans of history.
