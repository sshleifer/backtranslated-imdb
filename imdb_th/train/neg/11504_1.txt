AKA: Monday in the sun. <br /> <br /> I don't know what I just watched. Three men wandered to drink aimlessly by giving everything and everyone on their path. This should be a drama. But what is it that is a film without losing quality? Redeem. <br /> <br /> I have read reviews about the performances here, "Wonderful" and "Heroes". Unless these people should come out as the most stupid human protocols that ever walked <br /> <br /> All right? This is not a movie It went all over and lost everyone except the audience. I watched it three times and could not use my life to see what everyone saw in this trash. There is nothing profound here. <br /> <br /> It gives a zero / 10 score from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend:
