It's a horrible movie. It sucks. It's terrible. I don't know what to say about this movie, but the DinoCrap, which I stole from some critics with his ass nails. AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sigh .. It's not Roger Corman that I hate. It's a horror movie about God. Really, but what do you expect from a movie with a Homoeric graphics computer, which is another thing that CGI sucks out loud. I hate movies. This story is horrible. No doubt Roger Corman B-Movie is the worst and probably the B-Movie that is gay too. It is --- DINOCRAP! I'm sorry, I have to be offended at these times. It's just a horrible movie ... 0 / 1,000
