Seriously, I am all for the gooey romantic comedies and will be easily sucked into Miss Congeniality like Goodfellas ... but this movie? It's not reasonable !!!! And I did not talk about the suspension of willingness in an unbelieving abusive Why is her family in England? Or at the very least, why she has no English accent She felt warm with her father and he forgave her incredibly for the past two years. (On that topic, no one made a lot of stories about her being away for a long time) and what was the stupid set of bachelorette parties? I didn't even get the fact that the immunity she paid for falling in love with her - which could be overcome by making a better movie. I'm just saying that characters, settings, and stories aren't enough. In my opinion, oh, and the worst part is that the film director uses the most unresolved angle on Deborah Messing's nose - I'll sue the filmmaker if I am you! I mean, honestly, I'm all a woman like that. But why, in the seven years of watching the will and grace, I never noticed that her nose was incredibly strange? Oh! Because those producers are kind to you! This movie is like my least favorite movie ever. Armageddon is the fault of the creator, not the actor. I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with better writers, directors and producers. <br /> <br /> This is easily voted by me as one of the worst movies I've ever had. waste of time I'm just glad that my friends borrowed my DVD for me. If there is a way to check this star, I will do it.
