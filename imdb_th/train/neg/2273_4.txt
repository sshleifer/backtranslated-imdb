This is not a big disaster that I expected. But that's a positive story that I can explain in the movie. I'm not sure what the funny thing about this movie is. But I think it's a matter of taste. Personally, I don't think it's funny to watch the moron that lives like an idiot or stupid himself on TV But then again, I'm not a Jerry Springer fan in the daytime. I don't get bored with watching. But I never enjoyed it as well If you are in the mood to watch bad movies But it's not too painful to sit and watch. This is a good choice.
