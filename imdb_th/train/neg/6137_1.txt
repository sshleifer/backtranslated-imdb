Whew, what can be said about Gymkata that is not yet? This is nothing but purity from beginning to end. If you want a movie that will make you laugh on the floor, this is the perfect movie to receive. From the combo of Mallet / Cabot's wild sweaters to Parmis (And it's a four billion tribe) Everything about this movie has a lot of crap. <br /> <br /> In the game of Bruce Lee's death, he shows again the lack of ability. Directing other faces that you don't usually remember will appear for your enjoyment as well. From Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, even if you can't remember or care about them after the movie is finished > According to the book called "Scary game", which, if I could find any trace of its existence, I would be interested to read it to see where this was wrong. But it seems that this book will be part of Gymkata's imagination. There may be something that Clouse created to sell his ideas. <br /> <br /> Choose this one and Yakmallah yourself. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen easily.
