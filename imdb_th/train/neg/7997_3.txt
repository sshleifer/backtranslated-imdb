(Although entertainment for reasons that are not intended), it is really disgusting. Obviously, these ants with bulldogs near the inn ate poisonous waste for decades and now have been modified by biting poisoning - hundreds of these bites are life threatening. Seeing some famous actors awkwardly falling among small black spots is a painful joke in a bad but bad way. Many scenes look ridiculous: a boy trying to fall into the trash while Attacked Susan Somers, crying out in horror while lying on the bed. Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathe through the Bernie Casey wallpaper, pretending to the game's legs, the list goes on and on The apparent danger ranges from ants crawling from the drain to the black lines of ants all over the wall. The actor for this film is not bad on paper. But it seems that none of these actors believe in bad content. Myrna Loy must sit on a wheelchair through this horror movie.

Although it is a bad movie But it can be viewed - for me, and there are many bad qualities in these films - the infamous beginning actors themselves feel like being a TV and a terrifying creature with men. This time, men must Push your hand into the ant pile to get really scary consequences.
