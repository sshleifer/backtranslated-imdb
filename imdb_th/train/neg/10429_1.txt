The first half is ok. But the second half was really disappointing. It's funny. The manufacturer even admitted that they had no clue for the ending and it really shows. The sad thing is that I have to write a minimum of ten lines to be able to post this. I do not want to include spoilers for my opinion because the performance is not worth the effort.

Going up to the border in the first season of being a space porn Eventually they cleaned it a bit and actually had a pretty drama so I started watching again. But at the end of the series, Kara is the angel of the cyclone as well as Ballar and the other six are mute.
