Usually I won't rent a movie like this because you know it's not good, just look at the box. I rented seven movies at the same time, including Nightmare on Elm Street 5, 6 and Wes Craven's new Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I got home I found that the guy videostore the guy who gave me the wrong tape in the box. Wes Craven's new New Nightmare. I met a lame movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly boring, bad performances and plot is not reasonable. It's hard to write good reviews because I don't know what this movie is about. At the end of the movie, you have more questions. Answer <br /> <br /> In 'Maximum power of 1 to 10' I rate this movie: 1 <br /> <br /> PS I want to correct See Corinthians (My bottom) He said that Robert Englund was tearing undergarments, riding naked, etc. The person who did that was Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mer, not Robert Englund.
