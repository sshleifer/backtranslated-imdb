I read the comments that came to IMDb and thought that I would watch this movie disappointed. In a positive light, the guy who is leading is good and taking interesting pictures. But overall, this movie cannot be convincing. Seems to be full 'The importance of self-indulgence in trying to say something meaningful But falls short and in the whole picture is an unbelievable thing. <br /> <br /> It is one of the movies that are movies. Noir, which can be defined as follows: <br /> <br /> "Film noir is marked with the emotions of pessimism, fate, danger and disrespectful characters." <br /> <br /> That is the story here: 3 losers stumble on each other with their common problems, which include mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, debt etc. and together they conspire to kidnap children and outwit each other well. g /> <br /> If it issues were <br confined to kidnapping over the character being kidnapped. I think the female lead is far from her depth and comes as an amateur actor. <br /> <br /> While I have a good time, I feel that I have wasted my time. br /> <br /> 4/10
