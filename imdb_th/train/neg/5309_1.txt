I saw the film late one night and didn't want to believe how bad it was. I always enjoy bad movies. But this movie is so disgusting that it doesn't entertain Some of the highlights of this film include ridiculous songs that are played continuously throughout the movie. Ugly effects (When someone is shot with a laser gun, they turn into neon green and immediately decay) and disgusting performances. Actually, acting is something that I feel stole the performance. I don't know the actors in the movie and I hope I won't see them again. Overall, I recommend renting this movie. (If you can find it, I can't imagine a video store that has this junk) so you can learn to appreciate quality movies after seeing this trash.
