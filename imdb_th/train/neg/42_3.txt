From three names from Jess Franco to finding a way to an offensive official DPP video (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars). This is probably the least worthwhile misconduct. Rape scenes and numerous nude scenes The savage tribes that worship 'Devil gods' that lie in the forest (Native Popon-Ta-Poon, who likes to eat the heart of a female sacrifice) <br /> <br /> hired by Laura as a delivery agent for a $ 6 million ransom for Peter Weston mercenaries (Alperliver) The brave and his Vietnamese veterinarian travels to the island. But encountered problems when the villain tried to cross twice Laura fled into the forest But ran straight into the arms of the native people on the island who gave her to their gods. <br /> <br /> Franco leads the director in his unfamiliar style. His usual terrifying trademark: blood shit, filming evil movies, fast zooming, mass shooting of targets, from focusing on images, awesome sound effects and ham editing. The result is a truly difficult mess in trying to sit from beginning to end. (It takes a few seconds to do things) and even Buchfellner's eyes that are charming in nature are not enough. So I come back to watch this movie soon
