This movie is scary. Is the fight scene appropriate? The performance is really bad, as you can tell that they are reading their script from the card. With the painful delivery of everyone in the show Thinking of watching high school drama and the cringe that is clearly the lack of smoothness of the actors' interaction (stop strange between the characters of various characters, as well as the delivery of other rows quickly). All stages may be forgotten. But many movies, including plot settings and family guy styles, cut off the way that didn't respect (Oh wow, they don't do well) I think they're trying to be funny with these things. But it turns out that a high school student / college student who attended in the afternoon tried to set up a funny Youtube clip. <br /> <br /> Now it's the fight scene. They weren't bad when considering the level of quality seen from anywhere in the movie. Nothing is absolutely fantastic, no matter where it is at the same level as any other poster specified (nothing like the Drunken Master). The fight has too much sense of the scene, with cuts to many different angles. There are distinctly different positions by those involved. <br /> <br /> In summary, the only reason to watch this movie is if you are one of the male friends involved in the production. This course is very cheap Which man you might ask? Oh, the same man who wrote, directed, directed, created and stared in this high school masterpiece.
