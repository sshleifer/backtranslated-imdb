The Good Earth is not a great movie, either way. It's normal. May be different in the 1930s, but who would want to see the lives of farmers It's not interesting for me. Yes, Louise Rainer and Paul Mooney do a great job. But this film dragged too long I can tell you the ending of this movie from the first show. In short, Wang Lung (Muni), a farmer who doesn't want to be like his own father, becomes like him. Both fell in love with their wives as if they were on a deathbed. This film makes the story 360 complete from generation to generation. Also, this film has no good actors or funny moments, it is a depressing story about being a farmer during the crisis
