pakage says Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn are robbing a big bank But that's not what I got out! I didn't get anything! In the first half, there will be new characters. (Without introduction) In every scene, the first half hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is a long and annoying chase scene. There are always annoying background sounds, such as loud clocks, loud sirens, whistling trains, or even scary scores. Quincy Jones has a lot of ridiculous pieces as well Like a bad guy chasing Betty on the ice with a car! Or the police arrived at the scene about fifteen times I really hate this movie!
