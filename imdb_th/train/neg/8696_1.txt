I am Anthony Park. Glenn Park is my father. First of all, I would like to say that the story behind this film and the Amber Alert system is very good. However, the movie itself is not good and the performance is very bad. The major problem I have with the film involves the second half of Nichole Timmons and Father Glenn Park. The events surrounding that part are not entirely accurate. My father was suffering from mental disorders at that time and took Nichole up unwittingly to hurt her. He loves her like a daughter and is under the idea that he is rescued from danger or neglect, which he believes comes from her mother who cared for her for the last 3 years that my father took care of her. And lifted her up quickly to let her mother entertain This film shows my father in a way that he will hurt her in form or form. The funny thing is that Nicole spends several nights at my house, while Sharon is working or doing what she does. The first reason my father thought of violence was because he had items that were thought to be weapons in his truck. My father is a gardener. Items that they considered as weapons are garden tools that he kept in his truck at all times for work. My advice is to bring this movie with a grain of salt. It's a good story and depends on real events. However, the details of the movie (at least Nichole Timmons - part at Glenn Park) are incorrect and represent the failure of the person. Direct Discover the truth in storytelling. The funny thing is that if the director will interview Sharon's friends who know the situation, they must specify what I posted here.
