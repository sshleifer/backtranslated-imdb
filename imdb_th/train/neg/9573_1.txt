Did not completely close the wall in a good way But totally stupid. "Killer Tongue" is a combination of cyan-fire, horror and comedy. This means that it is a movie that is completely disinterested and inconsistent. There is very little dialogue, which is largely a result of the fact that the script, if there is one, will be completed "waste pond". I don't even call it strange, as well as "totally ridiculous". You receive a warning. There is no reason to waste time on this matter and if you do that, the pungent smell will remain like rotten fish. .......................... ........................ ............. MERK
