There is so much to do here. The actors are number one and the script gives the best dialogue to capture the atmosphere of a family that is woven and cute. However, for this reason, the movie is not loud. We saw Leo, who clearly knew about his positive HIV diagnosis, a reaction that was inconsistent with the supportive atmosphere in which he found himself. The movie ends with avoiding the things that Leo, his brother and the close family in this family face with love for him. A young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is generally impressive as the rest of the actors. Unfortunately, the dramatists could not decide that they wanted to have a profound thesis on the impact of HIV on families with attractive work or anything that destroyed HIV wash While this film provides food for thought, it makes the audience want more than it gives.
