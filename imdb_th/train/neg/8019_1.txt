I read the opinions of other users on this board half a dozen and it seems that the opinions are very different. I have to agree with those who find this movie scary. It makes me difficult to write that because I hope it will be great or I will not pay attention to see it on another day. I like supporting indie movies, especially if they are gay themes. But this movie is almost resistant Those who walked away as I thought to do after about three minutes might not think of peeling $ 11.00 or thinking that it was nowhere fast and without improvement. Maybe I'm a bit more optimistic than them .. Otherwise they won't pay first. <br /> <br /> Logan is bored. He's a klutz. He's gay. Because the main character in the movie is boring, doesn't mean that the movie about him must be boring too! There is an endless scene of this kid just laying around like washing, reloading, everything you've learned in the first scene and the second scene, etc., etc ... Nothing or none. No one speaks anything, even in depth or funny or interesting. Probably the most shocking thing is that I didn't feel the attention to Logan. That is an important achievement. He didn't grow, he didn't change, he didn't learn. (No one taught him anything) He didn't do anything and didn't make a movie! The scene after the same scene did not create a movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the title is not reasonable. 1/10
