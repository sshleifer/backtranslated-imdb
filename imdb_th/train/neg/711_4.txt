I'm not sure if this is a spoiler; May be a public service If you are one of the people who focus on instant gratification at the end of the credit, you will miss the last line of the final news announcement of the credit announcer, stating that the United States recently surrendered to Nazi Germany on 7 May 1945. To end the Second World War. This is just a few problems with this closure: <br /> <br /> 1) Older audiences have to think in mind, equivalent to two or more movies. Based on stories that are not in their eyes to fill the gap between movie events And this shocking conclusion. <br /> <br /> 2) People will literally kick themselves, that they don't "watch" one of the films created in their heads without charge. Spend instead Of peeling time and money to see this from a video store (Or on cable) <br /> <br /> 3) The final credit sequence of imaginative news announcements may be the first information that young audiences experience. The Second World War led them to the conclusion that George W. Bush was the latest heir of the Nazi throne.
