And forget this completely. If you want to see the Madonna act for rent "Body of Evidence", at least Willem Defoe is in that scene. <br /> <br /> In this movie while the scene is beautiful . You will not miss anything. Bruce Greenwood wasted Jeanne Triple Horn as a pole and Madonna was very scary. It was fun. Why do they have to engulf the original movie in this messy story? I will never know. Guess that they think it is "bankable". Madonna as an actor is definitely not. <br /> <br /> If you rent the original movie since 1979, you will enjoy it and the actors in it can actually show. 1/10
