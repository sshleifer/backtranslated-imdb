... but it's a lousy movie like Maltin says that this is the effort of Christopher Lee to create a serious horror movie. It's serious ... too serious! The story is stupid and slow. (Something about the old man residing in the body of a small child to achieve immortality) ... This movie is all talked. Actually, I slept a few times! This movie is very boring! The actor sleepwalked through this, with the only exception of Peter Cushing and Lee ... but this may be a work of love for both of them. Avoid all costs ... unless you have insomnia ... This will make you sleep!
