Macy, Ullman and Sutherland are great, as usual. Ritter isn't as bad. What is her name as usual? It may be a good movie. Bad plans are bad. It can be completely predictable, monotonous and boring. <br /> <br /> From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the movie is arranged like a child's drawing using numbers regularly. The character is a piece of cardboard that has been cut. There is nothing new or interesting to say and that is worth more than all the performances, which is a pity. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the script writer is not a victim. Especially with the "precocious" line from completely unbelievable children. <br /> <br /> Again, it's just a show that prevents the score from being much lower.
