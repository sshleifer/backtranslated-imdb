Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy partners in history and deserve it, so I'm happy to watch their movies. In general, men at the Horn factory will be the fourth person to crack and soon Ollie will break with all the horns. He was resting at home with Stan. He wanted silence and a doctor's phone. (James Finlayson) to say that he is coming to check Ollie. After knowing that the plumbing and electricity were muddled by a repairman with a strabismus, the doctor came in and after the test, he recommended drinking goat milk and receiving ocean air in the ocean. After Stan practiced playing the trumpet by going out the window by telephone line and the car crashed him and Ollie to the pier to rent a boat. They waited for the boat at the harbor to try to milk the goat and Stan brought his trumpet! At the same time, the first page of the newspaper read that Killer Nick Grainger - Escaped Convict (Richard Cramer) fled. He then sneaked onto the children's boat while they were asleep and the goat chewed through the rope. In the morning, look at their location and the murderer came out and demanded something to eat, and he saw Stan and Ollie do fake food like Line for spaghetti, cheese soap, belt for bacon, sponge for meatballs and he forces them to eat it. When Ollie begins to choke on something, Stan blows the trumpet to help and Ollie's anger causes him to kill the murderer and it will continue until the police arrive, just to let Olly's anger go to prison. Have the least funny moments But not black and white movies "Well, this is another good mess you get!" Is number 60 in 100 years. Price 100 and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are number 7 in the comedy of comedians. Okay!
