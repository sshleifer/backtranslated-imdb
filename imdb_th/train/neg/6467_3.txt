I still don't want to believe this movie. They have so many unbelievable things that it's hard to believe that everyone wants to create it. <br /> <br /> The story is funny. But in terms of being funny How do you mix funny, slapstick characters with train robberies, prison movies, urban collusion, funny stories and FBI agencies? You can't. <br /> <br /> In addition to the horrifying director The most obvious is the actor. I watched this movie and thought: 'Is this really Marlon Brando? No, it is impossible (5 minutes later). Is Charlie Sheen this? Wow. Maybe Brando may be true (5 minutes later). This is not Donald Sutherland (5 minutes later). Not not Mira Sorvino. Too much for all of them (at the end) No, no, no, certainly not Martin Sheen !!! Not for 10 seconds of the movie like this. 'And it ended and I went down with excitement. Many good actors and Oscar-winning actors often convince actors in stupid, stupid and scary movies. I don't want to know much about how they acted in this story. They don't have much money. <br /> <br /> Just an incredibly stupid movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 5 (1+ - 6-)
