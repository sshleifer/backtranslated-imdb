I just received 4 special versions of the UK Superman 1 for $ 5. Additional things include the 1951 Superman and Mole-Men feature, so I slapped it on the DVD player last night and this is what I found. br /> <br /> The first disappointment - I didn't check and I thought I was tagged as one of Kirk Alyn's publications. I'm not a fan of George Reeves as Superman and I never saw anything. Besides the translation clip Of Kirk Alyn - but hey ho that's okay <br /> <br /> production of black and white. Less than an hour It gives the feeling of two episodes of one of Reeves' first television series, which are two parts together in theaters, although IMDb says it was filmed in theaters before the first TV series. In any case, it is a strange choice for the reason that I will go later. I am as old as I remember TV and movie productions which are limited to one or two places and scenes, so there are no major surprises here. Still, for movies with a low budget, this movie has a really low budget. <br /> <br /> A story about the small town of Silsby - 1,430 people who are shockingly still the source of the deepest oil wells in the world ( 6 miles) The story opens with the supervisor of the pond that quickly follows the steps to close the pond. This contradicts the arrival of journalists from Kent and Lane to report about the ponds according to the orders of the oil companies, while Clark is inhaling the fact that drilling into a 6-mile radioactive cave has a strange little man Two people (small, large, big, black, in a bear and a bushy eyebrows) emerge from the drillshaft and start spinning around the city with a dazed facial expression. <br /> <br /> The mind, a deep storyline, now here is the rest of the children are scared some children, so Jeff Corbin Ray (played xenophobe rampant in the city) rallying friends to kill. These "creatures" Superman stepped in. (Not effective enough) and caught one of the little children shot and taken him to a local hospital Corey's friends burned the hut that other little friends had hidden and thought he was killed. But he escaped and laid it on the shaft Corey seduces the crowd. Lynch (Even with the sheriff arrested him) to hang the male mole in the hospital Superman stops them into the hospital and is injured. A chappie at the shaft to send him back to his group. Molson - all 4 men appear with some weapons that they shoot at Jeff Corey. (I call this the Aargh! Gun gun because the effect seems to make Corey go "Aargh!") And Superman helps him. He immediately changed his method because of the surprise that Superman helped him after he behaved himself. The mole-man went down to the end. <br /> <br /> Although the film is long, Only one hour But there are a lot of creeping things around. Be careful and chase - I have abandoned "Mole-Man 1 creeps from A to B all looking out to make sure no one is following him." Mole-Men never Participate in any case - they don't have any conversations - they just open up, get persecuted and go back. They look a little creepy. But they are hardly a monster that reacts to the city. <br /> <br /> Reeves is a very good Clark Kent - a very difficult journalist. Phyllis Coates' Lois Lane is quite cold. But he is a scary and terrifying superman. Not only will he not look in the (At least his hair will be dyed in black in this story, which is an improvement from the relatively light hair he wears on the TV episode). The way he plays it all wrong in my book. I'm sure he was ordered to "stop" (which Superman continued to do), but some people should tell him that the fist on the hip should not be punched on the ribs. And he acted as a superman as a strict and very cowardly teacher - he didn't wiggle his finger in condemnation But he may do it as well. <br /> <br /> And Superman walks around a lot (I say a lot - he's not in it all) and runs a little. He traveled and landed a few times. But not seen on the flight at any point Oh, some bullets bounce him out and he uses Clark's telescope. But no visual effects In fact, the visual effects are obvious if there is no identity and some parts are not very good. <br /> <br /> I tried to consider this effort based on the standard of time: But even though those standards, I think it's a flaky effort. Fortunately, the production standards in the TV series are higher, and at least they have a problem creating a story with a little more of them. <br /> <br /> Something that disappointed - I didn't watch. It again
