This is a stupid movie with a predictable story and a terrifying performance !! Willy Nelson is as strong as a braided line. This movie looks like a very long ad for the bright red lipstick that Jessica Simpson wears, especially when there are many close-up faces. The location is not amusing and, as I said - can guess, regardless of the money spent on making this movie, it's a shame. The reference to the old movie of Marilyn Monroe did not add to watching the blonde ambitions. It's also unbelievable - Jessica Simpson can step into the top management position when wearing a hat - it's ridiculous !!!
