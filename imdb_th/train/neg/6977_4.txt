I have read all the reviews here and are impressed with the imagination of those who like this movie. I can not say that I found to be very recommended. Leonard Cohen's audio track is not only too heavy and too boring to measure This movie looks realistic enough. But there is something going on to make it work and nothing more: a rough plot (not a real problem for me), not a lot of character development, nothing It's just a flick along. There is a flaw as before. Cimino's "Heaven's Gate" has a truly surprising time and is a movie that I'll watch again soon. For the great revival of the West Coast "Deadwood" of HBO is better than "McCabe"
