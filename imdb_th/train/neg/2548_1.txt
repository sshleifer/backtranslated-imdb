The fact that this movie makes every path to rental in Norway strange This movie is so bad. The quality of this image is just a little better than you get from a mobile phone. The main character is simple, annoying and the rest is sucked. Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed. The fact that people who create this movie put their names in this special story. And distributors; Do they agree?! This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Labeling this as a joke is an insult to humanity. I want you not to support this movie by buying or renting.
