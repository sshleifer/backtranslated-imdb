After holding her (Although she came willingly) and threatened to have sex (Other events that she was willing to do) He revealed that he had kidnapped three men who had made mistakes in the past. Then he decided to kill her (huh?) But was foiled and died instead. (Or something like that) and she was furious in the basement. Unfortunately, <br /> <br /> Okay, writing is bad: it's long, full of hundred and ten words. Is it too much? <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible: wait, show? <br /> <br /> Filming sucks: the home video isn't good enough. But the video from the cemetery for 20 minutes is just a curse. <br /> <br /> And the budget is funny: understand ...
