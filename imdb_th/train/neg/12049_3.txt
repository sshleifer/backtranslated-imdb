The box for "To Die For" sucks me in. - The fat man wears a shirt and promises to laugh and have sex. There are many Thomas Arky (Simon) that are easy to see. But without laughter and a little sexy. <br /> <br /> Both Mark and Simon were accused of being together for many years. Enough to pay attention, so it's hard to imagine that they will take care of each other The offense seems to be in the script, not acting. Both actors do the best they can with what they get. <br /> <br /> The ending is happy and undaunted. (Well, not totally affected, I'm relieved that it's over) <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie about gay relationships and AIDS, that's a joke "Looking away from it" is much better.
