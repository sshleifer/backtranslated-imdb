I am a big fan of B5, especially at the end of the third season only. I honestly watched every previous season when published, concluding that it was one of the best stories that I thought would hit the TV. Even when filling because it is interesting The movie has been well produced and entertained like everything that will be screened in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Which leads us to 'The River of Souls' By nature, after seeing everything else, I have high expectations. Martin Sheen appears to be acting in the Ed Wood movie rather than the serious sci-fi story. However, apparently it suffers when it is time to use this idea in a two-hour movie. There are no special effects that will entertain us in the absence of interesting stories. There are places where they can clearly see a short time and just a temporary dialogue to fill the story out. If doing this in the regular season, it will be ranked among the worst episodes.
