To tell the truth, I was a little baffled to see all this positive reviews by many people, which is the main reason I decided to watch this movie. And after seeing it, I was really disappointed and came from people who love this type of movie. <br /> <br /> I was totally amazed with this movie - it's like the movie of a child with Nude images without reason and everything related to small children who swear and swear I am not a righteous person But this story goes far beyond my account. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: A story about two men being sent to the Big Brother program for negligence. There they met a child who had a passion for the chest and another person who was a middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> Just the name itself is not linked to the story. They are not exemplary and do nothing but give time to what they do. The story can be very predictable (but expected) and humor is lame. And we have never seen the same character (played by Mc Lovin ') in many other movies (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laughed three times and almost didn't sleep. <br /> <br /> Selection The actors didn't matter after he was the one who created the movie. And the performance is as expected when you watch this type of movie And what direction we expect This is the same guy who brought us to the Wet Hot American Summer competition and that movie was terrible. In any way, he often brings some celebrities to attract his horrible movies. <br /> <br /> Next, I don't feel totally riff, but it's a waste of time. The only nude scene that seems to be the best part in the movie. Can't see why I should recommend this to everyone. <br /> <br /> Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Two nude scenes. <br /> <br /> Cons: Not a joke. Scary. Nude and children are not mixed. <br /> <br /> Score: 3.5 / 10 (Grade: F)
