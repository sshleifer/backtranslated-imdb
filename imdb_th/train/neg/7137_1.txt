Cars in this movie are excellent. The performance in this movie is terrible. Plot and driving scenes are not reasonable and not as good. If you get the attention of movies that some people change and suddenly laugh faster Good movie for racing fans There is a part that they made a mistake in referring to the NASCAR driver as a rally driver. If you can't tell the difference, go and see. You will have a bomb. It really comes down here. There are really good cars in this movie. They drive horribly and completely unrealistic. The show was horrible, mostly because of the terrible plans. If you want to meet a hot girl, turn on mtv or vh1 instead. I'm disappointed that such a good car will be presented in such a bad movie If the level of the car matches that of the movie, they should race with a bike that has rust.
