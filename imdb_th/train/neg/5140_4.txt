Demer Daves is a great director when talking about the West and "Broken Arrow" still in everyone's mind. As long as the melodrama is concerned, he should let people know, such as Vincente Minelli, George Cukor or Douglas Sirk at Excellent.

Nathalie's characters are inspired by "Imitate life" by Fannie Hurst (see Stahl and Sirk), but who believes that she is a black person Is the human daughter? Susan Kohner is more reliable in the matter. "Life imitations") and Sinatra and Curtis received a fixed part which they could not do with them: poor staff Natalie will fall in love with one another. France shows that it is a land of patience, which the racial union has received a warm welcome all the time (around 1944). It is suspicious and is also a place for narrow-minded people. You can find here anywhere.
