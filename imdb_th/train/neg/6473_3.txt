From the first episode ("The Little Mermaid") is my favorite movie. It's full of great characters, fun music and movies. A week or more, I watched this movie for the first time. I believe that this movie is a sequel to most people and not more than the original. I think I feel this way, probably because I have high expectations and I grow up. However, it's not a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It started when Ariel had just given birth to a beautiful baby. Melody Eric and Ariel felt threatened by Morgana (Eurselas sister), so they built a wall Large around their house, which is located on the sea When Melody grew up, she began to wonder outside the wall that was not allowed to go. The problem arose when Morgana tried to control the seven seas. <br /> <br /> I don't want any movies to go out, so you have to see it to find. I don't like the same sounds and sing great songs again. I think this is a good family movie, but overall!
