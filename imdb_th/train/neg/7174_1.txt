I want to read other reviews before leaving my comments and most rules of course: this movie is a fear! From acting to animation that is not realistic to countless errors, I actually hope that the female genitals will expand with a wide imagination. (Can not extend the clitoris if there is no engine) Can not lower the wheel level unless you have electricity. A small little fan that is not going enough with any stretch to reduce the landing gear. One thing that I think is very strange is that when they land after the wheel is touched and the nose is broken, the plane stops with both tires in the air How can the captain use the left and right brakes with tires that do not touch the ground? Do they forget the spoiler? Word to the Director: Find * all * that you can do about the plane before trying the movie "plane". Sorry to overstate the technique. But I gave this movie 1/10
