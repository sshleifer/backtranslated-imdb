Eternal redundant images, useless images, useless scenes are what you will find in this movie. On the other hand, I feel badly technically. Music bits are directed like an amateur. (There is no coordination in dance-going, bad postings, bad and clear adaptations of occasional actors, etc.) <br /> <br /> This movie is long and boring. Eventually causing less and even less feeling. <br /> <br /> There are some good ideas. Some cartoon elements are really effective, especially open scenes. However, this movie is getting worse and worse and cannot be fully understood. <br /> <br /> The example I saw was very powerful. That is to say, the difference between the trailer and the actual movie is close to tearing.
