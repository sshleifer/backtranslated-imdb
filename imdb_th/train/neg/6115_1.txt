The characters of Tarzan have been repeated many times, and many bad interpretations have made the people of different generations hope. (People like me, I mean those who like Tarzan books since I was young The movie version that follows after a little book) should know how the latest translation is stacked. IMDb reviews Some people mention this point, but this is my $ .02 <br /> <br /> I know only two - Tarzan's 'em-cinema' depicts the Greystoke and Christopher Lambert and Disney animated versions that try to portray Edgar Rice Burro's interesting character. (The son of a British noble lover who had been picked up after their death by a tribe of monkeys that lifted him into one and became "The Lord of the Forest" of human intelligence that is superior to before returning to England and claiming his other identity) instead of a Hollywood man whose origins are unclear and the trademark is shouting the name. As for him, he cannot speak English properly. Knowing the language, his habit of swinging on vines, strength, courage, and more about the only thing these two characters have in common is the name Tarzan and the fact that both have a wife named Jane. Ron Ely's TV show is a compromise: as with Burroughs' characters, he speaks good English and is skillful and gentle in both cultures in the style of JamesBondish, but he is not Lord Greystoke and no Jane. <br /> < br /> This movie is in the third category of Tarzan movies and I hope it will still be a category because it's scary. This category uses characters as vehicles for every soft porn. Jane is played by a bad actress. According to legend, Bo Derek is in Africa to find her father, a devoted teacher who is fighting the forest to find things that had never been identified before. Although her father should have disappeared for a long time, she easily found him. Richard Harris's father is the best thing here. He saw that the film was very stupid, so he enjoyed doing too much and interrupting it in a way that reminded me of Peter O'Toole's stupid performance deliberately in What's New Pussycat. The father explained the legend of Tarzan. ("Ghosts or spirits," he said - whether it is stealing or attempting to show respect to King Kong) with his daughter, a point that is not familiar with human monkeys. The infamous ancient shouting of Tarzan The father died, which was unusual. It didn't seem to make the daughter who sacrificed so much ... <br /> <br /> Then Tarzan appeared. But didn't say anything Of course, he didn't say anything in the whole movie. He and Jane fell in love, and they ran around, almost nothing when she recited the love poem, ending. That is the plot. <br /> <br /> Never mind. The scene in which Tarzan battled a boa, a boa, a strange boa, because it was the only poison that had ever seen. Jane treats the bite with the help of a chimpanzee that helps pull the clothes she ripped to tie the wound. (I didn't do this!) And this is the only excuse for you to take your clothes off. <br /> <br /> I like to always summarize reviews by saying something positive. But this time it's hard. Let's see ... It's not fair to criticize this movie about an orangutan, although we all know that the orangutan doesn't live in Africa. After all, classic Tarzan movies all use Indian elephants. They don't? In addition, you have to admit that Bo Derek is beautiful both face and shape. (But in this case, why aren't you doing this career as a model of art?) What does it say about a movie when it looks boring to look at really beautiful women? I didn't decide that it was positive. blank Or what is not good that they have never seen her target) but now I know: try doing what I expected. <br /> <br /> watch this movie if you are a bad movie I was here
