I must say that I look forward to watching this movie and searching for a new life there that will separate it from boring and created Mexican movies too. I do not know why But I believe in Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas, to be someone who will inject freshness and confidence for our non-existent industry. Probably because of the soundtrack (Which I listened to before I watched the movie) sounds different from others, perhaps because it dares to incorporate new faces (apart from Demian Bichir, which is always a favorite of Mexican film directors) inside Is a script with modern social behavior, probably because the photographs that I see in the examples are vivid and realistic rather than acting. This film became the main audience and was a major role player. What actually Serrano relates to is this. "Battle of sex" old-fashioned while "Every man is the same" and "Why all women ...;" Others. There is nothing new in it, even using the common ground and the ancient thought until it finally mocked itself without leaving the reflection there. Any value for the female / male condition is filled with the usual fervor of the audience, like a safe porch about the ancient thoughts I mentioned earlier. (People who always work) and screaming performances (It is a movie that plays well in its context) .. The characters in the first episode are more interesting than those played by Monica Dion and Demian Bichir become more pathetic characters. I do not agree with Serrano completely. They should not be treated as a puppet for his lesson to come ... He makes sure that we receive his message and destroy the role of They are completely The story should stand. However, it is sometimes a fun movie and you may have a good time seeing it. (If you agree to be controlled by it)
