This is a private movie for Peter Bogdan. He lives his life. But changing things around to match the detective character These detectives have a beautiful style and have no problem making them. Looks like a millionaire playboy filmmaker, rather than a detective, right? All these movies were written by Peter and it shows how real people are. You should write what you know and he does that. And make the audience bored and confused and jealous for that matter This is a curie for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered after filming. But in real life, Patti Hanson is married to Keith Richards, who is a model like Stratten, but in real life is much better and has a wider part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced to increase. She had nothing to do with this, which was quite complicated in the beginning. Overall, all the characters in this film are the ones that only a few people can relate to, unless you are a millionaire from Manhattan with a beautiful model when you call. For the rest of us, it is an annoying snoring festival. That's what happens when you don't touch. You entertain a few friends with all the inside jokes and boredom.
