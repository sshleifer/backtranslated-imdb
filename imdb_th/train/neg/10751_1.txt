Why am I losing money on this last day of Sundance? I need a refund ... Can I request a $ 16 refund while I watch this movie? I'm still waiting for something to happen. Nothing happens. The only way I can know what it should be about is to read the story that doesn't really like movies. Why does the director zoom in on a useful camera and zoom out? It doesn't have art. Why did the director show Lulu his nails for fifteen minutes? Why when the actors tried to say that they sounded like they were reading? Or is that the point? I feel like Phantom Love does not have any stories and to speak directly, I feel like a friend's holiday video has higher entertainment value than movies
