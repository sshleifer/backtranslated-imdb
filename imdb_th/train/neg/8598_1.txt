I'm kidding! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It's terrible even though it's hilarious. I and my friend accidentally rent it because it looks terrible. Cheesy's ancient horror flicks are good for some people who laugh. The plot has a voice-overs problem. But I'm sure there is an explosion!
