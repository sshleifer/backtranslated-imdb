Yes! ... No, not because Pintilie likes to strip his actors and show their privacy to the public. Pintilie is the "emperor" who is naked - so to say ... <br /> <br /> It is a great time for someone to identify the truth. This impostor is a voyeur, the rest of the children trapped in the body of an old man. His many bare scenes are not artistic in any way. It is 100% visually perverse: He is entertained by making actors pull buffalo movies and look at their feelings. And if he does this in front of the audience, he may get difficulty! Did you know that in the series of "Niki Ardelean" he used to make the poor Coca Bloss say by telling her: "Oh, Coca. What should I do to you!"? She is a good woman, very sensitive and sensitive, and she is incredibly shameful - for his satisfaction! And as an alarming warning about the level of vulgarity and lack of education in the Romanian audience, many people are still very stupid to announce "clip art"! Will anyone be suitable to reveal the truth of it all?
