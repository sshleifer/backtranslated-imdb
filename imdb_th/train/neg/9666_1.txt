When seeing "Triumph of the Will", I can say that this movie looks very scary, even against the "low" standards of the past of time. By nature, it is totally totally inventive and bias. This is what we expect from German propaganda in 1930. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation is low and cheap. In addition, it was so ridiculous that even contemporary Germans had to leave the theater to their nose. In the genre that is famous for attracting bases, lack of initiative and misdirected thoughts, this movie does not have the same "bad" qualities.
