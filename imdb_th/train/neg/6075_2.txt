One of the worst movies I have ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a pointless ancient idea of ​​strenuous exercise. It tries to spin or twist the plot with the jokes of the crazy fans turning the bugs - the movie doesn't mean anything (spoilers). We believe that the madman has a knife to access and kill players. Baseball in a luxury hotel without a safety witness or camera? This film is nonsense, trying to pull our hearts through the hoops of baseball, ending with ridicule, no complexity and gimmicks. Not sure what all the actors are thinking. This is as big as they are far away if you like the idea in the movie.
