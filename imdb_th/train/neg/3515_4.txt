Basically, the general propaganda movie for the last war But there are some things that make me fall in love The first is the use of the mouth epithelium. In the second episode, the character of Scott's mouth, one of the first when he dropped the bomb, dropped the target - during the bombing ("dammit") and when he tried to make the cannon become a pilot ("s *% t ") I may be wrong about the second instance. But I played it many times and that's what looks like me. The third case is when the character of Anne Shirley wants to leave O'Brien character and good luck ("Give Hell") over the roar of the engine. She had to think that it was not too ugly because she said "Heck" clearly. I found that interesting characters had moral issues with the bombing, especially the bombing of civilians. The avuncular bosses make him confident that only military targets will be attacked due to the accuracy of the bombs used. When receiving what we knew about LeMay's later strategy of arson in Japan, forgetting this scene played sarcastically. I remember the reference to McNamara's LeMay in "The Fog of War", which shows that if the United States does not win the conflict, he must try to be a war criminal. The ending is a way beyond the movie. It reminded me of the end of the White Heat (I didn't compare the movie at the end!). Maybe it was because he was bombed. Blow up really well !!!
