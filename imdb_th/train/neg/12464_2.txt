This film, which is expected to be exciting, will have about five sub-plots that are developed simultaneously for the climax at the end. But it ended with yawning. <br /> <br /> The writing is repetitive, slow and separated. And boring characters George Clooney seems to have entered the gym. But Matt Damon makes others seem to read the script from the teleprompter. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is that it was created carefully for Politically correct, so there is nothing about big business, oil and the Middle East I've seen more documentaries for excitement. Watch only if there is nothing to do.
