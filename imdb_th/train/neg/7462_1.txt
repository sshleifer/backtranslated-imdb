The path must be a problem here. Recently, I heard John Cleese talking about the panic work for Fawlty Towers. He should attack his car with a branch. The first branch is too fragile and not funny. The second branch is too hard to be funny. The third person is fragile enough to be funny. This attention to detail disappeared from "Corky Romano". No matter how embarrassing the comics were, it was not fixed and left on the cutting floor. The only value that I can find in this film is the study of a very flawed movie that has been released without being repaired. <br /> <br /> I've scanned many other reviews. Seeing that, of course, the loss of time makes me wonder if someone gets paid to promote the name. I can't understand that anyone who is over 9 years old can rate this name more than 4, MAX. I mean, come up with 5 averages. I can't imagine it. br /> <br /> This makes my list of the 10 worst movies of all time and hey. I actually like The Three Stooges and can endure Ed Wood!
