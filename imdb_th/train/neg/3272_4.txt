I will say one thing about this movie: No lull. You can't watch this. The problem is that it's too harsh. There are too many actions and it is not necessary to lull! That is the risk that you get in modern action movies. You want interesting But not too much This is a way that is more than necessary. <br /> <br /> Although the show is good and has two "names" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, but still has the feel of the movie "B". The best is Scheider's dialogue: only one part of "B" of this movie. "B" <br /> <br /> The rest of this story is strictly Rambo. But with a few outstanding scenes One of them is a very innovative scene with mines. That is memorable. Other scenes are not enough to make this moderator last a long time.
