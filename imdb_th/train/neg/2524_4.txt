Title: Robot Jox (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stuart Gordon <br /> <br /> Actor: Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo <br /> <br /> Review: Stuart Gordon We are often linked to horror horror movies such as Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak. Take a small detour here and do a little sci-fi. I emphasize the word "little" because of this. Is a very low budget flick and the main weakness is there. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the future. The world that great powers (Which, according to the film, is the United States and Russia), their differences are not caused by the full-blown world war ... but by fighting a warrior-style fight with a giant robot, our hero Achilles must rise With an evil Russian robot fighter called Alexander. There are many cheap motion-stop animation shortstop animations. <br /> <br /> The idea is great. The great country dealt with disputes about the territory with giant robots? Interesting places and that can be managed appropriately if there is an appropriate budget Unfortunately, what the fun movie ends is a shameful thing for another great director. <br /> <br /> I am a kid who loves this movie and I guess if you want the enjoyment of the movie. this story Must change back to the little boy mode to enjoy it I show this movie to my friends and when this movie makes my friends progress like "What is the piece of this Franco piece" and I like this movie is the sci-fi movie from Stuart Gordon, my favorite director. "But when this movie stepped into a dark land, I almost felt like I stopped and didn't let them go through torture. It made me love this movie since I was a child and still have a little nostalgia attached to watching it, but others don't get it. <br /> <br /> And I realized that This movie is not really good. First of all, this movie is about a giant robot that drives the hell out of each other, and in order to achieve this in a reliable way, you have to use a special special effect to get it. results That will help the audience to suppress unbelief Unfortunately, this is a small movie from a small company (Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after making this movie!). The effect just helps giggling and laughing at them. Heck, even some dresses and wardrobes don't seem to exist yet. Half finished or tried. <br /> <br /> OK. When you accept that you are watching a mix of medium and fine animations, you can arrange them. Take the movie and enjoy the big robot that drives the hell out of each other. There are some scenes when the robot is fighting very cool and makes me go. "That's why I like this movie!" But everyone knows, and they have some crappy results that will take you away from the little nest you are trying to hide and boom your truth back. To recognize this movie is not with the location. <br /> <br /> And another thing that makes me annoyed with the movie. This movie is a movie for children. Do you know that the giant robot Duk it comes out? Stop animation animation? Hello? But the dialogue of this movie has a lot of sexual intelligence and violence causing the blood to flow a bit. So I asked myself if this is a movie for children? Soon after, I concluded that this is a movie for children who are sensitive to adults, which is not a really good combination. <br /> <br /> So for those of you who do not feel innocent. The innocent charm of watching two robots fight each other, and if you don't have a nostalgia about this movie (like me), well, id recommends that you keep your way away from this movie. Gordon is a great director. But this movie he did not do for me At least I am now fully mature. <br /> <br /> Score: 2 out of 5
