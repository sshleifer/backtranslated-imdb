This film is a flash and no soul. The actor is very interested in numbers. But often these numbers are not linked to movies and feel like standalone music videos. And there is no attempt to make the numbers seem to happen there. In front of you, everyone listens like coming from the studio by sucking all life from music All the performances are boring and unreal, especially Hudson, who is playing with a strong "girl" anger (she is a stubborn and selfish person). Her character is certainly not profound or other women. Although I think this movie wants us to believe that Hudson's character is facing difficulties due to her weight. But she refused to do the best for the team that caused her to be in trouble Hudson's Academy Award is an unreasonable joke. When she sang, she showed her emotions. (Although it is often misplaced, but this is the fault of the writer / director) but when she's just acting, she doesn't do anything to show the insurance role. Eddie Murphy's character is the only one with an arc and he works well. But still didn't get an Oscar The only actor who brought something to this film is Danny Glover, who plays a small character that doesn't matter and makes something real. There is nothing here for your teeth without drama or heart or even laughing. The arrangement of the musical plays is so bad that sometimes this movie seems to be fun with the stage plays rather than a single story. When Hudson's argument with other girls was prolonged, if it had passed long ago The movie didn't know what it was about and I felt insulted in the last few minutes. It's a big, boring and time-consuming story, and it's the worst movie I've ever seen in 06, and nothing last year started with the protagonist.
