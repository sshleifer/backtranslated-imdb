Not "Ulli Lommel's movie" gives me hope. But I must confess that ZODIAC KILLER is trying to sink under my lowest expectations. There is a latest trend among young filmmakers of using digital video for their first project, which is good and good for giving these children the opportunity to create jobs without having to spend all the money in stock. Expensive movie But many of these young filmmakers think of filtering finished movies to look more qualitatively celluloid. Effects are not always perfect, but can help. Non-filtered digital video works with style. "mockumentary" only because unlike any other video In that it is the main problem of ZODIAC KILLER. Watching movies feels like watching a TV drama about a murderer. It doesn't feel like watching a movie. And another unpredictable thing is that Lommel is not a new generation of filmmakers. He should know better. He should know that it is impossible to create horror. (Or even doubt!) In the video for God's love. This man has directed since the sixties! He may be the only director who has failed to develop a career for over forty years in the business. And luckily we wrote the script as well! Therefore, you can expect complex actions that do not mean anything, unjust behavior, and truly false plot elements that will make you fully dissatisfied. Please, please think about this too. You will thank me later
