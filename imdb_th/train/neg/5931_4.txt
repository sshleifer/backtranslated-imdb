This movie should take only 10 minutes. I mean there is content that can be viewed in only 10 minutes (I hesitate to call it a movie). The credit for the release of this film is somehow promising. When the movie begins with a short comment of yourself, you have to rub your hands and follow the story from Cohen's life. Nick Cave performed reasonably, covering Cohen's popular song. The length of the cave show makes you more eager to see Cohen, where good words and words encourage you to imagine. But when it turns out that Cave's performance was just the beginning of a long, boring show that was in fact no one without a little attraction for you to sit. What do I mean by filmmakers? A five minute close-up image that wants to be a singer in a fake concert in Australia !!! Filmmakers think that they will insult the audience by adding "Fake applause" in these nasty performances This movie is the perfect torture that shows you what you see very little. There is no picture of Cohen's past. In fact, except for his first few days as a singer / poet, there is absolutely nothing! If you add every minute that Cohen talks about may be less than 10 minutes, but these 10-minute moments are presented cramped gradually, during the work of a disaster camera that gathers the most beautiful people. Some people shout the lyrics of Cohen If you ever decide to lose money in this movie, don't! Just throw in the trash and at least help you save time.
