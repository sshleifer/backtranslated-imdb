Teen girls may do Many things But one thing she can't do is acting. Her appearance on the screen is about anemia and clumsy, dramatic situations in which she tries to show some horrific emotions, body and language. Her face is an amateur actress. The remaining actors are slightly better. But they can't record the ancient movies with the cast and shallow plot.

Slow motion is not really necessary, choreography is basic and lacking in inspiration, and most kung fu scenes are just training or standing in every type of kung fu, not really fighting. Not to mention that it's just ridiculous. Where, when the young and thin girls fight with the big man and the muscles, <br /> <br /> The only reason this movie has been noticed is because it's about Higher Roma It's easy to publish this movie - the first martial arts movie from Denmark.
