Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with a problematic past that is more than she bargained for when she went to a pool party with a handsome colleague. On the day she and his friends joked that they were in Maddy's murder club was serious and moved up to 'Level 3' by beating a woman's brain in a garage. But Maddy is also the one who wears plastic masks and kills other members in the group, or that other people are lost. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie. Full of holes and bolts that are completely out of control before the ridicule ends Some conversations are very ridiculous. I didn't have a problem with Rochon's performance, but the supporting actors were cruel. However, I try to sit through the full moon release for thorough entertainment. There are many skin and blood, and it is the perfect flick for sitting around with your group of friends and separated. Horror movie fans may enjoy the cameo from Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (as Debbie's parents) and Julie Strain (first victim) <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
