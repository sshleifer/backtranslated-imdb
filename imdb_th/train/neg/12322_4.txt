It seems to be a very important part of these comments. The movie has an amazing animation (I watched on blu-ray) but it was really short. <br /> <br /> At first All the drama is pretty boring. I get advice about Laputa situation, one kind between Agito, Toola and Shunack. The main rival. However, sometimes my heart is wandering, and this is a wishful idea (Laputa is my favorite animation Engilsh original dub). The character is not really cute and as mentioned in the other post, they fell in love. Quickly makes Minka jealous and refused (She loves Akito, who has forgotten this story). However, it seems that she forgives Toola at the end without explanation for the change of heart, in addition to making the ending happier. <br /> <br /> Besides This is also a lack of serious explanations. Who is like Druid? Are they people? And who are strange women / girls who seem to hang out with them and run into the forest? There is nothing to explain why they are there and how to empower humans. Plants from the moon have not filled in the gaps about this matter. It's almost like the strange version of The Day of the Triffids. <br /> <br /> And who called Toola? Why worry about this if it can't be explained? <br /> <br /> I want to like this movie very much. But I found that there is no point that is as close to the movie as Ghost in the Shell, or there is a real character of Miyazaki. I didn't watch it again. But hopefully I won't buy it My advice? Let it go if you have a few hours to spare. But borrow it or buy it cheap! Maybe if your new animation movie and you don't have to go anywhere, you'll enjoy it. Is definitely a favorite
