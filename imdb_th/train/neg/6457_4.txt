I guess I used to watch movies that are worse. But that may be because I am tired of the horror that is standard. What a killer monster is really bad. In general, it's a guy in some green bodysuits. There was a much worse performance when the movie B went, but didn't think this would be the protagonist. Actually, it has PTSD with matter. But still stupid In general, it's a horror movie with a low budget. But at least not as bad as the Titanic, the movie sucks the ball The blood looks fake in this movie. That was one complaint I had about the horror of the new millennium with stupid, low-grade blood. The gruesome death scene with really fake blood was so stupid At least there is a good shower scene.
