I entered this movie, thinking that it would be a complete football drama. (In the same vein as Remember the Titans); But I felt like I had just joined Ted Haggard's sermon about Rapture. The only thing missing was a small amount of requests at the end of the movie. In fact, one person may be preached on television rather than a poor excuse for entertainment. At least with television preaching, there are more words from the Bible than words from popular self-help pulp. This plot is predictable, too poor that anyone who has long enough concentration will put the whole storyline within the first 15 minutes of the movie.
