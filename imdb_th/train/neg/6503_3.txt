What Hopkins achieved in this effort as a writer and director has made us feel that we have no one to know in this movie. However, there may be problems in it. His films have many ambitions and his intentions are complex and drawn from the depths. But there is no identity, no character, we never know who is who, so there is no investment in our part. <br /> <br /> It may be about the screenwriter involved in his own character. right? Maybe. By that I didn't mean that Slipstream was not clear. I mean there was no telling. Hopkins' movie is an experiment. On the face of it, anyone can make the case that it is about a screenwriter, during which time he meets fate, realizing the life that was hit and miss and / or succeeded as a blind opportunity while he Being hit by the "slippery" of clashes between different points in time, dreams, thoughts and reality However, it is an uninterrupted brain, leaving no room for emotion, even in a relatively small extent, the basis that allows us to connect with its characters. <br /> <br /> I don't think of them. Have a habit And the school with the color of the vibration camera that works with machine gun speed and editing makes me free But when thinking about this movie, I began to feel that it was very relevant to this story. There are many films in the past decade, where the cutting or movement of the camera has sound effects, including technical documents that make the atmosphere worse. I think that in this case it is justified in its purpose: to create an impressionist response of dreams. Anyway, I don't know anything about Slipstream when watching it and I came out in the same way. And I don't care because Hopkins didn't try to make us interested There is an interactive movie and there is a movie sitting on a rocking chair and knitting without knowing Slipstream is the back.
