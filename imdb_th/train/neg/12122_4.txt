Seeing that being a snooker world champion, the finals ended with frustration and disappointment, with Ronnie O Sullivan defeating Greame Dott 18 frames to 8. BBC 2 found a gap in their tables. He and decided to broadcast the movie A MOON. No knowledge. <br /> <br /> I missed a few seconds of the credit name, so there was no idea Viggo Mortensen starred and thought it might be a cheap TVM. Pearl and Marty are Their children go to summer camp, it made sense to make a TV film, although brightness. (Too bright) The movie seems to suggest that this is a movie, and it wasn't until the appearance of Viggo Mortensen as a hippie walker. It was the movie debut after everyone who had the appearance of Mortensen was not a star in TVM. I mean, it's like a legend like Robert DeNiro that appears in a straightforward video movie. Wait a minute. Bob ....? <br /> <br /> Some people on this site have said that Pearl and Marty are unbelievable couples on screen and I agree. I can understand why Mook attracts exciting hippie guy. But didn't know why Walker was attracted to the house of Pearl That sixties came before my time But of course, if you have the choice between hippy chicks and wives who are bored of the house, it's not an option at all. In your heart, many people take LSD in those days, so I guess to explain it. <br /> <br /> I feel that the major problem of A WALK ON THE MOON comes to reality. It's a romantic drama. At the heart (just like you would expect on TVM) that has many bustling scenes, so why have a clear sex scene? It's bottling with the rest of the movie and may close to put on the menopausal women who have 20 things in 1969. I said that probably because the film seems to be aimed at the teeenage market with the upcoming era scene. And those teenagers may be bored with the historical and social context of humans walking on the moon and Woodstock. In other words, walking on the moon trying to attract people Watch many types But may not attract them at all
