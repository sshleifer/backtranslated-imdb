The only reason I saw "Shakedown" was that Erika Eleniak was there. She's always sexy. But she played the second violin to bring Wolf Larson to the man. Unfortunately, because she had the ability to perform more than she was allowed to perform here. Most movies contain endless shootouts that quickly become boring, especially when you see a bad guy armed with a machine gun. Larson has disappeared all the time and he is armed with a pistol. The effect of that earthquake good But there was a blurred movement and a terrible CGI explosion as a psycho "spiritual leader" Ron Pearlman tried But the mambo jumbo jumbo religion that he had to spray out was just boring. Eleniak, Perlman or Larson (assuming he had) might want this person to look for others. It's worth it to rent. (* 2/1)
