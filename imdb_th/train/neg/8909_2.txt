This movie is weak and not funny at all. The plot does not make sense. Some scientists working in science open the door to another dimension. (Maybe hell ???) And his daughter was absorbed through or something. Then one day she came back without a clear reason and now she has a big breast and wears. Stingy costume (I guess the demons in other dimensions do it for you?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend. But she is gay, so obviously she is more interested in her new girlfriend. Spell books (they want to be a witch or something ???) and evil spells end up reading again. Which is the way the devil came to the world, which only women on the bikini and those who reject love There was a scene naked without reason and there were men in there that my girlfriend said was a well-known wrestler. But his part is not completely necessary, obviously they do something to put him in there because maybe the wrestling fans. I'm sure the women who don't have the top don't hurt as well. The special features of the DVD are even more confusing than the rest of the movie. I think it might help explain what happened but actually makes things more confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Essentially, this is a movie that is fighting for monsters. But there are things (such as other dimensions and book sellers) rather than causing confusion I don't like this movie But it's like five bucks. The story is very big. I do not recommend watching it, even if it's too stupid. I can't think of any parts of a good movie.
