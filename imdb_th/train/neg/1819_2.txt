I searched for this movie for one reason - Al Adamson. He was one of the worst directors of all time - with there, with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steiner and Pan. Awesome theon However, I was a little disappointed because although this movie was really bad, but never approached the horrors of his previous movie. For this reason, this film is not particularly fun for us to watch bad movie fans. <br /> <br /> Now I'm careful to watch this movie. Movie - Something I won't review. On IMDb, however, this movie appears to be like this sometimes, especially during the first 10 minutes, but you can tell that the script has a lot of changes, like most movies that are not made. This caused a stir at the end of the movie has no plot violence, and certainly not sexy! The result of all this is the overall confusion. <br /> <br /> Sadly, there is no good part. For example, a porn video shows surprisingly little, and it can't be understood why they put 71-year-old boys in some love scenes. Of course, Livingston, 71, looks quite good - but he is still an old man and no one wants to see him take it with a little nymph! Then, when the last 20 minutes became very violent, while Livingston became a person like Rambo! Talking about strange and inappropriate things. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is little to recommend this sad movie. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to be bothered, and this film is quite boring, even with crazy names like "Naughty Stewardesses".
