Although there are many other people who think about the first movie. But i like it very much However, this one How to combine one word: this movie is (And this is the word): CRAP! <br /> <br /> But let's take a look at each other: this is a plot: finally the queen has Was moved from her castle But her successor: Snow White had other problems: the court joke, the father of her son, lost his way. At the end, Spliss went to extremes to fight his gray hair and sell Dynasty descent for blond hair and full hair Snow White seeks help from Bubi (Otto Walkees), who must first meet his six dwarf companions and then try to find the royal family, or at least try to find the name of Rum Rum Steel Skin. <br /> The whole plot seems to have been written over the weekend that the writer is very drunk. But under pressure from the studio to write the film. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are good jokes, even for fans at first, or for fans of other actors. It's not worth it. To buy a DVD, believe me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that at least the type of movie recording from complete forgiveness is the performance of some actors. That's why I gave the movement 3/10. Sadly, the script was so bad that none of the actors or all combined to do bad things. <br /> <br /> For example, at one point they even Skip our reality and sad .. They don't do funny things while staying here. <br /> <br /> Still a great actor in this movie: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen, (particularly funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as an actor From Helge Schneider and much more, but sadly, all these comedians can't really make this screenplay really bad. <br /> <br /> May be a treat for some hardcore fans But for general movie viewers or now, DVD tenants or buyers are not worth the money. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to rent movies.
