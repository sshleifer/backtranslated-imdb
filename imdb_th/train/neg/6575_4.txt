An interesting movie about the real events that occurred during the Civil War in Vermont. It made me interested until the end and I didn't regret watching it. I never read about this attack. I want to know if the rebels pulled it out or not. I enjoy historical movies from that era. <br /> <br /> My major complaint is the use of allied uniforms. They look too good !!! Sometimes the performance is quite solid. I like the old man who eats mashed potatoes because he doesn't have teeth. The wounded soldiers were played with a strange hounds. Overall, it's a movie that descends.
