A wonderful vender with a $ million hotel. I don't know how he came with this movie! The idea of ​​giving the situation after the spt11 and the views of the American Society is hopeful to make it out of 2 out of 10, but this is not a movie because the best people can do it with a good idea. (Clash of the West - East) There is something important going on in the Middle East and just coming out on the screen of the MAC. * With the fingers of the Amerian women who are at the level of folly. (Because you don't know the truth) The shape is not good and the most important thing is the idea from religion is a joke for me in the last scene that Lana said to be quiet and try listening and the background music says " I will pray "things that are not really related to religion, but it ends in this way. You will see the truth. If you just close your eyes and pray, the lights will shine in truth. It's common to see it. PS: "My house is not a place, it is" the only thing that gets 10 of the 10 sentence. But it wasted on creating this film (by the way; While "Someone" mentioned below, America's best young man is not excellent, they are just "poor" and "hopeless" people who are registered for the army that needs a good salary. !)
