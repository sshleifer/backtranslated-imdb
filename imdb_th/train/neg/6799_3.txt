Do not expect much from this movie. In many ways, this film is similar to the movie Doris Day, starring in 1956, named Julie. That landed after her husband watched Louis Jordan shoot the captain She did better, was more reliable than Kim Ohah, who controlled 747 cars and managed to land without receiving help from the control tower. I know there are about 747 planes. I've been a flight attendant myself. As I said, don't expect much from this movie. It's done at a cheap price. The manufacturer must use a plane with the name of the airline at a cheap price. Oceanic is the name that many movies use. The only thing written on this plane is the name of the company that produced the plane.
