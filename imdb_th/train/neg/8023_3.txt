After watching this movie on a DVD, I watched the preview. Dubbing the movie's narrative is a surreal story. It has surreal and surreal. <br /> <br /> There is only one part of the movie that seems to be my image. But frankly, it looks more confusing than the image seen Other unusual images, especially the lunch room scene where everyone on the floor is so ridiculous that they have no meaning. I didn't think of a picture that didn't mean anything. But these scenes seem to be unrelated. <br /> <br /> My impression is that the director is trying to convey Logan's only words. I don't know what will explain what happened. Unfortunately there is nothing I see for me to know what Logan is thinking, his views or even his emotional state. All I can say is that he is not particularly happy with his appearance and that he likes older men. <br /> <br /> I think the ending signaled the relationship between the two boys. How to become But not much The layout of the scene is not clear to those who honestly look like the police rather than artistic decisions. <br /> <br /> Still a boring movie and free content for me, it's a definite change. I like the movie of Madagascar very much and I feel that this movie has the inspiration to tell that story and may have style. It didn't come close. For me, there is no question about this: this movie deserves A for effort, but D is for execution.
