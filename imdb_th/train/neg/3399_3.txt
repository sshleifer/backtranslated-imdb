Birthday Girl doesn't know what he wants - it's a joke or not. It's a drama ... I don't know what would be a comedy or a touching story ended up in a land that doesn't have humans The location is original enough to guarantee a script full of interesting situations. But almost did not give anything This is really a shame if you watch the actor - it's strong all the way. But they didn't have the opportunity to shine Very disappointing
