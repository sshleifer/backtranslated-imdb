Scorsese's worst collaboration in this terrible mess Scorsese is all of his elements in this film, with horror that rang loudly with a loud phone call and the door slamming that seemed laughable. The character is totally broken and the southern accent is annoying and forced. Nick Noltie plays the best lawyer in history who believes he can protect anyone! Bow Deane's psychosis is nothing more than a typical psychopathic killer in the 90s. The scene with De Niro and the early Lewis is quite clumsy and the peak continues and we all feel tired. With psychotic psychosis that never dies One of my most horrible movie experiences Rent the original 100 times better. <br /> <br />
