... no one watching the movie at all My husband and I went to see it last night. It's just a small theater, but usually there are a lot of people. not now! My husband and I are the only ones who watch Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst things I've ever seen. Yes, CG is good. But it is so Acting, dialogue and dialogue, director, editing, etc. are very scary! Since we are alone in the room, we feel free to talk between movies. That is, we talked about the badness that reminds us of the great power of Morphin Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal Combat and Lord of the Rings. It's like we expect to see the commander Rita and Lord Zed of the army of Sauron. <br /> <br /> Those creatures are ridiculous. You cannot introduce legions of dino / dragon / lizard that are filled with artillery without explanation. Lord of the Rings has a variety of characters. But it introduces and develops more than 3 films, not in half and half hours. <br /> <br /> Changing the scene is very scary. I didn't fall asleep during filming. But even though it's a simple matter, I find myself wandering in the pit. <br /> <br /> The character is a white American. Because of a poorly written dialog box in the script Know you for a long time in this life It seems that he is upset that he is left in "Mordor", not knowing where he is or how to come back. For God's love, we cannot understand where he is or how to go there. But if he is not upset, we shouldn't do that. <br /> <br /> Oh and why dressing Sarah's soul looks like she borrowed from Queen Elizabeth? Another thing ... The three main characters are reincarnated to complete the task. Sarah works to finish and go to the afterlife. Jack did this as well. And why is Ethan drunk? He was left alone without a girl. There was no map / compass / helicopter to help him get back. What should he do? Smoke signal? And if he returns home, will he return to his work? He should have received the same kind of mercy that was killed from movies that other heroes have. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time or money on this movie. We remain until all because we pay. But when the credit runs out, we go out the door.
