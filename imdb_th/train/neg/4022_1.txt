This movie is very scary. I watched it three times and not all. It is impossible to watch the story so deeply depressed and disgusting. I don't write spoilers for anything, so if you want to know why it's disgusting, see for yourself. The only good thing about this movie is John Savage, his conversation at the beginning and some funny parts in the movie. The little boy in this movie is annoying and the whole situation is a lie. I saw this movie at movie theaters across America so I thought it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I'm wrong !!!! The performance was very scary and the nudity itself seemed weak and disgusting. Another thing is Starr Andreef, the other main character who has never been in a bad movie before. Like John Savage This movie talks about!
