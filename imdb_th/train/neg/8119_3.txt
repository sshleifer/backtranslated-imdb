First of all, there is nothing in this movie that really impressed me. It's not a bad movie. But another movie that I said "That's not a special matter" after I saw it There may be drama and things, but it doesn't grab me. As I said in the headline, it is very cheap in the way. The quality of the movie itself (in the picture) seems to be of low quality and reminds me of the cheap story created for television movies rather than respectable British filmmakers Camera angles and pictures are very amateur in my opinion. There are no really similar shots or effects to create interesting scenes. I have never seen English movies before, and the stories that I have seen have not impressed me more than this, and they look similar to color cameras and things. Smart (see my "Lola Rennt" review if you like) but it's not successful for me as well. Overall, it's just a movie that doesn't care, which doesn't have anything special. (Best of all, I'm scared) and unfortunately have to spend two hours.
