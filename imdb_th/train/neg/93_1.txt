A woman asks for advice on the road to go to the mysterious city and hear two horrifying stories from the local people. Both zombies are involved. But sometimes fate is something that is disgusting for you as well. <br /> <br /> Zombie Chronicles is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, I have to confess badly that I quickly passed through most garbage. And there are a lot of beliefs. I only spent 69 minutes and still have many fillers. You get a lot of skinheads that perform a lot of thrilling kissing scenes between stupid teens (poetry, tee) and good examples of why some people shouldn't be actors. <br /> < br /> As for the title character, they hardly have footnotes in the movie. Why do you get more Undead orders than you did before ?! Although considering that the pathetic eyes will break out of the eye socket and eat the brain sequences (among other 'happiness'), maybe that is a blessing that disguises <br /> <br /> and Above all, it looks Like it was taken on someone's mobile phone to broadcast on Youtube. The camera jerked. The scratches on the lights flashed ... I had to rub my eyes when I knew it was created in 2001 and not even 1971. Clothes and fashion look obsolete for about three decades! <br /> <br /> If you think I didn't pass the examination from the chronicles that didn't see this whole movie You try to sit and watch it. I will not give even the first time you are surprised by the smart blue before you make excuses and go. It is truly ridiculous that everyone chooses to release it, and honestly you will enjoy sipping a drink on the disc rather than torturing your DVD player. Really, with this terrible excuse. In fact, do not be surprised if it keeps the bag and leaves in the morning, leaving you in the agenda of watching VHS tapes throughout your life. You have been warned ... 0/10 <br /> <br /> P.S 18 horror movies that the woman wore a big sports bra during forced sex scenes ?! Watching movies can't make that part correct ...
