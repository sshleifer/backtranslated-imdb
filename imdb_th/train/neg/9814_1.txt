This is the type of movie that you regret that you put on the VCR. It's a strange movie of Stephen Raja. The movie "Misery (1990)" I can't understand how this movie has a score of 5.2 because it doesn't. What story, and when the movie ends, I am relieved. <br /> <br /> This movie should be published as a short film. Instead of spending a lot of time with the same thing And in all the bad movies, everything happens at the end of the movie in 10-15 minutes ... <br /> <br /> So before you decide to watch this movie The new battery in your remote control because you are going to forward a lot quickly ... do not worry, you will not miss anything important.
