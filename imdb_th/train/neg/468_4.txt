Before I commented on this film, I just watched it on YouTube. I have to admit that the reason I checked this out was to see what I first saw in TV commercials in 1980: the disunity of Barbara Bach and Since the movie was rated R, I expected to see her nude. Alas, there is no dice for her or any other great actress who appears here: Stacey Nelkin, who should be a teenager. But actually is 20 when you do this Seeing her in underwear and underpants, and later in the belly dancer's dress, is like stirring up like Mr Bach. They give some of the laughter spread to this movie. In fact, I do not blame Ron Leibman for having to remove his name from credit because his role as a licensed licensee is an embarrassing thing, even though I like the "seductive" scene he does. with you This also happened when the launch of Ralph Macchio, a maverick in the series sent to the school of education. Others are black children who love his stepmother and Miss Bak, an Arab, an oil worshiper and a son of a politician who loves his girlfriend Kandy (Nelkin's character). He is very vulnerable to sneaking at night. In the female academy Tom Post plays the formidable character Sisson, which I find to be a joke. With a screenplay by Tom Patchett and Jay Tarses and directions by Robert Downey Sr. (whose son Robert Downey Jr. has a cameo from the beginning of the football scene) Up the Academy is not consistent with the political humor But if you don't really Enraged at scatological content and sex stories, this is actually a pretty harmless joke that the mad magazine and trademark covers children Alfred E. Newman - shouldn't be ashamed even if they used to have their names and characters photographed. . .ps. Another "costume" is Harry Teinowitz, who was born in my birth city in Chicago, who was ill. He played Rodney Ververgaert. He also talks about one of my favorite lines: "I'm coming."
