Although there are some strange, mildly stimulating ideas in the script and the overall curiosity of the movie, Fury of the Wolfman appears to be an interesting and unattractive trip to lycanthropy recorded by the presence of Perla villain Cristal, the rest of the players, including hammy Naschy, is a complete cut. (Although no one has been assisted by the brutal dubbing), although the screenplay contains enough form in the werewolves / Frankenstein / Dr. Moreau, the form for a dozen films, the plot has been developed. Uneven, so weak characters and very absurd conversations (At least in the English version) The hidden interest in the messy procession will be canceled soon. <br /> <br /> The direction of Zabalza seems to be jerking, even skillfully. His dramatic performances are clumsy and inefficient. He was not helped by the bright light of the Villasenor.

In the form of inefficiencies, even with an interesting musical score Traditional special techniques that are ridiculously deserving of special accusations
