I can't say anything bad * or * good about this. The characters are cute enough. They are produced and designed elaborately and look professional. (Except that monster set) However, it doesn't have the initiative, no idea and nothing you have never seen in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and / or OUTLAND. Dirty companies in deep space with unstoppable monsters "flick quite a waste of time.
