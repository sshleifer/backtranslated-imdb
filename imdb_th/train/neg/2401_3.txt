I've seen the movie Wolf Teen better in my time. This one uses the cake. More funny than the horror story "Full Moon High" makes "c" into the cheese festival. The quality of the stars in this film is not bad. In the way it was created, just send down the hill Adam Arkin played the role of Tony, a high school football player in the 1950s, who ended up being not old due to a werewolf biting at Transylvania. Everybody! Ed McMahon plays the conservative father who meets with his ammunition. Alan, Adam's father, plays a shrinking role that doesn't seem to be his game. After many years, Tony seems to be out of place because of the attack, and then he will have the opportunity to enter his state. Laughing more than shedding blood, this movie is just the beginning of the 80s "Teen Wolf" is an improvement from this story! 1 out of 5 stars
