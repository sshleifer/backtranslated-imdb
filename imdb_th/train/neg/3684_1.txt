They sell it as a horror movie. It should be a thriller. But I think it's funny (funny?) I don't think like that.) I laughed the whole movie that I thought it was because of acting and a ridiculous plot. I don't blame the actors. I think they're not so good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a "bad guy" that is very good. She is beautiful and a good actor as well. But let's take a look at the little purpose here. The story mm mm ... direction mm mm ... It lacks many good doubts. In fact, it's a really boring movie. But there is one good thing: it is a short movie, just 1 hour 30 minutes (for me, it's like 10 minutes under water !!!) <br /> <br /> I don't know why this movie Received a very high rating, and in the Rotten Tomatoes the higher the rationality and the objective
