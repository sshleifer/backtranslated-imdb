Ok, I'm always a fan of Batman. I love the animated series and even Batman Beyond. I even read Batman's comics now. Imagine - I was a little excited when I heard about this series and then I was very disappointed What is this set? It doesn't start comparing with the original series. It's like a long toy. There isn't any depth. What is it with Joker? Who in my most humble opinion is Batman, the best villain of all time, and they kill him. I hope I can tell that his design is the worst part. In fact, I hope I can say that there is something about this series that is creative or interesting from a distance in the short term (because believe me, I can say more). Your money
