This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I watched mostly from unusual curiosity since I loved the novel and I hope I don't. I closed the machine after less than an hour. But I want to turn off the device after five minutes I hope i have It doesn't appeal to many novels and changes in all sorts of factors. Unless the movie is able to redeem itself in the last 50 minutes (Which is impossible) I will not recommend this It is an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. I do not think that as many people say it is "The Bell Jar" that is not able to make it unnecessary I almost want to see this one day in the hands of the director and the script writer who can show justice.
