The most striking thing about the semi-musical set in 1920 in Berlin is the excellent film and editing. It's the best from First National in these departments. The story is mildly engaging and similar to the story of the other two stories of Miller (SUNNY, SALLY), where young women who work as romance by wealthy boys and unapproved families The four musical numbers are bound at the beginning of this movie and we are going to stretch the length without any musical floats anymore. Miller sang some parts of I THINK OF BABY and answered because of you. In addition, there is never a blue color and thinks that you are not the first. <br /> <br /> Miller here is very involved and happy, reminiscent of Irene Dunn in the style and delivery offer Sadly, she does not dance like her right hand. SALLY is still her best movie with this second-highest lineup, and Sunny is quite bad. Her life was tragicly cut down from the sinus infection before the hospital day and antibiotics prevented such tragedies. It is worth visiting these films, even if you see Ziegfeld's medieval star.
