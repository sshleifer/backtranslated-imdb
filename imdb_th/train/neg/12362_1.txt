I saw this movie in New York City. I waited for the bus the next morning so it was 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. It was raining and didn't want to wait at PORT AUTHORTY, so I crossed the road to see the worst movie of my life. It's terrible that I choose to live and watch the whole movie. I haven't seen anything bad this year. 69 years old. Called me crazy. I just stayed because I couldn't believe it .........
