First of all, I must say that I love Animal Farm books. I read it with my 9th grade and it was great. We also decided that watching movies would be useful. This movie is disappointing for me. The movie cuts out some characters and thinks of many key issues in the book. It skips a lot and doesn't explain anything. If someone is watching this movie without reading the book, they will be confused. The most frustrating thing for me in this movie is the ending. The end of this book is the most powerful and in the movie, they change it! It should be a pig and a man in the alliance and a sort of "melting" together, but instead of the movie, it seems that the animal will rebel against the pig In conclusion, I don't think this movie captures Orwell's true meaning in his book.
