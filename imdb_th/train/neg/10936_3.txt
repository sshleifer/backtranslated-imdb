I want to like this movie, I really do There are some good actors. But in the end it will be flat It's too difficult to be funny in some places. (Daughter tries to cook with enthusiasm) Go to other people (the scene where they clean someone's yard, so he agrees to join the team) and there are some scenes just as fillers. (All work scenes) and I didn't find "bad guys" threatening or hating worth as much as I found out that they were annoying children. <br /> <br /> I met people who liked the movie while Playing ball in the church And I will say that the referee points to the end. In the end, I do not care much about the character or the quest for the glory of the church. It may be because they all have one dimension, which I may not have thought of a lot if the movie is more fun or seems to be slightly more slippery. Create a good movie But this is not one of them
