I am a big fan of the true crime genre. But I can't sit and read this chapter It's almost as though Dahmer intended to be a nude porn to the pornography soundtrack. There is no way to see what makes Dahmer tick, no survey of who is his victim. Nothing except "See how beautiful this guy is." And I have to make this filmmaker - Dahmer.
