I remember that the film was exhibited in Barcelona (Spain) in the 1970s. Although it may seem unbelievable, and I can't give any explanation, but this film is shown in a theater dedicated to ... movies, art and great quality .. a few people who screened) People who saw it (The lucky ones are without a doubt.) And there is no reference to this very boring SF movie, which can be found in the science fiction encyclopedia of Peter Nichols, or about the author of the novel. That it is a story without many special effects that seem ridiculous in reality and no longer It seems that in some countries, working time is 90 mm and in mothers 77 minutes. It means only a little pain.
