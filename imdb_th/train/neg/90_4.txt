: Spoiler: <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed in Love's stable love. I waited a long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it aired on Thursday night at Hallmark. I love the first three movies of "Love", but this one has nothing like I thought it would be. This film is both sad and depressing. There are many ways and solutions are terrible - with many scenes outside the context. I still think the death of the baby Kathy soon happened and Clark's appearance in the movie seems to be. improper It seems that no actor wants to be there - they don't have emotions. It seems that there is no interaction between Missie and Willie. <br /> <br /> I think the book should be better written. It seems that every movie made out of Janette Oke's writings, I mean, in a movie that they never mentioned about me and two boys or Clark was injured because of it and I think Missie and Willies respond to Kathy's death that can be shown and heard more than just heard. <br /> <br /> From the four films that have been done until now. Is my least favorite I hope to have the next four movies that have more books to follow, and if the character of Clarks is in there, I hope he has a bigger part and I hope his part won't be fresh. I hope that there will be more Scottie and cookies and maybe even Marty. But who knows what the writer will have in the store?
