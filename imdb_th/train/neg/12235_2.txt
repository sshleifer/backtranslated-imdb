If you want to know what kind of white people listen to music in 1974, this is the movie for you. But you have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins as well. (See my words at My Girl 1 as a reference) <br /> <br /> Entrance fee for yourself: I approached My Girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance. Have just watched its ancestors But as a person who is finally prepared to find my mother, My Girl 2 makes me look at the theme of mother search. <br /> <br /> Put another way, what I like about My Girl 2 There is nothing related to My Girl 2, but involves the protagonist who asks, like many adopted children. "Who is my mother?" And if there is a movie about my mother in the theater group, I will be sure to create my own movie. <br /> <br /> People are not lively. The movie should not be dormant. My Girl 2 (like My Girl 1) is just ... ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Avoid if you are not a comfortable nanny with a little annoyance
