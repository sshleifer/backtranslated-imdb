This man is hilarious. It should be under COMEDY or stupid. It will make you realize that the stink of this matter is much easier. Seriously? I want everyone involved in this movie to have immediate effect. For everyone who is thinking of watching this "movie", let's see a few plot points. Oh, wait, no, no. There is no character plot. I think Casper Van Dien is bored and he decides to shoot something with some random and amazing ones. This movie is the worst movie of all time. Don't believe me. Go watch it. Do it. People. I challenge you. But be prepared to gouge your eyes out. If you can do this without making the bull angry, you will be brave and brave.
