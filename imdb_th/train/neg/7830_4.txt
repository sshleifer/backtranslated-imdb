Until now, Nightmares and Dreamscapes are unpredictable and frustrating. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, may offer a little in the way of storytelling or really scary, but at least it is well directed, suspicious and interesting, with a strong performance by William Hurt and impressive special effects. br /> <br /> However, the second story in the series is scary and not in a good way. The screenplay is not good, requires a superficial character and doesn't like to be illogical in order to move the plot and have the character walk endlessly for the purpose of unnecessary performances. The show was too unreasonable and unreliable, and I felt more sympathetic to the first cold-blooded murderer than the newlywed couple. The director uses a million tricks to try to tell a scary story. But with expert acting and writing, the results came out like the first year of film school projects with camera movements for their own benefit. Or tension. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series is still like this, I will be very disappointed. I look forward to installing William H. Macy and hope that he will get a director and a good screenwriter for his segment. Up until now, the quality is still inconsistent in both ways.
