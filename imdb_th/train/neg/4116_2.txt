My one-line summary should explain everything. But I have to go. <br /> <br /> From the trip, this movie looks like opera, soap, too, and that's all I can comment on. There are a few interesting scenes like "Big One" that visits during the middle of the movie But hey, that's what an earthquake * gasp * wait a moment! That's Dante's peak! Some of it was hit and slapped. I can't believe how bad this movie is. "Borrowing" scenes from other movies One of the wonders that the director thought the audience was stupid enough to believe that there was a huge mountain backdrop in the LA forest, Ala Dante's Peak. <br /> <br /> My advice, forget Bond Wanna. - Bae and go to find the real thing (Again, someone from Dante's Peak accidentally) <br /> <br />
