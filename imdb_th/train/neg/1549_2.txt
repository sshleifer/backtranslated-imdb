While Leon is cute on SNL, he takes just one minute like SNL skits-to-movies. Most cannot add 90 minutes. It has a lovely time. (The person you have seen in the example) But most actors lose. Tim Meadows did his best. But the plot has a very high score Farrell will have a small part. Farrell may be the most funny person alive ... but not in this movie. It's a shame.
