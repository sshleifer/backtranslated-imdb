I don't like Love Sick as much as I think. Finally, this film shows the sexual relationship of Alex, kik, Sandu. Their triangular love is full of frustration, frustration and jealousy. Eventually, Alex wakes up and realizes that they are not born. Results and future <br /> Director Tudor Giurgiu is in the AMC theater on Sunday at 12:00 on the 08/10/06. We watched the movie together. After this film, he told the audience that the purpose of this film, which represents the sexual relationship of Romania, is a kind of complexity. <br /> <br /> In my view, my sexual life is Always complicated everywhere I Did not feel the impression and effect from the movie The ongoing love of Alex and Kiki and Kiki and her brother Sandu are stories of neighboring neighbors. <br /> <br /> The two main reasons I don't like this movie are the first. Tell us how they started to fall in love? Sounds like after Alex moved into the building where Kiki is still alive. Then two women fell in love. It's not reasonable. How can women fall in love with other women instead of men? Too many parts, you have to create images and connect those stories with your thoughts. Secondly, the whole movie has no scenes of Alex's sex and Kik. That's what I'm waiting for ???? However, there are still some parts that should be introduced. The "ear piercing" is very interesting. Alex is willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate the love of Kik. That is the scene that reminds you of their love. In addition, their scenes are lying on the football field. The dialogue that shows their love is real and passionate.
