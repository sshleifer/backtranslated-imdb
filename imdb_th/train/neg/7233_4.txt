I feel like a genius I felt like I was the only person who saw through this fake movie. I watched it three times, one time with explanations, and I found myself feeling annoyed at the close of every time the screen went dark and the worst of all, I felt that the movie had never been solved. Yes, the priest died, but he Did not feel peace with the city that caused him to mourn or to himself That and he is an idiot. If it is not a description by Peter Cowie that explains not only the movie but the book that comes from me, I can't stomach it at all. I enjoy french movies But this is completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The diary of the Country Priest was filmed with beautiful black and white photography. Behind the scenes of extreme close-ups that the characters don't say anything until the camera is cut and gloomy. Don't create interesting or relevant stories. How did this movie become a classic with incredible ideas: It reminded me of the new clothes of The Emperor's. <br /> <br /> Yes, Claude Laydu's performance shows sincerity and thought if you A sadist I felt empty because, in general, it was the weak feelings of the Catholic priesthood, which is a corrupt and embarrassing corruption institution. The victory of the young priest on the countess's pride is a weak scene, but 90% of the film will drag you down with fantasy and boring windows. This priest is not as humble as he is so poor. <br /> <br /> Being that I don't speak or understand French, I'm waiting to do something in English to help understand the movie. Sometimes SUBTITLE English. It is impossible to watch / read and roll the text very fast so much that I can't read. (And I'm not a very slow reader - I just finished Dostoyevsky in 3 days.) <br /> <br /> I really want to like this movie. I tried everything "selected" by the criteria collection and still couldn't see why in many aspects this thing was very popular. However, I watched two hours of movies that wished to recognize the main characters and never before appeared. He seemed to be a victim rather than a fighter. And for that I say it stunk
