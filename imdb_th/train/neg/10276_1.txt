So you may read some comments posted in this movie and you might think to yourself that "Well, of course, there are many reviews of RAVE REVIEWS posted on December 30." The funny thing is that most critique reviews seem to come from the same person or small group that is coordinated. Of the group "Open House" In fact, my friend is not really able to see this movie. Just because it is "free" does not mean that it will receive a free ticket. If you are going to do a musical, whether it be movies or on stage, whether on Broadway or at the local community theater, you should make sure that (a) your actors can sing (b) your actors can dance Yes, (c.) You have a good sound device (d.) You have a score that is well written and (e.) You have lyrics that are witty and charming. Even Anthony Rapp can't record this. It was one of the unfortunate movie experiences that I felt extremely embarrassed for everyone involved.
