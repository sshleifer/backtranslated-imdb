Saw this movie running in a matter of hours with TCM. Many problems of this film were evident from what I saw The first time, the adult did not age when the child had done 10 years. Many films had continuity problems and for some reason, the actors who played the youngest son seemed to be the most aged 10 years ago. /> The copy that I saw disappeared for about 20 minutes or at least there was a big gap with a black screen appearing. It's too bad, because even though the script leaves something to be desired, both Bergman & Russell did well in the film in their role. It is a shame that a large chunk is gone. But what is here is watching. <br /> <br /> I'm just hoping it won't be damaged. The script has little reason for Bergman's character to be sent out when a small child. But was brought back to take care of them when they were adults Some lines are not reasonable. There is a competition in the stock market that is similar to the year 1929, but the children grow up to fight in World War 1. All the performances of supporters in this film are normal. Just wondering what is in the 20 spaces of the movie that I can't see while it's gone.
