I do not give out "people" often, but if there is a movie that deserves such attention, that is "Gas!" On the face completely in the effort * H with a similar story (In the movie "Whiffs" - see here on IMDb, http://www.imdb.com / title / tt0073891 / for more information) <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould approach the brass ring too "Whiffs "More than Corman did with" Gas! "But didn't go there. One movie close to the success of M * A * S * H. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" What's wrong? what? No one came close to performing at a higher level than the masquerade of a high school. Foul production Some people here talk about the amazingly new built-in headlights on the fleeing car and still lack a lot of attention to detail. Nothing works as it should be in this movie, and no one is interested. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" Really made me sleep. It didn't cure insomnia. But really close in Cinematic Sleep Induction "Gas!" Falls between "Last year at Marienbad" and the creation of George Clooney's "Solaris" (which is amazing, more boring than the Mosfilm manuscript, although not familiar with the idea of ​​attracting the attention of viewers) br /> Corrections will destroy "Gas!" for about twenty minutes. The results are pointless. But not much more than the original movie. <br /> <br /> Some movies are terrible, they have interesting qualities. This is not one of them. Don't waste time. It's not even bad.
