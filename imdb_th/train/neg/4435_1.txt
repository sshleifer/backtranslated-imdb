God, I haven't watched this movie for a long time. It may not be from 'The New Guy' or the various Freddie Prinze Jr. movies. Yes, it is surprisingly scary. The empty performances and woodwork of Mira Sorvino must be inspired by Freddie. Theatrical performances are awkward. (Like playing quite and the feeling of detention is not working with the movie), the actors don't know what they are doing, especially Sorvino Her accent is terrible and her sex appeal is not here, so it's painful to see other characters and what is the shot of a live audience on a ridiculous lawn chair! I have to turn off the DVD player. It would be a pain for myself to end the movie.
