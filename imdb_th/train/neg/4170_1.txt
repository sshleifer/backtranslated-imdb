This is an unpredictable thing. If there is a story here, somewhere, it is buried deep under the gruesome character and the camera work that is shaken until it is invisible. There are a group of vampire hunters who do things and vampires that they kill have little aliens in them. They popped their heads out and spoke like Speedy Gonzales. If you imagine the blood and gore covered with socks, the alien puppet screams in horror. These people are loud, terrifying and extremely annoying. Then there were some anti-human beings that stood around their CGI spacecraft so incredibly unimaginable. These people make Hillary Clinton look like a right wing extremist in comparison. They are friends with vampires or something ... Who is interested. <br /> <br /> Then the camera works. Can you remember that everyone hates nonsense thousands of times per minute from creating the latest Rolleball? People who make this movie will love that. There are enough here for three crappy nu-metal videos on MTV. <br /> <br /> Nuff says this has a smell. In comparison, Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
