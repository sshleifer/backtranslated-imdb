When you want the dragon to eat all the cast members, you know that you are on a bad path. <br /> <br /> I go with very low expectations and read other comments and do not disappoint. Different from other cheap and failed movies, but this movie is not funny, fun. (And unintentionally) <br /> <br /> - Teachers follow - <br /> <br /> First, the plot It's not very consistent. When looking through the "small" error, such as the dragon grows in 3 hours, all the ideas that are based on chaos Watching the movie wants us to believe that dragons come from space in the form of meteorites, which are really dragon eggs. After explaining this, they show a farmer appearing with a pitchfork and a dragon emerges. Later scientists "The mad scientist" has babbled about how the dragon is older than the dinosaurs. Obviously, humans are around when dinosaurs are or we just have a good little box here. Another important thing is that the lab is bombarded with force. "Strong half" is the same as used with Hiroshima. Then the two went to check everything and almost no danger! There is another dragon that grows from who knows. In conclusion, it can predict a lot. As soon as the man mentioned the cloning, I guess they would clone the dragon. That means that the safety of our smart pants is not easy to use and clever as the movie will make you believe if you don't care if I know that this movie is about dragons. <br /> <br /> Put that thing. The second worst thing is Some "special techniques" refer to the fake stones that fell during the first phase. CG helicopters and dragons looked better than little drops, but they destroyed what they would do when they walked through the hall at the same time Their credit, flying dragon at first, looks okay from a distance. (Although people in the cave are probably the worst person in the movie) However, these things look funny. The scene that shows millions of different images of the same person who is not the same or the "recommended" screen with important statistics. <br /> <br /> Arrive the actors. They are not great. But I guess at least they try? They seem to be more enthusiastic about what they do than many actors who participate in the latest "BloodRayne" and you have to rate them. One thing I noticed was that the woman who played Meredith often had her face covered with cosmetics that had a lighter color than her. She looks like she is not working well with some white face. <br /> <br /> The script is bad and wonderful. You didn't really notice the music. But actually it's not too bad for most. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is not to see if you don't want to see it because you heard that it's bad (like I do). Bad CG effects. Also, don't waste your time and money.
