This is a rather convincing piece about the destroyed WW II code, stolen, etc. The show was about what I expected from the actor MGM "B". This actor <br /> <br /> should be Be careful of one important thing. Jean Rogers, who has done a great job in playing Dale Arden, the sexiest in the first two films of Flash Gordon, is great in this movie. Her character is extremely annoying. She didn't give up too much. We should believe that during the height of the World War, what was clearly the most secret code, she would be allowed to enter the office of her choice, even if she had no official duties. From that point of view, I'm sorry I used to watch this movie. It changed my perception of Ms. Rogers forever. Talentwise, she's very light. <br /> <br /> Lee Bowman is his normal self, which means he's enough. <br /> <br />
