Was banned as 'Video Nasty' in the UK. Unhinged received natural misbehavior However, the most shocking thing I found about this movie was the inexperience in every department. The neglect that I can manage: terrifying performances, humble corrections, terrifying directions, terrifying scripts and abysmal soundtracks that are difficult to implement Travel to the Storm Music Festival. They are assisted by friendly strangers who take them to a nearby house. The old lady's house owner, a battery and her lovely daughter, welcome the girls to stay for them to rest for a few days to recuperate. However, some people do not want children out! They are the victims of an unseen attacker. <br /> <br /> Spend a long time traveling and presenting the worst acting ever in a horror movie. (And takes some time) Unhinged is the real, great movie This song is totally messy. (It sounds like the three-year-old boy has released the synthesizer) and it helps to fill the movie perfectly. Only a few scenes that are filled with blood and a little bit of pornography help Unhinged not get the lowest score. <br /> <br /> If you are a horrorist (And, unfortunately, I am), you will want to see this to mark off the offensive video list But received a warning, it was really bad
