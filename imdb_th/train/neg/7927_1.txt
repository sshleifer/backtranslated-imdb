This movie is excellent. The day before I watched my cousin Jay He said it's okay. But I think it's RULEZZZ! I mean, it's really cool. Ted V. Mikels is brave and smart. He made the movie completely, unlike the horrible Hollywood movies like Matrix and STop or my mother would shoot. It should be better. I like ninjas and pirates I also like big paws that funny people wear. I think he's the coolest person since the Domino Pizza Claymation Guy. Not only does this movie look really cool, like an out-of-focus movie that my father made from my birthday when I was six years old, but it tells the story Complex with dozens of characters that seem to be totally unrelated. In the end, it's a genius that this web site has done to make everything meet. I hope. Ted V. Mikels will create a sequel. But it needs more aliens And a pirate
