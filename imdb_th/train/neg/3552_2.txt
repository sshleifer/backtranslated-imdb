I finally saw INCUBUS after waiting for 20 strange things for many years to see and it was not worth it to wait for it all the time to see it. THE INCUBUS is a horror movie that has many followers, with the killer / mon The invisible spurs are raping and killing women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The movie looks like this: the movie opens with the killing. Then blah blah blah; More than blah blah blah; Then kill again More than that, blah blah blah; Continuing with blah blah blah; There is another killing. (Surprising, right?); blah blah blah etc ... <br /> <br /> This movie can be predicted from beginning to end. Even the "stupid" red herring used in this movie could not convince a 5-year-old boy, and I discovered the secret identity of the incubator at the time I saw the character. That "shocking" arrived. I was not shocked or surprised. In fact, it's very funny that I kept on a laughing day after I watched the movie. It was so stupid. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is the story that makes "Rock Band". That sequence is one of the most remarkable moments in this boring movie. It's a striking scene, not necessarily because it's good. But because it's funny and pointless: movies played on the big screen show the moments like rock videos with men in red leather pants that obviously cut his long hair. Edited by the scene of the girl who was attacked in the cinema by the incubator The best thing I can say about this movie is the movie I like. But besides, there is nothing to say about THE INCUBUS except that it is hilariously unintentionally.
