This is one of the movies that you think the creator will refuse to publish because it's terrible. Obviously they are thinking that children are stupid and excellent in absorbing infinite advertising and think they are entertaining because it's so much fun. This car has a button saying Wendy's, McDonalds, M & M's and Skittles. No cars. Speaking in the cartoon (Dr.) Talon should be evil, not handsome and charming. Why Rupert Everet 'Claw' anyway, writer about drugs When they write these scenes? It seems that they are Roboon Cop (bad) by turning men into robots to fight crime. I tried to get a refund. But there is a policy that if I watch movies for more than 30 minutes, you will not receive a refund. I am sorry that I watched that garbage dump for more than 30 minutes after I was informed about the non-refundable policy. I decided to look at the disgusting garbage called Inspector Gadget.
