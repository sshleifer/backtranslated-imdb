This movie caused unintended laughter more than anything I had ever seen. Really, if you are a Tolkien fan, rent it to laugh with your friends. I'm not going to be a million person to break down its disadvantages ... All I will say is this movie. (For me) lost the important point in changing my favorite character, Sam to become an idiot, shame, shame ... 3/10
