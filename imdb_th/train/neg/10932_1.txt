The sad thing is that this is probably the highest budget "Halestorm Entertainment" that has to work with. Everyone involved should be fined for garbage dumping because all of the celluloid they lose is good for nothing more than adding garbage. But the work of the camera and the quality of the movie is the best amateur. The soundtrack seems to have been created in some PC laptops. The worst part of all is that I actually sat through the whole thing. I think just because I can't believe that I paid to buy tickets and the cinema I watched agreed to show "movies".
