Good efforts and good ideas (Prostitution is a human prostitute ...) but bad results ... The director tried to imitate his French colleague Tran Anh Hung by creating an atmosphere that would describe Vietnam ... one problem Is that Vietnam is long gone and when "The smell of raw papaya" has a historical background ... trying to project this atmosphere (Muffled voice and slow pace of life ..) on a modern day makes a fake feeling In addition, it also creates a feeling of weariness quickly and the results are too clear. <br /> <br /> I can only think that the action took place in Saigon or Da Nang because that was where Harvey Kafiti. Former Marines in the movie May have been stationed during the war ... but in southern Vietnam, no one or few people who speak with the northern accent shown by the actors ... seriously strange even for bad Vietnamese speakers <br /> <br /> The old poet who is leprosy ... very suspicious (not a disease for those who have his condition), a farmer girl who can read and write complex poems in Vietnam ... more suspicious. .. <br /> <br />
