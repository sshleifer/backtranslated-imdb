When talking about horror movies, I am more than happy to suppress unbelief, ignoring the sub-production values ​​and overlooking interesting channels. This film is not scary enough to be presented. It cannot be enjoyed as a camp. Bad conversations, inaccurate performances, bad directions, killers are predictable and poorly organized, the music is annoying, camera work is terrible, even the set is bad. I felt really bad for the actors who tried clearly. But had to deal with horrible conversations, planned and lacking clear directions I wonder if they are trained as well. It's embarrassing to look and be boring than to pass to the end. The planned "surprise" requires a lot of patience. It's quite easy, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Usually I don't write reviews. But this movie was so bad that I felt forced to warn others. This movie is completely time consuming. If you have to watch this movie, don't miss the "creation" -featurette. The writer / director seems to be under the impression that the female killer is brave and brave (already seen). He and the actor spend time. Half an hour to separate parts of the film as if it were "Citizen Kane". A new era. It's like listening to a group of third graders leading you to the background of the Christian contest. Their They think they create something that is substantial. Is it really sad? The only reason I made this movie "2" is because I think "1" should be reserved for true cruelty, such as "Manos: Hands of Fate" and "Space Mutiny". So "American Nightmare" is not a bad movie. The most I've ever seen But I must say that it is somewhere in the bottom fifty
