Essentially, the story of man and nature, this film has beautiful movies, the dense forests of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, but this film never actually happened. Newlwed Taylor was ignored and abandoned by her husband and later pulled. Went to the chief worker of the farm where Dana Andrews played the garden, under the spell of the late father of Peter Finch, who had a murmuring ghost above the Elephant Walk This is a key point of contention between Taylor and finches. The elephants are determined to restore their original route to the water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their right. The ferocious beast and the best moments in the picture Taylor and Andrew had a great time as she struggled to maintain a faithful wife, even though he married Finch.
