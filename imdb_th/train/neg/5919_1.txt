I rented this movie yesterday and barely able to show my disappointment in the little Laura Industries for engaging in something that is not good. I'm not sure if it's a horrible writing or bad governance or both. But it makes the audience very disappointed to waste time watching this story It consists of innocent stories that are weak, very bad lines and live on beautiful landscapes and lovely people only to sell it. Unfortunately this is not enough. You should rent a tape full of static electricity to waste time with this nonsense. Lindsey Wagner has a pathetic role as the owner of the farm that is clearly working very hard. The ranch knows that this is an obvious work from young people from Los Angeles.
