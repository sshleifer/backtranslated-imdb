Let me start by saying that I will try not to put too many spoilers here. I normally enjoy Robin Williams movies, but this gem is not one of them. It was charged as a thriller. The audience at night was nothing but blunt. There were 6 people on the opening day of the theater. 2 went out for good reason. This movie I think is written and directed poorly. The show is fine. But nothing to work with A film about a storyteller who read a good book by a dying child. However, put * like a ghost here *, no one can check the existence of children. So Williams went to Wisconsin to try to find the author. However, what he received was headaches and excuses from the caregiver. Boy That's it all You wait about an hour and a half and the movie will end. It is excited and chills as much as visiting a dentist. Homosexual, eye-catching or eye-catching. There's nothing really related to this, and this film has a little bit of vulgarity. But it seems that it will be thrown into it without reason and there is little reason In conclusion, I cannot write good reviews in this movie because there is nothing for it. It's cute, like watching dry colors. I gave it 2 because the performance of what was worth was okay and it wasn't directed by Uwe Ball.
