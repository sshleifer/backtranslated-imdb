I didn't expect much from this movie, but boy-o-boy, I didn't expect this movie to be so bad. Chris Rock doesn't show good action here. You can't get that caracter. I think the movie is probably better if it is a drama or a romantic scene that will be part of the movie and / have a better sense of humor. This movie is like a filmmaker with a bad hangover, resulting in "doing" they don't show a single smile. This is a terrible movie! I give three tenth because a little smile to me, but I never laugh!
