I expect to be a bad movie and get a bad movie. But I can't imagine in my worst imagination how bad this movie is. I don't want to try to explain what Blood Surf is about. Not about blood surfing But as a huge $ crocodile, they complain about the fake shark in the jaw. But Spielberg is clever and doesn't show sharks until the end. There are many crocodile shows here and it's the worst fake crocodile I've ever seen and they don't try to hide it. If you want to see a disguised crocodile watching Placid Lake, <br /> <br /> The director has the opportunity to create an interesting movie of waves / sharks. But he had to make a b-monster movie. He had the opportunity to create a traditional surf movie. But he wants to create a monster movie So do you understand that this movie is bad? Is there a good part? Not really. It has nudity and sex scenes taken from the playboy movie. The performance was not as bad as the other half, and Kate Fischer looked good. Unfortunately she didn't take her off. The leading actors are not too bad. They have potential The location is beautiful and the movie starts well with a good surf scene. The fault is that the writer and director who is not a patent The conversation is the worst thing I have ever seen, and the script is written very badly and the director doesn't have any ability and is not very imaginative. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. Look at Sirens to see Kate nude and see Lake Placid. If you want good crocodile action, <br /> <br /> 3/10 because I'm in a good mood. (But not a good actor) and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi work well with the sh # t parts they have to work with
