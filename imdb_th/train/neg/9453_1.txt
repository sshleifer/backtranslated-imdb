What is the Holy Cow movie? I can't say how these filmmakers can bring 250 books and turn into movies. I guess they don't know! I do not remember the farting or burping in your books. <br /> <br /> They spend this time with classic kids, adding farting, burping and sex parody and making it funny KAKA should give you a good idea of ​​what these Hollywood manufacturers think. I have to speak with eyes. It's interesting. But the wonderful sight story was destroyed by the humor in the bathroom. (If you think it's a joke) I don't want the kids that I think are true. <br /> <br /> Don't take your children to watch. Don't rent a DVD. I hope Doctor Suess ghost's ghosts will come and haunt the people who created this movie.
