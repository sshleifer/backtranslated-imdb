I felt utterly embarrassed when watching this movie. I waited for a year to be eliminated here in New Zealand. I shouldn't have created myself a lot because it was very frustrating and no doubt that Clark's worst film was very unusual for this movie. First of all, some performances are fantastic, especially Nick Stahl, while 'The Bully' and a girl with curly brown hair. (I can't remember her name) But for the most part, it is unbelievable and incredible, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is now a veteran of Clark's movie and he is good at 'Kids'. With this solemnity to turn his scene into a joke The screenplay feels like being written by a film student in the first year. Don't regret one high school student who has never seen a movie before. And I can't understand Clark's intention Did he try to point out the meaning of these children? Of course, when Hell didn't stop him from going into horrible horrors I'm not a rude person But I don't want to see the breasts and teen butt every 5 minutes. I still insist that Clark's best movie is 'Another Day in Paradise'. It's great and I don't think he will be on top.
