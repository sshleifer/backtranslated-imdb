I am a big fan of the original Cracker series and own them all on DVD. Nutcracker tends to be a great person on occasion, but Robbie Coltrane and other actors, including writers, seem to always carry it out. I counted the original crackers in the crime crime series on the great Brit TV at that time and there was fierce competition: Prime Suspect, Inspector Frost, Inspector Morse, Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Homes and other Cracker hosts, along with Prime Suspect. On top of my list <br /> <br /> which makes "A New Terror" more sad ... <br /> <br /> Finally, this is Very pale imitation of Cracker's past glory. I forced myself to sit through all things, believing that it would not be so bad, and eventually the sparks would ignite. I am wrong. It's bad from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> There is very little criticism: First, just get the prejudice that may have happened: I was opposed by the anti-American side against the war. The screed that droned in and throughout the most performances The Unbounded: The murder of two naive Americans of any crime and the British junkie is, in the words of Fitzpatrick "understood but not justified" me. Thinking, "I walked for a couple of hours to listen to this disgusting sound." So I had a negative reaction to the anti-war voice / America's beliefs that arose from my beliefs ... From politics, I have a clear feeling that this cracker is just a prop for propaganda and it helps to undermine. The script is very weak. <br /> <br /> Two seconds. Robbie Coltrane. How much is broadcast? Fitz is almost a player in this story, as if he were a person who was connected to the story written without thinking that Fitz Coltrane's role was able to present a performance on his shoulder that was wide and still there. suitability But the writer thinks of other things and missed the opportunity and has a wide distance. <br /> <br /> Third: What is the King of SCRIPT! With some sparkle and a few bit of character development (Fitz's son bragged that Fitz could not stay at his home if he missed his plane to Australia. The detective likes to beat his poor actor. The head and the old sparks between Fitz and Miss) but not enough to make the story boring. <br /> <br /> Where is the fourth hell? Panhallagan? Now it's interesting ... It's Manchester and 10 years that you have to be ranked. Another opportunity that is wasted (Or perhaps the actors don't care?) <br /> <br /> Well, there is a lot (terrible) to say, but I'll close with curiosity: at the end of the show (when aired on BBCA) when The advertisement announced that "Director's Cut" is available on the BBC On-Demand. I think AH-HA! The director's cut, which is probably something to pay, may have all the things I expect to see tonight. But never made like an interesting and consistent story Unfortunately, after believing himself to be sitting in a terrible "A New Terror" version in the hope of seeing something worth looking at, just disappointed, I had no hope to really stimulate me to pay for the second generation. May be longer and more boring It also made me angry that I thought that BBCA sliced ​​and diced and sacrificed show time to support endless advertising streams. (Every ten minutes or more) then turned around and asked me to pay for what might be a version tonight. <br /> <br /> To close, I would like the first paragraph of the examination of Wah. Of the "New Terror": It says it all: "The first excitement about Robbie Coltrane recoup his role as a flaw. The criminal psychologist is being snowed by a heavy political statement writer. Jimmy McGovern is determined to deliver within this revival video. Jolting, initially in its message - is that the Americans are a bunch of people who don't like it. A little bit of terrorism before it invaded our doorstep - McGovern's clear chest of words caused a story and gagged the joy of seeing Fitz back in the case. "
