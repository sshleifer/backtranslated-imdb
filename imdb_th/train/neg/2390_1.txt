I love Tom Robbins's book, so I am so excited and interested in watching movies made from one of his books. I know there is no way that the movie will catch half the magic of Robbins. But after watching the movie, it made me not want to read the book again. The Cowgirls Get the Blues film does not include the eighth content in the book and seems to focus on connecting love between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy more than anything else. In addition to the incredibly weak plot in the movie, I think the better actor may be chosen to play as a character. The only actor in the movie that I think plays their role is appropriate for Robbins' description in this book. It is Julian's friend in the clip five minutes at the beginning of the movie Those who do not read this book may enjoy movies. But as a big Tom Robbins fan, this movie doesn't have But disappointment
