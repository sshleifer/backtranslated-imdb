I saw this movie the day before in the movie class and I have never seen Almodovar movies before but expect it to be good. Unfortunately it turned out to be a pointless movie with only a few laughter mixed with full boredom for two hours. High heels are just a collection of random scenes that may work in their own separate movies. But together does not add any meaningful meaning. <br /> <br /> or so I think Then, the next day, my film instructor spent the entire period explaining the small details of the film, such as the murals showing the flamenco dancers in the background. Spain as a developed country under the fascist rule Obviously, this movie is full of clever little tricks and references. <br /> <br /> Great. But you know what? It's still a bad movie. It takes more than the depth and complexity of creating a good movie - you still have to give the audience a reason to pay attention. What makes the audience interested enough to pay attention to all the delicate tips. High heels give us strange characters. But in most situations, they are often reused from other films, and Almodovar does not seem to use them to create any issues. The end of the movie? Why is that like that? <br /> <br /> There is one funny scene related to broadcast news. And that is only a fun time The rest of the film is just a reference to the ridiculous movie and the visual cues that are only clear to show us how Pedro Almodovar is wise. More time than using manual tricks to make a good movie come out
