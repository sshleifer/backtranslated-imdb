Dakota (1988) is one of the early Lou Diamond Phillips starring vehicles. This film is similar to the film released later. There is a slight difference But the same I don't know which one came first. I think it will be one of the mysteries of life. But they both have problems with "children" that try to make life available. Instead of being a motorcycle related to horses Basically they are the same movie and they both are like hell. If you are a serious L.D.P fan then I suggest you watch them both. You have been attacked and posted from L.D.P. If you are a game, try playing <br /> <br /> Not recommended except L.D.P. Fans !!!
