This movie begins with the execution of a shaman and beloved. His head was cut and buried, his body ... looked like "something that didn't die", right? It played a bit like this. But when the body reunited with the head, an interesting and horrible death ended and the movie moved very slowly. I mean, this movie is only 88 minutes long and I still think "When will it end?" The characters in this movie are mostly idiots and they deserve to die because they are very stupid. Because he was afraid of gems The only thing that will keep you watching after the head is reattached is the fact that there are many girls who are flashing, which you really get lost. But still, I want to watch horror movies, not soft core porn movies, and as a horror movie, it is a way to slow down the movement with a slow stretching method to make it fun. Because it is like having a flesh eating zombies attacking the city. No ... Just a small scene where three or four zombies attack the house. It's not a factor in movies and their scenes are useless. So mostly I think you should avoid this movie if you don't find it really cheap.
