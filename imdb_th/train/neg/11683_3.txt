Three stories and not enough to be combined. "Inside Man" is a very scary story and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Even though there was a time of it But the movie began to appear as a fast-paced thriller that caused slow crawling, fast jumping between highs and lows. I will give credit to Denzel Washington. He plays his role perfectly, with an insight into his human side. Clive Owen did well with his partner as "Intelligent genius" and "mastermind criminals" (both are not the same in retrospect). Overall, each person creates an excellent subset of individuals. Yet when the pieces finally came together and everything was considered "ah-ha!" Immediately or the sum of everything Everything ended up with very little energy that started with a lot of holes, lots of questions, and as I said before, nowhere near the normal level of Spike Lee. I must not strongly agree with what is called "Professional critics" ... This is not the movie they played.
