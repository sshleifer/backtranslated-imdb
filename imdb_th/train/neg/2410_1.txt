Hood of the Living Dead and other films that they directed seem like they were gathered and filmed this story with a friend who wasn't gifted one afternoon when they were bored. I found that 95% of amateur movies and over 90% of home video videos are better than this movie. (Although the similarities between them guarantee comparison) "Hey, let's see if there is anyone stupid enough to buy our movies?" Hope that no one else can't. I apologize to those who participate in the review because this review is quite severe. But I am the one who read your fake reviews and bought movies.
