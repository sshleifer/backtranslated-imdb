Yes, this movie is a real thief. It stole the Academy Award from Avatar just because politicians wanted another war hero movie to increase acceptance. I don't want to go here for politics. But here it is clearer than the summer sky. The Hurt locker doesn't have anything outstanding. No real plot. I felt myself in the 50s of Hungary when the party told people what they would like and didn't like. The same propaganda movie was created at that time, except for only black and white movies. Although we consider this name as a reasonable type of genre "War in the United States" is great. But you have better movies to choose from
