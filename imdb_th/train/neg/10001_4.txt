This movie has nothing I can not catch at first: the special talent of the leading actors. This means that there is a lack of chemistry when she shares the screen with her leading actor. Even romantic scenes are still just actors playing. It is very likely that the director predicted what he wanted from the actor. I don't know. <br /> <br /> Can you be a screenplay? Who do you love? It seems that he is more passionate about his cooking and restaurant skills and ultimately is himself and exploiting from his youth. He never believed me that he fell in love with the princess. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed in this movie. But don't forget that it was nominated for an Academy Award, so judge for yourself.
