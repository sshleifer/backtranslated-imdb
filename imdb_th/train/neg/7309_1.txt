I rented and watched this movie for the first time on DVD without reading any reviews about it. So after watching 15 minutes, I noticed that there was something wrong with this movie; It is scary! I mean, in the example, it looks scary and serious. <br /> <br /> I think Eli Roth (Mr. Director) thinks that if every character in this movie is stupid, the movie will be funny ... (Silly It's funny ... wrong!) He should watch and learn from horrible comedies such as: "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" and "The Return Of the Living Dead"! That's a joke! <br /> <br /> "Fever in the cabin" is the reason I signed up with www.IMDb.com so that I could release the dissatisfied thoughts. <br /> <br /> I made a decision. To watch the movie for the second time> AAARGH! <And make a note for "review" part of me to show how this movie is stupid, "Resident Evil" (horror) or "Where's my car?" (Funny) I can see over and over Again and still enjoy! But here ...! <br /> <br /> How bad is the script and director ??? This story is terrible. This is a scary scene, in chronological order: <br /> <br /> In the first scene we saw Henry, who did not know that his dog was lying on the floor with a tongue hanging from the mouth and staring. The dead mirror is <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't explain anything about a long-haired blonde who likes to bite someone. <br /> <br /> And my answer to the question is not. Marcy's answer ("What's wrong with the forest?" ") There is" nothing ". The script has a bearded man warning them about the forest, just" suspense ". <br /> <br /> Then" smart "of 5 packs. Burt almost gave us. Is an example of how to start a forest fire. He met Henry, who has already been infected. Now, the person who asks for help and from here in the movie wants to break the record in using the word "F-word" Bert. Be surprised because Henry is very ill. Bert: "Do you? (He forgot to add: "... with my BB gun!") <br /> <br /> Bert headed back to the cabin. He met Marcy and Jeff. Having sex But now decided to go for a walk! Marcy brings a clever fire that was not careful before Burt. (A clear time for change?) Bert doesn't say anything about Henry because the fool thinks he killed him with a BB gun. <br /> <br /> Later, when all five Estupidos sat around the fire Of them, the strange people appeared with his dog (Maybe that's a warning about the forest. It's about. It's full of strange ... and their dogs!?) They let him sit with them just because they have a large bag full. Go with marijuana (Their brain is completely drunk! Not surprisingly, why they all died!) This is the last time that we can see this memorable character ... still alive. <br /> <br /> Henry appeared. Note: He lied all the time, a few yards from their cabin !!!) Looks worse, almost like a zombie covered with goo! He said he needed a doctor. But Einstein refused to help the poor He entered the unlocked truck, of course, with the key to the ignition. It seems that Henry is smart enough to drive the hell out of there. But instead of slapping the blood to the seat control panel and the window instead. The Fantastic Five comes out with weapons: a BB Gun, knife, baseball bat (* huh? Used to play baseball in the middle of the forest ???), poker and a (insecticide) - able to fight with unmarried and unmarried men (A clever script!) Bert manages to kill the car with a single shot of the BB gun, which is only possible in the heart of director Eli Roth. "What should I do? Bert shouted at his defense. Jeff and Paul try to beat Henry with a bat and poker. But missed and hit the truck window instead Henry went to find a dumb woman who said: "He came to me!" (Thank you for the information, fool, I can see! But I don't think he wants to do any harm to you!) Marcy injects into his eyes, causing Henry to cry! And our "hero" Paul touches Henry's arm with a burning fire from the fire, which they leave to recklessly burn while in the cabin! (Where is all the wisdom gone? I guess the marijuana has started collecting money! :-) Henry turns into a human torch and runs out screaming <br /> <br /> The next day, Chief Bert and Jeff Come out for the technician And Marcy decided to "Go for help" by yourself in the woods while Paul is behind with the Karen ... Doesn't that sound silly? Marcy should be with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert are "asking for help". <br /> <br /> Now I skip my comments to the way we see Marcy in CANOE. devious! How do you get a canoe? Do you know that you are going! However, she went to the bank of the river and found a large cabin and seemed to be abandoned, and as in most horror movies, went into the cabin, saying: "Hello? Is there anyone? "Suddenly, Bert sprang up from behind the furniture and scared her. (And me at first) and followed by Jeff as well. How did they come here! Do they swim across the river ??? Do you see that the script is silly! <br /> <br /> Deputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin. He didn't notice the blood on their truck. This happened about 35 minutes to watch and I decided to stop torturing myself anymore and turn on the DVD. (Before I leave my eyes! ... Now it's funny!) <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, do yourself a favor, then watch "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" or "The Return of Living Dead. "You will see that they are more fun than this ... Even" Toxic Avenger, Episode 2 ", which is a lousy movie, is a fun way than" Cabin Fever ".
