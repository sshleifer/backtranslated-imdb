I believe in keeping religion away from the government and from movies. When I want to preach, I will go to church. But I don't want from the movie I don't care about supernatural themes. (After that, religion is about as supernatural as you can!) But this movie has a lot of preaching until I'm annoyed The landowner reminds me of the witch seen in other movies. The bad guy looks like he's horny If only life is simple I think when that movie is stupid, they should be published too. Warning: Danger! Announcements are available here!
