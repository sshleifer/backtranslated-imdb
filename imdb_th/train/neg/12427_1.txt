I hate this movie It is a terrible, terrible, poor story, a terrifying performance, a real stupid criminals who are not at least funny. (Which is different from the first two films that are very good alone), all the bushy traps are weak Lazy because their salary is not higher than $ 20 per week This film is definitely lousy. It's not worth even renting. In fact, do not look in t.v.! Go take your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two! I don't give this 1 star (out of 10). Just believe me when I say that if you like the first two and you're not a complete fool, you won't like this movie.
