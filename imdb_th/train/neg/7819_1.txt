... This will be the worst movie I've ever seen. Um, okay, maybe tied with Boogeyman and scary, really scary. <br /> <br /> I have low expectations and can't find them! I can't think of a good thing. So this is the worst point ... <br /> 1 The Acting 2. The Plot 3. The CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics .... seriously) 4. THE THE PLOT 5. THE DIALOGUE and finally .... 6. The <br /> <br /> There are many unanswered questions. They made a long movie 2:32 hours and knew that they didn't put Lex Luthor and Superman. Went into the scene together and was forced to end up for 3 minutes or they thought nobody noticed That the hero and the villain have a screen less than the son of Sperman and the henchmen he killed? > When Superman goes to the hospital, why doesn't he ask him? "What do you want us to do ?! He is the real FIS! We don't know Jack about his anatomy!

Why? <br /> <br /> BTW For those who wonder why Superman can lift krypyonite across the continent, I think I think ... <br /> <br /> ... From Superman Will not be affected by kryptonite until he sees something green in the rock, it is clear in his head So things on the continent are just as he suppresses the fear of the sparkling green stone .... <br /> <br /> Whether or not the writer is half-intellectual
