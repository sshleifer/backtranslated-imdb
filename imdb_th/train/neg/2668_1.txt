Don't be sucked into renting this movie. It has nothing to do with escaping from death, despite the name (English). I can't think of a good thing to say about movies. Bad performances, bad editing, poor director ... "Poor plot" that is ridiculous and the sound / music is very annoying. The only way possible to sit and watch this movie and enjoy it is quality, historical history. They don't make this movie worse anymore.
