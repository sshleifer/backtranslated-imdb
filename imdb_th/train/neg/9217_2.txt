Yes, the only thing that this movie is memorable is that it is a star. Tom Hank, who is only a few years later, will be a star involved in Hollywood. Although this is not a movie that shows a lot of his talent and the only thing that can be considered quite entertaining about this flick is the scene in which he thought he saw a monster and ran through the young man. Yes, this movie is about the evil of playing games that make people use imagination and try to find interesting scenes. Essentially, after-school special school classes about the dangers of dungeons and dragons have been cleverly restored. Here are Mazes and Monsters. Clearly, the creator of this film thinks that no fool Should enjoy any matter unless they go out and drink drugs, unprotected sex and harass the weaker children like children, not bad people. These are games that require the brain, there really is not a paradise! Not that if they have brains, they may think by themselves and not be brainwashed by some groups. Yes, I think this movie is the most stupid and time consuming. True, it may be a movie that is anti-drug addiction. But there are a small number of people who have died that take the dungeons and dragons as far away as possible in all existence, rather than saying things that people are drunk for more than 1 month.
