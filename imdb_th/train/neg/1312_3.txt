Tom is listening to an old radio program that has children from 1950 to today to watch TV. However, they did not broadcast on television when this cartoon was created for people to be entertained, whether it be comedies to music, to scary stories from the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom Shaking in his boots to hear stories about "demons". Indeed, he is doing everything the narrator says. "I stood at the end of the chill, the ice flowing down the spine, the heart beating in your neck." <br /> Then we will taste what we will see for many years after 194 cartoons that Jerry tortured Tom without reason. If the cat asks for a problem, that's one thing. But when he was interested in his own business and Jerry was hurting him (And in this case, the mind) I felt embarrassed to find "small people". <br /> <br >> These early T&M efforts still take more than a minute to follow. Sometimes one minute makes a difference. It came here because it was dragged for a while. May be cut for five minutes without missing anything because the sketch is too long Usually for Tom and Jerry's, usually much faster.
