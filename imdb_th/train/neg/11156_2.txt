Dark Wolf (short review) Let's understand it: This is a disgusting thing of violent destruction with bulls. * It's just a horrible movie. It is a werewolf movie in a city with the worst performances and is as weak as a fool from the 80s high school movie. The worse thing is Kane Hodder, who is poor with playing werewolves. Mammoth Kane f * cking Hodder Someone is trying to make sure that Jason Voorhees is the peak of his acting career ... <br /> <br /> However, former friend Jaime Bergman is still in Film and eventually she became a werewolf, too. It's the worst drama in the world that a werewolf looks at. But it has a time of near-rampant nudity But that's all Want to know more? Okay, werewolves are generally ugly black blurred images that zip around the screen. And when we get the privilege to see the sequence of changes, we will actually present something similar to a full-motion video from a video game created in the first phase of the first Playstation Playstation. CG is very original Perfect for those who like horror movies, hardcore, who want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by images vomiting rampant 2/10. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
