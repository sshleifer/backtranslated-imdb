Chris, the adoptive son of a moral family, a loser who works in a school newspaper with Kate (Christine Lakin from "Step by Step", the formidable sweetness of the episode shows that the TGIF's death line is ABC) That he had just inherited the porn kingdom from his biological parents He lost sight of true friendships and what love was and blah blah. Other nonsense. He also had to fight with an uncle who wanted to control the family business and a rational lawyer. (Not them?) A slightly below average teen comedy stole from a better teen comedy. (The only opening is American Pie-esquire). Hit your head with morality at every opportunity to gain and lose the only star talent it has. (Wayne Newton, Lin Shaye and if I stretch the star of St Martin's "Freaks and Geeks "and Justin Berfield's" Malcolm in Middle "). But it is still far from good. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: A little extra, get topless. <br /> <br /> My grade: C- <br /> <br /> At me. See: Starz on Demand (valid until 29 September)
