In general, taking beautiful pictures and using them with ability But writing is very slippery. There are unbelievable scenes like this that are not happy to watch. The fact that lovers, young people, have twin brothers, are the inventions that I moan loudly and "the connection to the light bulb mood" looks as well as me. <br /> <br /> I don't know too If you have a glass of wine and want to relax with something to look at with a humorous comedy scene, this is a very good movie. Does not require a lot of effort on the part of the audience But Italian movies, especially Italian movies, are usually much better than this.
