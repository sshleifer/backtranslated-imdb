I can't believe that this guy is a shit director and Dracula 2000 Dracula 2000 is a fresh innovation and can be written well. It started with the defeat of Dracula at the end of Dracula 2000. Then, ignore the lecture afterwards, explaining what happened after that. Tracking the story correctly can make this a good sequel, but Craven chose to go in the form of his old movie without a good relationship. But it's the main villain. <br /> <br /> Even the actors who play Dracula are different. (Change from dark hair in Dracula 2000 to blonde here) <br /> <br /> Avoid this film if you have respect for your taste in movies.
