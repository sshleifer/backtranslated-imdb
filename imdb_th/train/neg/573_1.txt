The last examiner is very kind. I was quiet like the first movie. But can't say that I like this movie very much The starting point can be received. But it went down quite quickly I just didn't see Jon Bon Jovi as "The terrible vampire hunter" and the vampire princess are not sexy and scary. Many scenes are not reasonable. I mean, normal people wonder if something happens when a strange woman suddenly appears to tempt you. Why can Una communicate with Jovi? Nothing is explained in this movie, you will not think it will be fun. But it was too much to ask This is one of the worst vampire movies I've ever seen.
