If I did not read his name on the DVD cover, I would not doubt that this relatively old and old music was created by a man associated with the new wave of France. In fact, this movie is far from that, I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s, the author of the New Wave would certainly hate this type of movie - it is like that ... So ... not true. And seems to be involved in many of his previous films This is not a bad thing - it's a very surprising thing. <br /> <br /> What I found was a little surprising. The amount of praise some reviewers gave to this movie, especially when there was Many good French musicals The songs in this movie are not particularly interesting and all characters look polite and stereotypical. If I have to see another rich person who is worried about the difficulty of getting rich or getting a good selling price in a designer dress, I must puke. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is American. The stage plays are not just all the French dramas that are gold. This movie is not another movie "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or "Huit Femmes" (EIGHT WOMEN) (EIGHT WOMEN) and even with Audrey Tautou, I don't see any reason to suggest it. Strange
