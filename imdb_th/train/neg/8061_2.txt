I start by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect his work very much. I hope he will be in the movie more than showing his talent. For this reason, the survivor's soul is a terrible movie. Very bad. <br /> <br /> I must say that I blame almost all of the bad scenes. Affleck is a very talented actor. West Bentley has an outstanding performance in American Beauty, with Melissa Sake Miller doing very well. I don't think any actors came into the script and I understand why. To say that this movie is a horror genre is an exaggeration. It has twists and turns you expect. But they did not take anywhere ... except more confusion I just found an ending that is anti-climatic because it doesn't seem reasonable or answers any questions I have about the story. <br /> <br /> I hope I will give this movie. Good review But i can't In all honesty, the only thing I think you will find scary about this movie is that you pay for it.
