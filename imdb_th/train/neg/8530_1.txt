"Her Cardboard Lover" is the last film of Norma Shearer. She quit the movie and I thought that he joined the board of directors at MGM. That was a good move on her part. "Her cardboard lover" is talkative, boring. Obviously there are only a few actors who have a speaking part, so they have a lot to talk about so that this turkey is floating. <br /> <br /> The story is a good idea about Rich woman (Norma Shearer) hired a man (Robert Taylor) to make a playboy fiance (George Sanders) jealous. I was surprised that director George Cukor didn't cut the scene. Talked a lot between Ms. Shearer and Mr. Taylor. Mr. Cukor served Ms. Shearer well in "The Women "But not in this movie. <br /> <br /> The best performance in the movie was received by Robert Taylor. During Mr. Taylor's career, he received the best comedy in this film and in The movie "When Ladies Meet" in 1941, in 1942, in 1942, he performed good comedy. The most "Her Cardboard Lover" and up until now, in "Johnny Eager", he has a busy year I miss all the actors at MGM. Mr. Taylor has worked with many big and small female actors. In addition, MGM also delivers all types of movies for Mr Taylor, most of whom are successful. That is why MGM has made him 25 years old. <br /> <br /> Mr. George Sanders is a very good person as a heel society. He had a similar role eight years later in "All About Eve", where he won an Oscar for supporting roles. For Miss Shearer, this is one of her worst performances. She's not funny and amazing for this comedy. It is strange that she made a great comedy in 1939 "The Women" and gave her the best performance. Obviously she is too old to find a younger man in "She loves you, cardboard" and it doesn't help to make some of your clothes worse. <br /> <br /> She and Mr Taylor didn't create a drama movie like their last movie. He together is "Escape". Excellent. The same opinion about this film can be said in other movies. The "private property" that Mr Taylor created in 1937 with Jean Harlow It's so boring and the actors look old. Miss Harlow didn't look good throughout the movie and no one in Hollywood noticed that she would tell her to go to see a doctor. So in 1937, she died at the age of 26. What a waste! She became a good actor and had a better role.
