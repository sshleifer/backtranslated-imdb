Gregory Peck's performance was great, as everyone expected, and the movie was quite amazing, even when played directly in the fascinating "moments", but the rest of the movie was overacted and difficult to watch for I am next I try to like But had to move fast for the past thirty minutes I felt that I had wasted a few hours. If not for Gregory Peck, I wouldn't spend fifteen minutes 4/10.
