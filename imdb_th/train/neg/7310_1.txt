** Bottom spoiler !!! ** <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever nods to get the worst movie of the year ... I've seen that is This movie is exactly GARBAGE! There are many unusual things in movies that you can't help but be surprised. But really how bad it is This film has great potential to be good. But eventually did nothing The character is as stupid as possible. For all the movies you just asked yourself "Why do you do that?" Or "What is your purpose in doing this?" ... This is something that is irrational and without character. We are not based on them, so usually you don't give me money for their fate ... You can only laugh at their folly. <br /> <br /> - For example, 'slut' (Marcy) ... She is the person he must sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? There is no point in this story .... as if the filmmakers wanted an excuse to give her a virus! <br /> <br /> - Everyone will go into the forest and drink water from the cabin of the cabin without having to look before. <br /> <br /> - Why did Bert not shoot the sick from the beginning? ? The movie would have passed ... In addition, they ended up killing him. <br /> <br /> - Why would it take longer than they would finally leave the cabin, even though they? Will he have to walk? 'No, I will wait until my two friends are infected (one away from death) until I choose to go out there. <br /> <br /> - What is the reason behind Paul's efforts in Fishing Leaving the hermit's body just falling into a contaminated and infected virus? <br /> <br /> I swear, common sense is not a friend. I don't think there will be a worse ending in the movie. At first, the kids asked the cashier at the shop at the gun shop, what gun did he do, and he said At the end of the movie, three black men (wearing one bag of clothes in a rag suit) entered the store .... Found that the cashier was cleaning to use. For hunting Then he proceeded to give them all the pounds and shake hands and teasing them as if they were his homeboys. <br /> <br /> Oh, what a hell is that hell!?!?! Who will be tasteless? How does the filmmaker think about that? I, as a black man, was offended by the critique of 'Negro'. My question to the creator: What is the end of black children? That is forcing me to forget the comments about racism in the first place I made earlier. To make everything smoother with a black audience by creating a joke? Well, I for one did not find that pathetic effort at least funny humor. This film is a joke .... PATHETIC's effort to create a movie that should not give time to day. Peter Jackson thinks this movie is really good? What movie did he watch? <br /> <br /> Center * from the stars **** .... If I can give a lower score than me Please IMDb'ers friends. Don't waste your precious time of 1 1/2 hours of your precious life in watching this movie. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
