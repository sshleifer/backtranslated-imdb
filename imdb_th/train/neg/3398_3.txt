It seems that the intention of this film is to show a fierce Russian character or at least Russian people can travel out of the big country It's too easy to rob a bank in England. And the British police were not so effective that they could not find someone who robbed the bank even when these volunteers were traveling outside the country by plane In addition, Nicole Kidman and a Russian colleague who predicted to speak a language that has not been identified anywhere may be spoken by aliens in the Urals. So Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, please go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and be busy with Russian grammar and pronunciation.
