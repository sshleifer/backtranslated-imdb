Warning: Avoid this horrible movie ... If you watch, you will be disappointed. SOOOOOOOOO <br /> <br /> Pam and Denise are old, grandmother. What are they doing now? Try to use SO HARD to look youthful and innocent. But it didn't work. Pam and Denise acted horribly in this movie. <br /> <br /> The script is so bad. With the development of the film industry, movie lovers are not satisfied as in the past century. I bet that a movie viewer from the last century will hate this story. <br /> <br /> Stay away from it. I think watching "White Chicks" from 2004. It's much better ... not wrong. At that time I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen.
