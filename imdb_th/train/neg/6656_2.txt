This is the second because I like it as a child. But it was so redundant that I started to hate it ... I couldn't give a descriptive explanation because it would be fixed one thing after another. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this performance is that it is quite disgusting to the children who boil with the mentors who turn to folly And about it I have a cousin who loves this show and he is a strange and stupid person that I met. This item should be pulled out of the air. It is the same story over and over again ... They need to perform better with Nick. I'm very bored with this.
