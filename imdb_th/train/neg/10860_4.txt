This is a disappointing movie for me. It came to me through a box set called "Classic Film Noir" which was a gift from someone who knew that I always enjoyed movies made in that style. I don't think it's a noir movie. There seems to be a trend today in labeling and marketing B and black and white movies, all made from 1947 to 1955, that is noir, there are male protagonists who are persecuted like Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb) and part action. The big movie of this film takes place inside the building. This is just the only noir element I see. There is no widespread suspicion or real reason why one should sympathize with Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was too worn and unbelievable as a bad woman. I don't want to destroy this movie for a potential audience. However, I would be interested in listening to what other enthusiasts in the Noir movie said about this.
