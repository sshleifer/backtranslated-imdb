This movie made me very disappointed. It's a great concept that has been destroyed by scary scripts. The story does not flow and is best separated. There are many elements in this story that are not explained or forced into true thinking. Elements like love stories may increase slightly and the artillery needs to be written better. All the main characters that grow up need the training he gets and stand less. Everyone likes stories. "Small people overcome" good and this shows promise While it had fireworks in the final battle sequence, it lacked clarity due to lack of choreography. This was done for a boring boring watch. <br /> <br /> It should be great :(
