I watched this movie, hoping to get an interesting and interesting story. But the story is not good at all The actors' performances were not better than this. Of course, Shahrukh Khan was there, but he wasn't enough to make this movie. "Reliable" and interesting. <br /> <br /> I read that this movie was made from Flaubert's novel "Madame Bovary". But for me, I don't see it with the Indian mind. <br /> <br /> In general, we buy movies for dreams and have Good times don't waste time and change our mood for the worse. I do not understand how it will get a high score of 6.8 / 10. <br /> <br /> It's a type of movie that you should run away from and don't care because there's nothing to admire in that! You will lose time if you don't like "dark movies" and "strange and unreasonable stories".
