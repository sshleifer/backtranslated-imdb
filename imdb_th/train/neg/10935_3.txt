I've never been a big fan of Mormon movies. As a Mormon, I always felt that humor was too special for the LDS community and made us seem to be overwhelming wackos. I hope this will be a breath of fresh air. The Halestorm movie I can finally talk to my non-Mormon friends. <br /> <br /> My boy is wrong. <br /> <br /> I think because this is the talent of B-list such as Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson and Fred Willard (one of my favorites. ) This thing must be Is a joke at least In addition, the basketball of the church is still ripe with the potential for many jokes like this. But I must say that throughout the movie, it seems that no one knows what they are doing. Every joke is depressing and every opportunity for real jokes is not interested. The conversation is polite and this movie has the worst development I've ever seen. All characters except Wilson are less than one dimension. It is hard to believe that after nine new authors, this film is still a tedious mind like the train wreck I saw. I can't speak out as words that make me feel angry. My friends and I are special in the final scene of the game, so we went to premiere at Washington, Utah. The director Kurt Hale was there and I must say that I avoided contacting him after the performance. He waited at the door, ready to listen to comments. I could not bring myself to tell him that his film was not only But tore away one hour and a half my life only But it still left the scars that were disgusting and painful that I would never forget. <br /> <br /> Here are some specific problems I have: There are sub stories of little love between the janitor and the fat piano player. But these two characters came out of nowhere and were impossible to pay attention to, so my friends and I were always wondering why we Should pay attention to two weak characters that are not interesting There are many sub-plans that appear every moment and each person gives the audience the opportunity to laugh. But each person comes with smoke before you start to pay attention. This is the feeling that the whole movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is important and I feel bad for everyone who expects to receive the first funny Mormon movie. Actually, the jokes in this story are not limited to Mormons. Then again, it's hard to say what jokes and loud feelings in my ears. <br /> <br /> Please don't watch this movie. Remember that the imagination that this movie is hilarious Please help me to be disappointed.
