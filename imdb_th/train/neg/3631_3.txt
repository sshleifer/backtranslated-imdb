It is accepted that Parsifal is not an opera that can attract everyone, even though it is my favorite. Knappertsbusch, 1951. In particular, the entire method of Syberberg is quite stable. Whenever the music starts to swell ... Syberberg gives the actors the same rhythm. Amfortas and Klingsor's competition is endless. What happened to the movie editing? The result is that the body looks tired. The audience will not be transported spiritually. Your motivation is to hurry back home and play the recording again to confirm that Wagner understands correctly. Syberberg mistook and decorated with Wagner's "smart" reminder of anti-Semitism. There will be movie viewers. Does this story have no knowledge of Wagner before?
