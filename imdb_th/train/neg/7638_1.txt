I couldn't bring myself to watch this movie until the end. I can't comment on this because I haven't watched both movies and the reason I can't see it because of the 'actors'. Firstly, most of them look stiff and I'm sure their scripts are on hand. Their just got out of the frame - but that's a little problem. The main issue that I have with the actors is not really their fault ... It is whoever plays this movie! Come on, this movie came out in 2003 ... I think the selection of people in their late twenties to play teenagers is out of date with a new wave! I can't watch movies on the first line from a man who is older than myself, "I'm 17!" How can anyone do that seriously ????? Don't be a victim of this movie. Go for a walk for 90 minutes. You will get more than this movie can give.
