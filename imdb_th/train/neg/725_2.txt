This is an awesome movie! Not for the matter But for delivery I went with my girlfriend at the time (When the movie came out) is expected to see a movie about the victory of the human spirit on oppression What we see is a brutal police oppression, 2 hours without the end. Examples and advertisements do not mention this! Also for all that they play whoopi goldberg. My memory is that she was arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the example will not say anything about this! (Not that you expect But it is more of a problem) If I know that this movie is depressing, I will never see it before. Or at least I have to prepare for it This is the victim and changed the advertising campaign and I will not watch this movie again!
