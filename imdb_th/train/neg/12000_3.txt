The only possible way to enjoy this flick is to bump your head against the wall, let the bleeding inside the brain release your number of brain cells, die and when you are officially moroned maybe you * MIGHT * enjoy the movie. This story. <br /> <br /> The only elegance of saving is the story between Raju and Stephanie. Gavin is a great person in the role of a taxi driver and a child. British ladies Maybe if they make the whole movie up at their escapades in India and the way they eventually fall in love will make it a more enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave 3 points Is Govida's, and his ability as an actor when talking about jokes As an international traveler in the post world on 9/11, Anil Kapoor will shoot himself a lot before he reaches the sky bridge to show his true love :) but then again in the movie This is a logical challenge to gravity physics. And throw eggs on the face of the audience * GENERAL * <br /> <br /> Look at your own danger. At least I know that I have scar for life: (
