I gave this score five out of 10 points, all five points for Hendrix, who delivered good content in his later days. Unfortunately, the quality of work and editing of the camera is at an astounding level! We have countless full pages of Hendrick, where he can almost do anything. We don't see his hand on the guitar. That's the point! We also have many pictures of Hendrix from the back? Looks like there are three cameras in Hendrix, but the fool is amateur. Can use it all. The person in front of Hendrick seems to be eager to focus on the stage stupidly as if Hendrix on the guitar is a distraction. While the person behind is keener in zeroing in a few chicks in the panel than actually documenting the incredible guitar work that has bleeding amps. (The recording is good, thanks to Wally Heider.) The distribution on the track is a clip of the student losing. Vietnamese and others on tracks such as Machine Gun, completely losing movies! If Hendrix still lives for two years, Berkeley is one of those things that will never see the light of day as officially released. The only gem that is packed is incredible Johnny B. But all in the poor picture documents of the great and inferior, both Woodstock and the Isle of Wight
