This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's extremely boring with many boring conversations and annoying characters and ridiculous animals. The only reason I watched this junk was because it was in the 8 horror series I received. The plot is unusual and totally stupid, just like the ending. There is no blood except with a slight blood mark on the creature and two blood gunshot wounds. The performance is TERRIBLE !! Richard Carella is terrible as a sheriff and is quite ridiculous, including his annoying character. Glenn Roberts is a comic relief and not funny at all! Mark Siegel is extremely annoying and doesn't have fun! Bob Hyman is a good person. But not more than that, Richard Garrison is annoying and never reacts to Kacey Cobb as it used to be. Overall, avoid this waste! BOMB from 5
