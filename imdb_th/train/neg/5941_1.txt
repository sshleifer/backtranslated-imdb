As a fan of Notorious B.I.G. I'm waiting for this movie. I'm unfortunate to see it as a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not credible or realistic enough to describe the scandal. B..G. Many of the following stories: Christopher Jordan Wallace, the real son of B. G. Like a child, unfortunately he doesn't believe enough to pay tribute to his father. Derek Luke is unbelievable, like Sean "Fat" Combs. Conclusion. Nobody believes enough to play their role here. The big problem of this is the real people they are playing. It's boring and doesn't give any information about Notorious B.I.G that fans and fans who are not the same don't know. I was particularly disappointed with Angela Bassett, a very good actress here as Voletta Wallace, slugs and slugs, according to Notorious B.I.G. I'm unlucky to say that It's nowhere near good movies. I expect a lot from it. Unfortunately I didn't get what I wanted from this. I think you should definitely skip this one.
