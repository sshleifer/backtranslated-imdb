When Ben (Foxx) discovers his wife, Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) fled with his brother. He rushed to find his son, Norman. (Michael Warren) to release the story of woe Garson's weakness (Dennis Dugan) needs to say that Ben is not good and has many problems as follows - including Ben's efforts to make Norman homosexual by holding him slowly. From this movie, it sounds more fun than the movie. <br /> <br /> The first episode was written by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, NORMAN ... Is that you? Is a real disaster on the New York stage In order for the performance to be true, I saw that it was set in the 1970s as a community theater - and while no one accused it of anything other than a superficial story, the actor played extensively and in such a depressing manner. It proved quite amusing. It's a shame that the actors of this film didn't do the same. <br /> <br /> This is a cruel movie. Red Foxx, one of the most funny cartoons of the 20th century, is a joke here recently. Michael Warren (Which later appeared in the television series HILL STREET BLUES for better effects), the worst performance, and Pearl Bailey is not far to tell the truth, only Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson The ridge and pendant by Wayland Flowers are only sparkling and sad, compared to other actors. <br /> <br /> Not only movies. Poor operation, it looks bad. According to the legend of the movie, this is the first attempt of a large screen shot in a videotape that was transferred to celluloid for project purposes - and believe me. This film has the theme of a bad sitcom in the 1970s until the skyline painted through the windows of Norman and Garson's apartment. <br /> <br /> Some movies are terrible. Until it became a joke but Norman ... that you? Not one of them I can summarize my reaction to this movie with two words: miss it. Don't buy. Don't rent. Don't touch it with ten feet. Just retreat slowly and run like hell. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor or GFT or Amazon Reviewer
