TiVo recorded because of Angelina Jolie. It has 2.5 stars. It seems likely. It fell quickly That the original Italian accent is good My male wife says that the other cute people in this movie are fat Italian women. Even men Bad signal Two couples chase their children like four Italian Stooges. <br /> <br /> My wife won't give up. Hopefully she won't use tips, makeup, clothes or decorations. It is a boring and distorted combination of ugliness and luxury. It is hateful. <br /> <br /> Cutting my left gap is not enough to distract attention from the pain of watching this movie. If this movie appears on your TV, do yourself a favor and your head on the TV screen instead. You will be glad you did. The only movie I have ever seen that is worse is "Hamburger: The Movie" or may be a "dead friend".
