Inside Man tells the story of the detective (Denzel Washington) who is under investigation because he may get involved in the event that the money disappears. When the bank was robbed and held hostage by the mastermind robbers (Clive Owen) and his team of detectives are assigned to force the robbers to surrender? His only image of proving that he was innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with her own secrets and intent, sent to recover items from the bank owner's safe stored in the bank and you have three problems. Unfortunately, what you received with this movie and nothing to return at the end Denzel Washington is the best performer in the field of ineffective and innocent acting. The only economical facility for this film is Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who is a much better worker than this movie. In fact, Jodie Foster offers surprising and most effective performance in playing with genres as a brutal and innocent villain. Clive Owen didn't do anything other than chicks and poses. But the depth of his presence and his successful acting ability is more than just acting. It's strange that a lot of talent wasted on this film that had little effect or interest. You have to wonder what the director Spike Lee is thinking while he is making this movie. However, the biggest surprise of Inside Man is praise that has not been accepted. For movies that seem to be influenced by before the summer, this film is frighteningly flattened.
