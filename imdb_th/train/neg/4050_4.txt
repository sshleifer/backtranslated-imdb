That is an outdated movie that is intended to show the children's desire for freedom in a British school that cuts humanity. Oh yes, it's like in the army. You learn to obey and do what you ask for. Yes, the youthful dreams of other things But it makes their dreams very broken. <br /> <br /> In general, that's how you can summarize good intentions if ... good intentions that don't challenge movie challenges: The result is a film that is damaging. <br /> <br /> At the very least, the old man helped McDowell Kubrick cast in A Clockwork Orange. The movie has a truly powerful social satire.
