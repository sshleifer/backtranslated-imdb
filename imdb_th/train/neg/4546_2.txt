I just saw this movie and haven't read the book. The good thing about the movie is that in some parts it makes you think for a moment about spiritual matters, evolution, evil, and part of you in the world. And there is very little harmony between the audience and the characters It is clear that this book has a lot of content in this film. The events that showed that actually happened were almost impossible to remember. Must give many reasons for the audience to see that the scene indicates a fluke Looks bad and does not create a better feeling than it should be Can you remember the enlightenment of Keanu Reeves (in Little Buddha)? This is nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Most scenes do not go well. There are many scenes that do not develop the story and do not help to create an atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The better actors in this movie are Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow. Can not save the first 2 Seemed to be staged more than the characters in an attempt to save the movie and because they were paid more But this doesn't work Most scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story. <br /> <br /> Jürgen performed well in his scene and sold as an evil person (as always), but the script didn't help him at all. The scene in which he tried to convince John (Matthew Settle) for the first time to join him is just a bad screenplay The execution of the scene when he died in the explosion was an irrational execution. The events that happened in the movie could not comment. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie took a long time to read! I haven't read But probably a billion times better. <br /> <br /> It's terrible that I have to write my first comment on IMDb.
