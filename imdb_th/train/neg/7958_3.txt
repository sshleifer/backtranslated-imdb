Protégé works in a linear manner. Expecting no fast action and you will not feel uncomfortable because you don't have time to sit on the edge. <br /> <br /> There are not many clues. Expect one I'm not going to be wrong with acting - acting is probably the worst, if not for Wu's performance, which is the only grace of this movie. And that cute little girl too. <br /> <br /> Humor is the best, weak, and acting must go through anti-drug campaign, scene with Zhang) to tell us what we already know - Like drugs that break up the heroin family, making you crazy. It's not easy to wean. You will fall into an evil cycle. <br /> <br /> I know that it might look a bit harsh. But I feel that the performance is far from being seamless and patchy (* Alert Spoiler *: For example, when Andy Lau was taken to the police station: What? We just said that There are tapes and all the evidence that has taken you since 1997, and that's the way he was caught. Nope. No action. The car chase is just a jump of the scene which destroys Wu's role as a spy at first) I suspect that the lack of creativity comes from the fact that it is the result of the production of Mediacorp Raintree, Singapore's film production company.
