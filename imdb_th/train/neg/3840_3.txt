I have heard about this movie recently from a friend and she just received it on DVD. There are many expectations and excitement that we both heard that this movie is really horror horror. How disappointed are I? Much!!!! Besides that scene (We know which bits) Nothing happens !!! I expect to see this woman a few times black and for you to make a few scary scenes, such as appearing in the window or walking across the hall or something > Almost all reviews here This movie is a scary story to watch. I don't see that i'm afraid There may be differences in what people find scary in the United States. Here in the UK <br /> <br /> Comments are greatly reduced after everyone criticized.
