The performances were poor by Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. The characters that were underdeveloped were not developed. Annoying talk with no real plot The ending makes you flatter over pancakes with more loose ends than you can tie in four sectors. (That is, if you care about these wooden characters too), MacLaine is the only real asset The last sequence on "Hood Chicago", finding the character Sinatra is laughing. The songs in that order are bad. And in the final scene, when Martin's character took off the hat for a woman, he called "Pork" almost causing me to go out and find a stone throwing through my television
