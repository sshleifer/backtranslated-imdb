Dr. Seuss would be mad if he was still alive. Cat In Hat proves that film production can bring classic stories and transform them into illogical goop stacks. We have Mike Myers as the infamous cat in the big crash hat! Meier proved that he could not perform in this movie. He acted like a young girl, showing a wily and ploying thousands of children in this movie. Never mind somewhere between boring and annoying genres. The story is the same as the original, with a few tweaks and like most movies based on other stories. Never tune with the original story! Bringing in evil neighbors Quin is a bad idea. He is a foolish villain that will never go anywhere in life. This movie is like a cartoon comic that has been rejected by the newspaper if you miss it. This film looks tacky! Of course, there are jokes for adults who like to cut the cat at his tail and the sensor before he speaks a bit of rude words. At least Grinch has courage and this film is really good! This film is a cartoon snot piece with bright colors and moderate bad performances. Mike Myers, even in this movie? And the other is fish What happened to that stupid fish! The first time you see him, he is a real fish. The next time you see him, everyone is lively and talking. But he seems to be like a moving piece of dough! This film is the whole target wreck. Good jokes, good jokes, bad, bad, good jokes! I was surprised that it had good jokes, such as jokes in the water park. So please, if you have the option to watch the Grinch instead of this mess.
