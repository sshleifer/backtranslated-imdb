I don't know who will blame Ms. Leigh or her director. But her performance as Catherine was almost impossible to watch. On the other hand, Ben Chaplin did a better job compared to the price I was concerned. His character is full of charm and attractiveness. But certainly not enough to show the greed of Leigh's character Chaplin felt baffled by what could not be understood as Leigh's shyness and lack of elegance. But her bone and joint insecurity There must be an element of confidence in his interests. But while playing it can not be understood, the show does not jibe. Of course, Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are excellent, despite the efforts to make them derail. Supporting actors are happy to watch. It's a shame as well. Leader doesn't work together because the production looks cute.
