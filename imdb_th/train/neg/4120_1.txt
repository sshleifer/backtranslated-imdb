The movie is very scary. Ameteurish and it's not funny. The main character is played by Mehmet Ali Erbil. Very annoying. Modifications by ET and Star Wars are just silly. <br /> <br /> Actress Yilmaz Goksal is the only one who thinks about With this movie He should have mastered his English and moved to Hollywood. Hollywood couldn't find his qualified actor besides Goksal. This movie is rubbish. <br /> <br /> Director Gani Mujde is a writer. This cartoon and film is his worst writing to this day. <br /> <br /> Cem Karaca's song is another story. Plus with this money loss, the actor Sumer Tilmac also has. The actors playing with the three sons are not as talented as they used to be.
