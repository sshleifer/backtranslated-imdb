This movie is terrible. It's funny. In fact, the Mystery Science Theater 3000, a television show in which three characters watch and mock bad movies, use this film to ridicule. I suggest watching (probably on YouTube) instead of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Please don't see Hobgoblins if you're not ready to stop in the first scene. In fact, I didn't see this movie during my favorite time. At least not serious. It's funny is not a joke. (Say the least) and you will be able to mock or see a more fun parody. Watch the movie <br /> <br /> You may feel yourself sick when you trust yourself. See Hobgoblins
