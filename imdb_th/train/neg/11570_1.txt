The director's intention towards this film is quite respectable. But his history of production made me realize that this may not be as important as other film makers, making his 30-day TV drama in his heart. But also counted in his MTV production. "I bet you will" that is contrary to his seriousness in any matter he recorded. Highly hopeful. Sadly, this movie made me disappointed. Same as "supersize me" after a while, I asked myself, what are all these issues? The main order is clear enough after half an hour. But the rest of the play is full of useless things and replicates what has already appeared in this way or otherwise before in the movie, so it deteriorates and is very weary of the ending.
