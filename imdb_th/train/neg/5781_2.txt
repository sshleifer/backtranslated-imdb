Roman Polanski created many films that were not accepted. His reputation confused me. There is nothing that stands out as a high point, except for Chinatown. (I've never seen a 'knife in the water' or 'Tess'). Any involvement he made with the film concluded for over twenty years; His work is embarrassing, safe and / or boring (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, Pirates). <br /> <br /> The children of R must have a meaning at the end of the establishment at the time. It came out. It was a concept that was produced and is quite high for the movie 'horror' of 1968 (never shown to children), but this is just a misunderstanding. SAP horror. Everything is skillful to the point that The story begins clearly Wang early (Hmm, thank you for the position that was destroyed at the end) and on a clear day you will see that the ending is coming. It doesn't maintain my interest. I found that no matter what the film was, it was most obscured in the 1960s, what a woman was. Chill is a chronic impatient man who doesn't care for the housekeeper / maid. Her weakness is sold out ... She finally gets frustrated. There is no real idea in it ... There is nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil. <br /> <br /> Dakota is almost impossible to find because it has an eerie potential.
