Nicolas Roeg, he directed a classic supernatural thriller, didn't see him now? The film has been broadcast on BBC television during the weekend, which makes the COLD HEAVEN film show tonight does not help. <br /> <br /> You see that it is impossible to Not comparing the cold heaven and not watching now, because both have the same director and the same structure, and for the top three of heaven, I think they still have The same plot, except the dead husband, was replaced instead of a dead child. In my sincerity, set in this film revolves around the sadness of a widow who saw her late husband running around Venice. Wearing a red shirt This does not happen. But about one-third of the way throughout the use, there is a lot of rotation, and even if it is an unnecessary twist But it is not explained in depth In fact, there is very little explanation in COLD HEAVEN, which destroys movies. <br /> <br /> People have mentioned COLD HEAVEN's relatively low production value and it is impossible to not observe them. If I am not different, I think this is TVM because it was created to make the television feel down to the white capital letter in the title sequence. Roeg also tried to inject an excuse about house art with the thought process. Speaking But didn't help the movie at all No one can feel it. Roeg should use all his efforts in a twisted plan that is completely flat on the screen. <br /> <br /> Cheap production values, ignorant directors and a strange place. And screenplay made for bad movies
