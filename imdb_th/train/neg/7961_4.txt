Five years after the original Creepshow, another sequel to horror, was written by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. This time there are only three stories instead of five. There are no three stories that are original or outstanding as well. The first story is a scary main story about an Indian wooden statue that wants to avenge the owner's murder. The effect is very delicate in this regard. But was too familiar to attract enough George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour to play by the elderly shopkeeper. The second story "The Raft" is the story of Stephen King. It was the story of four teenagers who spent the day unawares on a wooden pallet in a lonely lake. Soon the children screamed because of their lives like dripping water droplets, making each of them unreasonable. clear However, instead of being a suspicious child, the children were saddened by the bad talk and impolite behavior which caused us to ignore what happened next. There are also unintended humor in this section. The third and final story is "The Hitch-hiker" which is actually a new adaptation for Creepshow 2. The original story by Lucille Fletcher was filmed in May. From then on, it was adapted into the Twilight Zone episode featuring the story Inger Stevens "The Hitch-hiker". The best results from these three proposals But there is no problem as well Lois Chills plays as a cheating partner who ends up running away to tie the knot. However, we do not know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her. Just like in this general story, characters exist only to tell the story with twists and turns. The stories surrounding the gangsters seem unusual. Tom Savini appears as "creep" in this sector. * 1/2 of 4 stars
