There is nothing to say about this thing. Gammera is a fire-breathing turtle. He was freed from a nuclear explosion. He headed to the ground and started destroying buildings and tanks and other garbage (Oh, yes, the wire I almost forgot). At one point in the beginning of the movie, he befriended a little boy and instead left him or squeezed him Put him on the safe floor. Then we have to watch a small twerp with a fat face popping up and running away, showing himself and running away. For some reason, Gammera can hear this child at a distance of 20,000 feet. Oh, the plot is to try to get Gammera to a place where he can place rockets and shoot into space. As usual, the creature scolded and uncoordinated. (Man in Gammera Suit) Japanese Army (With the help of Americans) use ammo and enough power to solve the country's debt problems, and of course it's not good. They should know this. We saw many monsters stomping in Tokyo. Don't put it down because it's fun. But it's not that good
