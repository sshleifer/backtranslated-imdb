I remember watching this movie in the year 86 when it was first screened and it was a horrible movie. The show was so bad that the plot was so subtle or it should be blown away in the wind. I think it makes me sleep more than once. & I'm not tired to remember. Please avoid all the better costs, still have all your teeth withdrawn without the use of anesthesia that will be more fun. It's a pity that I can't score or delete. I hope I won't waste my money from the video store. All I can say is that the tape is still brand new, almost surprising, because this movie is terrible. If I remember correctly, I sat & watched with women. I wanted to go out with & the fact that she sat next to me wasn't enough to wake me up.
