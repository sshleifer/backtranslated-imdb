OK. Well, I found this movie in my old movie division and it looks quite good from the cover. But the real movie !! Okay, the first story with swimmers is quite good. But it took a while and the story that the boy was completely mentally retarded! It's not scary! His dream sounded like a little bedtime story of a young child. Then, a woman was completely mentally retarded. I'm sure there are people who will call the news people and ask him to go out with you. But that ended with the cold she stabbed him and she was in the hospital and she saw him on t.v and he said all the garbage she The next thing is the love story that is gay about the man who brings the dead back .. OMG is silly. I won't say anything about this again. It's not that scary. But the idea of ​​this story is very cool .. Yes, the woman is overwhelmed and she kills a classmate or something. Then, when they all told their dreams to each other, the loser went on the bus. (To Hell Ahahahahahah)) And they saw all the people from the dream on the bus ending.
