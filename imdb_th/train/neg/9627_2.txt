Okay, I love Ben Stiller, of course, even if I don't care about Jennifer Aniston. I do not think this woman will act at least All movies or sitcoms that I see you are very difficult to pass on your fake performances. It seems that she is standing there to read the script. This movie has only one thing that is good about it and that is Ben Stiller. There is a plot that is used and abused. How many films does the same story have? We can say "The power of nature" not only the old plot But the result is predictable. It's boring I know everything that will happen before I do it. It's boring But watching Stiller is always welcome !!!
