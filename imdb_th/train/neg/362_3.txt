In order not to be confused with the movie Madonna, "The Next Best Thing", "The Last Big Thing" is a stupid joke. Review of artists that are coming up with variety and strength. This economical indie makes "Chuck and Buck" seem like a masterpiece. Filled with punchy performances, poor sets and costuming, etc. "..." What gets some awesome comments and nominations dates for just one edge reward through this one.
