Despite the hard work by the supporting actors and the intelligent script by Alan Plater, the film has a problem from a serious flaw - the lack of charm of the central character / actor. One of the characters describes the character of Richard E Grant. "It's a little wrong" and unfortunately this makes him perfect. There is nothing about him or his acting to make it credible that his girlfriend and publisher / high class friends will spend a lot of time and effort with him. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and thoroughly annoying. The part that is called an actor that can make you love him, even if he is a prate-Ewan McGregor. For example, <br /> <br /> Every witty words in the school system, etc., must be thankful for the annoying performance and not Like anybody What I want to do is just shake him and tell him to beat himself.
