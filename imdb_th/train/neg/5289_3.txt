I love Jane Austen's story. I only read two (P&P and S&S), but after seeing this adaptation, I "persuaded" from my bookcase to understand the story and because I refused to believe Jane. Austen may write nonsense like this. For me, I think if you create a movie from Jane Austen's novel, you wouldn't be wrong. It will come out very well by default. I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, the character you are sympathetic and like where you are. You must have at least one favorite character in order for the audience to invest in their emotions and this does not deliver. Of course, I want Anne and Wentworth to come together, but because that's what you know, the purpose of the story is that they are together. But I had to resist to throw my teacup on the TV and continue to watch until the end. <br /> <br /> Anne was the most annoying and eventually I didn't know why Wentworth was you. Suddenly smitten as if nothing had attracted him She is a gentle, boring, socially inadequate person and finds like sheep that follow other people's advice rather than having her own heart. This can also be used with leading characters if you do well. This thing is not well done. <br /> <br /> Other characters are showing many narcissism, which Mary is the worst person with the narcissistic personality disorder that is narcissistic. Which Bennet in P&P has similar flaws, she is still loved while Mary is more crazy about acting More disgusting than funny. <br /> <br /> Wentworth is very handsome and seems like a good person. Most of this story, I just wondered what kind of person he was and why he absolutely loved Ann. He was a type of person who wanted more people ... not having to say much because I reacted to the characters That shows more than showing that people are performing well or badly Anthony Head is great. But as soon as I saw that he was in it, I was expecting a little <br /> <br /> found the story very confusing It wasn't until the end of the movie that it seemed that Elizabeth wasn't Ann's stepmother. But in fact, being a sister (I'm still not 100%) The story behind Anne / Wentworth is all too vague. They are together But broke up and both were bitter about this? Why have I wondered about this for a while now and the explanation seems to be that she left him because she was persuaded to do that by someone? But there is a saying "by by" that is almost missed, as if it didn't matter. How does it matter when it is the essence of the story? In addition, many names are also placed. But there is no real feeling for the character For example, who is this Louisa, who are you? friend? Family? What? It is not clear who is a different character and their relationship with others. Lady Russell has a lot, but why? Mrs. Croft and Wentworth are brothers and sisters who feel very unrealistic because Mrs. Croft looks old enough to be his mother. <br /> <br /> Last kiss, yes it is. Strange that they kiss each other on the road. But I didn't think about this because I was busy shouting. "Go with it !!" on TV because Ann's lips shook and trembled because of what felt like a long time before they met Wentworth. There was some hesitation. But only a few seconds or about half a minute. <br /> <br /> There is a problem with the camera. As a general movie watcher, you don't care about the angle and anything except you decide to look at it. I didn't decide to do it here. But I still notice them For me, it means that the filmmakers didn't do a good job. A lot of conversations arise from face-to-face close-ups, something that should be used only when there are really important points. In this modification, it is used too much and therefore lacks meaning. The hand-held feeling sometimes does not work in retro dramas. The camera running in the running scene eventually felt too contemporary. (Not to mention running) This is the only Austen I caught in the ITV Austen's season, making me wonder if it's worth it. See "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park" or If I should read the book and let it be like that I regret to say that this is Jane Austen's adaptation that I don't like. Maybe I will see the 1995 version instead. The BBC is famous for the beautiful adaptation of Austen before.
