This film has several major flaws. The first and most important thing, which is clearly lacking a good plot! This sad story makes the movie not only But difficult to see But also sent some of the watcher's feelings in despair as if he or she was wasting valuable time in their short lives Which means that this film cannot attract the attention of viewers But encouraging viewers to watch movies that are insulting and everything involved! In short, it's a very bad thing! Do yourself a favor and chew big rubber boots. You will find it more interesting and fun than watching Terminator Woman.
