Spoilers of both these and The Matrix track. <br /> <br /> I like the original matrix very much. It's not a deep film, even Fishburn's philosophical efforts. But it was quite fun and I had a weakness for Hong Kong's struggle. <br /> <br /> At first, Neo was a secret life. Of the cube workers is quite unhappy Each day, the drone of the organization and at night the brave hacker Eventually, he was finally forced to choose between these lives by his actions - did he become a criminal, fight the machine or did he return to a safe and memorable world where he began to pay attention to his interest? found Life is quite bad He had his woman beside him and his merit friend. But he had eaten an overwhelmingly prepared food, dressed in sweat, and living with a machine that was truly skilled Even though the truth makes him free. <br /> <br /> At least part of the fun of the first movie put in the question "If I was" will happen in the minds of the audience. What happens if _I_ is capable of something that is impossible? What happens if I am a "The One"? It doesn't matter how much you are an example of a cool name like that. <br /> <br /> In addition, Agent Smith is also a great bad guy at the moment. That he represents the fear of power that We carry with us. He cannot stop as a terminal and without mercy. <br /> <br /> At the end of the Matrix, Neo has to go back to the matrix to share the good news about freedom. > <br /> This movie failed to complete the original movie concept, and it was like that when there was lack of gusto, such as poor writing and poor editing, I couldn't believe it. That they had planned a crib These changes When the dialog is at the fifth grade level with a randomly reduced vocabulary, I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying. <br /> <br /> Summary list My story about failed characterization:> <br /> Oracle has a little advantage if tricked to the fullest without real reason. <br /> <br /> The important "personality" of the matrix is ​​used. Without needing, for example, Mas Torre is the key Lovely idea But not an interesting character. <br /> <br /> Fishburne loses his "advisor" role and doesn't get anything to replace it. <br /> <br /> The people in Zion are not special. Satisfying and you will not want _want_ they run around the world. <br /> <br /> Special Effects Issues: <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are pointless and can be transmitted. In The Matrix, you feel that Neo may lose and he has to become even bigger in order to survive in The Matrix Reloaded. He is just a character in the perspective of a particularly badly planned video game. > <br /> The fight on the freeway looks quite fake and unattractive. <br /> <br /> The pacing of the <br /> <br /> As I said above, the fight scene <br /> <br /> Too crazy for everyone - everyone in If I was at the theater watching the clock. Not because we hate good dance and good sex But because we don't know about people who are pictures and we don't care. <br /> <br /> What hacking writes what writers should be blacklisted from business It crooked, using words that the playwright didn't understand clearly and wasted time and the killer walked around. The creator's words can be done at the tenth time and there is more danger when "Zion has to make a rebellion that will go so that they will not destroy the matrix. Now there are too many people who do not believe the matrix. In danger of being struck and killing everyone who is attached to it. In addition, the world cannot even support people in Zion, even one person in the cyber world. You may choose one from Zion to create a new Zion while I wiped the memory of the people in the Matrix right now. "<br /> <br /> It turns out that we have received a long stretch. If someone argues that it is at a deep level, ask for transcription and try to separate the sentence. Each word is longer than many sentences and uses words that are shorter and meaningful. <br /> <br /> So in summary, it's not worth seeing <br /> <br /> I can. Saw the third sentence And despite what many reviewers have said It doesn't save this turkey. <br /> <br /> The examiner who feels that the second and third movies are "deep" should go to see a movie that is really deep. Perhaps reading one or two books about rhetoric and debate and may be a philosophy This film is not difficult to understand. But it's hard to be <br /> <br /> Scottish
