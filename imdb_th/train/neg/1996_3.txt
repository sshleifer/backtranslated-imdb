This tragic little movie has a slight similarity to Broadway revival in 1971, which is very popular. Please note that when Burt Shevelove directed that revival, he wrote a new book extensively. I have a feeling that the author of this script has participated in many changes from the original 1925 version as well. I played Jimmy Smith, an innocent pilgrim on stage in 1974 and thought that this $ 1 DVD will bring the Remembering, there was no chance of even the expected happiness of seeing "Topper" Roland Young play. My 'my' part was a big disappointment. There are still three songs from the drama and not very good. Even the classic song "Tea For Two" is like a virtual solo. Many familiar faces of failure in 1940 did not act proudly and the actor Anna Negel only embarrassed himself. When I was frustrated by spending a dollar, I knew that this movie would not be good. Other reviewers spoke of the Doris Day version, which is actually called "Tea For Two" and is currently working on the stage (original). So, those who are actually looking for "No No Nanette" may find more memorable versions there
