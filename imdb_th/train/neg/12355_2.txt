After reading many reviews, I do not know what movies that some people are watching. But apparently not the same movie that I saw. <br /> <br /> This movie is scary. Moore's main performance was terrible. Women can't do Nice tits, but she can't. She never met as a true character. But it turns out that the Hollywood actor is spoiled at the beach to play for the kids. <br /> <br /> And that's what this movie is in the end. Training sequence is above politics - above all Political correctness - above the battle scenes - you guess, above all else Your mission is to enter and exit without being detected. Then what do you do? Why have to shoot as much as possible and make the most sound? Oh GI Jane. You can be my wings at any time. <br /> <br /> The evidence is good, but as soon as Hollywood gets it, we end up with the Top Gun. With nipples. <br /> <br /> There will be more things that are expected to be received from US commercial movies anymore.
