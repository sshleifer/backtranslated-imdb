This movie sucks! They took something from my childhood and raped in the house! This movie is terrible. I want to go home and keep my DVD "Duke" and cry in the corner. The character is terrible! Not "The Dukes". It is Stiffler and Jackass. When driving the evil Boss? When Rosco was a tough person They never were! Boss Hor is very greedy and Roscoe is an idiot. When did Jessie smoke? He never did! Now, don't understand me wrong, I'm a generous person and there's nothing wrong with a small Chiba, but there's no place in this movie! The only good thing about this movie is an example before the movie and the ending credits. It's a waste of time and money. Avoid all costs !!!!!!!!
