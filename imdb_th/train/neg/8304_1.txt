"A Christmas Story" is one of the most popular movies of all time. ACS can bring viewers to the time and place in the way that there are very few movies that have ever existed. It has a sweet and good wish that is hard to find. <br /> <br /> So I waited (and waited) the sequel of "It Runs In The Family". This movie was almost released a few times. To pull in the last minute Finally, when it comes out, IRITF is (and is, I think) all the failures. <br /> <br /> Good scenes and movies. But the director is not completely marked This film is nothing more than a cash-flowing formula of casting, lazy, lazy writing and irrelevant performances. <br /> <br /> The narrator Jean Shepard, one of the great humor and storytellers America We used the warm wisdom that he used in the ACS. He was too angry and why he did that I would never know. He managed to mock the annoying and over himself. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting in IRITF is not reliable and forced. Actors may have seen ACS, but things that are witty and different in ACS must not be registered with them at all. The acting is shameful and ignoring Shepard's arid humor. ACS is always a true treasure, but calling IRITF as a sequel is an insult to the fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
