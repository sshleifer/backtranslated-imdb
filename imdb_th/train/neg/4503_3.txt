I admire Rob Marshall at Chicago, but the memory of Geisha has become a failure in fighting Western and Asian art again. Overall, the scene is beautiful. But after not paying attention to the exotic scene, some people may find themselves bored with them. Too many cherry blossoms are too straightforward. May be the cultural difference of awareness here: the final beauty is not flashy, because the truly beautiful geisha will not be a western pumpkin in the movie. <br /> <br /> Other comments mentioned The biggest flaw correctly As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt that the best actress, actor / actor can play any role when he / she can seem. Gong Li is great. But the power of emotion that she performed in this film was not translated into Japanese style. All I saw was bittersweet and Chinese woman jealous. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favorite actresses, didn't look like Japanese. Some comments mention the delicate and feminine characteristics of Japanese women, which I disagree with. These things are so fragile that I think that not all modern Japanese actresses are qualified for the geisha role, not to mention the two Chinese actresses and the only Malaysian who grew up in a broken culture <br /> Geisha is a good image to stimulate the curiosity of American audiences. But it will be an insult to the film and the art as well if this movie won an Oscar for the best costume, best director or best picture
