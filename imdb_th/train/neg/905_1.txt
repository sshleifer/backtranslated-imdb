A single woman named Stella (Bette Midler) conceived by a wealthy man (Stephen Collins) He proposed to marry her with a sense of attachment. But she disappointed him and decided to raise her child by herself Everything went well until the boy named Jenny. (Trini Alvaro) became a teenager and things gradually worsened. <br /> <br /> I've seen both the silent version and the sound of No one has much effect on me. (And I cried easily) but they did well if dated Trying to create this in the 1990s is just a stupid idea. I guess Midler has enough power after the incomprehensible success of the "beach" to do this. Explode. Laughing and being standard today even though Midler and Alvarado will give good performances in this movie. But I was bored at the end Stephen Collins and Masha Mason (Both good actors) didn't help in supporting the role. Really subtle and boring - who thinks this will work? See the 1937 Stanwyck version instead of this one. 1
