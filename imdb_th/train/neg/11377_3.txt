OK. For beginners, taxi drivers are amazing. This is not a taxi driver or amazing. The thing is not good, but I think it's funny, which means that it has qualification for redemption. Like the conversation ... Wow, there are no more or less plot, all the characters are stupid and the movies preach. There are some places that I think this movie will dive into the intensity of the taxi driver type, which will have a message at the end of the movie on the heavy head. I do not want to believe that there are 20 people who have watched this movie. Yes, it's worth it to see if you're really bored and you want to confirm the fact that everyone can make a movie or at least try it.
