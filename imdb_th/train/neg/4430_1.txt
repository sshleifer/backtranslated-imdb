Thanks to the dimensionless film by Neil Simon and the boring direction from Robert Moore, the second chapter became the show case for Marsha Mason, who received the Oscar, the head of the three-quarters of the second chapter. Just as she gave Cinnderella Liberty 73), Goodbye Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and Only II Laugh (81). Only this time, she had no children to drag. The second chapter is Moore's third and final documentary film directed by The Cheap Detective (78) of Neil Simon and Murder By Death (76). The beam is a different story. The characters have one dimension. There is almost no detail. The first half is less than cute. Meet the cute and shy love between Caan who blinks with the chipper mason and a boring second half makes you want to get the first half. The location of NYC, like Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper, that is thin and painful is irrelevant. But at least they gave a friendly welcome And finally, and at least there are awesome songs played between credits
