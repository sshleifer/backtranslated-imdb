I can hardly find the words that show how scary this movie is. I was sold by the contract of action with Segal and the stealth plane, which usually made action movies that provide entertainment. I can honestly say that I should dig my eyes with a cocktail bar rather than having to watch this movie again. The acting is so scary that it's almost funny. The story is weak like crazy, with wide plotting slots so you can fly F117 through them. The script is very bad. If I find a 10 year old child writing, I shouldn't be surprised. Directions and production are amateurs. I don't even hire these people to shoot the worst wedding video of the enemy. Voiced by Utter, who is responsible for making this film, makes art cheaper and they should Ashamed, Steven Segal should not show his face to the public again. I can't imagine what made him agree to be shown in this movie. Is the worst movie I've ever seen all my life
