I'll tell you something about this movie. I've seen it twice The first time I was a kid and this movie was quite fun for me. I really like it. I think it's funny and interesting and the main character is cool. <br /> <br /> I saw it again a few days ago. It was really scary. I didn't know why I thought it was funny before, but now ... I didn't laugh at all. Nothing fun, even a little. It is stupid Weak story The performance was nothing special. There are great actors in this movie. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is the fact that this movie is really racist. Don't understand me. I don't complain about racism in movies. However, I've seen people complain about the lack of black men in movies like 'The Shaolin Temple' or about the fact that the only black man in 'The Street Fighter' is one of the bad guys ... ... Will get a point. There are people seeing people everywhere I wonder how they will interact with movies like 'The Meteor Man'. Why? I'll tell you why There is no Asian in this movie. No white people among good people In fact, there is only one white person in the whole movie and he is the leader of the bad guy. All good men are African Americans. Don't understand me wrong, I don't care if the good man is black or white or yellow or pink or green ... What I'm interested in is the fact that we hardly see white people in this movie. This is the only movie I have ever seen. It's not like real If there is only one black man in a Japanese movie which is the case of 'Street Fighter' is no problem - in Japan, most people are Asian. But if there is only one white person in American movies, there are some problems - in the United States, most people are white people. It's like shooting a Japanese movie that has all the white characters and only Asian people are bad people. <br /> <br /> That's it. I rate the movie 4/10. It will be 1/10. If I don't enjoy it as a child
