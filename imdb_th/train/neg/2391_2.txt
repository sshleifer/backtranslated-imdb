I love movies I love the independent effort and production in the major studios. I love movies with stars and I love unknown movies. I love drama, drama, comedy, action, adventure, science fiction, western mysteries of all types, except horror. I love foreign movies, including movies in English. I love good movies and I love movies that are not good because there are almost no movies that will not entertain or entertain at some level except "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues." <br /> <br /> When I attended the late night performance of the Cowgirls. I attended about 10 spectators. Less than half the way I remained alone. Soon I was unable to tolerate the mess that was happening before my eyes and I went away as well. To this day, "Cowgirls" are still the only movies I have ever walked out. <br /> <br /> I don't know how to explain this uninterrupted, absurd, ridiculous, nonsense, nonsense story Lack of redemption value Suffice to say that this film is one of the most important films of all time, terrifying and obscene at all levels. It tries to be wise. But the idea of ​​feminism seems to be out of date. It tries to be funny. But the humor is rough and worth it This is one of the few movies that can erase their own rock by drawing the protagonists in the way you oppose them and their values. If you want to watch movies, watch "Waterworld" "Ishtar", regardless of anything, except "Alexander". If you choose between this and this, read the book instead.
