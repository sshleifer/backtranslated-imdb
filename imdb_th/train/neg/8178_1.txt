Have you ever watched a movie 20 or 30 minutes ago and suddenly you knew that you had watched this movie before? That happened to me with "The Young Graduates", the cover of the video box. If you can search for that video is very deceptive. I swear that the two women on the cover were not in the movie. <br /> <br /> However, I was born a decade too late to appreciate the finer points of this film or ... It is a waste that doesn't exist. Destination I leaned back hard. But I guess there is something connected to this movie. <br /> <br /> Well ... plot of the story. Let's see ... There must be a plan here. No, I can't find it. It's quite a matter of senior people in high school who show stupor and make drugs and speak languages ​​that are outdated decades ago. A female student is interested in her teacher. The teacher has a cold wife. (Which he refers to the iceberg), so he is open to the progress of the girl She looks remarkably violent as dancers dance and flick on the dance floor. Glad to see at least one species. Find interesting things in this souvenir. 1/10
