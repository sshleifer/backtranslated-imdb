Hollywood's attempt to change Jack London's life into an adventure movie "Jack London" is not a bad idea. Of course, he brings an interesting and sometimes adventurous life. However, this film is flat and not satisfied. The most important thing is that it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (as in London) has Londonesque speeches; And it's good to see Jack Beard get his "The Call of the Wild" after spending quality time alone on a snowy mountain with his dog "Buck", both Virginia Mayo and Susan Hay Word is both beautiful. This film brings "Yellow Peril" that unfortunately goes between life in London and World War II, both stressing and insulting <br /> <br /> ** Jack London (11/24/43) Alfa San Santel ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
