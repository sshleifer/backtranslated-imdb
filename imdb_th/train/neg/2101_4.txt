Last year, Bernard Rapp died and was a well-trained journalist. Cinema was one of his greatest interests. (He wrote the world wide dictionary of movies) and therefore he was bound to swing the camera at least once in his life. But the movie he left did not give a warm comment: "Tiréà Part" (1996), despite the terrifying performance of Terence Stamp, was a dramatic parody of the character "une Affaire De Goût" (2000 ) Is a simple story. Giraudeau sends distorted works. "Pas Si Grave" (2003) is another game released and "Un Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence" seems overwhelming as before. The potential of the cartoon is used in a subtle way. <br /> <br /> However, the initial idea to predict the swirling jokes that Yvan Attal held and Sandrine Kiberlain, who invited their friends to move. Fully in the mansion with a desire If they want to play with their guests, they pretend to be part of the company and things don't go as planned because the announcement of the way does not surprise them. Both couples began to ponder about the authenticity of their lovers. <br /> <br /> Despite the lush scenery and the material that he would likely receive when he managed, Rapp's outstanding director couldn't. Manage to live with this game Unexpected results The plot follows a well-worn style with characters that have specific well-known functions and masks that are revealed about what they actually are. Verbal or comic effect situations are often depressing. Bad edits faded a little further from this film with this bad habit from Rapp to immediately cut off many sequences. Even the information of the actors who are sincere in the business is debated. It seems that they feel tired and recite more texts than to live. In particular, the audience Sandrine Kiberlain is in deep torment. <br /> <br /> It's sad to say. That: Bernard Rupp's movie never lived with his intentions as "un Petit Jeu sans Conséquence" as a witness.
