Warning: I recommend that anyone who has not seen this movie has not read this comment. <br /> <br /> Although I didn't see them all. But the Hamilton people are showing some bad entertainment. Entertain me !!!! I think the same with semi-bad performances, stupid plot plans and twists at the end of the movie, which is very retarded. Okay, so these are these Is someone who eats others? Yes, yes ...... Observe. I say that people are not human, not because it's not human or waiting. Okay, these people are human beings or they are buried or what they are !!!! I mean, maybe they are just "things" that come here to see what kind of people have tastes or are they eating. People for a long time now or maybe this movie is HHOORRIIBBLLEE !! Which is what !!! So if you think Hamilton is a good thing, why do you ask me why? Why? Why is it so scary? For me, it's just flat out. Terrible !!! One big BOOOOOOO for The Hamiltons !!! Go to see The Gravedancers, Tooth & Nail or Borderland for entertainment !!!!!
