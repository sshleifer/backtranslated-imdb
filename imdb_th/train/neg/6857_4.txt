This comedy seems to be very forced. Actually, the actors tried very hard to make an unimportant chapter. And for this reason it doesn't go anywhere The idea of ​​a woman who knows that she is pregnant after getting a divorce quickly is not a joke. Then, when Cooper sneaks out with the child because he doesn't want it to be adopted, it seems to be very scary and it pushes hard to make this a joke. It's really a shame, too, because the actors are more capable of scripts and I find myself bored with all the clutter. Considering that Cooper made a very funny movie, I suggest you watch them instead.
