I rate this movie only 3 stories because it's a shame because it's worth it. I like to watch great movies and I'm not inclined to the movie "Man". Blonde is legitimate. It's a great movie. On the other hand, Georgia Rule is a disorganized, weak, weak, ill-written and unrealistic example of creating the worst movie. At the end of this movie, I didn't care who lied or if there was anything to fix. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in the movie is a good story. This story is weak and does not develop. (Just because the deep content doesn't mean good story) A good story has a dynamic character. The dynamic character is a character that experiences the main character changes and is prepared for changes throughout the film's time in Georgia Rule. The character's changes occur immediately and are not developed. Secondly, there are too many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters. Pulling out good dynamic characters is a difficult task and takes time. (You spend only a few hours in the movie). That means that dynamic characters that try too much will get too little attention to their personal changes. Although I do not care about the poorly written and litter of weak, dynamic characters, I can't say who I like. Not all characters are organized. It doesn't matter if you write American Beauty, but not when you try to play a comedy. Georgia is an awesome mother. Her daughter is a terrible mother and daughter and Lohan is a terrible excuse for humans. (No, I don't cut her slack, because she is shit with everyone and we all have responsibility. For our own actions) "Moodley is right." Mormon children should have the courage to not compromise with their religion and obligations ... and Simon. I mean seriously, what kind of men are allowing. A 17-year-old girl who is sometimes attacked This movie is worth watching if you want to remind yourself what a good movie is!
