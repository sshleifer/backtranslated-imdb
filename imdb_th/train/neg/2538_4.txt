Between the years 1937 and 1939, twenty Century-Fox created a lot of Mr. Mo films. However, at the end of the series, it is clear that the studio has a "shark jump" in order to speak. This phrase indicates that the TV program has passed and the responsible management decided to recharge the program by changing the basic formula. For example, when using "The Brady Bunch", they recommend 'Cousin Oliver' that is annoying, and with "Family Ties", they recommend strange babies that grow six years in one season only! With the Moto movie, they jumped in the sharks by offering comic relief because they thought that these genius movies needed to be re-adapted. In the previous film, Warren Hymer played as an annoying wrestler. And in this film, the character Archibald Featherstone appears. Featherstone may be one of the most annoying cartoon examples that has ever existed, as you hope someone (especially Moto) will kill him to close him !! Although he should work for the famous Scotland Yard But he shows the cleverness and acumen of the radish that is damaged by the brain Over and over again, his scenes look terrible and unnecessary, and Peter Lorraine feels pain when he stands there and watches the "action" of this character. It's terrible to destroy things. COULD is one of the better Moto movies because of the clever plot. <br /> <br /> For this, the crown of Queen of Sheba was discovered in the opening scene. Moto, which is an international police more than the character he used to be, is ready to protect valuables from being stolen. Many thieves try to steal the crown freely. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie can be watched. But there is enough evidence to show that the Moto series should end here. With the approaching Second World War, the movie could not survive any longer, as the sympathetic character of Japan would not be accepted in the United States or in allied countries.
