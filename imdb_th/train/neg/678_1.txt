All I can say is I'm glad I knit socks while watching a movie, or I'm very angry that I lost 2 hours. The performance is terrible. The plot is worse. There are some scenes that are intended to be serious, which makes my husband and I laugh out loud. I would like to recommend this movie to those who like to make their own version of MST3K.
