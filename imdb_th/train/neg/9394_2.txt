Oh how is this man serials in 1952! This boring thing is the type of cereal that Annie Wilkes (from misery) precisely, not just the hero escaping from the trap by adding scenes that are not in the previous chapter. (And may not be there - tell me that when the baddies blow up the plains in episodes 7 to 8, they will not see The character jumps) but I think this serial has a stock video recording of the world. I mean, most are stock images! And not just other serials (obviously, the entire flight sequence came from the King of the Rocket Men and the cool "molten rock" scene of episodes 2 to 3 came from the Adventures of Captain Marvel. It's itself! All "Trip to the Moon" sequence (which may be the shortest time ever is 30 seconds and the characters seem to never leave the Earth's atmosphere) from episode 1, repeated in episode 8! And Episode 10 is the whole scene from the previous episode! (Have you ever wondered why MST3K has never done episodes 10, 11 and 12, they have to stop after 9, so they don't have to do it all again!) <br /> <br /> I don't understand. Scientific Prepare to watch the sunbathing moon as ever! And Moon men who can't breathe in their own world? What are they smoking? <br /> <br /> And if it's not enough, it's too talkative and stunts (usually the best in serials). There aren't many smart eyes. I'm the only one. That think of bullet-shaped helmets (Or is it a lemon) Commando Cody is completely ridiculous? Rocketeer looks cool, no matter how bad the movie is. (And human beings are terrible) The tanks that look no better than this seem like many children built for Halloween. The only positive thing I can imagine is that the actor who plays as a hero goes home instead of the usual large muscles. (Hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!) But then he doesn't care ... /> <br /> Not worth looking at for nostalgia. See Captain Marvel instead of 2/10. <br /> <br / > (BTW, check out the memorable prices for Pearl Lib, real women)
