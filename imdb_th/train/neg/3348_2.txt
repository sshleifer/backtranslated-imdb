"The Haunting" in 1963 was one of my favorite horror movies for many years, so I expect to have a remake in 1999 with many concerns. It seems that any follow-up may be more than or equal to the original masterpiece. Unfortunately, my concern has been well established: this film has a foul odor. <br /> <br /> I don't know what people involved in this movie are thinking. Jan De Bont, who seems to have Coincidentally, when he directed "Speed", that was excellent. (Or maybe worse) as he did with the duds "Twister" and "Speed ​​2: Great Cruise Control". Hey, Jan is attached to the movie. Liam Neeson has enough of his role as a psychologist who pretends to be a psychologist - I don't think he has the ability to truly change his acting - but even if he can't save the weak script. And The weak story Catherine Zeta Jones proved again (Just like she did in "Entrapment") that she lacks the ability to show higher from the content delivered to her The lead actress who performed a great job on the episode of "The X-Files" seems to have disappeared as Eleanor, insomnia on the edge of consciousness. And that blonde man, no matter who he is, is more wooden than the strange laughing statues of children engraved into the woodwork around the house. I do not think that he changed the expression only once throughout Movies <br /> <br /> (Front spoiler) <br /> <br /> The reason that the first movie works well is because we are not sure. The house is truly haunted or whether the symptoms are the result of Eleanor's precarious mental state. There are no spirits to appear in the original movie, which makes your imagination come true - a highlight of other great horror movies, such as "The Changeling" and "The Blair Witch Project". Many CGIs, which are generally (When encountering a weak plot / plot) makes this movie not scary. The f / x isn't as great as this. Considering ILM, freezing breath looks particularly fake. The effect in Peter Jackson's movie that underestimated the "The Frighteners" that I saw earlier was much better. The wooden figurines of children, which should look creepy, just look silly. (Especially when they scream) and CGI monsters have nothing to write about at home Instead of giving relief from bad performances, bad directions and bad writing, the effects add to the chaos of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the dumb scenes are especially: When the three characters broke into Eleanor's bedroom And none of them were surprised to find a huge foul-smelling demon hovering over the bed. The scene in which Eleanor "saw" an old woman of the house hanging from the rafters ... The performances here were exceptionally bad, and last but not least, the unexpected fun that Wooden Blond Guy shouted like Unexpectedly, what should be heartbroken, jump on a piece of furniture and begin to bump into the paintings of the evil old man who built the house. In fact, we are satisfied with this scene. A few seconds after his attack, Blond Guy was dragged to the fireplace by the ghost of an old man and as soon as his head was cut off from the chimney It's just part of the movie I like. <br /> <br /> In summary, stick to the original "The Haunting" in 1963 3/10 stars.
