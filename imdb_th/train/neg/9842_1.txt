It seems that everyone in this movie will send the story to Woody Allen. They stutter and stop and stutter more for DeNero fans that are really difficult! It tries to appear to be irritable and art. But it came out like a movie about a very low budget made by students The most frequently used word in this film is "Hum". This film creates the atmosphere of the late sixties / seventies. If you like movies that people are constantly talking about, scary light (Although it is because "Art for the benefit") and make you feel that you are sitting in a weak political meeting. You might like - really bored. I found this CD in the dollar tank and now I know why.
