I could hardly see the incompetence There is almost nothing to say about this genre that is full of hope. A few interesting things that seem to be the first contract film will become less than the red herring. Prodigy actor - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - was used in a role nowhere; The genius director sometimes creates a movie that seems to be filmed through a coffee-colored camera lens. The writer (John Grisham), who never made any merit, discovered a new depth of inconsistency under inspiration mind This movie is cheap, has a mischievous feeling. But not at the level of opinion which is part of the aesthetics Usually, I come to IMDb to write a balanced comment and generally see value. The great disaster of this film made me want to create an endless yearning. I couldn't but because I didn't want to take my "mind" anymore with this trash.
