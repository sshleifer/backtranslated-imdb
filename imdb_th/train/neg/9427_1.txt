When I rent "Unhinged" I expect to have a gore movie. The box also claims that the film has a violent scene that has been cut from the drama. (Now I have a serious question about this story that was released in the cinema) After completing the movie, I wonder if it will receive a video. <br /> <br /> The story is as follows: Three girls People traveling by car, smash their cars, hit trees. These women tried to find a way to the mansion which had women who are very feminine. In addition to this point, most movies contain useless scenes that are intended to make this movie long enough to be released. <br /> <br /> One of the things that makes this movie scary is the show Lisa Munson Who plays the main character looks as though she is reading the queue card The performances of other people are not good. But not as bad as her Another thing that makes this movie worse is the camera technique. Many cameras were shot by the ceiling. This story is very annoying when the movie goes on. Above all, there is a small gap which makes the box very misunderstood. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time on this. My rating: 1 out of 10
