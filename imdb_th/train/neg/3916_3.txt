We all know that movies are never completely fair for this book. But it's great The main characters were cut away. Blanca and Alba were very popular in the same characters, sub-parts and main elements of the main plot were eliminated. Clara's clairvoyance was greatly belittled, making her look like a character that is more shallow than I know in the book. In this book, we learn more about her power and the important impact she has on many people, which eventually become an important element in family life. In this film, she doesn't have anything more than a special lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero-third-by way of being a son and therefore coming after the second Segundo second) and the connection between between Esteban and his nephew from Pancha Garc√≠a (not the son he still recognizes ) Was cut in half and reduced in importance. <br /> <br /> One of the most basic things about the book that this film has to rob: This is called "House of Souls". Where is the house? The story of a family of 3-4 generations should be rotated around the "big house at the corner", the lines mentioned many times in the novel. The house is the basis of the story. But this film relegated to the background unjustly. <br /> <br /> If I had not read this book before, I would never have guessed that this movie would be superficial. Is based on a rich and fun novel
