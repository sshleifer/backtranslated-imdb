I'm a big fan of comic books. But this movie is lower than I expected. I expect Heavy Metal 2000 to feel ..... Slow motion, bad conversation, a lot of blood ..... but it's worse than anything I imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot line is almost the same as the cartoon. But the good point will stop there The characters have no power or spirit that attracts my attention in the cartoon series. This film covers only a small part of the cartoon and the part used is slower and tedious than the next. Focusing on the movie is insignificant, instead of the more interesting overall story of the comic book. < br /> <br /> With the right people in this project Sadly, it's not like that, so now there is another scary movie that few people will see and will love less. My copy will certainly collect dust for many years until I finally leave it.
