This movie is really scary. After seeing the advertisement, I thought it would be charming ... but it wasn't. Women couldn't do it and they couldn't sing as well. The soundtrack for this film is full of their songs and it is not a cute picture, a terrible story, an unbelievable plot, one of Disney's worst movies by FAR! Ally. A bad actor in the "Phil of the Future", so I don't know what happened in "Cow Belles" and her sister, AJ, seems to be just a knot sitting with her sister "celebrity" and she Did not show three <br /> <br /> At the end of this movie, girls learn about ancient morality, but this is the time to help movies about train wrecks. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
