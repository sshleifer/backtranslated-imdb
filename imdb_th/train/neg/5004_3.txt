Wow, it's ridiculous because this movie came out for a while. I think someone else has just checked it a few days ago. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I watched this movie just because Nick Stahl For the record <br /> <br /> This movie is ridiculous. The characters pushed me crazy. They are so Clich√© and STEREOTYPED. This movie has the worst dialogue I've ever heard. There is a way to plot too much, too twisted. <br /> <br /> There is one scene in the movie that should be worth watching the scene: "A warm heart, a cold gun." Disgusted in the shower (actually they were all disgusting), but his performance in the scene was great. When looking at his face, it reminds me of American Psycho (good movie). The scene is worth watching. But not worth watching the rest of the movie to act like and don't watch
