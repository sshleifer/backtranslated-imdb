Fun with Jean Arthur in "The Devil and Miss Jones". My attention is so sharp, so I try to sit the second set of balls about the jockey's death. Pictures in fashion, magazines, movies, whether from allegations of former husband William William or another marriage appointment But I never felt her because the character was just a call. (She is a heroine who likes Curious, funny But when in the morgue - like every woman in the comedies '30 - she fainted), William Powell had a high time working with Miss Arthur. But you never know that it comes from the results; They look awkward, standing side by side, reluctant to joking. The actors who played as Powell were troubled and the audience laughing was uneasy.
