The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighter is surprisingly acceptable. The characters are reliable and interesting. The mud laboratory seems really high-tech. After that, it will crash. The characters began to behave stupidly and the new plans were introduced from nowhere about fusion reactors (and this is "modern times") to critique the crisis, only one plot. Incredible There is one thing that suspects that anything that creates a movie that starts wrong is wrong. <br /> <br /> All characters except Dean Cain played by the Russians. This resulted in some strange situations and details, such as the character played by Vessela Dimitrova, who was called "Bailey Kent" despite her heavy accent. Br >> Due to the good start I consider This movie score is 5, but it is more frustrating.
