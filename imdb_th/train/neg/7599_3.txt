A friend told me about John Fante last summer, after we talked about Charles Bukowski. I do not know that Fante is Bukowski's favorite writer - an author with a similar edge and humor, except from one version. This page 'Ask the Dust' is the first book I read and it's still one of my favorite novels. This novel is an excellent writing work about frightening and frightening young writers who are posing with themselves and the outside world as too talented and talented writers who don't know how to write about real experiences. In the novel, the protagonist is innocent, not knowing how to overcome the love of women he wants to write in a magazine. The story of his strange relationship with Camilla, the way he used to have his first sexual relationship with an injured person and eventually he was left with nothing. But the story of a failed attempt at love ending the film's adaptation is still true for the book for a while. But spoke to the love of the theater that persevered through racism, illness and death The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a jerk and a crazy Camilla and their love has never been and never been true, no matter how much they want to meet. This movie draws the true meaning of the story and replaces it with a schlock. I don't want to believe that those who write Chinatown can read this book and make a movie about it that makes it wrong.
