Just got a part of GEORGE 2 on TV but can't watch until the end Just awesome! I can't even remember All I know is George and Ursula, not George and Ursula in the first movie, which is not good enough. There are many scramble. But the direction and correction are scattered and missing I've seen and that's what Jeez says. Because of the IMDb's 10-line rule, I have to type on when I have nothing to say about the newly created sequel for TV Disney hangs your head in shame.
