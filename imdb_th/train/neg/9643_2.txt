Lower than the average movie with bad music if considering movies from songs ??? The script and general direction that is full of mistakes. Salman Khan is his regular actor. Ajay's performance has intensified over time, especially his appearance as a rock star. Entirely just an actor Overall, I feel like losing money in the cinema. Salman Khan is still underage for 10 years, compared to Amir Khan. There are many songs in the movie that are boring, except "Man Ko Ati". The most important song that impresses the supporters of the UK music is not the most impressive. "Khanabadosh" can be very easily understood by English music supporters. Another movie I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid" which is a simple, slow love story with a good direction.
