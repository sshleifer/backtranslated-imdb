Should congratulate Bashki for trying to convert one of the great works of English fiction into a movie, then slap a silly face for this effort. The animation is not good, the characters look ridiculous, the music is overwhelming, and the film is blitzed around the first and half of Tolkien's masterpiece I can still remember my true disappointment and hate the movie when I first saw it. Now I know that any effort to convert a book into a movie is bound to fail in many ways just because of the media. But this movie, regardless of the source of the story, is a pathetic story. Bashki is more capable.
