Christ, Christianity ... One watch is shocking, unbelievable and may be crazy, while the chaotic exercise in the smut that is unhappy with the ingenuity and agility of the Galapagos turtle What will that be? Does this movie really exist, or am I an unfamiliar guinea pig of a shadowy foreign pharmaceutical company, some people sipping my coffee without realizing that it was stabbed with dangerous hallucinogens? I've seen many movies and many bad movies. But nothing is prepared for me At the end of me, I'm a gibberish, snelling carcass, tearing the carpet with my teeth like a dog, the nail on the wall, great until my lungs hurt. I plead for madness like madness. (Those who do this, I do not know) and longing for a hot desire for the calm balm of Ozu Yasujiro Sweet Weeping Jesus Memories ... Sometimes they come back to me. When I am in my weakness when I can handle it I trembled with tears. I bitten my fingernails until my hands were struck by blood. But I can't drive out the horrible events from my heart Alone in experiencing this horrible experience, which may mean only one of two things: a) This film is made In fact there exists or b) I am just one victim in the international conspiracy of a truly scary proportion. The incredible thing is that some people seem to be happy with the test or at least don't get hurt. Maybe they are part of the operation. God condemns them, crazy people! God cursed them all to hell !!!!!!
