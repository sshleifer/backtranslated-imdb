I will start with a good point. This movie is only 86 minutes long and some stories are terrible. Funny. Now for the low point My first warning came with a real "warning" on the film. When it began to show the following "warning:" movies that you are about to see are annoying graphics and images because in contrast to popular beliefs that have been killed are not fun, cute or romantic. Should be able to help myself in 86 minutes and close it The first word of this film is: "I am at the glue factory." There are some men talking on the phone and they refer to the old house as a glue factory. I do not know why So the basis of this film is that some children are obsessed with the zodiac killer and begin to imitate him. The budget for this movie is at least 50 bucks and they have to use the cheapest camera to find. Performances are worse than I read from the script. That's what looks like they're doing. The scary and "twisted" big script is the man who wrote the biography of the killer. Libra is a Libra killer. Of course, they tried to show this conclusion. But made it completely clear within the first 10 minutes without the painful details of the plot. This is a terrifying highlight of the movie. They try to make the Libra killer compare himself to "Army One" because soldiers are just murderers Then they tried to "worship Satan" by showing some men in black in the meeting. A great "computer hacker" can receive the address of this child when someone notifies his name and phone number. For some reason, he had to hack into the FBI to get an address. I'm not sure why he doesn't just search in the phone book or use whitepages.com There is also an allusion to 9/11 without reason. I also learned that no matter where you are shot, the blood will come out of your mouth in a matter of seconds. <br /> <br /> So if you like bad performances, sub-chapters, camera work not good You will love killer killer!
