I never expected that movie adaptations would follow too many novels. (Especially the film that loved the evening) but when I saw that Susan Minot, the author of this book, was a screenwriter It's a good adaptation. <br /> <br /> If you like books, don't pay attention to this movie. Until now, both of these books are almost without similarity. <br /> <br /> Here, our characters are completely different: the bride loves Harris. Harris is the son of a housewife. Buddy is a drunkard, loves Ann and / or Harris. I don't think that the only character made from this book goes to the screen; Oh, it's the worst in every moment Older children with nasty fights and children and young people do not work on film? This movie is disastrous across it.
