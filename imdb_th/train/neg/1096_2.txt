While some scenes of practice are true But there are many people who describe military professors as former Nazis. Obviously, people who write the screenplay are either against the army or writing a screenplay for that audience. <br /> <br /> I'm a Vietnamese veterinarian and even during this time. Some of these traits may still be served in military prison. <br /> <br /> And I like the scene where "hero" and his friend (both of them) are sitting in the captain's office. Smoking and talking and insulting the captain as if he were a friend This kind of thing never happened in practice or in a formal situation, just as it was for the purpose of the scene. <br /> <br /> At the end, I asked myself if "What is this movie about?" It looks like it's going to walk around the place without focus, except "I hate all power." Thank God that I received from the library and did not pay rent.
