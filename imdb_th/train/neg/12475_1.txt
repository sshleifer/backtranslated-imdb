I do not remember walking out of the cinema except for this one time. Not only that But I live with 7 friends and we all want to go The plot is not interesting, the characters are made of clay, violence without points. I don't care when good people die. I don't care that the villains will get it. Imagination and magic are placed on the thick like a liver pudding and are not linked. In short, good entertainment if you spend eternity in hell.
