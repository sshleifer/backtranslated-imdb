*** Spoiler *** Do not read this if you think to watch this movie, even if it is a waste of time (by the way: the plot can be predicted that will not make any difference If you read or not anyway) <br /> <br /> If you are wondering what to see "Ugly Coyote": No! It's not worth the money for tickets or VHS / DVD. "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick" in general can speak. The plot itself is as shallow as possible to be a ridiculous and irrational version of the American dream. A young, good-looking girl from a small town became a big success in New York. A few attempts to make this film fail, such as the father's "tragedy" accident, the hardships of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend, and so on. McNally (the director) tries to stimulate the compassion and sadness of the people. There was no chance of success in this effort because the script was not good and the performances were superficial. In particular, Piper Perabo failed completely in the story. Bent one of the "Jersey's" scared to sing in front of an audience. The only thing good (And quite funny) about "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, who expressed the small hope of this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm very surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer produced the film. This first "disappeared in 60 seconds" and now ... What happens to great movies like "The Rock" and "Con Air"? That is the true story of Bruckheimer. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for superficial movies that have women that look good, just have a relaxing evening, you should watch "Charlie's Angels" (funny, fun and ironic) instead This flick <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down (3 out of 10)
