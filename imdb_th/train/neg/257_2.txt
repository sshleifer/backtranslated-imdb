I love Jamie Foxx. <br /> <br /> And I enjoy 99% of all the movies I see. <br /> <br /> And I walked out of the movie. <br /> <br /> I agree that there may be something related to two middle-aged women who are behind the theater that laughs every little thing ("No, Jamie is knocking on the door! Hee Hee! ") But .. It's so annoying. There may not be continuous shooting from the camera and there is no shooting from ordinary camera angles ... Everything must be in your face loud and annoying. <br /> <br /> Bad guys try to be smooth and like. Malkovich, but at this point it's old and tired. He brought something new or interesting. From every character, there are many lines that you see too much that you have heard before and many lines that are "tough people" ... and I don't care about that as long as there is Of initiative for it Actually, all the supporting actors have been sucked. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Foxx and I think he's really funny and I think he's funny in this movie. But not funny enough for I have to endure everything. <br /> <br /> This movie needs more short shots, more boring shots, more emotion and Jamie Foxx.
