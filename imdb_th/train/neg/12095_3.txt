Elfriede Jelinek is not yet a household name. But won the Nobel Prize in Literature Her novel turned out to be the second prize-winning film in Cannes and the highest award for male and female actors. I am a dinosaur in terms of appreciation of aesthetics or art. It has been debated what has happened. <br /> <br /> 'Gobble, Gobble' is a presentation of popular orthography in the United States. Kingdom In the world of turkey movies is a huge failure that is measured by receipts, box office or important reception 'Gobble, Gobble' and The Piano Teacher is the perfect companion. <br /> <br / > The embarrassment of this praiseworthy movie cannot be exaggerated. It didn't start very well, as if causing the audience to be annoyed. Granting credits to the non-critical scenes of the interrupt for more than 11 minutes, we were introduced to Professor Erika Kohut, who was clearly the altered ego of a highly respected writer, professor of piano. She lives with a husky mother. Father is a madman, an institution that died without being seen during the operation. <br /> <br /> The piano teacher review was too difficult to register for dissatisfaction. What we saw in the movie (And may read in the book for what I know) is a notorious and ridiculous story of the emotional pendulum swinging here without having to go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Erika, the name that has been used Minimal work initially appears as a person with severe musical sensitivity. But otherwise all suspended Not so much because there was a handbag at the two-step scene, along with the shaman who voiced her from beginning to end with many apologies. If the reviewer has to (yawn) to separate leitmotif (why not use a pretense word when a simple person will do it), Elrika's violent mood will be like that learning Becoming a 'low-pressure' engineer, whatever it is and playing ice hockey during his free time, is a talented pianist. He meets Elrika in an antique show in the apartment. Luxury in what may or may not be Paris In a strong artistic style, he fell in love and began to 'cherchez la femme'. <br /> <br /> Reprice Erika has a passion for hardcore porn. Inhale the tissues brought from the waste basket in the private booth she watched. <br /> <br /> Walter performed an excellent audition and was reluctantly accepted as Erika's private student. Which has a distinctive teaching style <br /> <br /> Soon he announced his love and soon Erika approached the women they were involved in, bad and incomplete sex. Erika still controls her lover. She promised to send a letter to teach him to exchange pleasant things. <br /> <br /> At the same time, jealousy was cold due to Walter's generosity to the nervous students who had abnormalities before. Rehearsing a concert in the future. Erika fills a student's shirt with a broken glass causing severe injuries to the delicate piano player. <br /> <br /> The next big scene (through the cut Erected by Erika, sharing with her mother, Erika wants to be slackened, slapped, etc. Sensible Walter is a nasty moment and walks out at night. <br /> <br /> At this point, there is still an hour The viewer can only fear the worst. Erika follows Walter for the rink, where he drills his ice hockey. They went out to the back room. Lusty Wally couldn't resist the hand that pulled on his pants. 'His baby gravy' will be driven away with other stomachs. Soon, Oh, <br /> <br /> Nasty but addicted, perhaps because he wants to take revenge for insulting. Cynical on the floor. Recently, Walter returned to Erika's apartment. Can you guess what will happen now? It's not very deep or difficult. Yes, he became a beast while Erika became a victim. At one point he locked the maman in her room and slapped Erika. Later, he kicked her at the face with her sex and renewed his love declaration. <br /> <br /> I'm not fair in This summary? Watch movies if you want. But I do not advise you <br /> <br /> Everyone can see eternity in the sand if they are in the right mood. I can explain the challenges of human relationships that are conveyed by this film if I want to, but I don't like 'because this is a cheap and nasty movie that draws attention to instinct and does not say anything. <br /> <br /> I should say that Erika, with his parents, wants love. In pornography refused improperly when it appeared, literally pink and shaking under her nose, realizing that she didn't like to hurt blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> The world has no reason to explain her dwarf Obviously, she made the monster out of those who appeared superficially in love - but of course, we all know that any man may be a violent rapist because that is his main characteristic. But he tried to tell himself and the world. <br /> <br /> At the end, if you have the patience to stay there, there is a slight twist. Before going to the final scene where she was due to act as a student, the underwear that was stained with the wounded hand, Erika packed a knife in her handbag. For Walter? <br /> <br /> Yes, you are in front of me. She stabbed herself in an area that is not life-threatening and leaving credit. <br /> <br /> If this is the second prize in Cannes
