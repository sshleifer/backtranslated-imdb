The first half of this movie is pure happiness. Comedy novels. Great performances. Brothers and sisters in Manhattan fall in love with the same woman! Bright adults are witty. What do you ask? As a romantic comedian, this story is refreshing. It headed to an unexplored land. And then it was separated Disappointing things As a public film, it begins with such a promise. Why have to change to the movie "I am I am I am". The ending picture of Heather Graham jumping on the air to celebrate. "Her happiness in finding herself" is emphasizing the monotony of the last part of the movie. <br /> <br /> It may be different. It should be magical. It ended up being the same as the old one.
