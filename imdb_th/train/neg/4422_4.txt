This is a real blow. We should believe that Merle Oberon was the daughter of an ambitious politician who had to prove to Tom DeLay in the 1930s that he should be worth supporting as a presidential candidate. Poor Merle can't go anywhere. But being surrounded by politicians and their wives captious swaying and support from Uncle Harry Davenport North only. She joined her two maids on a blind date and Gary Cooper appeared. Some of the shots of the rodeo may have a lively thing. "Misfits", but without such luck Gary stayed in a formal dinner at Merle as president, and although invited to sit down and join the group, read the narrative of their snobbery. Where is the sudden sharpening of this cowboy? The most exciting scene in this film is the ghost party that Gary holds in his unfinished house for Merle, a wife that doesn't exist. Will it not end? One that should be avoided
