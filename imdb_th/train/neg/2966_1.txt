I don't understand all about this movie. OK, if you like splashing water cheap, you will love this movie. But if you like good stories and good actors, don't watch this story. Personally, I don't like actors in this movie. They seem to be hired directly from the street. The dialog box is smooth and you always know what's going on. The overall quality of this movie lacks a very low budget. When we see this movie (I and 3 others) We all thought that this movie was created by some people who wanted to do this just to graduate in film school - with minimum effort Another issue that makes the overall experience really diminishing is the bad camera (very shaking) and the bad sound.
