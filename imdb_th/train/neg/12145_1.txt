As you may have gathered from the title, I believe that this movie is the worst zombie movie of all time, acting, camera work, writing, special effects and anything else related to this movie in the distance. People argue that while this film has horrific action and excellent production But it comes with a clever script. Wow. The story has more holes than me or others that could be counted for the beginner. Why would the government tell everyone to go back to work when unsafe? I know that the government should be evil. But they did not receive anything from killing the entire population of the country No one will rule! Another thing I wonder about, though, the government tells everyone to work. Why would people go if the streets are full of zombies? Zombies will hide in the bushes and ambush the unsuspecting people to help the government in planning to kill everyone on earth. And what about the ending? The stupid torch that sacrificed his life in order to get closer to the zombies. He may forget that all cameras in the last 35 years have zoom features. And another reason why he spoke Hindenburg before he died. Hindenburg is a rare occurrence by a few people. Everyone in the country will see dangerous zombies. Does he think others will get some overview? They also destroyed the only interesting semi-scene in the movie when the soldiers were watching exotic dancers. Why do zombies hide behind the curtain for five minutes before attacking a girl? Especially when the zombies can pass through the door It may be just something that an unseen zombie movie fan like myself doesn't understand. Every day I pray for the Lord by increasing the ability of my brain long enough to figure out the slight differences in raising animals. <br /> <br /> Okay, I think it's interesting that this is The first movie that gave The desire to hurt the people involved in the production of Hey Trent Haaga, I'll call you!
