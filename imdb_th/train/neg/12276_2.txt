This film has a lot of potential, unfortunately, it's separated because of weak / unbelievable stories, ridicule and lack of content / substance. One of the obvious flaws is Sean Connery, a male player The Arabs do not know how to pronounce their own Arabic name! This may seem a small flaw, but pointing to the lack of effort in attention to detail. The quality of the show is below average on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> The elegance of saving movies is twisting the plot at the end. And French music (I can't remember the name) Overall, it's a terrible movie that Sean Connery is clearly wrong.
