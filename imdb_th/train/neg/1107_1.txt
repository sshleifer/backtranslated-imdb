I read the back of the box and talked about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I think "It's great. This is great!" In fact, I still don't understand. For me, it seems that every character doesn't drink smoke (opium?) And has sex, not that the quality of the movie isn't good, but please! Where is the story I made myself finish the movie and yes it picked up to the end. But then the movie almost ended Rent if you want Don't trust behind the box.
