If you enjoy watching things that need to start as a 2-hour movie during a time when you can't connect, you will love this movie. Otherwise, you will wonder if they can create a movie like this from something that is easy to translate to a big screen in the name of Inspector Gadget. Not in movies and in some movies it doesn't make sense. While this film takes less than 1 and a half hours, I can think of a truly memorable moment and that is just a moment before or between credits! <br /> <br />
