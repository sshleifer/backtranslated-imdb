Ok, first of all, Steve Irwin rested peacefully. You are loved by many fans. Now ... This movie is not a movie at all. It is a TV show "The Crocodile Hunter" that has bad performances, bad scripts and bad governance between Steve. Catch or teach us about animals. He is fun as an animal / expert searcher. Millions of people will miss him. But all movie ideas are a big mistake. The plot is almost completely broken. The casting is very bad. The performance is not worth the elementary performers. The direction must be wrong as well. If you can't perform effectively halfway from your actor, no matter how bad the script is, you must not be a good person at first. I should be able to write the script better. I hope I will never go to see this movie. Of course, I watched it for $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son) while out with friends who insisted on seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son, who didn't like that Like a lot of movies But he has never asked to see again If you want Steve Irwin's lovely memories to buy his series on DVD, avoid this film like the plague. If I was Steve, I knew I wouldn't want to be remembered for this film. Respect him: Avoid this movie!
