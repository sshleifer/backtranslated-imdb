I didn't expect this type of movie outside of America. The way everyone can bring about child sexual abuse is a thriller. Auteuil (which I had previously admired) went around, like helping Rambo children without knowing and insulting children who were sexually exploited around the world. /> <br /> The dreadful thing is the amazing things and the ground. The movie "Happiness" was released last year. Before this movie, Menges and his friends should be ashamed. It is admirable to read the comments of the smarter audience. They can see the low and ridiculous management of this topic. You who think this is a great movie theater, showing disgust and you have to watch "happiness" to open your heart to the true horror of child pornography. <br /> <br /> You think your child Is your trend more likely? Kidnapped and sold as sex slaves or neighbors attacked teachers, friends or even relatives. Hmm ... I wonder if they are going to make a movie about being a slave to international children, no matter what they are. Owe it to everyone so that it is true and emotionally involved instead of nonsense.
