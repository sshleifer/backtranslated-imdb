Video games that look below average will become some conspiracy to allow the next terrorist to discover in the US backyard. Welcome to the madness of doing directly in the movie video. It's full of actors and actors. The name doesn't have a small plot. <br /> <br /> However, this strange game continues and our "hero" bet with real money and do well. It is like gambling, except that gambling is gone and it's terrible. Instead of being a real online game that has little real value and you will be given the right to if you do well. <br /> <br /> What makes strangers more than that is two strange computer programs that fight at the end. I'll leave the audience to see how it happens. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not worth the $ 1 rental. Please "D-"
