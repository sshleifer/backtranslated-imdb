I am very sorry to say this, but "Thunderbird" doesn't come with a loud pop-up. In one step, I take seriously the importance of walking out of the theater. In the hope that the movie will be better I will be disappointed. It doesn't get better. It's worse if possible. If I had to watch a movie with the idea that it would be "spoofed", I would still be abandoned. They have a great opportunity to create a great movie here. They have completely lost the opportunity. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be embarrassed to have the name attached to this movie and Jonathan Franks. What should I say? I saw this movie in the show before it was released. I am looking forward to watching it enthusiastically as I grow up in the sixties with traditional performances. To say that I'm disappointed will be an exaggeration. The last thing I will say about this movie is that the puppet in the TV program is just more wood than the actor in the movie.
