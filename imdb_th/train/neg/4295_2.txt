This film is another tragic and boring story about AIDS and tragedy. It started without events and predictions and continued throughout the film. I wait for it to pick up But unfortunately it has never been done Acting is fair But the script needs a lot of work And if you are looking for nudity, don't waste time with these hot actors Due to poor sound quality and lack of narration, I missed 1/8 movies. If you have never seen more than five gay movies or recently, you are gay, you may find that this movie is interesting. Low budget movies It is considered one of the worst gay movies I've ever seen.
