The vanity project is clear for Karin Mani (who?), While Charles Bronson, who is hot, walks around, sweeps 'scum' that rob her parents or grandparents or something and impresses the young hunks that are Her karate skills In the pivotal scene, she intervened to stop the rape and a police officer threw her into prison, so after two cold showers and an unsuccessful prison-barrage, she had to bring the law into her hands. Her blah blah blah. I guess there are many movies like this? The script is stupid than usual if you believe. Mani came out as a type of entertainment industry that would create her own Death Death, and I found that this movie was loved by period. But this movie is an unsightly tool A talented actor will lose the role here and will undermine the amazingly incompetent DA and the judge who must be the uncle of the producer.
