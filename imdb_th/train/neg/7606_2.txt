Beverly was born at the wrong time. She is a leading actress of her time, bringing power and elegance to the stupid movie that she performed in Corman in Gunslinger. She is the wife of the town sheriff. He was attacked, so she took the role of a murderer. She is better than the content that she works with far This film is mostly gray, arrogant and boring. With some humor (Unintentionally) with tire marks everywhere where people run behind one building to appear in front of another person (I've heard false clothes But this is nonsense! The sheriff fell in love with someone hired to kill her. Although she doesn't love her husband, it's just something like a week or two since he died! And she ended up shooting the man to death in the end There is no luck with this guy. <br /> <br /> This villain is another woman who owns a sedan. She plans to buy a lot of land in the event that the railway passes and makes her rich. Her action plan, if it wasn't beautiful - she would steal a lot from the city as much as she could and the skidaddle. Hey, it's just you and she hired a gun at the end of the whole city. You tell me that these people don't have weapons, right? See what happened in the old city of Old West. When the bank robbery came to rob the bank, then was hit by a bombardment by armed and dangerous city dwellers. Riding aimlessly around, alternating with a slightly lame shot. The ending is a scary story, as in Corman's flick, though thanks to the goodness it lacks in the end of the world. The sheriff changed her badge to Sam Bass and rode out at sunset, even though the film was gray until you never saw the sun.
