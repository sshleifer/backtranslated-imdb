My friends have been through the process for many years to choose the worst horror movie in the video store for evening entertainment. For some reason I ended up buying this one (maybe v. Cheap) <br /> <br /> Cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. There are also some fun scenes. Among them is the scene in which a man was attacked and defended himself with improbable things that made me laugh at that time. (It doesn't seem funny when you look back.) <br /> <br /> In addition, it's a nasty story. But it should be worth watching if you like movies like "Chopping Mall". Yes, I can see as well.
