Laughing a lot - because it's terrible - people who are sorry, but of course it's one of the worst movies I've seen ... I know it's a low budget However: Actors behave like playing in soap. Absolutely crappy, and the last time I saw that strange image was in the trash at the Youth Video Festival ten years ago. I was really grateful that people gathered and filmed cheap movies. But at least there should be a certain amount of quality But at least one thing is good: the first three minutes of the movie are quiet and interesting and okay - and the score is worth listening to. Many DVD cover contracts. But that is the best thing for this movie ...
