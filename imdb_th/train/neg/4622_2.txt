It is not surprising that this movie never saw the light of day. The time of the launch was terrible. The show was "Jumping Shark" when the movie came out. Who would pay to see a few censored clips from the original show? And the show clip is a little of a 90-minute pathetic whining by Chuck Barris about the hardships of his life in hosting the show. Did he expect us to feel really sorry for him and the messy millionaire's life? Does he really think we want to know about his life? (Obviously, after that, he wrote a strange autobiography about his career as a CIA agency). He thought that having everyone, everyone, his audition would remain fresh for 90. minute? Or the network administrators chase him every time? This may be used as a sitcom plot for 30 minutes, but not full-length movies. However, it is good to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene and Unknown Comic again (although making the movie "spicy", they also include his most vulgar routines) and while others point out this. Is an important part of Phil Hartman's first film (although it only takes a few minutes). Please note that his name is spelled HARTMANN in the credit, which is the name he was born with You can't miss his voice and facial expressions even though he is thinner and younger in the SNL. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) has his first small part after leaving the soap world.
