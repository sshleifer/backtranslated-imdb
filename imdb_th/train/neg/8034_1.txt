I know that slaughterers are often not good. But come here, what is it like? It's like having a 10 year old boy who collects money for their lunch and starts filming at the end of the week. <br /> <br> Anyway, six young people all go. At the same house to be killed outside the screen, we have other clever brains. The black man, the guy who dressed like that, after being eaten by one. All other shaking boats were stalked by some men who had masked the people at the rejected box. There was a good murder somewhere in the middle. But then it went back to boredom. Actually, we knew it couldn't be a killer when someone was attacked because the loved ones liked to spend his sweet time for everything. <Br / > <br /> After every character you expect to die And soon she will become a girlfriend, eventually being arrested by the murderer (They like pushing down and fading) and the killer reveals himself. I think the writers of this movie just put on their blindfolds and pens and put them in the list of characters. Motivation is just a lame and doesn't start my secrets. Too much time to explain everything. (Then, about ten minutes, which he added to his arms for some reason) and eventually got dominated by men with guns, he was not fair. <br /> <br /> Actually, one of the most horrible movies that I've seen I can enjoy myself more by watching Lindsay Lohan's movies. I swear. I mean, most 80 slashers suck as well. But at least they throw T & A. This movie Nothing to go
