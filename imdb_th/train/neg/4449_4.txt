"Sleeping With the Enemy" is predictable 'There before,' a thriller that doesn't seem to find any inspiration, no matter what the actors and the team are trying to do. I can't believe that many of my friends talked to me when I saw this in the movie sixteen years ago. <br /> <br /> The lack of integrity in the creation of the Ronaldinus bass Did not help or the direction of Joseph Ruben or the average performance from Julia Roberts Supporting actors, including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson, do a little to help <br /> <br /> Not many people speak. Just miss it. <br /> <br /> Sunday 14 April 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center Melbourne
