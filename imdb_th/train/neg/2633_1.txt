I saw this movie trailer many times at the theater and I was excited. It looks like a classic thriller action movie like a scene that happened in the 1990s. It reminds me of the movie The Cat Refugee and the Chase between Douglas and Sutherland. However, The Sentinel is an action movie The most exciting time ever As I saw, many people say that this is like a TV movie. Certainly not. First, there are many better TV movies in this category. Secondly, TV movies may be very fun sometimes. But this movie is contrary to having a good time It's not stylish at all, and most importantly, the sound of the movie isn't attractive. This is not an action movie. There are two action scenes, including chase and clash. They are not a great action scene. But worse, the action scenes do not taste like movies, both Douglas and Bassinger's love affair is not very necessary. In addition, the presidential assassination plan is also the most ancient story in this category as well. But they insisted on that And this is not a cat and mouse movie as it should be Although Douglas is now very old But he still has the potential to perform in action movies In the movie, Michael Douglas can't be like Tommy Lee Jones. Sutherland is the wrong choice because you feel as if you watch Jack Bauer and its characters are one of the reasons that make movies like Eva Longoria Parker's TV movie. Surprisingly, of course, that she is inert. In this movie because she is a TV actress This movie was not even fun for a second, so I couldn't get through for a while.
