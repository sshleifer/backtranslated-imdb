For the first two seasons, I think The Apprentice is an interesting and exciting program. The combination of reality TV and a 16-week job interview is an innovation and the producers can manage the show to meet their needs and not "Go out there" <br /> <br /> New season 6 Nothing more. More than a great joke and nothing related to business at all. In the previous season, they used to focus on more business-related jobs. Now, most of the interest is in the meeting room, where contestants expect to do everything to show them. (That means lying, back stabbing, etc.) The boardroom can provide entertainment to watch. But it's entertainment at a low point - sometimes you wonder if you're watching the old episode of the old Jerry Springer episode. The work in the show is boring and mostly a trade show for companies that are stupid enough to pay for their publicity. NBC And what is the agreement about half of the contestants living in the tent in season 6? That is just a normal idiot and nothing to do with business in real life. <br /> <br /> I don't respect any contestants this season. They all seem to be an idiot to me. In the previous season, at least some contestants were slightly honest. Now it seems that the contestants will kill their mothers to show them. It seems that Donald Trump's great ego is getting bigger and bigger for every passing season and with honesty I can't see why people with common sense want to work for him. His reasoning in most meeting rooms did not make sense at all, and sometimes it seemed that he liked to leave people with what it was worth. <br /> <br /> RIP, the trainee, please NBC for God's sake. Broadcast program as soon as possible It's too embarrassing to watch The Apprentice once was a great TV program. But now it's a big joke.
