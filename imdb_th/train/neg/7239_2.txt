This film has been advertised as a romantic romantic movie. It's not wise or romantic and of course not a powerful comedy. The fate of the characters that are meaningful but pathetic "Tom" swinging from a disgraceful disaster to another place. The elegance of the only saving is the performance that is capable of Toni Collete and how often we see Paltrow's satisfactory face.
