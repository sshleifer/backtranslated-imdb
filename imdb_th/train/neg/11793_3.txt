Deep Shock plays the TV movie: Commercial quality actors, low-quality designers will be "bad guys" and scripts that are full of technical and political jargon, more important than knowing what to do. With <br /> <br /> I went to watch this movie because of life. (I like to see what filmmakers have thought of in their designs in these cheap made videos) and as soon as the bat I'm disappointed because Life in the box is not something that is in the movie. The actor I expected because it was the type of movie (Actually, quite plain and not thinking of going through one point) The song is a melodious, unusual, unimaginable action. <br /> <br /> I like the design of computers and technical equipment. With sub-designs, this film is very fluid, with a navigation screen telling you what scene you are watching the story unfolds. But there are not many stories here. <br /> <br /> This film gets 3 / IMO 10 stars, boring searches and destructive missions to explode the North Pole and these creatures protect it. .. Even lamer is a love-tag relationship between the two characters that you don't see. Chalk this movie into a movie that tries to get professional actors out of the throne and become a video. Don't bother.
