This may be an entertaining movie. But it's ranked with other songs such as Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the food chain in the cinema. If they were quibble at this cheek, it might be an entertaining movie like Re-Animator or Dead ALive, but Juan Ponze Simon played it on the cheek. But in a straightforward spot. <br /> <br /> The location of the film is a small community surrounded by mutant slugs. There are abandoned toxic waste near the sewers, which make slugs become aggressive space animals - even if they are slow-moving animals and can be banned under your boots. Health inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only people who are willing to fight slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy Climax is an uproar, laughing - unintentionally - which makes you scratch the head that is a foolish situation. How stupid (actors and screenwriters) <br /> <br /> Story: $$ (No new floor The scene here appears that Simon will play the tongue-in-cheek blood element. But the dialogue is straightforward if Simon works with a smart script - someone with one torpedo character and various strange characters may be a cult movie) br /> <br /> Violence: $$$ (You won't Being attenuated here, we received a lot of explosions, chest scenes and a big head explosion in a fine Italian restaurant, blood and guts. Many horror watchers enjoy swinging here. You also receive the bodies of those who have been cleaned with slugs and many wonderful scenes. <br /> <br /> Performances: $ (Wow! Michael Garfield seems to know that this script is a musty character, and he sends his chapter with facial expressions, which shows that he knows the unusual way to create this movie. Effort is Kim Terry, as his wife, works adequately, even though she is doing a little bit too much. "Every teenager" is an awesome actor - no exception. Men, this movie may use Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) <br /> <br /> Nude pictures: $$ (Two naughty teens on the bed before they are sent - in a bad scene - by Group of slugs Crawling into the bedroom of both male and female girls here)
