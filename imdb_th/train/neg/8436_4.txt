David Mamet is a very interesting and unequal director. His first movie, 'House of Games', is the movie I like the most, and put the movie series with characters whose perspective of life changes when they fall into a complex situation and the perspective of the audience. <Br /> <br> So 'Homicide', which from the name, tries to define the viewers' thoughts as normal crime plays The main character is two policemen, one Jew and one Irishman who handles ethnic areas. The killing of an old Jewish shopkeeper who proved to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli War of Independence caused the Jewish identity in the heart and heart of the Jewish detective. With more clarity The process of awakening is staging and hard to believe. The group of Jewish terrorists is opera and the way the detective eventually walks to the final intense confrontation is pathetic. The end of this movie is Mamet, like a smart but frustrated man from an emotional point of view. <br /> <br /> Joe Mantegna and William Macy give a strong performance. But the shortcomings of this matter are too clear to compensate.
