Let's start by saying "JAWANI DIWANI" is just a pathetic movie. I agree with the last person who said "I miss Joyride". Haha. <br /> <br /> The jokes are terrible. The performances are average. There is something wrong with this movie. Emraan deserves a better thing. Totally, all CELINA JAITLEY has revealed. Hrishitta bhatt is ok. Emraan hashmi can be used as well. Desperate who wants to be famous So he used RADHA and pretended that he loved her just because her father was a music director and could help him become famous. (Since his father obeyed everything the daughter said) one day, Mann and his friends went to Goa for fun. There he met ROMA (CELINA JAITLEY) and fell in love with her completely and tried to flirt with BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> That night, ROMA couldn't open the door of her room and MANN decided to help her. When he saw that he couldn't do it, ROMA went to ask for help. While she was missing, Mann could open the door and decided to come inside and sit in her bed. BLA BLA BLA ROMA came in and had one night stand. However, one night, ROMA fell in love with him. That morning they saw the mafia who didn't see anyone. Don loved ROMA and couldn't stand what he saw. He ordered them to marry and be shocked. Mann obeyed the commands and ROMA of Merry. Then the news of their marriage ended in the newspaper. After that Mann found that he loved ROMA after making music videos together. He is now stuck between love and fame. BLA BLA BLA <br /> <br /> This movie is awesome. The song "SINI NE SINI NE" is great. The remixed version is better than "DIL DIWANA". It's also great. The title song is also great. Men avoid watching this movie.
