The Hills Have Eyes II is what you expect to be and nothing else is left. Of course, it's not the movie that has been nominated for an Oscar. It's just pure entertainment that you can spend 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The story is about a group of National Guardians. Who find themselves fighting On the last day of training in the desert They fought throughout the story, which included a lot of violence. (Which is generally the film) because of the blood and courage that circulated throughout the image and also the rape scene that was thrown away <br /> <br /> I will give the hill two eyes, 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment. Although I find myself looking at my watch more and more as the movie begins, because it starts to drag due to the fact that it still tries to shock and shock the audience with graphics and jumping scenes. Occasionally, to ensure that the audience Always awake. The Hills Have Eyes II is just great entertainment, something that will pass the time if you are bored and nothing else. <br /> <br /> 4/10
