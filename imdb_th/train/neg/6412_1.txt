I just came back from this movie and I was totally shocked. This movie is absolutely ridiculous to all humanity. The theater I live in may have 4 other people. This movie introduces me and I can't believe that this person likes it. I can't believe that a man with consciousness will like it. No plot, no plot at all. It was a joke. How do you make a movie about? This movie shows why Hollywood is in turmoil. I can only look at the spiral of the industry. "Horror movies" and giggles It's a mimic of every movie. This is true for "Teen horror movie" Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw. It's all trash. Not supported by this hogwash!
