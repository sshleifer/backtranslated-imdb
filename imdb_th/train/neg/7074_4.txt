My God, this movie is very boring. I am a big fan of Gina Gershon. When I rent this movie, I expect to be a romantic drama and a great performance from Gershon Gershon is great. But she is not the right actor for this role. She is too good for Rade Serbedzija. The love between the characters of Gershon and Serbedzija is not too reliable. And I absolutely hate the character of Serbedzija (the award-winning organizer). He's not charming in the movie. Dr. Loren Graham is not beyond my understanding. Maybe Sean Connery, Robert De Niro or Harrison Ford will perform better in this chapter. No matter how, I was tired of doing this movie. If you are looking for a good Gina Gershon movie, check out her best movie Bound. If you are looking for a romantic movie about a young woman and an old man, try watching Harrison Ford's movie or Sean Connery. Gina Gershon insults and she deserves a better chance. I hope you can choose better in the future.
