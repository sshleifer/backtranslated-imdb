I made a special effort to watch this movie and was disappointed with the results. On paper, the script seems to have hope and the cast that left with hope - I like Pacino in Scent of a Woman and see Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in many French films. But I forgot how important the dialogue is in the movie and in this movie ..... trash! The filming location is also charming. But the hopeless dialogue was hypocritical and forced to pull all things to a level below zero In addition, I lost the world of racing and didn't care about this sport. Even the unimportant dialogue in "Love Story" is still better than the dialogue in this movie. I expect to get better from this movie and feel very disappointed to receive many disappointments.
