My boyfriend used to play the game The Zombie Chronicles as a joke. We didn't realize the little joke that she paid 1 pound for it. While watching this movie, I started to do more with what I wanted to do than watch The Zombie Chronicles. These include: <br /> <br /> 1) Drinking bleach 2) Rubbing Sand in my eyes 3) Writing letters to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) American Civil War declaration again 5) Tax return 6) Math GCSE 7) Sex with old women <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy aka Sgt Ben Draper wrote this? The guy can't dig the hole properly. The best thing he did was kick the door down. (The best part of this movie) This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I've seen White Noise: The Light. The movie has never had many errors in it. My girlfriend left here, so now I'm with the shame of owning this shit. <br /> <br /> News in: Owen Wilson watching this movie and trying to commit suicide. The truth <br /> <br /> Don't watch
