See No. 1 on 18/18/2009 ?? 2 out of 10 (Dir-Pete Riski): A movie about a strange psychopath about a woman with autism who is being tested in a hospital. Then hell broke I'm not sure what the filmmakers' intent in this story is. What we received in 1 and a half hours (at least not long) is a distorted horror / twilight movie / zombie / ghost movie that ends with a feeling that doesn't feel anything at all. Initially after the power had gone, everyone disappeared in the hospital, except for small groups, including women and fathers. There are generally annoying characters, creepy old men and common men who have a habit of many scarefests, and of course the girls that the main characters receive attention. Things start to happen at different times, such as ghosts and A monster that appears when it is stopped and people die because this small group tries to escape what they are. Of course, the autistic girl is the center of everything and Day Hated that they used the suffering of this girl very much and was provoked that she was the cause and put it in the hospital where people were weakly cared for. We have never found an answer for what really happened, which is very strange, so please avoid this dog. If you don't want to be crawled and confused for an hour and a half, this isn't ideal for you or the movie audience. It's a waste of time !!
