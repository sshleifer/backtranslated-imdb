This is a very scary movie. The only reason you want to sit and see is the order of Miss Eleni Nak. The pain that occurred with Mr McNamara, which became embarrassing at times, also destroyed what might be a sensible movie. If the right actor, Mr McNamara, is not Tom Cruise, the actor he wants to be.
