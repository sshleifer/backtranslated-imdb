It was 1974 and received the star Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> Only one person would expect anything from this movie. <br /> <br /> And it's a movie. From this film, Slovik has revamped, has good women and doesn't want to fight. <br /> <br /> In real life, Slovik may be innocent, innocent, or he may want to manage the system. <br /> <br /> Who Which Slovik had or never had a decision history But this is a movie that handles desserts at a time when a country questions why it is fighting. <br /> <br /> Regardless of servicemen living in Vietnam in 1974 (as Willie Nelson will tell Saying the truth about Vietnam War, not WWII) EoES is propaganda as Gung Ho in the forties. <br /> <br /> According to the film, Slovik identifies his position as simple and simple. He had a nervous problem. Heck, I had clinical symptoms and trusted me. If I had served the military, there would be no problem for me to let my nerves go and fail in my job and be demoted or put on. The duty KP or latrine without problems <br /> <br /> If we believe that teleflick, Slovik has no choice, no doubt is due to his criminal history. <br /> <br /> No matter the audience. Will want to believe However, each Depending on the audience I learned that movies from this decade or decade related to government service or military service will use the same gestures repeatedly. <br /> <br /> 1940 and 1950 serve your country. <> /> 1960 and 1970. Laugh at your country. <br /> <br /> This is history. <br /> <br /> The whole movie looks like Hollywood guessing me. He refused to serve, and when he was bound to be executed, he would show emotions. <br /> <br /> Such emotional eruptions can be easily worked for his benefit in announcing his nervous condition. The movie wants to show him that he is a human being and when he is dying he will be sad. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Catholic. But I think the lecture of Mary Hail by Ned Betty and The shadow at the end, along with the Lord's prayer, is funny, as if they were trying to see who could speak faster. <br /> <br /> I didn't see that the film could be watched without knowing. it is Aimed at Tricky Dick Nixon and the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> I hope it's worth it for Slovik and everyone who chooses to follow his example.
