Critics talk about this death when it is not really great. Of course, "CHAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are the same movie with suspicion, but I find "Chaos" more fun because it's a game. As fast as the movie "Nak", the reason that the film became more popular was because it was released in America and "Chaos" aired around the world at various film and theater festivals. Prof But not yet found distributors in the UK and the United States. <br /> <br /> It is true that the film has a tribute to many classic movies such as DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee movies. That doesn't mean it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> See if there's nothing on the TV, but you might get bored after a while.
