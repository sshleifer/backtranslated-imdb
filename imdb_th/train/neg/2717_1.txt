Do we need narcissism in the Baby Boomer? Technically, I am a Boomer, but as "the ideal child" of the 1960s, everyone is reading Marxism, burning figures, cards, and in general, protracted wars which destroy tens of thousands of lives I'm still in grade But I can remember them well and 9 out of 10 people are just foolish people who can believe anything as long as it is devastating. <br /> <br /> This is just another important exercise in itself from children. Grow.
