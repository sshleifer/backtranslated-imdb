Before I started I _love_ Eddie Izzard I thought he was one of the most fun stand-ups today. It is possible that I am doing this with too high expectations, but I do not find Eddie funny in this outing. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is Eddie trying hard to As Eddie, everyone knows that he is a completely unrelated cartoon and we all love him, but in Circle, he doesn't seem to be more involved in jokes and makes me fall into place. Many of the topics that he mentioned earlier he mentioned - I think I remember the reused jokes there. <br /> <br /> If you buy a DVD, you will see the background of Eddie's tour.
