I didn't enjoy this movie. I think acting is not good and the story is boring. Is the old computer 20 years old, saving all day? I think this is a little far away, even with movies. I can't figure out why they can't close. Why not take a big hammer to find it? <br /> <br /> It's a shame. But after the original movie from the 80s you expected The actual delivery This movie may be an old movie in the 21st century, but not if that's what you want to see. Don't watch this movie! <br /> <br /> Although the old computer won't open to save time But in my opinion, it still flicked as before ..
