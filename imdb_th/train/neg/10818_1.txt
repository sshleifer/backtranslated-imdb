When reading the novel before watching this movie, I was very disappointed with the wooden performances and the arrogance of the producers in the story that didn't care about this. I feel that this film does not reflect the brilliance of Bronte's work and gives the feeling of a shallow love story. In the short period of the film, it took 2 hours. The film lost many of its main features, which made the book understand and progressed. There was no romance between Rochester and Jane Eyair. Seems to be quite suddenly and without information, since both characters have infrequent interactions, such as you can't help This is the injustice of Bronte's novels. You are not impressed with Jane's strange cheek and courage, which attracts Rochester. Find her and his arrogance that attracts Jane to him. <br /> <br /> Even The script is bad. The few characters that were best conveyed were Mr. Fairfax and Grace Poole. However, overall production was poor. If giving a better script, maybe the movie may be more successful than watching "Jane Eyre" (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for excellent production.
