I like the first movie But here's a sample textbook of the sequel that should be left on the drawing board better. The general concept in the first film is that if it is not good, at least it's very interesting. The sequel of this story is trying to create ideas and characters from the first movie, and although Christopher Walken is still as good as Gabriel, but the whole idea is a little laugh If you haven't watched these movies, then pick up the first movie and forget about the sequels, they can eliminate all the happiness from the original.
