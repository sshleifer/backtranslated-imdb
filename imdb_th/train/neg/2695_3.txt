When I go out to a video store to rent flicks, I tend to believe IMDb's views in movies and until this story has never been seen at 7.0 or higher on websites that I don't like. <br /> <br / > Sidney Lumet, the legendary director of the best movies of the 20th century, was wrong here by making the biggest mistake that movie directors could do: fill the characters of the characters with different characters. Go without any real redemption features.> <br /> I like movies with defective characters. But no matter how dark the person's personality is, we have light in it. We all have shades of gray that are darker or brighter than others. Mr. Lumet stepped on this line by filling the characters in This movie with a black, sympathetic and almost insidious character. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke's hank is a 30-year-old, immature and irresponsible child. The wife who hates him and the daughter who thinks he is a loser, which he is very much His uncertainty and willingness to let others work dirty for him because he was too cowardly to do it himself, leading to a failed bank robbery plan and the mother was killed. By the time he stood up with his brother at the end of the movie, it was poorer than elevated. Ethan Hawk plays well as a character. But did not receive much because he showed that he had a boot on his face all the time and he didn't care that it was there. <br /> <br /> Speaking That the wife of his character is not as good Almost every shot of this film that she did was speaking, renting and raising money, raising children and crushing self-esteem that didn't exist by themselves. Seriously, that's just about all the characters. Behaviors similar to her big harp cause evil. <br /> <br /> Albert Finnie plays Charles's father and while Mr. Finney is an actor Excellent for decades. He spent about 90% of this film. Opened a grimace as if he was suffering the worst constipation in the world For someone who has been an actor for as long as Phinee, you think he has the ability to show more emotions Although he didn't show much But his character is sad and sad And when he was Terry, Andy, according to the conclusion of the movie, it was like Dr. Frankenstein, who brought monsters to help him create his own misery. <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomi didn't have much involvement with her character. Stuck with an unhappy marriage to Andy and a relationship with his brother for unintended reasons. When Andy's world began to spin unreasonably, she jumped on the boat reasonably. But actually it doesn't make her selfish or serve herself less than other characters in the movie, but it may be the least common sense. Br /> <br /> And finally we come to Andy, who receives The great screenplay by Philip Seymour Hoffman is the only reason I rate this movie as 3 instead of 1, his performance about heroin addicts who embezzled the "perfect crime" of robbery. The jewelry, the insurer's parent is so distorted was mesmerizing. His descent from a person who controls the peace of the plan that is flawed to insecurity, madness in killing people is believable and sad. Hoffman's character became the main villain of this film. But it is difficult to take root with him because the choice is a little brother who has mood swings and the father whose parents accept themselves in the early days eventually lead to psychosis. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie is worthwhile to watch PSH's great performances. Don't expect to have characters that should be worth cheering because there is no
