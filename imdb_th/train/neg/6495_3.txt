I rented this film on the merits of the examples shown and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> If Jackson Pollack collaborates with David Lynch and Timothy Leary to create a movie. Like it makes the LSD journey seem like a part of Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> It's a set of scenes that the characters project in and out of reality. Or various reality, and this film doesn't have any effect until the last 5 minutes which makes it feel instantly I wrote a nasty review on a movie review blog that gave everything a go and I wouldn't do it here. It's a well-made movie and soundtrack written by Sir Anthony Hopkins and let me say this. If there is one feature in exchange for this movie, it's a song that fits perfectly. Some dialogues are very good and bad. Unbelievably at the same time. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy some parts of this movie. I really do and when you reach the end. Find out what really happened. It's an unfortunate thing that you have to wade through a 2-hour frenzy to get to the important point, which reduces the impact of the entire movie. The real problem of this movie is not acting. But everything
