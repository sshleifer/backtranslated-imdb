I saw what the director tried to do. But he missed the mark The main actor is very good. But his revision of the time period caused you to leave The work of the camera, such as light and exposer, is an amateur, which I can forgive if the direction is more maneuverable, but that doesn't sound a bit and that will take you out of the movie I can see that this director did a little better in the future, so it's not correct. But don't expect that dv movies will be as good as 28 days later or whatever makes your expectations lower and you get more. It's at least half an hour. Oh yes, and others who are acting leaders are quite bad if you ask me. But I am a head high in the movie to get something worthwhile.
