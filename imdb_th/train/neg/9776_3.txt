I don't really know about making movies. But good movies have to tell some stories ... Your character must start and finish the journey. They may leave in the final exit to Brooklyn. But not in a satisfactory way, and I do not mean a happy ending, just at the end. <br /> <br /> The final exit to Brooklyn Brutal labor produces a number of moving topics. Most of them involve some of the most different characters that have walked through the movie screen. But the final solution to Brooklyn failed to bring these stories to any conclusion ... It caused some of them to hang back and forth without an end or burst into the strange atmosphere for the episode. <br /> <br /> Two "art" ends. And they have spoilers. <br /> <br /> Sad toot characters. (The main character in the movie) was hit by a car and killed. And that was for him in the movie .... He went well, removed from the memory of everyone .. There was no reaction from his friend, enemy, lover .... Nothing. <br /> <br /> In Another topic, the stupid, naive and hidden gay strike leader, was rejected by his homosexual workers and discovered by gangsters around the house by gangsters. The end of the dance scene shows Brooklyn streets and lights that are very similar to Nazi concentration camps ... and that scene is dragged on ... and the camera turns to the body. of Head of labor and he was crucified ..... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez And of course, it's for him as well .... The deletion of the brain ..... already <br /> <br /> The bottom line .... No matter what the first commenter said in the first year 1989 about this movie .... This movie is a slumping piece of sediment. Avoid it. And if you are not warned in advance, it should be rated NC-17 for a tremendous amount of physical, emotional, and sexual cruelty ... Don't let the teen watch
