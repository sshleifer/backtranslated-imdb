I can't believe that people think that the stink of stinking garbage is a joke. Moving effort with humor amidst cruelty, disgust and stupidity 'There is something about Mary.' There is little reason to continue until the end. Of course, Cameron Diaz is very cute. But that's not enough to record movies. Ben Stiller tries hard to work in the story and is clearly very talented. But this movie is a loser. <br /> <br /> There has never been any scene, the schedule is not well defined and the frame is not good. What they are doing, so I know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; The bonus comes from the one time I smile. Not that I have humor or being alone in my mind. My wife also hates The next day we saw 'Rush hour' and laugh at us This movie is puzzled.
