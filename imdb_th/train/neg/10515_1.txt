This is a slasher movie. "Go straight to the bathroom." In general, a long story, a group of teenagers / adults begin to be caught in the middle of a creepy forest and have been hacked by a demon. This slasher comes from: <br /> <br /> - Distinguished women, -teens or young adults who are left in a terrible place, - the last scene of death. The survivors of a well-built young woman who often expresses her diaphragm But never diminishing - a creepy madman who knows about the evil - lesbian kissing scene <br /> At that time, for a magical movie, it was really scary. The atmosphere is dead. Nothing, even the clear scenes and nudity of sex, is enough to appeal to both male and female lesbian viewers. Looks like it feels like being seen with a disgusting head of nasty head or a cold cold. <br /> <br /> Let the devils ..... 0/10
