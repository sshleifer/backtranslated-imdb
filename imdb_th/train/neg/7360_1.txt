This is one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. Especially due to the fact of uncertainty (For example, a clear representative who posed as a bank loan officer, while clearly he was talking to someone through a wire or scene that scientists thought it was safe to enter the room The virus has been released though. 'Can't find a working host.' Does not mean that I can't find one.) The cheap set (the bank looks like it's badly created like a dungeon) and bad performances. It is the story of an established criminal group that succeeded in successfully stealing a virus capsule that caused death. However, the chief honcho, who decided to remove it from the bank deposit box, did so at the same time that the bank robbed, while the same FBI agent was notified of this and at the same time a serious earthquake occurred. That the consequences of the vibration will be more chaotic in many ways However, the results were not created for fascinating action movies. But is a film that has received z grade junk since the beginning of the movie (This may be why some parts of the screen capture images on the packaging that are created with computer graphics instead of the actual screen shots from different scenes of the movie.) What Ron Perlman is doing in this story, I don't know. I wonder if he is embarrassed to be in it or not.
