I have to admit that there are a few books that have related movies that I actually read before seeing the adjustment in the cinema. Ninety-eighteen fourteen occur as one of those rare cases. This book is great. It's immersive and interesting predictions. But the movie is just plain sucking It's the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I didn't close after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching movies was only half of the two-story homework. It's dark and weird But did not do anything to get the right atmosphere The performance is nothing higher than the average, and considering the fact that there are not many, it is very disappointing. For example, the book didn't make me feel that Winston couldn't blur more than a single syllable each time. Movies that are boring, disturbing, and not visually appealing make the movie a book that makes the whole book a disadvantage. Wait ... Isn't it English?
