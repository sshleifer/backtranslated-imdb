Previously, things created for television movies began. I had relatively low expectations. That is because it was created after the last episode of the broadcast series and the original series disappeared. No President Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta. If you remember the second episode to the last episode of every series, except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley, leaving B-5 permanently. Now for this movie, they bring Garibaldi back (which is not in the movie B-5) to join Zack and Captain and the Doctor, making the image short and irrelevant. But because the old chemistry has gone a lot, this film is severely handicapped. <br /> <br /> This film is about Soul Hunter (Martin Sheen) leading to Babylon 5 to find a world full of The spirit that was stolen from the archives hidden by archaeologists (Ian McShane) has many terrifying mumbo-jumbo occurrences.

(Like myself), others who saw that it might be considered the series to be sucked, which is a great injustice This is a good example of a performance that doesn't know when to quit.
