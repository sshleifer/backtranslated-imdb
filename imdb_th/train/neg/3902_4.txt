This is the modification of the gods in Jane Austen's novel. Compared to the US version with Guinneth Paltrow, the script is written to be similar to most books. But the performance was terrible In addition to Kate Beckinsale, who I believe is Emma's true image in the book, other actors are trying too hard. Mark Strong is not a "gentleman" that he should be. He's always rude and aggressive, doesn't have any feelings and throughout the movie, you can't see his love of "growing" for Emma. This has a bad effect on Kate Beckinsale, who seems to be trying to "resist" her leading role and her partner Moreover, there is no chemistry between all the actors. Hariett Smith, played by Samantha Morton, seems to have no real affiliation with Mr. Elton by Dominic Rowan. The movie's settings are too bad too. Very much I would imagine Emma Woodhouse to dress in a more modern and elegant way than she did here. The ending is too long. It is good that it is similar to the end of the book. But it is the killer's ending for the movie And again, I do not see the feeling of happiness when confronted with Mr.Knightley. In conclusion, I believe that this modification will be honest with the book. But with poor actors It seems that this movie was created without a budget at all. I would like to see the version "Fade" with Paltrow and Northam, although it is clear that it was made "Blockbuster" rather than watching these actors (except for good Olivia Williams and Kate Beckinsale better) destroy all the scripts.
