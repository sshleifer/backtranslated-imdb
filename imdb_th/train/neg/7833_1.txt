I just saw the third week of the mini-series Nightmare Story and Dreamscapes of Stephen Kings; Meaning, I saw Episode 6. I have to say that the story is really weak. I read Stephen King's Skeleton Crew, which is a collection of his short stories that have been published in the past. I remember that most of the stories are average to the poor. But there is one thing that is really wonderful, if not outstanding. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to say is because this mini series comes from the collection of The story from Stephen King does not mean that it is good. In fact, if his previous collection of short stories has any indication, most of this mini-series will be at medium to low levels. <br /> <br /> In Stephen's defense King, I didn't read the new short story. Maybe they are good stories in books and cannot be easily adapted to television or may be the fault of a playwright trying to write an interesting chapter. Who knows. In addition, these short stories may be Created for this particular mini-series and not for printing Maybe that's a problem. If Stephen King sends these shit to the editor, I'm sure the editor will tell him immediately to make it more interesting because as it is boring. <br /> <br /> The obvious thing from all. This is a problem with stories / scripts and not actors and actors, because this mini-series has great people to do. <br /> <br /> Seeing this mini-series makes I appreciate those "Twilight Zone" series. Each series is only half an hour. But it is interesting and sensational I don't understand why this mini-series can't do something similar. I'm sure this mini-series has a lot of money to create a good mini series. Unfortunately, some things do not click at all. <br /> <br /> For example, this week has two episodes. The first one relates to the horror story writer who bought paintings from suicidal artists. The author began to see changes in the picture while he was driving home. He felt uneasy. He left the painting. But it appeared near him. In addition, the person's image in the picture was killing people and killing him. (I'm not going to talk about the second part of this week about criminals and plunder because it's even more boring now!) <br /> <br /> This evidence is interesting and the story should be good. But after seeing I was discouraged because there was too much space in the story, including the content from the outside that showed nothing. After the last scene, I was left to have more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> I tried for 3 weeks to enter this mini-series. But it is too annoying because the story / script is not good. If this is a movie, I would suggest that people wait for the movie to come out via cable or I won't even recommend renting your video store. However, since this is a TNT cable channel, I would say that if you haven't seen it, try using it for a week. If you don't like it that week, you won't like the previous series or the future because they all have the same boring style.
