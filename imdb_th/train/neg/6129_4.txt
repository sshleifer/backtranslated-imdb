Considering the film and THE STRONG MAN that same year, I wouldn't put Harry Langdon on the list of great screen comedians. There is not enough Maybe he is developing his style But sabotaged himself with his first big success too seriously No matter in any case, all his tricks are reminiscent of the bigger jokes. But he lacked Keaton's acrobatic skills and Lloyd's great intelligence. He also undermined his personality by dressing and walking like Chaplin's homeless character. His trademark is innocent, innocent, cowardly, and tends to respond to the devastation by baffling his eyes or touching his lips with the tip of the index finger. The humor in Langdon's movie is the result of a fate that caused many obstacles in his path, which he tried to overcome in an innocent or innocent way or at least physical condition, such as throwing stones in a tornado. Two or four - Dodge the stone by lifting the legs so that they roll under him. In this regard, about the son of a shoemaker who participated in the competition, walked across the country to publish the shoes of rival companies. He was able to overcome with good luck. There is nothing that is not better than Big Three.
