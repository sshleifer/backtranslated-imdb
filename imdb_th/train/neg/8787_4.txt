I heard the first White Noise when I saw a TV ad. Before that I didn't even know that it actually existed. I watched an online preview and decided to go and watch. Now, as a fan of movies like The Sixth Sense, I think this movie will give everything I need. It has Michael Keaton in there and he throws. Unfortunately, the film didn't deliver. It tries to be a Sixth Sense or another Stir of Echoes and fails miserably. It has a very bright starting point. But in the middle just drag yourself over and over again and end up with a completely poor twist. Unfortunately, most of the "scary" movies today require a loud and loud sound to make the audience jump up. This movie is probably more than this. It's a shame because it's a good idea.
