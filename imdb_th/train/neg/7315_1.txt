Fall to the right point We have five past college graduates. (Must have a doctorate in word F) Go out for a weekend camp. They ran into people who needed help. But instead of trying to help him, they decided to put him on the fire instead of the good people. However, it seems that the neighbors are ok. Oh well, when things are really bad, they lock one of their companions instead of asking for help. (Try neighbors) Some villagers do not like them. They chase at high speed, running through the forest for many miles until the car crashes. After ten minutes, he appeared in the cabin. (How can he find it and how he will travel at the speed of light to get there This bomb Then he decided the next day to return to the cabin, believing that he must be a certain shrine. He trembled with the relief he had survived. (He had to think that it was a 24-hour insect). Unfortunately, he met an unfriendly police officer. The other couple decided to have sex while Buck eats the magic. The woman then realizes that she wants to shave her legs. (Eat a lot of shaving cream) However, you get the idea. Nothing suitable here. This is the five people I don't want to be friends with. I'm rooting for bacteria that eat meat. Other characters have been suggested that are quite fun. But very different as well Good life ninety minutes wasted
