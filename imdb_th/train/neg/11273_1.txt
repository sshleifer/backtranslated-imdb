How do you gather this respected British young actor into a manure pile? Scary scripts, annoying annoying cameras, horrible fixes. Rhys Ifans only tried to fulfill his role with life. Another painful evidence that "different" is sometimes equal to "shipwreck". Why do people not read the script in advance? Do things like: Do yourself well and do other things - such as hitting a hammer to your knees. It's less painful and more fun than this movie!
