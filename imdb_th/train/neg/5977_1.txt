Wow. I can't even remember that it's about this movie, except that it's a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The plot in general. The girl's parents ignored her. So this PokeMon pretended to be her father. I am the only one who is disturbed by that? Then this strange PokeMon kidnapped Ash's mother to pretend to be a woman. I don't care whether he will try to make women happy or not. That's a bad thing. <br /> <br /> No real plot. The girl is just a boy who wants things in her own way. She plays with Unowns as Entei's "daughter" and is clearly able to grow and shrink in age with help from her "father". > <br /> That's what I remember. Think you can use it as a hint and not see it. (Or if you see it, don't expect anything much) 1 from 10 <br /> <br /> Seriously if you want a PokeMon movie for rent "PokeMon; the First Movie"
