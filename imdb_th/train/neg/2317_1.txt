The direction clearly states that the idea and plot of the film is completely original .... However, for those who read the comic 'slam dunk', we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and Still a joke ... <br >> <br /> The other note is that Jay Zhou doesn't know Kung Fu. It just doesn't impress anyone if he tries to do as he can. Today You can see the difference Fortunately, no film. I think Jay's performance is still a follow-up story, especially when almost everyone in this movie has improved a lot. The only reason I think why Jay is the main actor is for his popularity. <br /> <br /> Despite how difficult I want to stop anyone from watching this, so make this movie. There it has become one of the best budget movies in China for this year.
