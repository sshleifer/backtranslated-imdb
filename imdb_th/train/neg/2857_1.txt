I've seen many Sci-Fi Channel movies since I started watching them in 2002 (my first movie was Sabretooth - which is actually one of the more fun Sci-Fi Channel features in my opinion). Their differences Some people are normal, but appropriate (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Swamp Devil). Some are not as good as laughing and there is something really bad. Raptor Planet is in the back. <br /> <br / > Raptor Planet The sequel of the original Raptor Island Sci-Fi in 2004 is a movie that is rarely watched. Effects that make dinosaurs alive (The combination between puppet and animation, including CGI and videos from Raptor Planet) is the worst-looking effect I have ever seen in a low budget movie. The blood is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The story consists of a group of commandos for some reason. (I forgot why) Travel to the world of extraterrestrial dinosaurs. That is the right person. Dinosaurs are aliens. Dinosaurs in space What next shark in space?!? The remaining plot is simple. Male actors are chosen and eaten. By now we are expecting this story in many dinosaur and novel films that have been released. But this is the first killer dinosaur movie I have ever seen that I was bored with the dinosaur attack. <br /> <br /> There was a chuckle in there. Bitten by Carnotaur (create a stock image from the original movie) to give life to life, which later became a giant hunt In addition, this is a scene that Steven Baur filmed in his death scene from the first movie. <br /> <br /> While Raptor Island is not a good movie to start with, it is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Believe me when I say that this is probably the worst movie Syfy has ever aired.
