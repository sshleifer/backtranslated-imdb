I didn't expect much from this movie because there were people from Parkersburg WV that I live in in this movie. This city is boring and this movie is too. There are some good aura in this movie. But I felt frustrated with the important places they were talking about. This movie may be good if there is a real show, but there is nothing unless you come from Parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see every day. Then stay away from this movie. The conversation will make you sleep. The show will make you tears and Steven Soderberg should lose credibility after filming like this. It is a movie that can be predicted without surprises. What you see is what you get and a 73-minute tour of Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a speaker.
