I watched this movie, expecting it to be similar to The Matrix or Pi. I was wrong. Yes, there is a plot that is not well written and does not perform well in the movie. (With motion cells, CG and peptides at boot). However, the real focus of this film is the talking head. "Expert" that spreads out into a new era, giving a good feeling during the plot. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's an innocent star. In the beginning, there was a slight quantum physics. For example, it states that electrons have both particles and waves, and most atoms are empty spaces. However, the movie uses a big jump. (And according to science) by saying that sub-quantum effects of atoms occur in large scales as well The talking head has brought it further. As they say the following is true: <br /> <br /> - When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the natives could not see his boat because their minds could not see something different. Corrections can reduce the rate of murder - with positive thinking, you can walk on the water - your thoughts can change the formation of ice crystals in water bottles. <br /> <br /> And wait, that's just in 40. The first minute only. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie is a torture. This film feels like the movie they will let you join in the cult. After doing my homework, I knew that it was just that. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this may be seen as a funny comedy. (Although not a joke) <br /> <br /> Save your time and money: don't see this movie.
