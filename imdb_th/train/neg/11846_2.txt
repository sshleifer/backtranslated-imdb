After watching this movie, I complained to the local cinema about the quality of the audio track or the sound system of the cinema. At least the first half of this movie is very difficult to understand what everyone is saying because of the music of the 20s and the ferocity of the audio tracks. I'm ready to blame the equipment in the cinema. But otherwise - it's a director. <br /> <br /> I say that my complaint is an important part of making movies. Music and sound should be distorted to create extremely annoying effects in movies. Today, the director has to try many things to create a unique movie. Unfortunately, no matter where or how you see that movie, the votes will be the same. <br /> <br /> So apart from the historical inaccuracies of this movie (Which you can search for yourself elsewhere). Distortion music is in itself. There are good reasons to let this movie miss. You will hear only the distorted scratches of the audio track and not the cat's cat.
