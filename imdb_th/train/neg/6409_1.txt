I just watched this movie yesterday ... I don't want to believe the comments on this website. What gives more than one star must be a fan of Buffy. I am a big fan of the first order. But i know shit when i see it At every level, this movie is very scary. Technically, most of the time you don't know where you are in this movie, even in the same scene, it's going to jump POV like crazy without reason. There is no reason in terms of movies. The mood was cold for the sake of the cold and tried to make the psychological thrill when it was confused. Throwing a nasty red neck in your movie is an economical way to convey the "atmosphere". I lost patience long before the last performance. But I enjoy it with my friends who have made the MST3K riffs to close it. Since leaving Buffy, SMG has 2 successful movies. If even "Scooby Doo" in your resume can be counted, Gellar is a must But she (or her agent) is sure that she can't find a vehicle for her and Mr. Shepard. If you have trouble paying the mortgage, I'll send you a few dollars if you promise not to Prague. In another movie like this! (In addition, Patsy Cline's land should be sued for defamation!)
