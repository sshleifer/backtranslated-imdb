The animation is good, the image is good, even if it's not entirely original. But the story is too long, too confusing and beyond the truth After about an hour, I couldn't wait. With many characters that do not participate and plot elements from anywhere or go wherever the movie is not the only movie and should be a short series or two movies If you like this story, maybe you will like But frankly, I've been destroyed by more creative stories that actually have a message telling me to rent a Miyazaki film and watch it twice. You can benefit more from it.
