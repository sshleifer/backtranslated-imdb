I think this movie will be much better then it is It sounds like the disguise of the spies and the beginning of it reminds me of Pleasantvil. But this movie is very short. <br /> <br /> The story is nonsense. KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia have established a spy school to teach. Their spy how to behave like an American But the city that they were in there for training was quite outdated, so they grabbed two yanks from the US. I don't know, but this seems to be out. It would be strange when next to nobody in the Russian city, all speaking with a Russian accent. Some people are drunk at the casting job. <br /> <br /> In addition, for this comedy, dry with pain. There is one of the two popular funny spots and they have nothing to sing and dance about. This film will ultimately make you sleep. <br /> <br /> And as a twist on the face, this movie is a professional in the United States, making me feel bad. The movie continues to tell that America is God and Russia is a demon. This is a smash campaign made with Japan in World War 2. It's a movie like this that makes everyone think that the United States is full of self. <br /> <br /> This thing gets 4 out of 10 and I It should have been really good, but the dance scene is funny. But then again, it dragged far away, really funny.
