I am not particularly impressed with this film that has a lack of music and takes only 40 minutes. Thank God because I'm sleeping. I take advantage of part-time photography to show the time passed in the movement of light and shadow, people, water, clouds and more. Unfortunately, that's all it is. <br /> <br /> My passion is Wonderful ancestors Koyaanisqatsi made in 1983 at 87 minutes and to prove that the sequel may be better than the original Powaqqatsi made in 1988. It took 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Try both.
