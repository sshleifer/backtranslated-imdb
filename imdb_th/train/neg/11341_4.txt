In this way, the disaster that Fellini had worked all his life The dividing line between ridiculous masterpieces and the nonsense of the independent associations is very small and what the film category will eventually coexist often depends on the personal feeling that says "Casanova". Continued appreciation for the scene and soon Bukowski could not conclude sufficiently: <br /> <br /> "Casanova also died, only an old man with a big cock and The long tongue and no courage to say that he can live well is true. To say that I can spit on his grave without feeling it is true, women tend to go to the fool. biggest Where today: We cultivate the wise and enduring Casanovas within the cavity, like the Easter bunny that we raise our poor children. "<br /> <br /> As far as I can, this is the point. Fellini received his story. Received more attention However, disgusting. However, the environment of Casanova is made from the degrading behavior and incestuous behavior. Fellini's themes deal with issues that are more clear in "Satyricon". The continuation of the plot is characteristic of just soft porn But there is no connection, and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slippery to the point of distraction. <br /> <br /> Still, there may be a point that shows Casanova as an idiot that is unsightly. And I challenge everyone to make this point unclear Fellini can't It seems that he is a very dirty old man - Maestro. Of course, but someone who has motivation makes him more satisfied than anyone. I think it's hard to imagine that viewers who like this movie It is not worth telling.
