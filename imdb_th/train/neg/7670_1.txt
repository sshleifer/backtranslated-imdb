What will I start? I went to watch this movie tonight with a few friends who didn't know more than the actors that were there and it should be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I can think of it in the first 20 minutes. It's a bad decision. So much that I went out to watch this movie The plot is nonsense and is a script. The line was scary to the point where people in the audience laughed like crazy. <br /> <br /> Actors couldn't look more plastic. Even some scenes seem like they should be doing much faster ... like they dragged without reason. <br /> <br /> All in this movie is a waste of time and a lot of money.
