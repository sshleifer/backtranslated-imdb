In general, I'm not worried about the violence in movies or philosophy, symbols or psychology. All of this is great for me and the movie brings many stories to us. There are beautiful pictures, especially in the lake and nature, good environment of character, good direction. This film can vote for a good movie. However, it was spoiled for two reasons and for these reasons, making this film disgusting. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is violence that applies to living animals to create this movie. Not the intensity of the movie. I'm talking about real violence. This violence alone may be justified if not and that is the second reason for the number; The text of this film is not just contemplating about the distorted relationships of female directors. Not that we all have no real twist on women. (Men respectively) But the conclusion of this film destroys it all. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * Finally, our "heroine" dies (with my own hands if I remember correctly. I must see this movie many years ago and it makes me angry. Now, the man comes out with a new witch. Of course, not going to see) and now there is a clearer picture that is some kind of natural devil that grows above her, especially her sex .. Of course it is the director who "kills" the female heroine Women must die, especially if men are attracted to sex. That should be the final conclusion. ** At the end of the spoiler. But if using the big picture, the art direction that is cruel to life, just to say that men can make women scared and men are cruel to women That's not enough I know that when I watch this movie, it will achieve great criticism for "Eastern philosophy and art" and whatever methods But for me, this movie is just completely lost.
