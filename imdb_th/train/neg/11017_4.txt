A woman's nightmare makes her afraid that she will be buried as a cheating husband, wanting her to die and deciding to use her fear by attaching her to the coffin and leaving her in the basement. The horror story about Queen Brinke Stevens transforms into a formidable horrifying creature. The only reason to see this unexplained jerk is Michael Berryman in a small pendant and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard The last twenty minutes of the bloody rampage Brinke's quite fun to see as laughable special effects. The head that was executed was really scary. See "Scalps" or "Alien Dead" again. Of course, I didn't expect the level of entertainment from Fred Olen Ray, but "Haunting Fear" is too boring to have fun.
