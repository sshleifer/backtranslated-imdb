Believe me, I want to like the "soul". The stupid person commenting at the time of the launch about the strange way is to see the old hand-drawn animation again as if the cartoon pencil, cartoon, latest animation. Was released twenty years ago and comments Now, computers do old-fashioned techniques, causing my blood to rise ... but then the ungodly stubbornness I have to endure in the first ten minutes of the "spirit" makes my blood better. <br /> <br /> Character design is general, animation. (Partly as a result) is capable of just the overall art direction, boring and boring, until you wonder how it will happen (we know from "The Prince of Egypt" and "The Road to El Dorado "Which has artists that have the ability to DreamWorks) and the use of complex CGI is in the wrong decision every time (Why are they disturbing?) There's nothing worth watching. In this animation cartoon, it's dangerous to life. <br /> <br /> But it's worse ... <br /> <br /> Horses can't speak. But they have humans that are more human-like and not more reliable than deer. In "Bambi", which can and looks like horses can talk. The spirit sent up. (To sound like a world like a 21st century actor, picked out from a department store in California) and then he came back without a truly innocent description Tell us everything we don't know or show the feeling that the art is not good, even if it can't be shown twice as well. The prologue, by the way: (a) There is information that the souls we discovered later knew how to know; (b) expressing the idea that the soul will lack power in acting, even if he can speak; (c) including modern waste such as "This story may not be true. But that is what I can remember "; And (d) will give countless children (Produced a treble, I thought at the age of six) The impression that the horse was native to North America, which is true in the ancestral form of the native zebra horse Etc., originated in North America - but all the horses in Europe were extinct long before the first humans arrived and the animals of the Mustangs (Allegedly "Here, like a buffalo grass") descended from horses. <br /> <br /> The prologue makes me annoyed. <br /> <br /> Often the soul talks about Brian Adams singing. Because he sounded as if he was infected with a bad throat - and not he sang, or even the way he sang, it was what he sang: a ballad that helped to tell the story, even if it was less than if Possible than the narrative of Transportation signals and sounds as if they are all the same. Can distinguish whether they may not) if only Brian Adams and pretend to be a horse may have a SHUT UP for one or two minutes, the movie may be allowed to be in true form Its: medium and derivative rather than worse jaw
