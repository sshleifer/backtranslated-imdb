54 is a movie about a club that is very famous in the 70s. It has a classic looking bartender. Sexy woman The high powered party, the party when everyone together, the ensuing chaos and the bartender (played by Phillipe) seems cruel. <br /> <br /> I'll be the most blunt and honest. As far as possible Unfair or untrue comments (For example, as an 'ok' movie) I found it to be a completely scary movie that was praised by horrible actors. Every time I sat down to watch the movie Salma Hayek, I was always waiting to see her beauty shine along with a great performance. But in reality I couldn't imagine how much talent she was. I mean, what has she really been bequeathed to other people besides dancing on her great table in 'From Dusk Till Dawn' ...? Like Ryan Phillippe, another poor actor who doesn't give anything to the screen. But his good looks and boring face called 'acting' Mike Myers are not as bad as the 2 of these. At least he gives something of value to movies. Become the founder of 54 Club categories that most viewers will hate. (Such as doing very well), he performed in a rather convincing performance which made me happy from the flick But alas, it's not enough to help this film from vain and ridiculous. The worst movie 'bad'. I found something that would be taken from this movie. Neve Campbell is not bad, but she's just 'right there'. The story is boring. It seems that the writer is more bent on making movies in this style and embellishment and forget to add anything else. Any class can be anything, because, like most jewelry, they are just hollow objects that are pretty to look like the basis of this disastrous movie. <br /> <br /> Actually, take one. one hour and a half Do more exciting things, such as talking to a 90-year-old relative on the phone about the weather.
