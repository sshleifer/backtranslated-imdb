I didn't expect much from "The Night Listener" and I never heard this before until I saw the cover in the video room. However, this film is very effective when talking about the construction of the suspension and tension. Sometimes it will drag slightly. But actually it helps you to wonder what will happen and more important: when, as the movie progresses, the character played by Robin Williams is dragged into the game "Cat and Mouse "To the point that he was obsessed with finding the truth and the existence of a 14-year-old boy who had seen himself, The Night Listener was an interesting story that was great to create doubts throughout the film You will be kept in the darkness of the liar and what is true. However, in the end, it is disappointing and not as potent as it should be. It does not give details or reasonable explanations about other main characters, which should be useful and interesting.
