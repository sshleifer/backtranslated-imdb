1940. - Visiting a slum in the occupied Nazi slum in Poland, recorded by a German photographer with an innocent collaboration of the Jewish community, combined with a permanent archive of clips from foreign films and related cultural film content. Jews in the world are cheating and parasites. The 'documentary' interprets Jewish life from the perspective of anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. Straightforward and unique expression of racial hatred I personally found that this movie was very scary and disgusting. Who would hope that such images would not reach the screen again?
