I expect a lot from this movie. Kin, like Lee as Naustradamous like caracter, but all I get is a waste of time and boring movies. I can't explain this. It has a wooden show, a scary script from parts from the Bible, such as hurricanes, tidal waves and earthquakes. But that's the end! The rest I have to wait and hope that something that has full meaning will happen. But it wasn't This film is about couples trying to find changes in the world, such as places in China that have earthquakes and end at a convent run by eight nuns and priests Finally, the convent is the key to spelling mistakes. This movie is both missleading and boring. One of the worst lees.
