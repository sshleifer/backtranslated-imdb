If you want to see intelligent conversations and have a philosophy about the possibilities and potentials of humans, see "Awakening Life", which is excellent, "What do we know # $ *!" Is everywhere in the spot where focus is not good, bad writing, poorly done, no artistic direction and completely annoying It doesn't stimulate or entertain a little. The merger of the traveler "Ramtha" in this movie has enough reason to avoid it. It is not uncommon for filmmakers to choose to overlook the fact that this woman worshiped 2,000 years of Atlantian gods or something? What an old chick is flake and what is wasting my time and money on this film? The person who is responsible for this movie should not be allowed to create the movie again.
