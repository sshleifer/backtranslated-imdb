William Russ is the main character in this film on TV. He left his family behind to appear again and began to pay off his debts. But he tried to avoid his family That is what Peter Falk (Colombo) came to have many different roles to convince him to go home. <br /> <br /> The story is normal At a fairly good level But William Russ is not a real star However, it seems that his performance will still be available. <br /> <br /> I found the delivery and the wonderful story of guessing everything. In fact, the last 20 minutes I can almost write a word for the word before it happens. Good movies shouldn't be like that. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a sub movie. In the letter grade system, it will receive "D".
