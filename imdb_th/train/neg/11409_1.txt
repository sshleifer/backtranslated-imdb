Beginning in the 1980s, the use of truly offensive violence as "Horror movie" I am a target group for this disgusting junk piece and now I'm bored. <br /> <br /> Oh, where do we start? Check out the settings: You can bring people back to life if they die severely. Therefore, a ludicrous evidence is an excuse for a butcher in a form that is scary, because that is necessary to bring them back to life again! This may be used if playing to the top for blacks to laugh a la Re-Animator or something. But not it plays straight There was a whole formidable family in the wagon that was hunted, one of the few scenes that at least when they died outside the screen. However, everything is on the screen. Actually, there was a scene in which the girl walked along, was beaten and killed by the zombies who were filming and shooting with multiple cameras. Then there was her face at close range because the filmmakers loved and spent a long time revealing in the shooting at the time when her hit face was carved into the skull. Of course, this was done by Jack Alberson, who fell as a groan in the background. He likes to drive around in an ambulance / truck. Play Tommy Dorcey's old song. I think it's cute. <br /> <br /> In the end, of course, even the sheriff is dead and the doctor is kind. To fix his rotting hands It is not clear why the sheriff did not go out with other townspeople who killed the children with joy and screamed their faces, pinned them in the eyes of the burned victims. <br /> <br /> I wonder. That what people see in Such a narrative performance to score in any manner. It's not scary. The twist is a laugh and overall it is sick. It's still not good enough to "See it with courage" or enjoy the level that you might see. The HG Lewis movie is not good. It's just a terrible trash for God created for those who go down to this pointless grave.
