This film reminds me of "ridiculous (2002)" Another art film that is violent and violent in human nature. I don't like movies But I can't say that it's a bad movie. It's just special. I reminded me of "Camping Cosmos (1996)", which has a large number of low-level people living in sea camps in Belgium. The same description of people who live together alongside their feelings and the encounters of incompatible characters. I also miss the book of French writer Emile Zola, a writer in a natural style. I don't like movies and I don't like the people in it. They seem very rude without basic good taste. Anyone asking questions about why they are alive, they all seem to be members of the big world that is forced to live with their needs Or you might say: Hell is on this earth
