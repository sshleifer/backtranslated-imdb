Two old men sitting on a park bench I don't have a problem with this scene - the only problem is that it's not the whole movie scene. <br /> <br /> The movie Yup doesn't have a lower concept anymore. They are not bored anymore. But there is something worse because these two old men are chalking and cheese. One is Nat Moyer, who is a Yiddish communist, while the other is Midge Carter, a former gold glove champion who is still black. Let me see the Jews and a black man sitting on a bench in the park. I guess it's possible But not feasible But if this movie has such a dangerous situation, why play with the Jewish stereotype? Why did they make a call from the tribe who used the Hebrew oath? Ironically, the Jewish people who saw at the beginning of the movie were the type of Jews seen in Nazi propaganda films in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Moi dearz. The problem with me is not RAPPAPORT. Up for a meduim that is completely different than a movie theater, it depends on the stage play and it shows. Walter Matt Tu went through his role as Nat while this announcer almost slept throughout the story.
