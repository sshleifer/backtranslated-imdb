I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I know why. The performance was the worst I've ever seen. Lowest light and sound The story has a little reason, even while being conscious. (Warning: I don't recommend watching this movie while sober.) This film feels like you're watching a movie about someone's home. It is a shame that all the money spent on this project is wasteful. I hope to see those who are still living in addition to the eva longoria that is the only "star" of this movie. Obviously not being hit by bad acting bars. I'm sorry that there is no constructive criticism. But what can I say to James Cahill? Don't try again in squirlyem's words. "It's severely lacking in a good department."
