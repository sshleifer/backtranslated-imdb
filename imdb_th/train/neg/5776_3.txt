Bad performances, southern accents, inconsistent movies, scary scripts ... <br /> <br /> I waited for this film at the film festival recently and was so frustrated after Saw it It has the ability to name words / unquote but they do not deliver. Of course, the basis of this story is the uneven and uninteresting story being told. <br /> <br /> Don't worry.
