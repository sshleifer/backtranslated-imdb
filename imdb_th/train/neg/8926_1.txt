I saw "Myra Breckinridge" when it first came out in 1970. At that time, I was 20 years old, healthy, who loved movies and liked Raquel Welsh. Moreover, I read Gore Vidal novels based on and thought of it. Very funny I saw a local driving movie and about half way I was very tempted to change the motor of my car so that I might die from poisoning poisoning and not having to see the wreck of the movie. It's not "smart" or "Modern" but it looks terrible and sloppy All the actors are deaf and the director has no idea what he is doing. The casting from Mae Tawan is one of the worst selection of actors in film history. As one reviewer said that her role was not related to movies or books. Her character in this book was hit by a young stud who had never done for the legendary West. Oh no, the plot has changed, so she will have more sex with him. I believe a lot from the 77-year-old woman who looks every day in her age. I can, but why is it a terrible movie? > <br /> Bluto
