In more than 70 years of watching movies, this is one of the worst comedies ever made. Melbrook, Mike Meyers & a few others have created bad comedies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton, which I like, usually has to receive her salary. good She wants to learn her craft again. <br /> <br /> Dax Shepard (I don't know who he is) needs a better director to show him how to practice. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler does not depend on her role. <br /> <br /> Mike White wants to find another character. He has done too many people of the same type a couple of times. Many years ago, as a leading actor But not as good as he used to be. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good that I can say in this attempt at comedy. <br /> <br /> Score: * (from 4) Score 25 (out of 100) IMDb 1 (from 10)
