If you're not in the 90's or not listening to rappers !! This movie may be ok for you, but for fans or the only person who has heard this rap, the movie is boring and there is no point in the movie that I said is interesting or I don't know. Another thing that keeps me stuck is that it makes it seem that everything in his life that he has done is very easy, without struggling. He makes prison look easy, sells drugs, and even tapping it is not the same. I think if the movie that was released in about 15 years from now may have more impact !!! Good rap movies, hustle and flow, get rich or die, try not to sell.
