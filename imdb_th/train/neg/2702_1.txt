Singleton has a serious problem that he must deal with. I felt that he thought he was wise. However, this movie is almost transparent and self-righteous. There is also a message. "That's right", for example, when the Nazis jerked our hearts. I mean, who in their right mind is going to take over the Nazis? However, he has a way in which Singleton demonstrates the stupid "fight" and seems to be designed to show us the superior combat qualities of the black protagonist more than anything else. " The bad guy "(in fact, a drunkard boy) who raped one of the protagonists of the movie In this case, I think the singles did a good job. Actually, things that might be too common when women involved asked young boys to use condoms and they didn't have condoms or didn't want to use them. In any case, he refused to comply with her demands that he stopped and he would have sex even if she was asked. I think this kind of rape is too common and in fact many people in the uniform refuse to accept the fact that it is rape. Now, it doesn't mean that rape, which can happen a lot in universities across the country. <br /> <br /> When the rape is established, Singleton does it. When the twin children tried to call the woman, her roommate refused to give the victim a phone call at the point that the boy called the roommate as "Black bitch", an injured roommate seemed to ask for advice from the Ice Cube and the group then proceeded to assault and insult the twin children to join "apologize" to his roommate for Racist words; However, there has been no mention of the crime caused by rape. Again, no one should really feel sorry for the young man. However, singles seem to send two messages that express racist opinions as a greater offense than rape, and in the event of any violence that is justified. Jerk <br /> <br /> About truly important things. But singles, while no doubt that the talented director seems to have no maturity or depth to pull out this thing
