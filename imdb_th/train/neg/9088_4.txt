There are people who speak many times - not at least for me - watching Eric Rohmer's movies is like watching dry colors. It seems that Monsieur Rohmer is not happy with this. (He doesn't deny it But then he will do what he is not satisfied with it), so much so that his new movie, which may be his last movie, is Allah Inch when it likes to watch woad dry those wonderful people who give Nouvelle Vague for you. Cahiers du Cinema has named it one of the best movies of 2007, so you should give your thoughts. The truth is not high according to Rohmer's agenda. Therefore, in the 5th century, France, we had a great castle that would not happen in the Loire Valley, while the other houses we saw were rude wooden huts. The story is related to the nymphs and shepherds, and while he was doing, Rohmer threw it with foreign objects that had just passed so that the overall result was played in the school year for students with special needs being caught on the plate Accidentally film Who wants to say, 'Come back, Godard, all be forgiven.' Yet, this terrible production can't make me speak.
