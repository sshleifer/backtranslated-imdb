"Wasting all time" Just a few explosions, discrete battles, exotic cars and crazy millionaires, slow-moving computers create a car crash. Blender and you will have an excuse, sorry for this movie. I laughed out of "Dr. Evil" like a heavy army. The plot is somewhere between unusual and non-existent. How many millionaires are willing to bet 25 million dollars in a car race? Answer: 4 But do they not become millionaires with financial responsibility? This was written for men with short hairs. It plays like a video game. I enjoy landing in Gulfstream II in the desert though.
