(This may be a bit of a spoiler) I want to start by saying that I didn't watch the whole movie and couldn't do it because it was obvious from the first hour that I was incredibly disappointed. Of course, it is a problem with shooting things that many people believe are amazing books and turning into Disney movies for TV. <br /> <br /> The wrinkles of time should become a miracle. Movie long ago There is a wonderful story that can ask children and adults. It also has been created in the quality sector. But Disney's parody is not the way to go. The problem of this movie is that everything they change has made it into a visual story, making things great about this book. It is complicated and emotional for children. There is no reason to make Charles Wallace purely "psychic" because that is the easiest way to explain. There is no reason to write a fight between the three women. W is an increasing tension, there is enough tension in the matter, regardless of whether There is no reason to take Meg's glasses ... that makes us lack the things that would be a sweet scene between Calvin and Meg that happened in the book. <br /> <br /> I can do little things. For many days, but I think the bigger things, such as the art, are closed For example, the way in which they created the appearance of Camazotz with the dark sky The creepyness found in the book is Kamazot, perhaps the world looks like the world. It has people who look like humans. The sky is blue, green grass and children are playing. But something a little The director chose to make Camazotz more complete than studying in the book and apply it to the overall direction of the movie. The lesson of the course is that Camazotz may be a good world. That is if we forget how to love. It would be better to have a beautiful afternoon because they are walking down the street with the children who hit the ball at the same pace. <br /> <br /> I'm unfortunately not watching the ending. Maybe someone can tell me that Disney has ended the story. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's an artistic disappointment. <br /> <br />
