Roy Rogers plays Jesse James and his gambler, Clint Burns George "Gabby" Hayes is the former sheriff of Mr. Rogers Gabby Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) is a memorable team as Two journalists who are looking for stories about an unlawful hero who is hard to understand. <br /> <br /> Sure, misunderstanding / impersonation is a character. Development because Rogers wrote the essay "Double Role". Rogers has the usual charm. But there is nothing that elevates his performance above all else. The potential to deliver Jekyll / Hyde's memorable work is caused by poor materials. The better partner to watch is Ms. Storm and Ms. Paye as a St. Louis Journal reporter. They are the highlights of the movie. The song is good, even if there are bad singles. <br /> <br /> *** Jesse James at Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George Hayes' Gabby, Gale Storm
