I am disappointed with this film due to the fact that it gives the feeling of guilt and the character is not strong enough to make this film a horrible attempt. The basic idea for this film is interesting. Unfortunately, it can't be excited, shocked, or shocked - there is part in all the movies that I think are scary.

The character played by Jeremy Sheffield is not really necessary for this movie and I think those who The director / writer was brought along with a lot of characters that were used without a purpose. If he left it on the basic character, making it a solo effort. In Kate's part, it might be The result - the performances of Jeremy Wood, is, to say the least. A bad look about screen chemistry - or lack thereof. It's a shame. Disappointing.
