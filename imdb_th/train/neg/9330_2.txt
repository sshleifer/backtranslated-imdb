Watch this movie soon and have higher hopes. Not much from the director who had never filmed the movie before. But based on the actors Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (leading the role in Body double, Brian De Palma's masterpiece) performed in a great movie Not together, and this truth has not changed because of this. <br /> <br /> This film is unbelievable, predictable and ancient. The only thing that makes it slightly attractive is choosing the location that is shot. In my humble opinion: Don't waste time with this one.
