Who are they joking with? There is too much in this film that is difficult to digest since Arjun (Ajay Devgan) wants to die. The father is unaware of when he arrives in London with his uncle (played by Om Puri) just to abandon him in minutes. later The only problem with this theory is that everyone who has been through London Heathrow knows that the fÃªte is impossible to pull out, and especially not Indians. But the problem of the film does not end there. There are problems of two main leaders. (Salman Khan and Ajay Deevanan) passed as a rock star nearing their dreams. I mean, yes, we saw success coming to Susan Boyle (a woman in the UK achieved her dream after age 50). But that's a rare case. It's hard for me to suppress my disbelief because I feel that the casting of Salman and Ajay is just a bad feeling. They will not use Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi to play the same role, so why should we be forced to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (those who get into their 40s) around their 20s in despair? Don't even talk about the most self-conscious actress today. This is her second movie. (Which I saw) and she was desperate. As an actress, she realized that she saw that she was worried about herself by looking good and paying attention to the camera rather than giving a good performance. It is difficult to believe that she refused those other screenplays to be a star in this movie, and then would look soft as an actor. And above all, the movie just dragged dullly There is nothing special about this, so trust me, you will predict everything that the ancient thought will happen in that.
