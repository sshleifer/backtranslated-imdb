This movie is late at night when I see it. It is interesting from the beginning. But it didn't make me believe overall I'm not a Tyson fan In fact, I don't like boxing. It is a barbaric, vulgar and confrontational two times (by society) that some people get money for a strike The actors are fine, especially George C. Scott (like Cus D'Amato) I don't know how reliable it is. I didn't read books and books about boxing or Tyson. I don't know anything about this guy. But it is quite fun. <br /> <br /> When the movie continues, I feel that it has a little charm and I lose interest. I try to wake up But the last hour was not good enough
