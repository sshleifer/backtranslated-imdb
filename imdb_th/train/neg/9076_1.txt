This is the most stupid and disgusting movie I have seen from time to time. I was tempted to turn off the VCR, but while the passion for watching a terrible car accident, I found it truly abhorrent in every possible way and slapped it to the end. I never had the idea of ​​objecting to the comedy of sex comedy on the screen. Animal House, Porky's, had something about Mary, both American Pie movies, and even the famous Freddy Got Fingered. I found it fun. Very much with their own vulgar conditions Mamie Van Doren's breast removing breast bath is the most horrifying look of the naked elderly since The Shining corrected and shot incorrectly with an incredibly annoying show from Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman. The movie ended. Without taking advantage of making me laugh once The only useful purpose for this film is an example in the textbook how to not make an overview. Oh and it serves as a good lawn fertilizer.
