I will give a negative rating if possible. I went to see this movie without expecting much. But I have an open mind All things are stupid! Obviously, the snake is a fake and the first two things they bite are stupid people and Johnson. Oh, how original is it? If I was a 12 year old boy, I could laugh. I don't know how popular this movie is. Seriously, the worst thing I have ever seen I'm not entertaining. It's not funny. I'm not bored! I didn't get anything. It's not that bad. But it is terrible, really ridiculous. Please don't waste money on this movie. Don't even rent this movie. No clue how to get a high score.
