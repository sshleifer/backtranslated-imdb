When I first heard of "Solar Crisis" when I was cast, I wondered why I had never heard of this movie before. Then I saw it. <br /> <br /> Now I know. <br /> <br /> For movies that cover space, sun, vast desert and vast metropolis, this is a narrow and attractive feature. afraid ; Feels like everyone is close together, so the camera doesn't have to pull back far. <br /> <br /> And the effect, while good, is quite bad. We are talking about the destruction of the world on Earth. If the team of scientists and soldiers cannot divert the light from the sun that is deadly. But in addition to shouting, sweating and red light about everything, there is no real emergency feeling. <br /> <br /> Don't let me start a character story. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle, et al is doing. Being in this movie without having to pay attention to acting with feelings and content is something everyone expects. Make you wonder who doesn't pay for the condo in Hollywood .... <br /> <br /> And as long as the end ends ... Okay, let's say it's stressful and interesting. But it is too little Late in this effort If there is a pace like that throughout the movie, maybe I have heard "Solar Crisis" faster. <br /> <br /> Two stars, mostly for the chance of losing and moving a bad career. <br /> < br /> I wonder how Alan Smithee is still doing his job in this kind of junk.
