Hello everyone, can you hear me? I don't know why you came to this page. But if you're a friend, watch this movie: join the fan club! This movie is incredibly terrible. I can't stop laughing when I see it. I think it's a bad thing to see it in a good way. Every cliche ever invented for horror movies can be viewed here. I was afraid that it was very difficult to get a copy of this movie. But it should be in the top 10 of the worst movies ever created
