Alex D. Linz replaced Macaulay Culkin as a key figure in the third film in the Home Alone kingdom. Four industrial spies received computer chips, missile systems and smuggled into the airport inside a remote control toy car. Due to the confusion of the luggage, Mrs. Hesse (Marion Zeldes) was not satisfied with the car. She gave it to her neighbor, Alex (Linz) before the spy appeared. Spies rent houses to steal houses in the neighborhood until they find a car. At home alone with chicken pox, Alex calls 911 every time he finds theft. But the spy will often escape the police while Alex is accused of prank Eventually, the spy turned his attention to Alex, unaware that he had a device to trap the whole house wisely. Home Alone 3 wasn't scary. But may not be done. You cannot replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 There are some funny parts. But I don't like when the characters change in the movie series. See their own risks.
