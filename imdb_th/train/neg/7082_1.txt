Ok, I wrote a nasty review b / c. This film is awesome. Since I waited for my review again (for Derrida) to appear, I decided to check out the old reviews of this horrible movie. See all positive comments All of them, I say, all from the participants, have not rated other movies except Crimminy! And wait until you receive criticism. "Rosebud" [sic] <br /> <br /> Pay for other movies that receive criticism. Rosebud and have glowing advice. Oh, shoot! They are the only writers and directors of other films. Holy Window-Wipers Batman <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, you suck as a writer and Tony. You can't guide bad scripts. have No job for you! <br /> <br /> Check reviews, always positive for movies that give low ratings!
