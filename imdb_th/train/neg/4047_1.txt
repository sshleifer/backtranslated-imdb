***** Warning, there may be spoilers which are more entertaining than this trip. **** <br /> <br /> This is a good guide to everyone who lives in the United States. Kingdom, whenever Channel 5 has 80 jokes in the late night, read books instead. I am currently recovering from seizures due to reading some comments about this movie. In fact, I was shocked to say that this movie is true! All I can say is thank God that the Cold War has never been increased or something else that we may give to Commie's. Our borders ... I found this movie the worst in the most excuse. Know of England in what makes comedy, who knows? But in every aspect, this movie is not only scary but the teeth are so bad. <br /> <br /> I have never been a big fan of Bill Murray and this kind of garbage makes me feel him. Don't understand me wrong, I like Ghostbuster's Which was created after three years after the film But this is just the sum of Bill Murray. Actually, I can safely say that I don't waste this time blatantly since I saw the first operation of the Operation Delta Force here. Even though these two movies are more like you Think For one thing, both of them have a bad action sequence from beginning to end and second place. They are both full of clich√©'s mysteries. <br /> <br /> One thing they should be in "The US Army" but they were also allowed to enter their camp. Willy nilly deceived police officers, women soldiers and later made them embarrassed in the general area. Talk about randomness! This movie is terrible for this. I'm scared. Now, don't understand me wrong, I'm not sympathetic to feminism. But the fact that these two women fell in love with both characters after arresting them shortly after releasing them for free ... twice, it was an insult For female competition The fact that there was one irritated hair, a fat person (Winger) and his unfortunate close friend, Ramis, was able to talk to himself in MP's underwear, in which they fell in love with both of them> <br /> Then there is a training scene in which you will meet the "Phycho" team that threatens to kill anyone who touches him or his stuff, followed by the obese doctor. (Played by John Candy), who claimed that he joined the army for "Avoid paying $ 400 for anger management class" leads to blaring Murray paying tribute to "Giant Toe" (WTF?) 'Seargent Drill' that in good faith cannot organize pi $$ Up in the brewery All of these scenes acted to propel many fighting scenes by people saying "How to go to the asshole '!" All the time, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> The scene then shows up to the rag tag, making their own nipples fully in the course. Assault leads to the first scene in Then fiercely shot in thin air Through birds with assault rifles, clock towers with ammunition (Like that, Oh, tell you that this movie is a random story ... He's a miraculous miracle as well ...) Finally, the parade that comes through which the unfortunate team turns into magic. (Bugger me , The Miracle!) Thanks to the wise words from Murray, which they did not command the soldiers as hard as dancing in front of the elders in front of the rest of the team All of this for the great happiness of their two Girlfriends who are standing, which should really catch them ... Everyone laughs out. Although this bit is nothing amazing. Then he chose them to protect the new multi-million dollar prototype armored vehicle in Italy. (Which became just a green painted mobile home with many gadgets) said, "This is what the army wants!" Yes ... <br /> <br /> Then there was a frightening final scene which Murray And Ramis decided to steal this top secret Military Vehicle to buy their newly purchased MP Girlfriends in Germany. Which the captain had no luck (John Larroquette) then discovered and led a team of new participants in the mission to restore this tank In which they would use the "wrong turn" route on the way and ended up in the Soviets holding Czechoslovakia, where they were captured (Like we didn't see that coming ...), so it began to be assisted by Ramis and Murray + Birds in the hand, which is where the big fight, shooting from the hip and the tank exploded. When they returned as national heroes, the Russians were humiliated by calling them "pussies", etc., etc. In the end, they were correct. There was no court of justice. Nothing. They just steal the prototype military car, drive into the Warsaw Pact country and almost cause international events that may cause a spark of WW3! <br /> <br /> This film is more fun than being diagnosed with Ill be sick. I know it is a comedian. But there are actors suitable for it But where is it in hell? Channel 5, cut those bits out? The only redeeming feature in this film is the repeated use of naked women bathing and female mud wrestling. (As I said randomly) not that it helps to distract from the fact that this is the absolute most crap movie This film should aim for 9 years of immature and sad children, we have to watch it instead of 1 star from 10 - Total Tripe. My advice, do little things that are useful to your time Like throwing yourself ...
