The use of cut scenes is terrible. All continuity will be lost either by writing a scary script or a lethargic direction. An insidious robot ... Musta is a jazz dancer. In addition, one of the worst audio tracks I've ever heard. (The monologue often drowns with music.) And ... where do they get their equipment? The boat looks like a milk box ... I made a special effect at 8 mm. At the age of 13! <br /> <br /> I would like to suggest which movie students should watch this flick (once 5 minutes) to learn how to not make a movie or ... Is it the editor's fault? <br /> <br /> It's really bad because the situation is a really good concept ... just take action. Go around (Sorry, Malcom, you should send "stunt double" You are a better actor than Users will have a bomb)
