Erwin Allen is great. All his TV shows have excellent pilots or at first. The rest is just his other show. The Swiss Robinson family, a few episodes, were ripped off his old TV program. One episode of the Swiss family is like the episode of Land Of The Giants when the members of the party need an appendix surgery. The list has a high budget and is too expensive to continue. Erwin loses contact with the TV program after the 60s. The performance is strong with Martin Milner. The star child arrives there, beginning with this program, such as Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. Including his disaster scene, such as the typhoon and volcanic eruption, causing him to become "The Lord of Disasters"
