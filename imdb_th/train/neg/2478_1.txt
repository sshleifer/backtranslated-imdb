This movie is S-L-O-W. Spend most of the movie waiting for 'start'. <br /> <br /> That setting is cool. The script looks bleak. The film is filmed. (Not at all Movies with low prices are not good. But this one has no redemption feature. <br /> <br /> The plot is more consumed with a vengeful and slightly mad hunter than the actual Wendigo. The movie itself is disappointing. Because 'Wendigo' is just a strange combination of trees and deer. Everything about this movie is not boring. <br /> <br /> The parents of the little boy seem to be quite distant. Whether it's a bad show or a bad screenplay, I'm not sure. But it increased my frustration and boredom. <br /> <br /> No food to think This film penetrates with pain, so you don't have to pay attention to what happened at the end. <br /> <br /> The environment of Wendigo reminds me of the boring movie that was shown at the end of the awards ceremony 'Mr Bean's Holiday': movies that are artistic and ridiculous, trying too hard to be profound and meaningful <br /> <br /> I don't want to see this thing again. I just watched it until the end in the hope that something interesting might happen ... but it wasn't.
