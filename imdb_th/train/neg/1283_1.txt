I must say that the first time I watched this movie about 6 years ago and I really like it. I just bought a DVD recently and once again watched, I wondered why I liked it. The performance is terrible and, as usual, we have a clan that is stereo in their fake set. The most horrible performance Tim Roth works as well as Liam Neeson. But I don't know what Jessica Lang is thinking. <br /> <br /> The plot line is good. But the execution was bad I was tired of seeing Scotland showing such images in the movie. Braveheart is even worse, which is this movie that helps to preserve elegance only But seriously, people didn't say that. In those days, why did all the actors have to have a Glasgow accent? It's just another movie that will try and capture the essence of the map, tired and annoying. I noticed only one person who said that this movie is good, American, and to be honest, I can see why they like me. However, if you are thinking of buying a DVD, I will say that using your money with something else like a better movie.
