When HEY ARNOLD! The first broadcast in 1996. I watched it. It was one of my favorites. Then the same episode began to appear over and over again, so I was tired of waiting for a new episode and stopped watching it. I was surprised to hear about HEY ARNOLD! The movie because it doesn't seem to be as popular as other Nickelodeon comics like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. However, there's nothing better than this. When entering the theater, I didn't expect much. I just expect it to be a dumb movie, a cartoon boy like the movie RECESS. I guess I get what I expected. It's a stupid little movie and nothing more. There are some good parts here and there. But most of this movie has a foul odor Just for kids
