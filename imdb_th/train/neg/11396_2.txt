Most of the cheap erotic horror Rolfe Kanefsky eventually created a movie that didn't go directly to Playboy Channel. "The Hazing" borrowed from everything that happened earlier from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead Still has enough humor to make it look ... hardly a character is a cardboard, the dialogue is a wood, a story like paper and actors can't leave a grocery bag Bring together and you have a lumpy ball for the movie Sometimes when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. Watch this movie very much. Chew it for 90 minutes and you have a strange taste in the mouth and no nutritional value.
