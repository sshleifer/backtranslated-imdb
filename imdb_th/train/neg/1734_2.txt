I am a big fan of Westerners and do not believe that Hollywood can capture old glory, but not even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can help this film in 1957, which has almost all the formidable characteristics Westerners who were reformed turned to be good people. The girl who collapses But there are virtues, people, big cities that have to turn to be fighters for salvation, etc. I can't help but observe the names of writers and "actors". The young man who plays Granger's son Any discrimination there? I saw better performances in the Chill Wills High School drama. I played as a cartoon character of Chill Wills. Did I get 1,000 words?
