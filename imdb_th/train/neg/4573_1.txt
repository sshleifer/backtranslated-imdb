I don't know much about this movie before I watch. But I heard that there is something about quantum physics, so I'm interested. What I don't know is that this is not true. But is a group of people who like modern sounds that like their own voice, talking about things they know little about basic quantum mechanics I said that it is in the documentary category rather than comedy or drama. <br /> <br /> Marlee Matlin is in the movie for this new academic conference. * Some of the stories. Some of her films felt horribly clinging and intended to express the thoughts of the speaker, so we would not die because of boredom. Matlin had a real job as a photographer, unlike the modern hippies that happened. On her sofa We listened to unnamed people walking about all the quantum physics that were meant to them. One of the bright spots in this movie is the narrator from India (I think), but I think he appeared in the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> It looks like Barbara Eden will leave. Myself already Regarding how quantum science relates to her crazy new age beliefs, it seems that the Quark from the DS9 almost doesn't have money at all, and he has also appeared in a short film. Will be impressed The cells in the body show as jello molds because the filmmakers see the Flubber too many times. <br /> <br /> People in the movie say that the Arawak people in San Salvador think that Pinta's Columbus is invisible Because the villagers have never seen a clipper boat before, as if people today have a way to know how Of course, they didn't reveal all the information and just said "Columbus's ship can't see the Indians in America." This film requires a lot of arrogance leap. Thomas also conducted two experiments around the year 1805 and found that light can sometimes look like particles and sometimes waves. Of course, you never know about this movie because the only reference is "Atoms may be particles and waves" and that must mean that people can pass through walls, walk on water and not be old if they just want stars! If so, I'm sure Marlee Matlin will stop deaf if she * believes * hard enough. I'm a sarcastic person. But this film is full of misguided hopes and beliefs that people who provoke them don't really hold on. <br /> <br /> These are the new era that serves to grab the quantum theory. As if It confirms everything they believe about meditation, energy, points, crystal healing centers, etc. If these oil snake salesmen really believe that they sell shit, they don't just want their salary to become a joke instead. Film? We will listen to other unnamed people without the information we know. Talk on the sofa in front of the fireplace. (Or TV screen) about how he created his own life Every time he is on the screen, I want someone to run in and throw the pie in front of him. These people pay too much attention to themselves. Some bald men in the suit say that no one has * really touched because there is a magnetic force causing it to be on a quantum level. If only one person walked on the screen and punched him in the stomach, cried "I didn't touch you! I didn't touch you! "The moral relativity in the movie claimed to have "There is no good or bad thing." Obviously, it's okay that Hitler gave millions of Jews dead. The other person said that there is no "love". It is chemical and we don't love people. We just stick to the chemicals that we have when we are around them. I wonder if this guy is doing this movie as a community service that has been addicted to heroin for many years. <br /> <br /> We are witnessing a truly pathetic order in which two young men walk around to get organized. RoboCop wedding. They assess that a woman is a cow, dog or fox, and the sexual position appears on the gravel. Marlee Matlin is drunk at the wedding. She should take a photo and the next day decides to love. Self and shower because she is a beautiful and unique snowflake /> <br /> I like the movies <br says that people often find evidence. Their ideas in advance Maybe in this review, I just saw what I wanted to see, but I really wanted to see these people paddling and it never happened. <br /> <br /> If you have never heard of any ideas presented In the previous movie, you might find it interesting. But there are better sources for all ideas here If you want to watch a good movie that talks about the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, go to the man who is not there. If you want to read a book about the quantum field theory, read the hyperspace by Mishio Kaku. If you want to watch a movie that talks about a different philosophy with imaginative images, see Waking Life (even if it feels boring, boring, important to yourself and sometimes pretentious). Anton Wilson instead of wasting time with this movie <br /> <br /> Usually I have a very difficult time scoring movies from 1 to 10, but this one is very easy for me: 1/10 stars <br /> <br /> The name of the picture This story was true People in this movie don't know # $ *! Embarked on the worst movie I've ever seen
