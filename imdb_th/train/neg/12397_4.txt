I read somewhere that this movie should be a film noir remake of 1949, "Criss Cross". I found the latter disappointing. But still better than this movie > <br /> The biggest negative of it But not a movie (that's fine) but a messy story Hey, the story of the 40s Dashiell Hammett as well, but I don't care too. The filmmakers here didn't help the situation by placing the story backward in the story that looked like every three minutes. No wonder it's following this story. It's ridiculous! What happened was about 45 minutes. Their confusion had no one cared anymore. I know i don't
