Why do I watch movies like this? - Unless I have a false belief that one day I will find a true jewel among all this garbage, I can't think of a good reason. This movie is difficult from beginning to end - but it's a semi-hilarious junk elsewhere, but in a poor Italian dubbing movie, you'll find a fiercely English exchange, like English between the faithful soldiers and the evil chief X-secret files, such as organizations dedicated to hiding "The Truth": <br /> <br /> Humans in black: silence is best for us until we can prove that UFOs <br /> <br /> Military type: In any case, I find that your intervention is not appropriate.> <br /> Men in black: Anyone who must determine the will of He is <br /> <br /> I'm spinning DVDs. (You know what I mean) Half a dozen good things and I still can't create those lines. <br /> <br /> "We like people who are contrary to our interests." <br /> <br /> In English Jim, but not as we know. <br /> <br /> Other highlights of this film's boring actors for me are unique performances at first. With the worst haircut that has ever existed in the history of everything, the man went around and looked like a shocking fish in a bad wig until being kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of Plexiglas by aliens. The aliens are not able to see the POV view as efficiently as possible - mobile cameras with fish eye lenses - a creepy story for the first time. But when used again and again, it will lose its energy It means that aliens always walked out of the room for some reason) <br /> <br /> This film is set to "England". This means that the Spanish scene designer in Italy put the number plate. England on two British cars and then put Union Jack on our hero's news card ... and that's about it. There is no other attempt to make it look like the United Kingdom. <br /> <br /> Please? When the artist Foley didn't notice that the characters were flowing (Is there a word like this?) Not walking on the gravel anymore But now on the lawn, so their feet are still loud and loud, besides that, losing another 90 minutes in my life I hope they will prove that those UFOs are not motivated to fight soon ...
