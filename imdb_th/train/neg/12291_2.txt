Hummel, an Italian film starring David Hussell and Linda Blair. I didn't expect much to be honest and in fact I spent less time than expected It does not mean that this film is the worst I have ever seen because I see things that are worse than this. But the story is mostly confusing and not interesting, and some good scenes are the only thing that saved Apart from that, you will love some special effects. They are really wonderful and bad. Now, I just want to watch "Troll 3" by the same director. Of course, it won't be worse than that.
