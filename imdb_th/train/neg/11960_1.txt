Actually, I left the horror movie in Asia recently after feeling tired of seeing ghost stories too. However, recently I have received more and more benefits and decided to give them a chance again. My first call port was highly rated by director Takashi Miike, who is 'Visitor Q' who received a high score. I've seen Audition already and while I don't like it a lot, I rate it as one In the more modern horror movies of Asia So I entered this with reasonable expectations. And unfortunately found only boredom I think this movie is really smart and it's above my head. But what I think is just a series of violent and nasty scenes that have little or no connection between them. Any comparison with the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is as insulting as I am concerned. All Miike is doing here to create a witty film around. My headache is located in about 10 minutes in (after the father had sex with his daughter for some reason) and it didn't decrease until the film finally ended; At least twenty-four hours later or will be like that Do not understand me wrong, I do not resist the violence in the movie and in fact find the most famous movie. But at the moment, there may be violence, pointless and boring, and I don't enjoy one ounce of it. Takashi Miike may have a lot of fans, but I'm not one of them. And I hope this will be the last time I can experience one of his films.
