Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu starring Peter Sellers in the fictitious character created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice until the end of the seller's career. The plot is very simple and if done correctly, it can be handled well. But it was executed badly Part of the reason that this film is not good is bad conversations, cheap laughs, lacking directors, and the awkward feeling that this film is not perfect. go back Is the only thing that makes me interested in the whole period I found a vendor who depicted ruthless Manchu doing excellently, along with the lines that can be remembered from time to time. For example, there is a scene where Fu Manchu is confused by the henchmen which he says "Well, all of you are like me." I hate to accept it. But I laughed out loud at that time. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, the strong character supporting this character attracted my attention as well as Helen Mirren was a police officer. Reserve Sir Roger Avery (His last film was also not a way to end his career) and Sid Caesar. (Which gives a rather strange performance of Al Capone's cousins ​​working for the FBI) ​​These characters make me look alike. <br /> <br /> The scene looks good too. The oriental design and the British society in 1933 were conveyed with elegance in a bad image. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, my advice is to watch movies if you Be Peter Sellers or Sid Sears fans, otherwise you would be better off sitting on a aluminum foil chew.
