This movie is advertised on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every issue. So when we went to Kinnepolis multiplex, our expectations were very high. But oh boy, it's so sad! It's a Hollywood style movie about movies in movies. Shades clearly show that we are not ready to produce. 'Big Hollywood Movie' I'm not a movie critic. But I think good movies start with a good chapter. And the script is a nightmare Like my subject line, it says nothing and looping. You can stare at the television as well without seeing anything. That is the feeling we have when we see the shadow. Shades are bad production !!!
