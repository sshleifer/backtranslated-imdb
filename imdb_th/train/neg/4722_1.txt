Do not watch Serbian documentaries and Serbian propaganda beware of this and you will see facts and truths. http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ <br/> <br /> The Death of Yugoslavia series (from the five episodes) is a story that is carefully collected and researched about the many bloodshed that is the end. Of the old Yugoslav Federation and spanning almost the first half of 1990. It has many news images and interviews with both stakeholders. "Yugoslavia" and other "real" developments that can only lead to this remarkable achievement are the combination of developments in the Balkans later since the program was created. This was a real action in the late 1990s for repeated performances on BBC television. But adding some recent events will help make this piece more detailed and awesome. Maybe all other episodes may be guaranteed? The short story title of this documentary was created more appropriately by abandoning the word "Yugoslavia" at this time by the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro, which is the name of the current federation. <br /> Not the same story as in "Yugoslavia: an inevitable war (1999)"
