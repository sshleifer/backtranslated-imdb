It seems that everyone can make movies now. It's like everything you need is a camera, a group of people who will be your actors and teams, scripts and money and a little walla that you have movies. The problem is that talent is not always part of this equation and often this low-budget movie becomes a favorite. The video storage rack is full of movies called these. These things are not a miserable pleasure. But it's just a celluloid that has been forgotten. Troma Entertainment It is well known for creating garbage cinema. But most of their movies are golden movies However, some movies that they bring out, they do not have any connection to the creation, and something like 'Nightmare Weekend' does not deserve to be released in all its forms. The best thing they can do with lousy materials. Some unintentional hilarity Move quickly (should take 81 minutes) <br /> <br /> Cons: Scary writing that includes boring dialogue and countless plot holes. The lighting is not good, especially night scenes and endings that you can't do. Do not make guilt, bad rating, impact, cheap and very old. The lack of character development entirely and you will not care about anyone. This should be a horror movie. But it lacks in that area and is not scary Nothing interesting or exciting happens. Full of unnecessary fill. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: I never expected this to be a forgotten gem. But I never thought it would be bad I don't know it's the worst movie ever created. But it's a clear competitor. Troma should let this movie rotten instead of letting it be free. Don't make the same mistakes as I do and let your curiosity get the best from you. <br /> <br /> My score: 1/5
