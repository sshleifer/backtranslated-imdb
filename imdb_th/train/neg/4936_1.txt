I waste time and give this opportunity This is one of the worst new programs. If they receive a reward to show that they suck, this should sweep the category. The performance is not good and the story is planned. Now the dinosaurs are a little strange. But at least it's fun The show took three seasons and was eventually copied. This new item is based on the advertising of the insurance company, not a joke and nothing actually happens. May be the original advertising and the number of times they are and still there is something wrong with this show Just came to the TV and we were tired of seeing the character "caveman"
