After reading the comments, it became clear that everyone had this work. It is very boring. Oh, it's a good day and nothing is the same. From all the comments, no one shows any emotions with this or other work. <br /> <br /> I grew up after the end of the steam and gem era. It is an annual film that is made around and filling the seat by mocking fart, giggling, giggling like yourself or being yourself. And it was the filler of the theater at that time Almost as big as the Wizard of Oz. <br /> <br /> IMDb insists that every comment has something about the plot. The problem is that it's a template. Randolph Scott (Cowboy / Hero) Collect friends and beat those evil people. Cheers! <br /> <br /> Every kid thinks that plot before we take a look at the quarter. That's just the plot of Scott's story. John Wayne Roy Rogers, who had created If you take the time to go back and review each movie - don't be surprised. <br /> <br /> You have to remember the context of time. Have more or less TV No, for children, there are schools with excellent outdoor activities, with guns, toys without cyber time. And the steam era collapsed But such movies provide entertainment and fulfill the imagination of young whipper Even girls can do it. <br /> <br /> This movie is entertainment. And it is unreasonable as it is today It has the original purpose of being a propaganda. But quickly became a movie for children. <br /> <br /> Our father had a real experience. And it will not be until Sam Peckinpah in the next ten years, which eventually clears the red blood stains that are imitated in realistic quantities and Not until his director dies slowly with pain and misery Until the Peckinpah and gun battles were bloodless. Thank you. <br /> <br /> To watch movies with little or no blood, adults don't mind. I think they wouldn't tolerate No courage to spray the life of shattering plants. So this movie is so elegant and without blood. Gung Ho is suitable for children. <br /> <br /> You will see that I set four levels for this score. Why do I have to do that? D. It's a very bad movie. No matter how I love it I love this movie because it brings a very happy moment in my childhood back. But it is not a good thing for movies in terms of quality Essentially, Gung Ho changed to a romantic novel for children. <br /> <br /> People should definitely look at it. I'm not saying to stay away. However, realistically. Simple plot, superficial characters. They are shoals. You can love bad movies.
