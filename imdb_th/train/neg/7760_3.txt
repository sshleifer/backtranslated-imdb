In Fiji, Valalola Resort Primal Park's greed and unscrupulous owners invite investors and guests to join his compound launch party, consisting of hotels and zoos that aim to find partners for his discovery When the small bandits in the college form a virus in the security system to participate in the scavenger hunt sabretoothes from prehistoric times developed from DNA found in fossils? Escape to kill host and guardian for entertainment. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Sabretooth" is weak and inexpensive. It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The characters are scary and not funny or pleasant, and the story is a formidable Jurassik Park and has a bad collection. In general, all lines and situations are bad and stupid. But the winner is when the guardian explains that the sabretoothes are scary and like to kill for happiness. My score is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ataque do Dente de Saber" ("Sabretooth's attack")
