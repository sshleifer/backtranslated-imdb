My friend and I rented this movie for $ 2.50 and both of us agreed with one thing: <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Me and friends. My count of 475 appointments (representing 95% of the movie) <br /> <br /> So say in another way: Watch this movie until you lose money! And I do that. <br /> <br />
