I watched this movie recently on DVD and I have to say I'm not impressed. I know it is forbidden to knock an independent movie. But this person feels unhappy. <br /> <br /> Interesting place But its operation is shortened I found myself thinking "It doesn't matter. They just got in. The story will come soon." Before I realized that the film was over and the story never picked up. I can't say that I found that all performances were impressive as well. It's quite bad, not Star Wars prequel trilogy. Not good, but not good. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the time is. I will spend two hours. (Because it is a safe estimate) However, when the film is finished, I feel as if I deserve some recognition for the power of intention that I try to not stop the film and walk half way Once I was thoroughly impressed And finally bored out of my wit I'm not one of those people who want action scenes and quick explosions in movies, so don't start with me because that's the reason I don't like it.
