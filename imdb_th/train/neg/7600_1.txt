This film proves that good performances come from good directions and this doesn't happen in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a good actor. But in this story, he is a boy and a youth. Why did Donald Sutherland meet an amateur? Because the script is bad, the adjustment is terrible and the actors seem to be bored. The atmosphere of this movie is terrible - I can think of it only when it is finished and halfway off. The director did a terrible job, and although I didn't read this novel The atmosphere in this movie tries to make it happen and the message and story never reach the audience. In one word, it's a movie TERRIBLE.
