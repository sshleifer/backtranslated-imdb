The revolution is a scary movie. I don't care if you are a history teacher. Al Pacino fan journalist. There is no way that this movie will receive the '10'. The correct point to the plot is Tom Dobb (Al) tries to earn money from the notes he received from a patriot carrying his boat. Everything revolves around that note. Tom's son joins the army to make a record, making Tom join the army as well. They go out on an adventure that tries to get out of the army many years later. The war ends. A few scenes and they are quite the best Interlude during use scenes "Five months later" and put the characters in the famous historical battle Love stories are funny and movies as a whole are difficult to follow. So save your "notes" and watch the Patriots instead.
