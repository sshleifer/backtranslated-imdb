I wonder how the actors act in this movie. Annette Banning is really herself. She pretends or is natural, right? It didn't make any difference when considering that even though she was walking on the ceiling, it would not change the style of the movie. Brian Cox performed very well. I almost thought that he had done this all the way, cunning, dishonest, in a dirty environment where no one really cared about hygiene. For Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is what she did in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is quite nasty and disgusting. Who will pay to see shit like this?
