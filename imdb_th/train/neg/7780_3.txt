I can hardly nod or just close this idea. But I decided to take it out, just because of the reason that something might happen * Make a monster movie That's what he wants. What appears to be many performances, whether it's a hammam or just a mundane and without merit, and a scene that seems to repeat itself like a monster attacking in the river water (Oh, and luckily, women just happened to Naked in your body ... even if there is an abnormality!) <br /> <br /> This is just nonsense. But I think it's not too dangerous. It's not disgusting at least, and once or twice we get a semi-interesting look at Brazil's "culture" (a father who walks through the city with a flock of sheep or other parts of the appearance of 'Hey, this is not America!') But any hope that the director had in selecting the Dimum or Carradine was struck by the best foot and in the worst and boring conversation. It didn't help anything when we finally saw monsters and actions. "That happened", in the end it was stupidly and attractively staged. Usually I feel sorry for filmmakers who have a lot of problems in photography, especially - in this case it takes a better part in the mid-70s, but with Monstroid or Monster or whatever is called. ..nah. <br /> If you get two Elvira DVD features of this story (bad print, poor transfer quality) and Blue Sunshine, don't forget to jump over. Of course, you are not Elvis who is hardened and can't help himself to hear her luscious comments. Personally, I would like Joel or Mike Nelson and the robot from the Mystery Science Theater on this roast turkey.
