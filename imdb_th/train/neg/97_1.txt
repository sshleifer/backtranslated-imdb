I have never seen many low-budget movies that I have to accept. But this is the worst movie ever, the main character that the old man said, like he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word Old years can do better. The story has the most horrible plot, and the army men put things that he thinks are such an army, and then walk up to the top. Lead. I can't believe it is under 2 nights rental at Bus Buster. Instead, please bring this thing for free and take it out of our eyes. I think there are half the famous actors besides women. I think the only thing that is ok with budget is makeup. But they show all the important scenes of the movie in the beginning song bits Just awful awesome
