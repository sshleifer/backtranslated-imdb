I just saw this film tonight and I have to say it's cluttered. I love Vince Vaughn but he ends up irritated at the jokes here and this film is more than a remake of the classic 80s "Santa Claus movie" classic. Soon, but there is no worst camp or Sheena Easton song. Your story is a black sheep family in a family that comes back to face his family on holidays. But with the North Pole Of course, Fred (Vince Vaughan) is a family that has to go home after the latter set, including his girlfriend. (Rachel Weis in the cameo role) dumped him, so he went home to confront his parents. Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti) and the strange, high jink followed by the brothers' race and a little anarky as well as threatening Christmas. all Now, if you think you know the ending of this movie, I think you will say it right because it's a predictable story on the hill. For the Vince Vaughan performance, playing as a cute loser as well, he always plays. But this time he became more annoying than being a favorite. Miranda Richardson played Mrs. Claus. But the role is less than one note Most of the characters, other than nervous jokes and Kevin Spacey, ended up playing the same person that he played in the movie "Glengarry Glen Ross" but a little bit. The only two actors who came out of this movie with their honor were Paul Giamatti, who brought sincerity and warmth to his role as Santa Claus. But he seemed rather embarrassed to be in this movie. Weisz, who had more acting with a smaller role than most of the main actors doing with them, was a shame because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserved. What is better than what this script gives them? <br /> <br /> If it's short, it's a big disappointment.
