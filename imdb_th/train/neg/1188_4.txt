Kurosawa really blows in this one. Every genius is allowed to fail. The concept is good, but the action is blurred. <br /> <br /> There is a fantasy about this movie, making it an art movie Tokyo's poverty deserves a more fair and realistic image. Many people have interesting stories to tell. Very disappointing movie
