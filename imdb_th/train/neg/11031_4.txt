It's very interesting to see what the director is trying to do with this movie. But the problem is that it's not very good. There is nothing really original in this movie, and while the plot is well presented, the main character is quite shallow and you don't care about them. <br /> <br /> Quite polite (And sometimes seriously not good) photos can be removed as needed But I think you can't expect much from someone who has just made a cheap movie for this. It's not fair to review the movie and compare it to other high-budget movies. But alas, that's what we have to do. By itself, it's not very good And compared to others, it is still not very good But it is not possible without a good score! I like the plot. It was built quite well and connected at the end. Sometimes in a dark scene, it can really create an eerie feeling as well. <br /> <br /> However, in the end, this film can't make an impression. That character does not exist and we do not care about them at all. Everyone may die, but it is possible to identify. The last survivor from the beginning
