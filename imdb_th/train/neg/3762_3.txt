I brought this movie out of the blockbuster in one of the shelves. You get 5 movies per 20 coins. I must say that I have my money here. I expect to have scary conversations, crappy monsters and shaky cameras. As Metlove said that the second part is not bad. <br /> <br /> The performance is not good, although not as bad as some movies I've seen. Or maybe I've watched movies with a very low budget. Recently, I didn't look. There are some things that the performance is terrible. But most of the level of playing at high school, at least <br /> <br /> CG for Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second worst part. The first thing I thought when I saw it (And I noticed other critics agree with me) is that men in monkey suits should be better The clunky animation-stop animation seems to be better. <br /> <br /> You might ask why I'm calling CG as the worst part. That's because the worst part of the movie is the sound effect. They are loud, annoying and constant. I have been camping. I know that insects sound like in the forest at night and while they can be loud, they do not make deaf like a hubbub in this film. Usually when the "background" sound dumps the dialogue of the movie, it is a bad thing. But from what I received from the dialogue of this movie, I didn't get lost much With the characters When talking about the characters, they are all But with cut and tender cookies The only gentle conversation is between ... Actually, I can't think of anything. There is one or two lines that make me smile. But that's about it. <br /> <br /> The movie is good. One or two steps above what you see in this movie. However, it still has features. "Home movies" that you get from movies that change pocket and prayer Dollar thinking about grabbing it. Otherwise, stay away from all costs.
