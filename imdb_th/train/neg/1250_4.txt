I have to admit that "The New Imagination" of the original 1968 movie is very disappointing. Special when considering that this is Tim Burton's movie. He is one of the most original and I would like to say that the best director from Hollywood has created <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of his own work of monkeys. I enjoy original movies. Really When it came out for the first time, people expect to have only another 80's cheezie science fiction. But surprise and prove that the theory is all wrong It has definite messages. Clear anti-war message The fear of the Cold War that is bringing the world and fear of using nuclear weapons plays an important role in the minds of filmmakers. For these reasons, making this film beyond expectations and becoming a classic movie immediately Although the new movie "Rebuilding" or whatever makes us have nothing left There is no ideal message behind. It's just a summer blockbuster that cares about money. <br /> <br /> Tim Burton's eyes don't let you down. The dark and creepy settings are excellent and of course the makeup is excellent. <br /> <br /> Obviously not enough to make people fall in the movie. Must have an exciting storyline or story In this film, the story is not very interesting and is a very bad idea. The script is very lame and filled with spaces. It seems that this movie will be written quickly. Explanation of why the monkey that is there and why the world ruler is so stupid and proves that the writer didn't know about it /> For example; Why do monkeys speak English? Why are there other monkeys other than chimpanzees on earth? (Because only chimpanzees in the spacecraft that hit the earth) Where did those humans come from? How can chimpanzees develop into all kinds of monkeys in just a few thousand years? (I mean, we spent a few million years in evolution from monkeys to humans!) <br /> <br /> And in the end, a bad surprise, the ending is just a dumb plane. Maybe because the original movie had such an end, they felt that the audience was expecting to end the same. The ending also raises many questions, which I know that there are no wise answers. Does Theid learn to work with a spacecraft? Which is powerless and learns to fly back in time and control the world with one hand? And what he did to all women And said that that would happen, I doubt very much that history will still be the same, like Washington will be built as it is today! (I mean, no big bananas instead of souvenirs?) <br /> <br /> Well, just say something about this movie. Some actors are very good. The character of Helen Bonham Carter is interesting and works as well as Tim Roth as Thid. He is a very good person who is quite a bit excited at some point of the movie. Michael Clark Duncan also works. I am not happy with Marc Whalberg. He is not an actor and plays here as a character that is not very colorful. Not very reliable and nothing compared to the original Hestons characters and main female characters, no reason or place in the movie. She has just been screened. Hardly speaking a word throughout the story. <br /> <br /> I think in the future when people think about Planet of the Apes, they will think of the original. Will be forgotten soon
