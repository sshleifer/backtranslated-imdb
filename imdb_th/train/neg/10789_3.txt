If you expect to see a lot in Altıoklar's bathtub because of a contract with the tag line, you will be very disappointed that the film has nothing but Altuloklar style about the most famous issues like sex, marriage and cheating. Which appears to appear from nowhere and is not involved or any plot proving that Altıoklar was not successful in "try anything M "as he claimed. For a lot of sex-oriented jokes, it seems to show that Altiloklar fell in love with the famous words: "Selling sex" I hope to see a very good story told by a very good storytelling technique. However, in the end, I found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching Altıoklar's experiments. But still focus on popular works
