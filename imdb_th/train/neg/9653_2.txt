I'm just wondering what the purpose of filmmaking is, profit or not, and who they claim that intelligence requires your brain to see something like this shit? This movie can be watched by children under 3 years. If you are an adult, do not try to watch. The reason I think Hollywood started using cartoons in movies with actors like this is that you have to forget the movie art, make sure you have a lot of popcorn to spend the time to pass until the movie ends With your hamburger Your laptop, mobile phone, this movie can be easily used in restaurants. But of course, not in my dog ​​theater, which is always attached to my family when watching movies from the building. Of course, this film refers to people who don't. Demand from art in the cinema, the only thing that this film can be used for viewing when making a supermarket shopping list. I give 2 stars to support the efforts in Indian cinema. But nothing more or less ..
