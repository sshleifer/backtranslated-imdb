What a bad movie! I tried without forwarding quickly ... It failed. After about 30 minutes, I stopped watching the movie online to see how many times this disaster occurred (just 84 minutes, still wow!). It's a movie. Boring and boring I don't think anyone can fall down by being hit by a fluorescent tube. One funny thing is that I watched the movie "The Killer Cut". The box stated that "More blood!" "More sex!" "More fear than drama!" Oops! If this movie is terrible with all claims, I wonder how "UN-Killer Cut" is crippled? If you want to watch great movies about the world of life and the world of death, see the Night of the Living Dead series !!
