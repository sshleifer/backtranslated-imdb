In one word: excruciating, I was instructed to read an article about the philosophical meaning of this film. But after watching the endless 115-minute movie and being crushed slowly under the bulging symbol and lava oppression, it looks better than reporting my reaction to the movie. In the end, who will go to see a movie with a course in hand? And this flick was troubled by the actor Claude Laydu from the film's debut until the end, wearing a boring and annoying mask like wearing a mask that could not be distinguished from boring dubbed voice Filming for a movie might be better than letting the audience listen to them while they say the same thing: Ambricourt's priest is a miserable human being. A story about a persecuted priest who seeks to help a wealthy family with a problem not doing anything to create a character that is interesting or sympathetic from a distance, while the family is a group of strange, unwanted people and monks. . The last 30 minutes shows a remarkable message about the grace and suffering of a man that is equal to others. The torture of Laydu and the vague description of Robert Bresson's script. All I feel is in the end. It ended with ice cream as well. Interesting thing for fans of Paul Schrader, who is a fan of Bresson, just to see how the character's elements and settings Schrader performs in the script and movies of their own. "Taxidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper"
