Painful. Pain is the only word that describes the dreadful actions of Shakespeare plays that are fun and interesting. I give it, but feel very disappointed and unable to even watch it end For those who write novels about the great distortion of this great Ado, I pity you and your bored brain. Let your excuse about the young audience being raised without penalty. Please do not worry about gutting in the intestines. This is a disgusting excuse for Shakespeare's drama. You will be forced to vomit and have to have a pot near the television that you choose to watch this shit because the defecation is not intended to happen.
