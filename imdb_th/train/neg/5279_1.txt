My friends tend to endure many desperate movies. But this movie is too bad for us to watch it until the end. It was boring and unfounded. No, even the "hot" women who star in this movie still make me look. Everything is predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> The performance is sometimes good ..... but worse than before. The most annoying character in all movies that you want to die must be the main character who is the best friend. The more I see him, the more I want to smash my screen. (You know that the ugly boy I am talking about) <br /> <br /> The story has been done many times before I think they should be sued by other movie companies. OK, it's a thought. good But that's all this movie has <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie can be viewed by yourself to record abuse from your friends. Or if you don't have anything better than this
