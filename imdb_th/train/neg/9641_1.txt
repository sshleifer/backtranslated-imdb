If you are watching this movie, you are a Fred Olen Ray fan. You find it on the shelves at $ 4.99 at Suncoast and think "What do I have to lose?" Or you rotate around the video store where you close your eyes. And rent the first movie at your finger. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. It has everything a movie needs: a script with jaw dialogues and a messy detour in a strange science storyline that involves psychology and other dimensions. The continuity that seems to travel through the worm in time and space. That not only Seems to be a border on a naked image that is worthless (Not all you need to ask) and of course, a 5-inch monster that is played by what I consider Fred's son Olen Ray. <br /> <br /> Underneath, however, there are some things like hearts - as if Mickey. And Judy decided to include all the children in the neighborhood and create a monster movie (Hey! My father can be directed! Yes, we can use red from me. Johnny's father's hardware store and I know that this former stripper can do the job!) <br /> <br /> See the eel release on credit - you'll know why the last movie <br /> <br /> Biohazard II ... Alien Force should be worth looking at, but it's not worth having this fun crappy veneer.
