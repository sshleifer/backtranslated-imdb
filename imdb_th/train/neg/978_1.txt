I watched this movie recently along with my sister who likes Sophia Loren's performance. I am the person they call piracy. I hate art in any form or style. Rambo is a horror action movie. If you know yourself in this story, avoid this movie like the plague. No one dies. No action. No nudity. Nothing. Let me write your resume in a few sentences. It started with a 5-minute black and white Nazi propaganda. Every Italian in the residential building would join the parade in honor of Hitler, except for housewives, anti-dictators The housewife who was cheated by her husband met with anti-fascists. She fell in love, he wanted to love him. But fascism is gay Despite this, they love each other. At the end of the day, housewives read books from her gay lovers and men were exiled by the ending agents. Do you want a shorter or tedious resume ... short enough? The man should use his gun at the beginning of this movie and shoot himself to save the audience from this cruelty. On the note side, my sister loves this movie. As I said, I am a cultural barbarian ...
