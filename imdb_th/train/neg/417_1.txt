I go to the cinema every week or so and check this website regularly. But never before, I felt compelled to comment on the movie. <br /> <br /> In my program, all the time of shockingly bad movies - Last Man Standing, Spawn, The Bone Collector - Now, I can add a sliding path that is 'Hollow Man'. <br /> <br /> From the ironic, long-term open title through actors and teams combined with an alphabetti spaghetti - Until the last episode of insulting - recording the number of worlds and chapters The most ridiculous and acting that was done in the cinema - this movie is horrible and only an impressive graphics computer that makes you don't have to go far before the end. <br /> <br /> This is not just My opinion - it belongs to my friends and everyone around us. When most viewers laughed and groaned during and after the deadly thriller, it was clear that this movie would be hopeless. <br /> <br /> Not only that. The director takes action beyond the limits of realistic fares for violent movies and enters the realm of the popular blood B movie. It is difficult not to imagine that the director is an old man who is dirty because the extent of the invisible of the man that is not seen from the lab and into the outside world extends only two times to feel the chest. Maybe having sex may be the first thing in the mind of a bloke if you can't see it. But apart from the beautiful satisfaction of the women involved, it almost makes the theater fun. <br /> <br /> [Track spoiler] <br /> <br >> See the sick movies and things. Worse than before While Kevin Bacon did a good job of showing more twists as The 'hollow man', the rest of them - perhaps a disabled person with a scary script - serves better as a hollow actor. A member of the team was found strangled in a locker by an invisible man. "He eventually lost consciousness." Shrugged off a colleague without emotion. This is normal for the course and the lab team, swinging between the full fear and full indifference at the speed at which you wonder how they will be shown. They walked along the path in the lab, fearing the gun was stable. But after a few seconds later, one of the crew jumped back to the path of happiness to receive the blood of injured colleagues. The chief woman treats the man with disrespect, politeness and good humor, even after he despises her and seems to have a slight reaction to his breakout, even though he drowned the Pentagon leader. "He drowned in the pool last night." The same woman couldn't bring two and two together beautifully. <br /> <br /> The script was strewn with pedestrian conversations that didn't behave like this and The rest is the AZ of film cliches, which are placed on the thickness and The faster the movie progresses to the point of unbelief and complete entertainment. <br /> <br /> The time when the 'Eureka' computer women are loosening the clothes on the security video looping-list window. Really is Endless - Predictions do not care about the strength of numbers, the decision not to kill two main stars. But just place them in places that are likely to have died and let them be on their own devices The woman explodes and pokes the coun, the explosion of the fireball that just burned before reaching the hero, the falling elevator that just stopped before colliding with them, and more than anything else, the immortality of the bad. <br /> Burning into small pieces with an electric sprayer that does not use electricity. Around the head of a bar that just cut a few actors, then survived the explosion of the fireball and the total destruction of the room. Lot B. More than enough life to climb through the fireballs for the final pop-up of the hero in the movie - where the unbelieving audience is flattering and looking at their watches. <br /> <br /> That movie This is not good. The theater is astounding. Even the film's name is hopeless like the movie itself, and there are no special effects that are close to recording this movie, which should be avoided at all costs.
