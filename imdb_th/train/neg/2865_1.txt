In general, I do not delete, and if this site I will give this movie -3 from 10 meaning I really hate this movie. I think Uwe Boll alone in the dark is the worst thing I have ever seen. But at least I gave 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion (Stephen Dorf filmed what made me laugh If it's against Bloodrayne, Bloodrayne will win an Academy Award for best movie if they compete. <br /> <br /> Now, this plot is about a good BTK killer, but they He can do better than the beginning. But that is I have to move forward quickly because of the dull death. I like killer movies and even if they suck, they can still get a great death. I'm not a fancy movie expert. But believe me that he will shoot himself if he sees this Sorry for traveling But there is nothing good to say about this, because it looks like someone has taken a video camera and shot it .. This is what is a disaster. Uwe Boll, your movie is not on the list of the worst movies anymore. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I can't explain the plot (if any), but that's the best thing I can do. Now, if you don't mind, I'll crawl into one corner and move around and remind me how much this movie made me scared for life .... OK, not for life.
