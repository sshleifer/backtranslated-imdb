If this book is still faithful to the book, we can conclude that the author does not know history. Mark Anthony never died from injuries received from the fight as it appeared. He died from being a coward by killing himself and then he asked his slave to do it for him. Slaves choose to commit suicide instead. In the true story, Mark Anthony was ashamed of the great courage of slaves and decided to copy him. But despite his death, Mark Anthony was a drunkard and failed in his own suicide attempt. He cried to Cleopatra and was taken to her blood. She dragged his litter up on the rope and Mark Anthony died shortly thereafter. If you want history, don't watch this movie. If you want romance, then you might enjoy it!
