During the filming of the video at the initial price of Crazy Fat Ethel II, I wonder if it's the same movie that is on the cover or not. Unfortunately it is The story is simple and unreasonable. Ethel, a madman who kills people with eating disorders, is released into the house halfway through the crowded hospital She is the most sane person, while a man puts a dead fly into another person's soup. Ethel will be teased by one of the half-house employees with a chocolate bar after he meets the measures to reduce the cost of raising dog food. Ethel responded by strangling him with a loop at the stairs and then .... You already understand. If this sounds fun, it is not so. This film is not good, with cheap effects and worse performances. The character looks very good when submitting a chapter that they should stand out in front of the cigar shop. In order to make the story worse, half of the film contains retrospective stories in Ethel Criminally Insane's first film, which is a little better. Terrible effort
