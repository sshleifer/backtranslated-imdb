I saw this movie with the intention of not liking it. I'm not sure. It's one of the movies that seems to have been created for Oscar, especially: music throughout the movie in almost every frame, almost no rudeness. In a time that is long gone A genius that describes everything he thinks and summarizes in sfx / cgi so that we (stupid viewers) get it. One thing that makes me feel fun is the fact that they misspelled the Nobel price! They call the Nobel price instead. (Named after the real person called Alfred Nobel) 'The Highest Price' .. Jesus! How can we make a big mistake in production, based on real stories? It's a scam! What do you and others think of RON?
