This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I love Japanese movies and I think other films by the same director are 80,000 v fire dragon, a masterpiece. I want to like this movie very much - asano is a great actor and the story is very attractive. But I can't find anything fun about it. <br /> <br /> The movie takes forever, nothing happens. And the effects that the director uses - such as continuous percussion and the use of very slow motion - add to my increased annoyance in the fact that the plot is Very slow Many boredom is the result of a completely unnecessary external addiction - such as spending an hour traveling around Asano to go around the statue of Buddha, cut in pieces and declare that he doesn't worship at all This does not add anything to the plot. A Japanese movie friend and I constantly check the time. We don't want to believe that this movie is scary. And the ending was terrible I think at least the director will try to reward the audience that handled this. But sadly I misunderstood
