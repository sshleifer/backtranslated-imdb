A few years ago with people who created Paris J'TAIME, which was not perfect but very fun (my score is 7). Create this junk about New York City <br /> <br /> In Paris, I Love You ( J'taime) created a feeling for Paris and it was created in many parts of Paris that are beautiful. <br /> <br /> In this movie I don't know New York City, I don't feel. <br /> <br /> New York has 5 cities. I don't see the scenes in The Bronx or Queens. There is one scene in Brooklyn (Brighton Beach). I see no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village / No scenes of a hotel or a beautiful theater It has a large character, most actors are not stereotyped, they are the lowest level caricature. <br /> <br /> Very little funny moments are about sex or insulting people. another New Yorkers we know and love .. <br /> <br /> Some movies nominated for 'razzie' awards are much better. <br /> <br /> Score: * (from 4) 20 Score (out of 100) IMDb 1 (from 10) <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I think the name should be <br /> <br /> New York. I hate you.
