Just have to write that one liner. But it's true I love the gangster genre and this is the weakest point I've seen in the last few years. I received praise for everyone involved in most aspects except the most important script. It is a weak story about a minor criminal offense. There is no number of good performances or black and white film styles that can compensate for overall deficiency. I love Kevin Spacey and I hear that he will make another movie about generals. My advice is not to waste time.
