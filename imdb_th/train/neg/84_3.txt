When I was a child, I thought that the weapon that the killer held was cool. But i am a kid and i am so stupid Even being a fool But the story of the movie is stupid and slightly boring when the killer doesn't use a light knife to kill people. What surprised me is that this film has a very strong character in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie because it was the most boring and one way to show the light of the sword at a very small level? The plot is sometimes incomprehensible and the end is chaotic. Completely It seems that all the movies revolve around aliens and one weapon. The plot has two children and some friends who have confronted the alien flash a year later and seem to be back in the same mix. Dead animals and will be explored and for some reason, a friend receives alien weapons and how to use it for fun, killing very lightly. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was created if you have a killer with a good death scene. If you have a confrontation with aliens showing more than a strange light vortex, then spontaneously summon That Star Wars
