I'm sorry, but this is really pathetic. The little girl is a little boy. There are no fun characters and a plot. In addition, it is not a gator, just like movies that want us to believe. If you look at the complete guide about reptiles, you will find that it is a real crocodile, not a crocodile Obviously they do not hire real animal experts or they will know that the creature is a monster. It's a sad excuse for the movie. Especially the ending I almost fell asleep with this one.
