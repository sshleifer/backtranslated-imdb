I caught this small projection film held by members of my college game club. We have been warned in advance that this will be "The gaming craze" and the film more than delivered. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays Robbie. The young man begins his college career after "resting" for the term. The audience that we see as the progress of the movie is Robbie, wearing a role-playing game called "Mazes and Monsters", a game that he is familiar with after the recruitment game for campaigning. /> <br /> This movie is worth it In many levels, one scene has a group. "Playing games with candlelight" which may be the best way I can explain While I'm sure this means "cultured" in some ways, as most gamers know it is horribly wrong. Most of the role-playing roles are done in a well-lit room, usually more than chee-tohs and canned soda. <br /> <br /> Performances while not being a talented Oscar. In the first role of Tom Hanks and Boss, friends and bachelor parties are still a year or two ago. Supporting actors, while still not very memorable, still deliver good performances. <br /> <br /> Most of the badness is in the fact that it's a movie created for the TV show. "The dangers of playing games" worth it. See if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
