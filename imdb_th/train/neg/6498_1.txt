I've seen bad movies before But this movie has won "The worst movie in life" by far !! Anthony Hopkins must be completely mentally ill to have his name attached to this one - everywhere! I will never see other films with him in the director and others! I do not want to believe other actors and actresses that I like (in this picture) that bow down to become part of this disaster! There must be a good medicine out there! For those who are not ashamed to be part of this movie Save your money on this! Many from beginning to end! Embarrassed by Mr. Hopkins! It is also a shame in Christian Slater! I can't believe that you put your reputation on the line for this one!
