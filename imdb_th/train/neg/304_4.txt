This film shows that Ruth is a cute woman who drinks too much, plays too much with a small baseball throw in. Ruth's childhood life is quite interesting. In addition, Lou Gehrig is covered. With almost no, and this is a relationship that is well known, bad or indifferent. It should be better protected His life is worse than anything else. He is an American hero, an icon that many baseball players use their lives. I feel that I am fair with the memories of the great baseball players that this movie is not interested in. Disgraceful in the creator of this film for the sake of his mistakes and not his greatness.
