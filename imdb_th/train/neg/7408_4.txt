I'm not sure why I clicked "There is a spoiler" because there are not enough explanations ever given in the movie to know what should happen. <br /> <br /> Most eyes deliver. In addition to the rubber mask monsters in the 1980s, I would say that now before watching this thing, I have never seen the band Lordi or know nothing about them as they win Eurovision. Obviously, the monster in this story is a member. Of any band in the musical theater. However, I do not know this while watching. I just think that most monsters / demons are just enough. <br /> <br /> I'm almost sure that there is a semi-coherent explanation behind what we see on the screen. Better if you don't really know. It might be incredibly lame. Think about it. Action makes it spin well enough to keep the audience entertained for the most part, even though half of the fun factor about wtf is likely to happen in this movie. <br /> < br /> I gave four things Mostly because I got a good laugh from it, especially from the way it describes what is so beautiful. Must be the mood that I have encountered But I found Hella funny for some reason. Then I searched for movies on the internet and found that no one knew what it should be about. That makes me more fun and increases my score by another half to 4/10. <br /> <br /> It's not scary or special contact. But it is quite good both visually and acoustically Overall far from necessary But can watch Do not expect too much and do not expect to have a reason and may keep you entertained if you are in the right mood.
