I have never seen this movie for a long time. But thought that I would continue to comment on it, mainly because of the memory of disliking it, so it was burned in my memory, my memory intently. THE GETAWAY originally had no reward to start. But at least there is a difference of being 1) Sam Peckinpah movie, 2) Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens 3) is a rather painful way to explode one hour And half of the time. <br /> <br /> From the 1994 version comparison, it was less than the dressing table for Alex Baldwin, Red Hot and Alex Basinger. The wife soon divorced. McQueen and Allie McBride, his wife, later separated shortly after the film was created and we were able to arrange Baldwins in their marriage council, arguing that anyone thought Stupid to make this movie. <br /> <br /> Let's talk and go far - Alec Baldwin is never and will not be close to Cooler King and one of the reasons why taking drugs. This is very annoying to me. Understanding of Baldwin Challenging our memories of Steve McQueen in the same role as others, pointing out the vision of Peckinpah in 1972 as a satire, which means imitating the action / adventure in a way. On the contrary, Baldwin Bassinger and the company seem to be trying to make the sound more violent, with only Michael Madsen's and James Woods' villainous characters that are as slim as those who come out like people. <br /> <br /> The film was significant as well. Lively and different in the basic level that is hard to say View only once is more than enough, not just because it's nothing new to offer. In fact, Peckinpah's movie is a small, stylish entertainment with an energetic mood. This version is a slogan that takes too long to contain a small amount or nothing. There is no artistic urgency in its existence and some uncomfortable scenes make you feel uneasy to make them enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> So I don't know if this may be one of the movies. That helps In order to start the wave of a costly budget, a new, ridiculous budget created around the famous actor / actor, which in itself is not really good. I often see filmmakers at least trying to find new ideas for this movie. This movie made me want to pull the eyebrows out and it revealed that in the last 15 years since the launch, Mr. Baldwin has become widely known as one of the biggest jerks in Hollywood. Thank God for "Team America" ​​that placed him instead. <br /> <br /> 3/10
