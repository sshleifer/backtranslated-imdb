A potential film exhibition that was set up in the 19th century, could not be produced. With big names actors like Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and many others. There is no reason for this movie to fail. However, this film has no ending. There is an excuse to apologize for plotting and falling apart with continuity. General stories of wealthy girls and poor children brought together in love and destroyed by beauty. (Or lack of beauty) and the disapproval has a touching side of the mother's first death Father played by Finney, who was disturbed, tortured his daughter in life, including death. He believed that the daughters would not destroy their wealth by marriage under their social status. The actor tries to salvage the rest of the story. Washington Square is a black hole of destruction and destruction, destroying the precious moments of those who watch sadly. I gave this movie 1 instead of 0 for the actor's efforts. Save yourself from Washington Square
