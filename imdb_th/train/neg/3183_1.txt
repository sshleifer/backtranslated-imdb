Sergio Leone spins in his grave ... If there is any movie that tramples the life of a man The main character of "Lone Wolf" The bravado is not interesting and weak, and the script is written by a monkey with eight levels of education. Anyone who thinks this should be a whipping horse The only reason I take time to get rid of is because it has a minimum of 10 lines. Sergio Leone's family should not sue, not because it is nonsense. But because it's now immortal by MST 3000, the shame disgusts me for blaming Hollywood ... At least Gary Busey makes shit that won't offend anyone. But cocaine users and weapons experts ... this movie is a real blasphemy
