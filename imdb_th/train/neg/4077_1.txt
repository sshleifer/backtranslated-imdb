What will you get when you have bad performances, bad directors, long scenes, scary, terrible light? You can. Jessica: Ghost stories seem to be shooting on Betagam, which is okay. But the light must watch this media In this case, it doesn't have some CU that the person's face is in the shadows. One particular scene is the scene where the psychiatrist It's funny if you ask me. Some scenes are so long that they can easily cut in half ... but I guess they won't have a long film. The main character is incredibly flat. He is a LEAD male. So he should have some "hero" elements for his character, but he doesn't. He sobbing and scared of the entire movie. Although the light is terrible, I must say that they have good camera movements. Unfortunately, the light is not visited. The cover of the DVD is good and that is a terrible end.
