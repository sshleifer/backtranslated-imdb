First of all, this movie reminds me of old movies that I had to watch in religious school classes. That's not a good thing Essentially, it's just a piece of preachers who pretend and pretentious like the series. "Leave behind" scary. I'm not blasphemous. The movie ... but I was offended when these religious movies just happened horribly. I just want to say good things about Christian movies. But it doesn't seem to happen soon I bet that if you give a proper budget to the Bible, they still can't think of anything. Just avoid this one In addition, the fact that "American Family Association" (in general, the lack of Mr Wildmond) about this film on their website is another reason that I hate In fact, after I watched this thing, I went home and watched a copy of NC-17 by David Cronenberg, who was rated "Crash". Forgive me because my father sinned. Hahahahaha!
