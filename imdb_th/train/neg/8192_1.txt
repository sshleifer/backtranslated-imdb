I must say that this movie is so bad that I have to go out if I don't have to review it for work. The worst part is that I want to see it so bad that I drove around the city to pay a $ 10 parking lot twice because of the wrong newspaper list. Vince Vaughn plays the man he always does - the only time I saw him play Other people in this film with John Travolta. However, the plot has the potential - it sounds great in the preview. But it's full of ridiculous and predictable plot points. And I hope that this will be a Christmas movie that has to be recorded on Christmas, the DIDN and Santa doesn't need replacement. But not now. The only wonderful thing is riding The best character, I'm sure this movie will be good for young children. But for adults, it's so lame that it's boring to sit and watch.
