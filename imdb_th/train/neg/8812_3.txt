Unfortunately, the realism is boring. This movie, I think it will never end. It's better if every character gets baked in the first five minutes. Where's the Blade when you need him? While the horror is like fighting, shock, requesting dreams and nightmares as BOISE MOI, creating creatures is not as entertaining as the above mentioned movies. While eating meat in vain may make Jeffery Dalmers' heart dance a little faster. But it's not as interesting as RAVENOUS. In fact, I found it as interesting as late infomercials and as exciting as going to the dentist. If you have strong social qualifications, you may endure this matter. I am really surprised that this is not created by people at Brain Damage because that is the quality of dead creatures.
