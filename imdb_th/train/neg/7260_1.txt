"The City Called Hell" (also known as "The City Called the Damned") English / Spanish co-production was created on the heels of Clint Eastwood's success in Italy, making the ending "Man without a name". Templates used in most movies. This is to hire a well-known American actor whose career has deteriorated and dubbed their voice. This movie is no exception, except for the fact that they use some British actors as well. <br /> <br /> It's hard to summarize the plot. The story of a rebellion or anything that was led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau broke into the church and killed everyone inside, including the priest. Fast forward to the target city a few years later, the character Shaw disguised as a priest. The mayor of the city (Telly Savalas) is a cruel leader who does not think that he will have justice to his gun. <br /> <br /> Throw into the mixture. Alvira widow (Stella Stevens), her husband, killer The fact that she rode around in the dead burial chamber, like in a coffin, for God knows why. After the mayor was killed by his party, La Bomba (Al Lettieri), the city was invaded by a colonel (Landau) to search for a rebel leader (I apologized but the name escaped me). Forcing them to reveal the identity of the leader. <br /> <br /> Although they opened the film on the side, it was difficult to tell from the dialogue that the characters Landau and Shaw knew each other. The blind man (Fernandez) Noray) claimed that he could identify the rebel leader by touching his face. He did that and .............................................. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the headmaster is sorry for making this movie. It's just plain scary and deserves my scary score. "1" Shaw spends most of the movie that defines his trademark, staring at anyone who is useful. Even Landau was unable to recover this matter. The beautiful Stevens had to lose here as well. After just making the movie The Ballad of Cable Hogue of Peckinpah last year, I found it strange that she would appear in this film. Savalas created many of these images ("Pancho Villa" and "Horror Express" arrived. Mind) During his prekijic, Michael Craig was still in a position called "Paco". <br /> <br /> Fernando Rey appeared in many of these "West", even though he appeared. To play the villain in the movie "French Connection", two stories Al Lettieri Will appear with the role of "The Godfather" (1972) and go on to other memorable roles before he died in 1975 premature. <br /> <br /> In all fairness Instead of spending more than 95 or 97 minutes on the IMDb program, but I can't see that an additional 7 or 8 minutes will make a big difference. <br /> <br /> Avoid this problem.
