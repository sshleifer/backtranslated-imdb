If you watch the information of Corey Large here on IMDb, obviously there is a movie "Reload" in production (as of June 2008) which he plays as a character named Sebastian Cole. <br /> <br /> First of all This crappy movie will receive sequels ... and the second story, Sebastian, was not killed at the end of "Loaded". <br /> <br /> I watched it in a few hours. Morning when i Are fighting insomnia, so I drifted in and out while on I'm sure I missed some points. But overall it seems to be really weak The big show is (for me) one of the strongest parts of this movie. I was a little surprised that everyone commented on the beautiful girl because I thought that the actors who played Brooke were pretty but not special.
