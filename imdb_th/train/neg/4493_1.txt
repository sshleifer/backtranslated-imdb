I tried to delete what might be considered a spoiler. I also assume that you have seen the first movie or at least know the most important part, so if you don't have this, it may not be reasonable. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: This movie won more viewers. Headed along with the weary philosophical ramblings over and over again in an attempt to get a cross theme. We are attacked again and again by the question of purpose and destiny and choice and forced to endure long-suffering torture that consists of them. <br /> <br /> Neo, awakened from Dreaming in the last film Now he became aware of his own existence. There are a lot of revelations in this film, which I will be ambiguous about this, so they will not look like spoilers. <br /> <br /> * If you still worry that vague references will cause the movie to lose Do not read the paragraph below. * <br /> <br /> Reveal the strength and weakness of faith. The strengths and weaknesses of love and its temporary nature are also revealed. Human interdependence and technology and confidence in our technology are also revealed. The importance of selection and experience is revealed. Explaining the things revealed will be too detailed, so I will refrain from (According to the guidelines for writing explanatory questions) Btw by "Revealing" I mean breaking our ears and eyes like nails. <br /> <br /> Story: How did Neo and the gang get from the ending of the movie? Finally until the beginning of the next story In a nutshell, they maintain faith and use and use undue style actions and using bullets such as stylish times. (And after this show, I hope the movie viewers and producers will learn to appreciate the subtlety and originality a little bit more). More later In order not to lose anything, I will not say anything more than the promotional material that has already been done: Neo is still trying to find the matrix and he is looking for answers while trying to save all humans and Zion while The baddies are following him. And his friends This movie is quite better when the latest movie comes out. <br /> <br /> Action: While martial arts, action and gun play are considered as the starting point in the movie. This story focuses on martial arts rather than guns, sais, etc. in order to mix special effects, often being used and waving in front of the audience until it becomes really boring. I talked about this movie with friends and colleagues alike and almost all found some specific action sequences. "Smith's fight" that we all heard that in this film is too long and boring. This is a big red flag for action fans because the end of the action scene should make you want a little more content or great content that just happened. <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes These cannot be. They have more brilliance than the order above which is made of wood and not boring. In the first movie, there is a real sense of hopelessness with some actions. The feeling that the fight for survival is not just good. (Which I actually don't think they will handle in Reloaded anyway) in black movies and movies. Go to see Drunken Master or Iron Monkey after this movie to remind yourself what a good fight sequence is. In addition, the person "matrix talent" that has in Reloaded inconsistencies and what they actually do is inconsistent. The first film has inconsistencies here. But they didn't stare too much - unlike Reloaded <br /> <br /> The special effects were poured down. Every little thing that others do, whether it's jumping, somersault, spinning Whirl and in many cases, pretending that <br /> <br /> is slow, voiding bullets or focusing on destruction Clearly, W Bros has a lot of money to throw to watch this movie and the children throw it away without any real restrictions. The sharp editors can really help this. But the first movie is a popular movie that has been ruled independently, which leads us to ... <br /> <br /> Characters and dialogue: I have spoken more or less. The conversation is tired and full. Philosophical thinking Actors can't really penetrate their characters when the script and direction are pushing in front of the audience with the progress of the character or completely ignoring it. The audience does not get the difference and content so that they can consider their characters. <br /> <br /> Keanu's performance is the most stiff. Keanu is good at acting. Confused and that's all. He did this movie. He tried very well to show his passion between Neo and Trinity. But it was rather flat. <br /> <br /> Lawrence tried to make Morpheus do everything from Moses to Henry V and bleak like a cat all over. With the script he had for him to use exalted effort But it still hasn't changed. <br /> <br /> Moss is unbelievable as well. Her concerns always seemed like Keanu's and chemistry didn't exist, even though in the actual scene they were disguised well enough. <br /> <br /> Hugo brings his strange feelings back again. Agent program But he suffered too much from the hands of the script I found him to be the most interesting character. But instead of developing, they made him a big pull-out fight. <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing movie. If you have good expectations and become your own as an independent film (Which is not the way it should be used) it is still scary anyway I don't see the deep matrix. But at least I saw that it was a fun sci-fi game with interesting ideas, good actions, a little funny lines and limited symbols and interesting elusions. Repeated loading failed to count all of these and me. Hopefully W Bros will give you a better experience in the 3rd season. True, I have no hope left after this movie.
