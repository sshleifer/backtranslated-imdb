Before I go, I have to admit that I'm a big fan of Bon Jovi. In fact, the thing that attracted me to the DVD box at first I may continue to buy it. It's a big fan and is very happy with the first vampire name. <br /> <br /> But this is not as good as half. Even Jon couldn't help me with this movie. My main problem is that it's not scary. In addition to the character of Joni Reckis, there are no other characters that impress and you don't care less whether they are dead or not, especially women who are addicted to vampires / drugs. Scary or sexy She looks like a girl who has 14 years of anorexia. It is not surprising that she is thirsty. Another big problem is everything. "Too bright". No atmosphere or fear. I know that the first vampire set up in New Mexico is not a twilight zone in terms of disgust. But it is still dark and intuitively when it is necessary This film has no such tension. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to before. The Vampire wants the Berzier's cross to be able to walk in the daytime. However, this is a bit less cool than this time. There are no factors to know that this is the master of all masters - the original vampires, as in the first movie. You don't care who or what this is. No army But she hid in the old ruins that looked like a Disneyland tourist attraction and was an eerie temple. <br /> <br /> So you really have it. Lack of fear, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting stories The real thing for me personally
