Everyone who has watched Comedy Central around midnight in the last few years may see ads for this movie. The first time I saw an advertisement for this movie in 2001, it seems to be a joke. But I did not call the number on the television screen and ordered without having to watch the movie first I think I will wait until the movie will be rented at Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> About a year and a half later, I am at Tower Records and in the "DVDS for less than $ 20" copy of the movie this When I saw that the DVD was only $ 6.99, I decided to buy it. I returned home, put the disc into the DVD player and waited for the laughter to start ... and I waited for a moment. Laughing, never coming. <br /> <br /> I have to agree with other comments on this page when I say that this movie is scary. Patients who are innocent, innocent, and poorly written. Southern comedy movies are ruthless junk movies and are in my opinion that they are the worst movies of all time. No stars.
