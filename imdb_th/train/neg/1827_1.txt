Jealousy is one of the best things. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler and Christopher Walken, the great one, can deliver the best actors. However, with "Envy" no one can help this disaster. <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are best friends and colleagues at the sandpaper factory Both make a living But since Tim has better work efficiency, he can buy more than his friend Nick. Nick is a dreamer who thinks for new ideas. One day, Nick thinks about spray cans. Causing the poop to disappear (Yes, I'm serious.) Falling in love with the idea, Nick decided to really invent this product. He proposed to Tim to invest in his ideas and share the profits. 50/50 Tim refused to think that this idea would not work. <br /> <br /> Nick's name invention "va-poo-rize" (again, I'm serious) becomes a million He enjoys spending money on things like big houses, horses, personal trainers and desserts. Tim became jealous. So the name of the movie <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad. This movie has the worst dialogue and bad performances from every actor. Then again, as I said before, no one can save this mess, not even the great Christoper Walken, who plays the homeless man named "J-man", making this movie funny. This movie is bad from the beginning and getting worse /> <br /> I suppose to avoid this movie at all costs. But avoid especially if: * You are attacked with humor in the bathroom * You love animals
