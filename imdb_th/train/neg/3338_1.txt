It took 9 years to create this movie. I think within 9 years that people say hey, this movie is terrible. I've seen better performances in porn. Tired story and play Abused children will become serial killers. How about new things for change How can a abused child become a flower shop? At least it should be a new twist. Why everyone with a camera and movie ideas (Especially the idea of ​​original movies) think they are directing I appreciated the fact that they were stuck with this movie for 9 years to complete it. That represents stubbornness and spirit With the hope that this type of drive next time, they will be able to focus on better scripts. If you want to see a failed experiment to create an indie movie from a writer / director from Michigan, see the hatred of A minute if you want a good movie from writer / director Michigan with Evil Dead.
