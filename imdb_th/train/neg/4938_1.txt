Cavemen are the greatest creepy things I've ever seen. This show, which is based on Geico ads, provides less entertainment and 30 seconds of real advertising for Geico. Half-ass-ed make-up to say the least, difficult to imagine a caveman with white teeth. teeth This show has the potential for a comedy series if they get an actor from an ad in which it makes himself a punch show. Maybe if the writers are the same from Geico ads, this may have the opportunity to replace pilots who lack good stories. I gave this show to 1 in 10. I want to put zero from 10. But that's not an option. I prayed for a quick death on this list. I would give less than 5 episodes before it died.
