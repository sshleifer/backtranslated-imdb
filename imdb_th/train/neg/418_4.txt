One might hope that a good idea, like "Invisible man" will perform better and be more cautious in the era of amazing special effects. But this is not the case The story, the characters, and finally the last 20 minutes of this movie are fresh like the mad scientists who flick from the early 1950s. There are some great moments, mostly due to the extraordinary effects that are remarkable and The idea that people who do not see walking along the road But alas, soon we will return to the narrow underground laboratory, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but a circuit. <br /> <br /> There are many old remakes. Movies or TV shows in the last 10 years and some items are charming. But it became clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of ​​laying the old oligarch under the noses of an idiot like Verhoeven (who had his time) was a very bad thing. Clearly, money is a key issue here: the time and energy that is put into the script is nowhere near enough, and for this reason "Hollow Man" is seriously destroyed with ancient ideas, unpredictable characters. br /> <br /> However, one thing that really impressed me beside the special technique is swearing. When creating this type of film, modern manufacturers are eager to let their children see them, so the language (and sometimes violence and sex) is greatly reduced. When the whole world exploded, the good people went, "Oh, dear!" And "Oh my God," "Hollow Man". I didn't say that the most natural response to what is wrong is swearing - but it makes it more convincing if someone really swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven.
