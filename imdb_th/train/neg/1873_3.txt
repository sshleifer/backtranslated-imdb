You must be joking !!!! We come to entertain the possibility that Parker Posey is really an actor and not just participating in "The club of the month" of the actors, except that this would mean words that rant about David Mamet - a confusing dialogue causing the interchange of the speed of a machine gun or mono sound. This movie must be screened in the Rotten Tomato Award --- or worse. <br /> <br /> As if Posey is hard and uncomfortable enough, we are more tough and uncomfortable. Jeff Goldblum has a stick in the movie. This is more than a toothpick factory. <br /> <br /> Adding to this strange actors has many other roles, with actors who can't remember Pardo or even children who pronounce "ever "Like" bean "which just gave Interested in the fact that there is very little to like about this movie, we are analyzing his accent to guess whether he is a Canadian or not !! I think I laughed at the place that should be serious and take the serious part to be funny. Even the soundtrack also sounds like a parody of the Alarik Jans song for Mamet's "The House of Games". If being tricked into this movie, it's almost funny; If taken seriously, it is only a piece that is nervous.
