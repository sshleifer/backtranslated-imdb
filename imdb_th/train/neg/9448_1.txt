There is no redemption feature for this movie as garbage. The joke it didn't start to be funny. Humor for children is poor and efforts to attract adults just add tackiness to all the miserable packages. Sitting with my children makes me feel uneasy about what will follow later. I can't enjoy the movie at all. Even though my child, who bought the DVD, enjoyed the ownership of a new DVD. But she and her sister are not interested in seeing it again, unlike Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King and others. Repeat requests for replay.
