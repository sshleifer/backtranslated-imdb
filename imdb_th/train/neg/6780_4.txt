This film is a critical failure film and back in the year. Fri 1964, based on the novel which later became a play A story about some naval officers who leave in San Francisco during World War II. They have a 4 day holiday which they spend at the Mark Hopkins Hotel. This movie is very important and there are no characters that seem very real. In general, Carrie Grant is a great comedian and drama. But here he played as a dealer Wheeler and he didn't pull it out. Tony Curtis or James Garner should be a better choice. Audrey Hepburn is set to play opposite Grant. But there are other commitments, so Susie Parker stepped in. She had never done anything before. I think she works well, taking into account all the pressures that she had matched with Grant and Jayne Mansfield in a short-lived scene. The studio tried to give her class by acting with Grant - but the character didn't have any content at all.
