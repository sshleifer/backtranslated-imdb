This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot. But who is this girl? And she looks very scary in this movie. I'm terrible! They speak with a single voice and do not have a chemical sound. The cover of the DVD doesn't come from a distance, close to what the movie actually is. Really boring I had to pass quickly through some parts because it was very painful to watch. I want to know if I am on this planet. Who else thinks that this thing is good? Hahaha. They like to say and say "yes" and without any desire. I can't tell if they're in love. I'm sorry. But this is the worst excuse for a movie that I think I am. Have seen
