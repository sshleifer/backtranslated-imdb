I've never posted a review before. But I have to do for this movie! This movie is terrible. I find myself trying to prove how bad it is by trying to think of it as a worthless or parody. But it is not. It is a truly BAD that is not nervous. This is a serious attempt to fail beautifully. Other critics have pointed out the many shortcomings of this film, so I will try not to repeat these things. But I want you to watch this movie All the time I could not speak, gaping with disbelief or rolling on the floor with hysteria. I haven't enjoyed watching movies for years. In fact, I will try to get all my friends to see because it is a movie that must be shared. <br /> <br /> The part I like: - When the audition must go-go boy (dance His unbelievable) - Free nudity (director / lead actor must have nude) - Office of preachers with cardboard and crayons of Christ - Of course, the famous wedding Scene with palm trees and forgotten rings (What does this play do?!?) - The old wife's wrestling match with Ben for possession of her gun - the order in which Arthur killed the preacher; Obviously he burned him with an unbelievable pairing - yes, a gay fanatic, a white-haired man and WeHo Fashions - and my favorite is using Joplin's "The Entertainer" in As the soundtrack opens in D Major "is the soundtrack off! - The list goes on forever - must see !!!
