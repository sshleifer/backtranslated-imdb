Slasher movies are often regarded as repetitive and original movies. I used to be a horror movie fan. But this movie is terrible The script is severely missing. The plot is ridiculous. Surprisingly bad actions. Only those who have a bad smell all the time I have to spend time with life. This thing has all the entertainment value of the sequel, 15 for dire movies at first. <br /> <br /> Who is doing this mess? <br /> <br /> I like two things. In this movie only The first is the killer mask - which is very good. The second is the Australian relationship with the vulgarity of good humor. <br /> <br /> Help yourself and avoid this mess.
