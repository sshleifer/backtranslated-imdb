It's a waste of time! I tried to sit through 'Sky Captain .. "about 6 times and every time in about 3 minutes I started doing something else - something else! It's a very boring movie. The performance is terrible. And apparently being the first director because it's stiff and i want to love i love sci-fi, old cliffhangers and i can appreciate the nods effort to flash Gordon and the metropolis But my god Lost money. I've worked for Paramount Pictures and I've written Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using a blue screen for screen tests. She told me that they had never been interested in or wanted to do it. This cherry was right in 1993, but had to forget her advice when she was light green. This dog, a blue screen, was a visual effect. But not the whole movie. Don't forget Jude and Jolie are not the best actors in the eyes.) Paltrow's performance reminded me of the terrible high school effort - it should be usable. But under the skilled director only The funny thing is that Sky Captain's director will continue to work even after this event. It's a trade, not an art!
