So Angela grew up and received treatment and surgery to make her become a real life daughter rather than the son she was born and now works as - waiting for it - camp counselor! How appropriate? I know i love it However, the first sequel of the Sleepaway Camp franchise follows all the rules of the sequel. Horror - more blood, more imaginative killing. (Which did not imagine But still more than that). The nudity is more complex and generally worse. <br /> <br /> It provides entertainment in the same way as the original characters and characters, and the wardrobe is very stupid and 80's. True that you can't help laughing well. At one point, someone asked Angela to come out and she said "I'll call you" then went out quickly. The man said to himself that "How can you call me? I don't have a phone!" And then he sniffed the armpit, wondering what she's closing (I'm a friend !!) <br /> <br /> It's a well-known fact that The 1980s slasher movie The Teenager Who Was Slaughtered More Often Do not be punished by murderers because of bad behavior. Some types are too promiscuous. When I started into horror movies and watched the movie Friday the 13th for the first time in the mid 1990s, I didn't realize this. I learned in the film class one or two years later and was surprised that they were crazy methods. I'm very impressed not only But movies that pass some messages, even if they are scary But there are some real thoughts. Put it on. <br /> <br /> But not in this movie! At one point, before Angela killed one of her victims, she said "Let this be a lesson for you. Don't talk to drugs!" The true subtle screen is written there. Then again, the conversation is the most entertaining thing in the movie Angela (who undergoes and treats them and all the problems in cleaning her past and integrating himself as a normal person and having Good development then changed the name from Angela to umm, Angela). At one point, said "I don't like being an evil witch of the West. But I know what will happen when things are above control "(People start to be killed ... by me! HA!) <br /> <br /> Then she wanted one of the advisers Mare to apologize, which the girl replied, "I want to die!" Sorry, Mare, but you really walked into it. <br /> <br / > Two years ago, I was a camp counselor at the sleeping camp that was similar to that shown in this movie. (Except the camp I teach at There are more than three children per counselor, 15 or 20 people, and there is no rule that one person in the movie). This makes me notice many differences in movies from real life in the camp. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter, but you can create a movie like this with children 9 years old, running, even if there are 10 or 11 year olds that were killed in this movie. I've never seen that before. <br /> <br /> The taste is absolutely bad, even for the magic 80s slasher movie ....
