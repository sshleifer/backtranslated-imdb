Wouldn't it be great if not a teen movie, another true story that would be foolish, pointless, would I have more sex than you are a teenager? In a perfect world, yes But this one is even worse This is not worth selling for stars. But it is a disgrace for distributors All jokes are student stories that reveal what people might not be interested in seeing, but it is "funny" Devon Sawa who is good at the finals. Destination is just plain dull in this movie. It makes you wonder if it's bad or not. Grade: F
