There is no doubt that Frank Sinatra is a talented actor like a talented singer. In the end, very few actors today can shoot the scene at one time and that is the way Sinatra works in the scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I feel like In the 1960s, the quality of that man The movie begins to enter the tank. Tony Rome's detective series doesn't have anything short of trying to compete with Dean Martin's Matt Helm set at the same time. Perhaps the James Bond competition But nothing worked for Frank over the years His personal life was in chaos. His music faded ... Sinatra appeared in the 1950s. Sinatra's last great movie in this era would be Von Ryan's Express in 1965.
