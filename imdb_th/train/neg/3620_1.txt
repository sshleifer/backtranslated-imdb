I tried to see the nasty things of the cinema when I was five years old. I've never been the same since Full of images that are caused by the use of drugs that create the image of the general destruction of your average refugee. This film, despite its colorful appearance, is not intended for <br /> <br /> The innocent man, especially the children of the poor, who broke his roommate's drum by (waiting), placed his head through it. Yes, put his head through it. But not afraid of my friends! He quickly received consolation from his chirping flutes, which was strange enough for me to give you. But still acceptable. <br /> <br />: This movie combines with the Wizard of Oz and the origin of the wild animals. But lost all aspects "Warm and ambiguous" of the two books. <br /> <br /> So this seven-year-old cousin named Barney, a seven-foot yellow, befriends this poor man. Br /> <br /> And to increase Interesting in the formidable theme, previously carnivorous ships are friends of the collective team of grandfather clocks that are sparse and "dragons" laced with a mix of mayhem. <Br /> <br /> A comforting image. The most amid this chaos is the Chom. The villain named "Witchiepoo" (?) Of course, she has a problem in her own: with a plastic mask that is clearly an expression of her face to deal with the broomstick, which the gas level seems to be the lowest in The most inappropriate moment As a result of this, one of her favorite hobbies is snorkeling and the water that separates the land of Pufnstuf from her decay and makes the abode. (I don't know where I want to be)> <br /> In summary, this movie is scary ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch movies with similar effects to the audience. In the name of The Exorcist, this movie is perfect for you. Fun.
