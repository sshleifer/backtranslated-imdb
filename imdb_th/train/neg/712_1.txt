When I started to watch this movie, I saw a friend from Buffy Sanders and thought how good he was to live in the movie. Now it's a strange movie that I can stand because it's a strange movie like David Lynch's movie, Twin Peaks, the lost highway. However, this makes me remember a website that is crazy about there about conspiracy theories that are not reasonable. I mean, the Nazi people who conspired with America to create an impure evil power? I was surprised that they did not mention the hollow world in this film with Hitler's flying saucers and lizards. Maybe if you have about 60 grams of the heroine and this movie, it may seem reasonable, but actually I don't take drugs like I don't condone this movie. It should be burned, destroyed, torn and just forgotten. Ol ol 'good sanders might get a show again. It's not his performance. But it's okay But the script is not reasonable, sorry
