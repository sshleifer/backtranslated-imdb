... ever, this is below I'm not kidding. The theater should have some warnings. 'Abandon everyone, hope that those who come here' would be appropriate. <br /> <br /> I don't have the correct explanation about hell that this movie is. The stupidity of his stupidity also failed to be amusing. This movie is aimed at some slow turtles in the sand box. The story was blatantly stolen from the cartoon Bugs Bunny for 10 minutes, then stretched like Mr. Fantastic to 90 minutes of pain that was bloody. <br /> <br /> I remember when Wayans was funny. Lee, for them to create a product, is to blame for the turbulent poop at a consistent rate. I'm sad and angry that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy the 90 minutes of kicking kicks that have some stories. . I will not lose anything. But the baby is a dwarf on the face of Marlon Wayans over the little dwarf body My favorite thing is the ending. Not the resolution of the movie But the real end to which we all stood up and walked away. <br /> <br /> I gave this star to this movie. But it is less desirable I do not feel that the six minutes they used to write the script were worth the stars. This thing deserves Razzie, and I pray to God. It will be. <br /> <br /> When will people learn? If you stop paying to see this stupidity, they will stop it. Seppuku is a sensible choice for this movie. Avoid all costs. You have been warned
