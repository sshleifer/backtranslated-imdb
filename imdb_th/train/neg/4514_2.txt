Book problem "Memories of Geisha" is that it has a Japanese texture. But under the surface, which is the way of thinking of all Americans Reading is like watching a beautiful ballet with great music, costumes and costumes displayed by barn animals that are worn in those costumes. Not about Japanese or real geisha It is a story about the wrong idea of ​​American men about Japan and geisha who filter through their own ignorance and misunderstanding. What is this movie if it's not about Japan or geisha? Is it a pure fantasy, as many people say? Yes, why is it necessary to become a fantasy of America? <br /> <br /> There are many opportunities to miss. Imagine a culture that does not hang up strictly. There is no connotation about sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex handled in this movie? Right. It's like it's dirty. The closest thing to the sex scene in the movie is Sayuri, sniffing his nose and frowning with displeasure for five seconds, as if the man was trying to get drunk. She dropped cockroaches on her target. <br /> <br / > Does anyone enjoy having sex in this movie? Nope, one of the characters said that there is variety. But what we see is that she pushes her lover away because it seems she doesn't want to be caught doing dirt. The general American purist has no place in the movie about Japanese geisha. <br /> <br /> Sayuri enjoys her first enchanted by some old decoders after her cherries are right. Auction out or not? Nope. She lay there like a cold ice sheet on the cutting board. Of course, she shouldn't enjoy it. And that's what I mean about this movie Why didn't they allow her to be happy? Why would all sex be sinful and inaccurate? <br /> <br /> Behind Mameha, the president is Sayuri's secret patron. And so he is behind the auction of her virginity. He managed to bid and beat himself. Nobu didn't even bid. Why did the president let the old cider win her and mingle with the old man, bringing his finger all over her naked body? Which woman would really forgive this guy? <br /> <br /> Let's try to understand this. When behind the scenes, the president of Maha was owed for Sayuri's geisha training. In order to repay his debt, the president sold to Dr. Pau, President, came to see the president selling the sexual favors of Sayuri to the old man, so that the president could get money from her. The president is not her benefactor. He is her pimp! Some romantic love stories <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is beautiful. But it is like the beauty of attractiveness and attractiveness that has all the characteristics and sensations that are exciting But under the surface of a woman who is a bad omen Under the wrong surface of the Japanese movie, the secret lies in the heart, soul, soul and the essence of this movie, all Americans and men. Not the best thing if trying to be someone other than lying, distorted and terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> The difference between Japan and MOAG: <br /> <br /> Japanese style ?? Simplicity, luxury, style, MOAG ?? Beijing Opera <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha, I swept up geisha MOAG ?? Loose hair, which must have all gunked up in the thick, white makeup. <br /> <br /> Japanese-Japanese shaved ice is quite strict about seasonal practices. The shaved ice was strictly summer. MOAG ice planing - the president bought Chiyo, Sayuri Young, played by the great Suzuka Ohgo, this treatment during the Sakura viewing season. The idea of ​​shaking my whole body with coldness <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha A trained and skilled actor, MOAG geisha - sluts <br /> <br /> Japanese wind chime - used in the summer because it can be heard thanks to the Japanese breeze. Cool down MOAG Wind Chime - Door Bell! If a person stands in front of another person's home and makes a voice with a bell, they will be considered insane. <br /> <br /> Japanese ?? Focusing on human relationships, focusing on MOAG groups "I want my life" American individual <br /> <br /> Japanese dance ?? Pure elegance Geometry precision and mechanical almost MOAG beats ?? Martha Graham surprised with LSD while wearing a white auspicious Japanese corpse. Performed by Geisha down the ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Ha ha ha! Are the strip clubs they research about most geisha? <br /> <br /> Japanese house fire? Setting or letting fire spread is worse than murder because it is a serious threat to the community. The fire can penetrate through the wooden villages, towns and cities that destroy hundreds of thousands of homes and kill many people. MOAG house fire - an excellent supplement for fighting scenes. But there is no separation point in the center, and because it does not require miraculous fire anymore Technically, the film ends here because at least Sayuri will be deported and join her sister among those who have never heard of it. Which is where both Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be exiled. <br /> <br /> Enough movie has a foul odor.
