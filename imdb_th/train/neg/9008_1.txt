There are many unknown movies or movies that give bad reviews that I like. This is not one of them. <br /> <br /> It's too much to use and uses camera techniques that make me feel like watching a TV drama. It can be ludicrously predictable and takes most of the movie to go. Then you ask, "Right?" When I decided not to use the movie too seriously and watched from a strange perspective. It's more fun This is a movie that should make MST3000 break if it still exists.
