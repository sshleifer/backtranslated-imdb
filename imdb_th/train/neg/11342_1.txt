I should explain why I gave this ... "Art piece" ranked 1 star from possible 10, just because it's difficult or next to impossible to score without being biased. May be the same if I give it. Is 10/10 - the next explanation will follow. <br /> <br /> I don't like movies that are pointless like HOSTEL or - I think it's disgusting and beautiful. Terrible (in all possible contextual meanings) but as I discovered after watching this movie - there is a type called "Historical Drama" - and may be the case of 10/10 because it has a lot ) But what about "Historical drama" genre is it is a sub-category of "Garbage movie" that John Romero is innocent - full of blood, the emperor of courage and automatically, it can not rank as your default Intended and you can't say that the funny moments are so bad or bad. For people who like bad performances, bad screenplay and everything is not good. And by changing beliefs - I am also one of them There are many days that I have a desire to watch bad movies and look for trash, and here you go - the day was saved! But that is my opinion and does not match with other people. <br /> <br /> What I want to say is that if you want to see a movie that's terrible - then Fellini's Casanova is definitely an option But listen to my advice and don't give a rating by default
