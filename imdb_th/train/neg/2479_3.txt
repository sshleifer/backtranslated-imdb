The first time I learned about Wendid many years ago in Alvin Schwartz's "Scary Stories" book: Follow the story of Wendid - after calling your name in the wind - dragging you in. Pulling you into the sky, you. While it looks like a strange idea But the story of Schwartz made it into a consistent idea. <br /> <br /> The movie "Wendigo" couldn't be. It consisted of an ancient idea that flicked everything: the family moved to a new home and strange things. Started, anyone who attacked them was asking for it and everyone listened to ancient Indian men. I saw this many times and I didn't have to worry anymore. <br /> <br /> Continue to avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey in "Malcolm in Middle") do better.
