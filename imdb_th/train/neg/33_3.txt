This is the worst thing that the TMNT franchise had been born. I was a kid when this thing came out and I still thought it was a ghost, even though I liked the original cartoon. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that I remember when the mafia, Epe, explained to his minions that the rhetorical question was evil. Many fans hated the series. This included a female turtle. But that didn't bother me So much I can't remember you until I read about the list recently. In conclusion, it's all memorable. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is possible is the soundtrack. They call it ... Nananana ninja ...
