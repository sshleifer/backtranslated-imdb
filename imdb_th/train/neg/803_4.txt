I read Ben Mezrich's Reaper novel a few years ago, and last night I accidentally saw this adaptation. <br /> <br /> Even though it's been years since I read this first And that movie is human A very important element that makes all things reliable, just write out or change badly. <br /> <br /> If the plot sounds interesting for you: go and get a novel. It's much better and better. <br /> <br /> There are still 4 out of 10 because it's hard to stop watching because of Ben Mezrich's good plot.
