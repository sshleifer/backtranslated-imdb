This film has all the elements that will be funny, smart, sparkling. But for some reason it uses a silly path Maybe it doesn't know who the audience is: but it's a movie of a guy who rarely plays the actor and plot. But it's too slack and silly blonde that will attract women fully. <br /> <br /> The blonde is legitimate and its sequel. This is a surprisingly horrible sequel. Great actors like Luke Wilson should expect better content. Jessica Simpson is more manageable. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller long for stupid roles. <br /> <br /> Many things in this movie are coloring with numbers Even the kid's party chaos is just a guide to writing a lazy script. <br /> <br /> It's possible that you will find this movie fun if you don't take it seriously. But it is a better thing that you will be disappointed More disappointed when the scene rolls past
