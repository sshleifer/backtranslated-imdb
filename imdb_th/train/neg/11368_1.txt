This film is more effective in convincing me about Zionist conspiracy than I am a Muslim. And I am a Jew. <br /> <br /> Who is going to the journalism school? Read the article? First year idioms? Confirmation of these panic presentations in a satisfactory manner may prove persuasive. But by not accepting possible arguments or potential solutions (or any), few sources and suspicious sources, each makes this argument ineffective. <Br / > <br /> I don't want anyone to go out of the theater, believing that there are any racist claptrap. <br /> <br /> Good lesson for me - and hopefully be a warning for you. Really About the movie before seeing it.
