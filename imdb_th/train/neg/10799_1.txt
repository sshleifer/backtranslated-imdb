This movie is so scary that it makes the angels lose their wings. Shaq tries to use other cross-attempts like his work in Shaq-Fu for NES and many irresistible rap albums and later the most performances The amount of horrifying filmmaking is Steel <br /> <br /> There's nothing good to say about this movie. I saw it many times when I was very young. But I have to be an idiot because this movie takes all the fun about the movie and tears it apart. It's fun to mock. I saw it on Disney Channel while back and spent a few minutes doing that. Even when the ridicule of ridicule is complete, you still feel bad. <br /> <br /> If you see on TV, try doing this: consider watching your movie. he If you do that, it will become like a pedophile movie, chasing children and knocking to seduce him. That is funny and annoying. <br /> <br /> Awesome movie trailer. Do not leave unless looking at it, mocking this movie.
