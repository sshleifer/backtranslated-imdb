This is not a good movie. Sermon too much in some parts and the story is sub-3D. That works, but it's not great. I almost fell asleep in this movie. <br /> <br /> A story about 3 flies that want to adventure and follow it. The character is lacking. I don't really care about these characters and feel that there is nothing that will make adults interested. Pixar isn't this thing. <br /> <br /> I want to see more special 3D effects. In addition, I still want to see more funny pearls than my mother said all the time. "The Lord of the Flies", a beautiful woman in the show, a woman in the house
