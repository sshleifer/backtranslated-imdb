- The Mexican priest became a wrestler to maintain an orphanage or something. <br /> <br /> I went to watch this movie because it was about non-WWF wrestling and I thought it might. It's funny. It's not sad. It looks embarrassing. Any chance for a comedy show is merciless. Landslide. <br /> <br /> I accept that I don't like Jack Black. After that, I brainstormed. Think about the role that Doi The one he represents The only thing I can happen to him is ok. Is like the foil needed for John Cusack's character in 'High Fidelity'. Jack Black is one of the relentless flatmates. (Like a little fat in Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis) that should be told that being a terrible idiot is not a joke. <br /> <br /> It doesn't hurt a little. It's annoying. It's not stupid. It's just stupid. <br /> <br /> I hear good things about Napoleon Dynamite as well, but if this is what I have to go, I'll hurry to find it on the DVD.
