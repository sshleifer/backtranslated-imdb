This is a movie that attracts great interest to the group that is quite clear. (Which I'm not part of) I went to see this movie trailer without knowing what to expect - I finally found it disappointing. The history of horrible irregularities (possibly "distorted"). The Jewish family in Hungary is not my cup of tea. This great fairy tale should give more things to the audience at the end. In the end, images like this about human condition - this image makes almost no new light on the face that has more meaning.
