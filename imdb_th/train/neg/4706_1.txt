That's right. Did you hear me that this movie is ABOMINATION. First of all, the band that is going to watch or listen to a band called "Brothers Band"! Not just a scary name But being a musician, they can't play anything! Moreover, the lead singer still sounds more feminine than Geddy Lee and his voice is even worse! Not only are they awesome musicians But they are horrible actors Led by a crappy director and a light storyline, this must be the most stupid movie ever. I hope this website will help you use zero or less than 10 points because giving this 1/10 dirt is a very generous way. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if you can call a funny movie if You are looking for a comedian with music. Go to "Weird Al" Yankovic guy because he can do it better than all these non-patented tweens.
