"Land of abundance" is not a movie. It is a grave for the German director Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> Many people feel that in "The Million Dollar Hotel" and now "Land of Plenty" makes it completely clear, not just Ven Der must lose it But he turned out to be the director of BAD, creating stories and scenes that were horribly weak and deep. <br /> <br /> One might argue that Case is very serious As if he had forgotten everything he knew about the cinema and started again - just to get bad results. <br /> <br /> In a couple of words, this film doesn't suit your time.
