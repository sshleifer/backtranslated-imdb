This movement took place on TV last night. I guess it's time to fill up because it's terrible! This movie is just an excuse to show tits and ass at the beginning and half way. (Not a bad nipple and goodbye) But the story is too ridiculous. The narrative "Wolf", if that's what you can call it, shows that he hardly keeps his teeth. When fully seen, you can clearly see that they have some trainees working with CGI because wolves run like running on the treadmill and CGI hairs. It looks like it is waxed shiny :) <br /> <br> The movie is full of blood and blood and you can easily see who will be killed / slaughtered / eaten. Even if you like this kind of water splash movie, you will be disappointed. They do not work well. <br /> <br /> Don't let me start with the actors ... The lines are very rough and The girl cried everything for about 5 seconds, but then again, if someone asked me to act badly just to give me a few bucks, then hey, I will register somewhere. <br /> <br /> Overall scary and scary. funny
