I am interested in this movie when I watch the show. But after I watched it, I had to admit that I was a little disappointed. The main problem of this film is that the actors can't hold this movie on their backs. Why? Due to bad script Although Dillon, Len and Jones try hard to bring this movie to another level But there is no new narrative and direction is too common So for Matt Dillon's fans, this is a movie that can be seen as well as those who admire the beautiful Diane Lane The legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always excellent. But this is not a movie for him Much lower than his level So if you get caught by this wonderful actor But didn't expect anything big or special The only thing you can remember about this flick is the scene of Diane Lane. The rest is very memorable.
