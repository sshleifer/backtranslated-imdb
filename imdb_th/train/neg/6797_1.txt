What do you say about the 16 mm stag film that is not well taken, the best and most attractive actor is German Shepherd? Nothing will be positive. Avoid this imitation in all costs. In any case, it is rare because wildlife is still prohibited and is illegal in the United States. I suggest that IMDb go back to visit their weighted formula again to create ratings due to 8.8 points for this absurd piece! I have never been rude and spent many hours enjoying classic porn movies in the 70s and 80s; But this is a lower product, even if it is a loose standard of loop (Then illegal)
