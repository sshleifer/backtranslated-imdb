Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a cynical journalist. He traveled to this small town where people said that witches (Itaver) was scared of the community. <br /> <br /> His car stall and he took refuge in a small building. Suddenly she became a demon and he killed her and the city wondered who killed this woman ... which I thought was a witch. But I'm not sure Evan is being either her soul or something and he must have faith or something to overcome. <br /> <br /> I really hate Christian movies. They are usually full of lame actors, stupid stories and the least impact. Not to mention that this is not just a Christian movie ... but a foreign movie too. Ivan's voice actor has created a movie that is more funny, scary, because it is a treble and very loud voice. You won't miss much when thinking about this movie.
