As a big fan of the entire Star Trek series, I found that this episode is disappointing and I suspect the use of liberal "scenes" with Will Riker's exploits in both positive (and mostly romantic) ways. And negative (many pain And the death of the crew) is a money-saving device as well as a "bottle show" (when every scene takes place in the organization) Diana Muldur aur (Which appeared at least twice in the original series) deserves a better final appearance for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski, a loyal audience (in the world of Star Trek, has another type or not) and is also abbreviated. This is the last episode of the second season; So the season ended "Not with a bang" but with "groaning"
