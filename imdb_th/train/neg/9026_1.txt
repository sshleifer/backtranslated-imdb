This is the worst direction I have ever seen. Closeup is a very powerful shot, but when every scene consists of anything other than close-ups, it will lose all the effects. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott There is a very beautiful view that will work with the backdrop of Mexico. The beautiful land cafeteria that Anthony Quinn lives in and the dusty city Costner travels through revenge. Unfortunately, we quickly captured these places before the camera cut into large giant heads. Even the transition scenes that Costner drove alone across Mexico quickly cut off close-ups. <br /> <br /> The score is too exciting to disturb all the feelings we should feel. The story should be handled much better. Above all, a lot of people emerge from where to help Costner - it's a bad writing. <br /> <br /> It's a story of a typical thriller, but many others use evidence. The same and doing something that is outstanding with it. Costner's No Way Out has a somewhat similar story. But it's a much better movie. <br /> <br /> The ending is completely anti-matter and suffers from the most beautiful scoring of the movie. This movie is not good. But if we see Mexico more and have lesser heads, this movie may be viewed.
