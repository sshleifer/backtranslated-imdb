I am one of the big fans of the quietest comedian and may review the film Buster Keaton for IMD better than others. All the movies he did since the beginning of his career until the early 30s, with examination Only two exams, so you can tell that I'm a big fan. Because of this, I found that it is now painful and difficult to see I love this man's movie and I think "Buster, how are you?" Okay, now I think. I can guess why Buster Keaton starred in the wonderful episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. He lost a lot of wealth after a messy divorce during The early 1930s and his acting career as a leading actor also passed for a long time now. In 1960, Keaton wanted money and loved his resurrection in popularity, so he gave orders. Cor anyone willing to pay - appeared in the film The Beach> The biggest problem now is that it is horribly written and Buster deserve much better. The show should be a joke. But not and instead of showing respect for the silent film, it is painful to watch - especially with Keaton wearing a helmet that travels stupid times as well. Do something you like yourself. Don't skip this thing - it is an imitation of greatness that was once a career of Keaton !!!
