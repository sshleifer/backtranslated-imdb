I must say that I hate this movie. I don't like to say that because Gerard Butler is there. About half an hour of boring conversations, sorry to everyone who is interested in the real story. I started quickly forwarding to Gerry's scene. I didn't really know the ending. These two things: sleep or shut, but Gerry is the light of this film while he was with most of his previous films. If you're a Gerry fan, don't worry. He's always cute and precious as he is. But if you want to watch this movie for the plot, good luck because you need it. Coffee or soda that will wake you up! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... and that's just because the casting director has the feeling of bringing Jerry to the movie, even though they don't know how to spell his name!
