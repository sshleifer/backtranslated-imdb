Manmohan Desai made fun movies, though AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, but he made craps like COOLIE and MARD. GJS <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies he has ever known Mard ko dard nahin hota. But this movie is terrible that you bluff. <br /> <br /> The English people were made from carricatures and this movie looks very strange. The scenes in the English hotel are very stupid. <br /> <br /> The movie has many stupidity. Amrita assaulting Amitabh. Then the whole scene, including the climax of the film, is even worse. The more gems there are, like the live horse statue, the mask of Amitabh haha ​​and the other direction. <br /> By Manmohan Desai is not good. The music is ok. <br /> <br /> Amitabh performs his style in a different way than COOLIE, LAAWARIS. Role type Amrita Singh is ok. Satyen Kapuu is ok. Chopra is normal again. Self-star Singh is as always.
