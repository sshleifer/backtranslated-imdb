I saw this movie last night and even after a few beers laughed, the only thing that this movie received from me was when I knew I was watching. In a word, it's a joke, not fun. I totally believe the trivia, a tidbit about Jack Black, apologizes for causing this garbage. I can't believe that barry levinson not only threw this script when he read the first page. Also, I can't believe that I have watched more than ten minutes. <br /> <br /> I give 3 out of 10 * because I like to see Christopher walking to make bad movies. In addition, horses " Corgi "only exists as a character in this film
