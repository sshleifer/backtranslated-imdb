The deliberate bizarre adaptation of this Borges short story is typical of Cox. His strong visual sense is as usual by canceling the horrifying performance of half of most actors. This film is a tradition in the surreal era of the Mexican era of Buunuel, and it seems sometimes that poor people use elements of crime. Lars Von Trier Cox's clear settings for single play, skipping and recording. Surrounding sounds can be used for movie performance, worth watching, but ultimately disappointing.
