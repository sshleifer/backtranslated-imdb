This is a perfect example of what you shouldn't do when you have a good idea. Isn't that a problem? The concept is fresh and full of potential. But the script and its operation have no real content It should catch you from the beginning and pull out your emotions a little, making you interested and investing in characters. This film has no things to take out and support flights, and this is the reason. First of all, you don't care about the characters because they don't offer the way people can relate. I mean, this is not Superman or Mission Impossible. Here, it should be about normal people who are in a stressful situation. They do not believe in the way they do and interact. For example: Jeffrey Combs is a policeman who chews gum, puffing and looks violent all the time, not the way to go here. What do I mean? He looks like he's in the bathroom or something. I love him in the animation again and the way he plays a serious medical / neurological genius that has not been recognized for money. But not for this thing, he tried too hard to compensate with a serious and continuous look But in a mild neurotic manner, it's not natural. I was surprised that he didn't separate the jaw while filming. This movie is about saving lives. It almost doesn't have a pulse and it keeps me waiting for things that never came.
