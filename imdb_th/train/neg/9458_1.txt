There are many comments posted and tell me how I feel about this movie so sick so short. <br /> <br /> "Grinch" I think it's amazing. - Jim Carrey is a comedian. Capable Is a versatile, intelligent actor (In my opinion) Mike Myers, on the other hand, makes him laugh with annoyance. I used to like him a lot in "Waynes World" and "So I married Axer Murderer". Day - but I never loved Austin Powers before and "The Cat In The Hat" just finished. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible - very funny! Not suitable for children, not just But in adult content But in the fact that some of them dated, they didn't enjoy everyone for 50 years! The plot is busy, busy, busy! It's really a shame because kids are very fond of like "mum". They may choose a villain better than Alec Baldwin - but he can pull it out if not because Myers is ugly and doesn't like the cat's picture. Nasty <br /> <br /> Do I mean - Myers? Even looking at the script or not having a writer? Other actors seem to have one - but the cat seems to be dizzy. <br /> < br /> On the other side I Difficult to talk about the scene and the scene fantastic !!! Unfortunately, they couldn't help the movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Dr. Seuss - this man is a genius! Do not destroy his reputation by adjusting his work in a way that is lazy and busy !!! <br /> <br /> 1/10
