I was blown. The movie Woody Allen that I walked out after half an hour. (I am aware of the moral sensitivities of commenting on movies that I have seen less than half. But I hope you understand why). Essentially, it is obvious from the beginning that we will receive patronage from the screen as well: scripts that define ideas as if there are bullets; The actor tried to be a character from Hannah and her sister. (Except Chloe Sevini) and was directed to do so And cameras that are extremely important just to have nothing to do besides chat and actors who send it drama? none; But it is an act that does nothing to improve the situation. <br /> <br /> Maybe I will go out too quickly in this case. But now I decided against another half-liner-Allen-clone hour. The script had a funny time or I went almost entirely to the back of an excerpt from Will Ferrell in the trailer (the trailer stuck hook again doh!) ?? But there is a slight rhythm that will let them fly away unintentionally the best Worse than this, there is no fluidity To say that the wood of this movie makes the forest look like jelly: the discussion that opens the shop is the most appealing thing. The only thing that should be done with numbers is checking pots? 2/10
