This film is another example of the curse of East Asian movies: two or more stories are combined into one story. Other auditors also agree, because there are many "first parts" and "second" parts. How can you develop a profound character or plot when the characters and stories are featured in For a short time, I enjoy the first part until it stops immediately (it does not "end", it stops in what seems to be the middle story), to be replaced by the unconscious and totally unbelievable The girl is arranging and cleaning the men's apartment (wow!). I look forward to the day that Wah Wai Wai will get a good script to work with!
