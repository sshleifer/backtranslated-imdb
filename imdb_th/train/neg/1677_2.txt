Unlike other people, I refuse to call this pathetic excuse for a successful movie with more style than content. (I don't want the name to have a bad style) It is also the smartest explanation in my heart. <br /> <br /> The most meaningless and meaningless attack in the eyes and ears. "Wonderland" Makes anyone wonder why this movie happened in the first place And who in their right heart gives green light for this messy and messy mess Biography of porn star John Holmes? Studying who he is, why he enters the business and how it affects him Bound to the clarity and fascination of about a million levels (And I have no interest in pornography) <br /> <br /> Rashomon's style of study, which creates confusion and violence in Holmes-related murders after him Ended the profession? Who in hell cares? What ideas do we get? This film ignores the most interesting aspects of John Holmes's life completely - he's a porn star! "Wonderland" may be about anyone: the fact that the main character is the most famous male movie star in history, almost unrelated. <br /> <br /> To make the story worse than a thousand times Full of jerkoff, gimmicks - fixing annoying machine guns, sloppy Dogme-95, unnecessary split-screen graphics and animations etc. etc. <br /> <br /> In the absence of interesting stories and characters Unique Principles Director (and I use loose words) have collected a dozen or more techniques from other films and decided to call this movie "Narc" or "Traffic" or "Report Minority "fanaticism often does not understand the style of film pieces in the air of" Natural Born Killers "or" 28 Days Later; "The soundtrack" Goodfellas "or" Blow; " "Velvet Goldmine" or "Autofocus" or "C atch Me If You Can. "The list goes on and on and on the pathetic <br /> <br /> I want to like this movie. I have a real hope for it. "Wonderland Avenue" opened for many years. If the context of the murder is highlighted rather than the murder itself, I think it should be used If murder (And the involvement of Holmes is increasing with the type of worthless L.A) signaling the end of the career or the end of the 70s that swinged back. I think this movie may have meaning. It may have a purpose. As it is - meaningless Such a case is not famous enough to do the exam carefully. <br /> <br /> This film should be the third scene of "The John Holmes Story". That's it. Time and it can work. What? Oh yes, they don't want to tell the traditional story. They don't want to create "Boogie Nights" or "Goodfellas" or "Star 80" or "Autofocus". Do they want their movies to be different? <br /> <br /> On the one hand, they are successful. There is a huge difference between those movies and "Wonderland" The difference is that those movies are good. <br /> <br />
