From the plot and movement view, this movie is terrible I found myself watching the clock in the theater, hoping that it would end and be relieved after 80 minutes of doing it mercifully. Basically, five characters appeared in the movie, son and father, son's friend and two male characters who were as old as the son that appeared and disappeared without context or explanation. Movies and scenes seem to indicate the same sex. But nothing actually happened to reveal this in some way There are a few great scenes. At the beginning of the movie, the son's young friend appeared at the window outside his room and they were involved in strange conversations. Photography and acting were seductive in the interaction between the two. Convincing by ending by acknowledging that there is another man who is older than that end
