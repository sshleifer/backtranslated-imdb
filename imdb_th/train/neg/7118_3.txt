I can't say that "The Screaming Skull" is trying to be a fraudulent Hitchcock or a modern Edgar Allen Poe tribute. Today, some people might cut it a bit and present it as one of the TV anthology episodes from "Tales From The Dark Side", old ... but after extensive rewriting. <br /> <br /> The sad thing. Is that it seems to be a little nasty and tedious, trying to get out of the ruins of this movie and the actors try to do the best they can with talent. But the director didn't know how to set the scene or the scene to be amazing Special techniques are not available; The screenplay sent a telegram to the point where it was clear that the two shells would see them. And the soundtrack continues to play the song "oompah band", Germany, when it should try to scare the audience. <br /> <br /> They try; They tried really hard. But this is an interesting thing from time to time. I think the youngest people who have never seen the horror or horror many may receive the "The Screaming Skull" charge, but the younger ones may not. Negative motivation or plot ("Mother, why is that man so good trying to make a scary cat woman scary, scary")
