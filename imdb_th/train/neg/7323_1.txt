In contrast to other comments written earlier, I have to say that the only good thing about this movie is the fact that a man in that looks like Jason Donavon, which reminds me of a teenager. I do not know if it has won any awards, and although I'm sure there is a lot of effort to make it all vain because the end result is one that sings opera soap opera in the early 90's. The movie filmed without hope and the performance is at the same level as the one level performance. Unfortunately for a long time and the subplot is incredibly unbelievable .... For example .... If your close friend sleeps with your ex when 6 years after just 2 weeks of being destroyed, you won't. Best of friends, it's all fantasy. That's all! Yes, and the bizarre 90's / indie house is a dazed mind!
