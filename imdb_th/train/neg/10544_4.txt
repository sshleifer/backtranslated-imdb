When childhood memories tell you that this is a scary movie. It touches and goes that you should come back again. However, I remember the horrifying scene about the homeless and the villain played by Jeff Kober. <br /> <br /> "The First Power" is not a very good movie. It's full of boredom and bad script. A lot of holes that the truck can pass by (including countless comfortable "twists" that help the story go by) Lou Diamond Phillips is a terrible ass cop that is very confident that the serial killer baddie Kober Go to the gas chamber just to Found that he was Satan's minion, and now has the power of resurrection, he finds in a mix of poorly perceived souls that help in this matter. <br /> <br /> Ah, this is the trash. But fun like this, especially if you have memories that like it It scared me from childhood and that scene with the homeless is still quite good. For any kind of logic here; Forget about it, almost every situation will be thrown into a good temple and you will have to end up crossing between the actions of Steven Seagull and the 70s demon flicks and anyone in the world who thinks it is Good idea to cast Lou Diamond Phillips in the leadership position here. No need to say that he didn't believe it. But he tried his best and I never had a problem with many reviewers here. For Tracy Griffith as a psychic but Kober is quite good as a killer Always like that actor. <br /> <br /> "The superpower" may be what the doctor ordered after working hard all day and needing to use "closing the brain". Beer should help increase the viewing experience and I will Of course, the next time I rotate this movie All in all; Not a good flick But is a rather miserable pleasure for fans who think of the old days that are easily frightened of children. "See you around, boys who are friends"!
