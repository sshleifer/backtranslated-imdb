There is no connection with the creation of all types of movies and the appreciation of the movie is healthy. I can honestly say that I am angry with myself that interfering with sitting throughout the length of "20 days". I will not waste time on the story. Other reviews I will say that Berkowitz's hyper, Woody Allen style lecture is very annoying. You want him to quit coffee or take some sedative. And it may be clear for Berkwitz that the film is a bad idea because part of his experiment details are used as a funding to make a documentary. Forgive me for insulting disguise as a compliment But I will give credit to Berkowitz, who has the skills to convince some idiot to find this scary money. I appreciate the scope and intent of this film here. But even about the standards that Berkowitz set for himself, he shot and missed every level. In closing, I'm sure many of these female companions are uneasy to date a filmmaker who wants to be Twitchy, so I question the genuine feelings. Hey Myles, I love your movie the first time I saw it. .. when it appeared as Seinfeld's episode or as a movie directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith
