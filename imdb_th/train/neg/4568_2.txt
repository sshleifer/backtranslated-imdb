Not a bad start for this program. But is a slap in the face of real law enforcement The worst part of the series is that it tries to charge a fare. Reality - and anything, but men and women who devote their lives to law enforcement should get better. What is the next medical school in one minute? Charo shows lipo? Charles Grodin provides help in hip replacement? C'mon ... showing a little respect Even Muncie's citizens are leaving the program as a scene. Police School = High School Gym? Bad correction (How many times can they use the Taco Bell cars in the background?) The magic siren sound effects But not the last - the safety issue of the staff than you can catch the woods
