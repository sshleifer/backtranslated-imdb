I have high hopes for this movie. The monologue in the theater is great and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting person with a lot of experience and knowledge about movies. <br /> <br /> I'm a Belgian movie fan. But this movie is bad It is unbelievable that a 34-year-old actor is playing the role of a teen "Linguistic games" are awesome and superior. Nothing about this movie for me The ending is too good for me. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed and thought I had wasted an hour and a half in my life.
