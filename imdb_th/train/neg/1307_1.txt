This is a really bad movie. I'm a big fan of Italian Horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci. And yes, even our good friends here, Lamberto came out with good friends. I found that the first two movies 'Demons' were highly entertaining - they were terrible. They were great. But this movie is so bad that it is really bad It was very boring. The story never went anywhere and I hated the character - the wife slapped her husband and cried the pain. The baby-baby in the wife *** made me angry. There was nowhere near enough to be dedicated to the Ogre who was probably. The best actor in the whole movie I closed it about three-quarters of the way through because I was so bored! Don't bother
