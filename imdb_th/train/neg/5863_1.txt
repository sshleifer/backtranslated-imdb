I can't believe that this movie isn't in the worst IMDB. 250 is really bad. When I first saw it, I remember talking about it in a college class, and the other two were also seen. We all tell other class members not to see it because it's very scary. By the time we do, some people want to see it just because they don't believe what is bad as we say. Don't be like them. I'm sure everyone related to this movie would like you never saw them in this movie.
