I will not say that this movie is not good. But it's not as good I expect good things, but I think Hum Aapke Hain Kaun is much better than this. This is a complete old style. In every step of this movie, I hope to receive something. The girl was burnt and won the love of her aunt. <br /> <br /> Even if participating But they must be allowed for every step they do They were very shy even after several meetings. I expect the aunt to be much more cruel than that. All you do is a crib like crazy. <br /> <br /> Hey, we have children. But we don't always watch them and have tears in our eyes. This movie is a dream. A happy family, a brutal woman with a husband and a man who loves her until his death in HAHK. Anupam Kher is the father of a poor bride and now is back And I know that Mohnish Behl will be in this movie However, I believe I lost my time for 2/10.
