This film has the look and feel of the student film project. Yes, there are interesting fixes and shock. (Although there are tricks) but the end result is children and youth. <br /> <br /> The director doesn't seem to say that "Watching this movie" looks like he's saying "Look at me! I'm a director! "<br /> <br /> Raise your finger.
