This movie is t.v the previous day and I'm not fun at all. George's first forest is a good joke, but the sequel .... is completely scary. New actors and actresses with a bad lead role, they should have original actors (Brendon Fraiser) and traditional female actors. (I forgot your name) So this movie got a score of 0 out of ten, not a movie that you can watch and enjoy. This is a movie that you turn to another channel or bring it back to the store if hired or bought It is good to see the male monkey coming back. But not as fun as at first, they should have a new George when Georges's son grew up and still had Brendon and (Her face) in this movie Ever better
