This is the most confusing item in IMDb that I haven't seen yet. All previous examiners do this kind of movie. This is not a movie But it is just a feature that adds a DVD of the movie "The One" In fact, it is almost no more than 13 minutes. How can Jia Li can do martial arts? And his reflection in the movie So yes, this IMDb list is quite a little fubar. Don't listen to any other reviews because it's totally wrong. You trust me because I never feed your readers who love BS. <br /> <br /> And that's the truth. I think you can say that I am a "person". Criticism is important.
