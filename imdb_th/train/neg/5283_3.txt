I am eagerly waiting to show this movie for the first time since I received the DVD for Christmas. Last night I booked a special slot last night. I sat down to watch with my daughter (17 years old and student of film studies) with chocolate. Of course, with enthusiasm, we love Jane Austin. <br /> <br /> After the first two minutes, we know that we are overwhelmed. The pictures and camera angles are shaky, bad general movies, directions and performances made of wood make us feel flat and not satisfied. We look further. <br /> <br /> Anne played by Sally Hoo. Hawkins looks strange and has no purpose, especially going straight to the camera several times. 'I'll find you' almost can't walk. <br /> <br /> Poorer, Rupert Penry-Jones, the captain of Wentworth's players, did the best with the script and the direction he blessed. I hope they will pay him well. But because he drowned at one time by a large wave that predicted that he had broken the sea and wet him and his co-actors They are almost out of the sea. Health and safety must have a field day! The poor Rupert was letting the sea flow out to send him the line. Suppose there is not enough money left in the kitty for filming this scene again. Anyone who has feelings will not try on the first day at first. <br /> <br /> Apart from Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige gives the only credible performance as Lady Russell. From the unbelievable picture of Sir Walter Elliot's annoying Anthony <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Captain Wentworth seems to have a strange grace like Anne. Visiting every two seconds She is a big part of the movie. As if he had developed an obstacle to memory that had made him forget his true reason On the other hand, Anne ran, venting from the main pillar to the pole to find a good captain, while at the same time able to call almost all of Bath in just three or four minutes. <br /> <br /> We never saw Anne's charm across the screen. Of course, we were left to wonder if Captain Wentworth, as charming as never before seen in Anne, innocent, innocent, and why some people didn't say what it meant> kissing. Importantly, which is usually the time when our favorite girls have been pulled out painfully. When they approached, Ann opened and closed her mouth, which had an effect on the screen, making her look as if she was chewing gum before the lips finally met. Eww! <br /> <br /> The funniest thing. Last night was chocolate and the exchange of views between mother and daughter in half an hour that the movie was so bad. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this charming and fascinating story, if Do the best /> <br /> Sorry Jane of England <br.
