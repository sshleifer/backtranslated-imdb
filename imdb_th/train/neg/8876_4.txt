Types of parody of the eclectic family "Officer and Gentleman", "Heartbreak Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (and no doubt that other movies that I can't remember right now) are rather boring movies. The porch is always there, which you can expect, and the Damon Wayans line is good. As I said, unfortunately, this movie doesn't surprise you ...
