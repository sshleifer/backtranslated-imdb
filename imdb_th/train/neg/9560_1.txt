Thank God I have looked at the place of friends and not paid. The story is horribly transparent and the entire movie feels like the episode of the TV show. If you have knowledge about computers or electronic devices You will feel like an insulting movie for your intelligence. <br /> <br /> Actors turned to playing a lot of music. She's lucky that Matt Lancer is really good. He's the one who brought the movie. <br /> <br /> I hate that I died almost two hours in watching this movie! It's a shame that they have to call it the sequel because I'm a fan of the original, which is actually quite good.
