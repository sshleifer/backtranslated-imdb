I insulted the horror movie without secrets. No plot, bad performances and gallons of blood are the core of movie errors and this "movie" is no exception. I do not want to believe that some cable stations actually use this garbage (this particular garbage is released directly to the video as I can remember). As mentioned, other movies will be a good insult to other movies. Say this: All Phantasm movies, All Jason movies, Freddy movies, Chucky movies and Michael Myers movies, most can be summed up in one word: TERRIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Phantasm III: 0.5 / 10
