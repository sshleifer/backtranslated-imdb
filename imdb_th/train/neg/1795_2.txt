I had the opportunity to see a sample of this film as a member of the test audience and the only thing that kept me in my seat was the opportunity to fill out a survey after screening. I feel that the biggest problem of this film is the lack of a main plot. But it consists of (sub) many sub-plans that compete on screen time For this reason, there is no single character developed enough for the audience to create any attachments. What the director and producer failed is to show us why we have to be careful of what happens to character In fact, one subplot and the characters associated with it can be removed at the same time without causing serious damage to the movie. (The time of receipt will allow sub-development and the remaining characters as needed). Simply put, the dish of The Hungry Bachelors Club is packed with side dishes and appetizers.
