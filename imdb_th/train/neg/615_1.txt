I must say that I always like horror movies that I have never seen ... However, this movie is disgusting for my blood-filled taste. I am used to the kind of blood, the kind of bite used ... but this movie is not good at all. The show was awesome. (But repetition (No puns) One mariner is so cute) and the sequel to this story. Scarecrow Slayer is even worse! Yes, maybe when it first came out, there was madness and people liked it. But when the movie The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose came out, this movie would make a movie like Scarecrow look like a kid. If you want this movie to pass, choose this movie! Special effects are wonderful, but when seeing that it is an economical movie, I can see that going in here will remind you of the movie "Children Of The Corn" independent rock movie .... Most of the time So if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs or in the sequel 2, the scarecrow will go there and these movies will suit you.
