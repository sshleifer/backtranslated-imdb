Where to start! ... I feel ... violated! Right to abuse! I just spent 1.5 hours in my life 1.5 hours that I can spend more time doing more useful things like watching dry colors called horror flicks. <br /> <br /> It's not scary. It's not funny. its Uninteresting, no movement, nothing ... <br /> <br /> It can be predictable. It's boring. Sad ... <br /> <br /> I might come here a little but look. This movie and you will feel the same thing ... or ... don't look ... if you don't want to feel violated as well
