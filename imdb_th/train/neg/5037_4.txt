Synopsis = Melissa is a new kid in town. She is fifteen years old and her birthday is coming in a week. Because Melissa's husband is beautiful, every boy in the city wants to contact her. But there are only a few who can catch her attention mysteriously Why hurry to watch movies When I started watching, I knew that "Sweet Sixteen" was not a very good slasher. It was boring and boring and didn't go anywhere. After one hour, only three murders occurred, and the story was not developed in a way that was possible. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed with good photography and directing. Great. Flick from the 80s. This film suffers from darkness sometimes. Although the performance is quite good But Melissa's character is easily sympathetic, even if she is a perfect slut. <br /> <br /> The story isn't filled with garbage. But it's too boring The only thing that makes me interested is Melissa. She's amazing and Dana Kimmel, who is really cute and cute in this movie. <br /> <br /> All in this movie that is not going anywhere Do not recommend Slasher fans.
