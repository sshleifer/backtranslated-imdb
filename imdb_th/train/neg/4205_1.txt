ALARMIST is a deep script that you think about yourself why new actors like David Arquette fall here. It must be one of the weakest plans I have ever seen and without humor. It has a boring border. It follows to a horrible conclusion that seems to happen just because the director is bored and wants to wrap quickly to go home for his dinner. Stay away!
