Where is his criticism about democracy and the Republican Party? After all, he served for 17 years and up in the body of a government whose influence did not change. Oh, I forgot about 8 years. He is second in control of the most powerful country in the world. This film is happy to show the image of Senator Young Gore asking why NASA scientists were forced to change the summary in his science article. But didn't ask about the complexity of Clinton / Gore in global warming May be too close to the election year, or maybe it will result in a chance for Hillary in '08. The way he is politically coward and the party is so extreme He does not criticize consumer protection. There is no criticism of capitalism. There is no history of industrial development which brings us to this point at the time. <br /> <br /> At the end, this film has a lot about you. Sacrifice himself more than the real problem we face. Mr. Gore If you want to create a short campaign and call it what it really is.
