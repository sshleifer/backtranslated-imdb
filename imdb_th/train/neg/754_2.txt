I have to admit that I laughed when one of the critics compared it to LOTR. Yes, if you split the dwarves, thousands of characters, special effects, great battles, strong characters, good plot, performances. Good, good direction and everything else Which left you with walking And this movie boy doesn't walk! If Mr Piano had his way, this would be a three-hour hard-core game that went through rural Wisconsin, but every 40 minutes or so, these annoying Martians appeared for a few seconds to interrupt him before he left. Go for a walk. You have never seen a lot of movies. If this has a budget of 20 million dollars, most will have to use with your piano shoes because he has to go through a lot of matches with all the walks he does. Which explains why there is no money left for the right effect, the right video camera or the right actor Honestly, it's like watching a bizarre fetish video for someone who has something to go for a walk in a long period of time. Even moving forward quickly, this is an unbelievable walk. <br /> <br /> For things about Saigon, I think it's a mistake to make Martians into the movie: they walk. Along the path Which is clearly interesting for the director rather than the story. <br /> <br /> I wonder how much you have to pay for the dog to walk?
