Ira Levin's Broadway came to the screen with almost no meat on its bones, a mysterious story with only a few tricks and twists. But nobody cares. Michael Caine, a discouraged writer, plans to steal the work of a talented young man and pass it on himself. His devious plans may include killing talented children with Ken's bitter spouse in arms. The first act that everyone suggested was an almost bloody eye, with Ken doing everything the actor could do. Dyan Cannon acted like his wife. (She's too smart and intelligent to be sent as a ditz) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle of the movie) seems to be very uncomfortable in the role of a better writer. These three characters and Irene Worth's dreadful neighbors are not clearly defined what will happen after the setting is almost impossible to register until the second episode begins. Sidney Lumet's character is strong and vague. The design of unbelievable scenes and low light and the final scene are all disastrous. The actor struggles to get some matter. But with some materials we see is their efforts * 1/2 from ****
