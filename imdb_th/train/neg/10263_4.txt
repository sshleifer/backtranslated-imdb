Yes, The Southern Star consists of a memorable title song by Matt Monro. It is quite sounding for this bloated and somewhat boring feature, paired with George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple. Searching for large diamonds Add Harry Andrews. (With a few strange accents) chasing ostrichs, flocks of wild animals and bad and boring photographs by Raoul Coutard and you end up with incredible excitement in the Senegal forest
