This shit looks like a dry color. I am very disappointed because I am eager to see <br /> <br /> It has no meaning for this movie. If it has never been done, no one will notice or care. It is hypnotized because of the big names in it, but if "no one" is in there, no one will give love to this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'm in the halfway point of the movie I will watch Vanessa Redgrave and think "Hurry and die!" This is like "Joy Luck Club" without any happiness from friggin. It is "Ocean's 13" (nothing but a famous star) of mother movies and completely anti-climatic ... Oh, until it ends. <br /> <br /> I'm sure they will all Was nominated for an Academy Award ... <br /> <br /> - 4 stars for the movie
