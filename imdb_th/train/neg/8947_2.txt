This book is excellent. This movie is not There is no reason for this film to not be able to bring the technological vision of the future of this book. Hell, all the recalls were released a few years later, and that was a good result of it. Even the orange that was released in the 70s did well to try to create a world of the future The colors that look cool, German, black and white from the screen. There is no reason to see this method. When the movie was created in 1984, the main characters were in the white-collar writing. But he dressed like he worked with oil And grease in the garage This film decided to use the method of mocking the Communists to determine the design, atmosphere and style. But novels do not need to define communism, communism, humble form of worship, workers themselves. This book must be seriously adapted to the modern context since this book is more relevant than ever. I can't see this shit for more than 20 minutes. The annoying soundtrack lacks annoying sightings. The film seems to have been created to deny the feeling of realism or confidence when that's what. Necessary to reinforce the message of the novel to the audience
