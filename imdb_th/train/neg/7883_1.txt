The cover of the scam, the title and type of the Power of Prayer that is hiding very small, tricked me into renting this movie. <br /> <br /> It started very well and pulled me in. I really liked it between 1/3 and 3/4 of the film begins to throw in things that are not set and unreasonable. My first thought was "This is not written by someone who knows how to tell the story." I ended up watching some parts of the movie again, thinking that I missed something. <br /> <br /> When I reached 1/5 of The last movie is boring. Nasty. Don't feel not saying anything and is annoying to listen I mute and move forward quickly. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this flick. <br /> <br /> Watch out for DVDs with Whitlow film labels and production levels. <Br / > <br /> And I'm a Catholic
