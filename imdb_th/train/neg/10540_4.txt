Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a devotee / serial killer who possesses "First Power": even after being arrested by Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and being executed in the gas chamber, he can move his soul from Body to body and still murder as per wish With the help of Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, Melanie G.'s sister) who is attractive, he tries to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> This concept may have some possibilities. But in the end, "the first" force "suffers from normal script writing and filmmaking This is something we have never seen before, sometimes even better. There is nothing about this movie that will distinguish it from other supernatural horror movies. Up until now, it's not very exciting and of course it's not scary. Phillips is difficult to sell as a stubborn nail, an insulting attitude and Griffith doesn't seem to try hard. The best actor member seems to be Kober that is outstanding. Try to do the best to make it so creepy. <br /> <br /> Climax is quite silly and a very soft ending. <br /> <br / > Not accepting enough Rate it as the average movie of this type of movie: <br /> <br /> 4/10
