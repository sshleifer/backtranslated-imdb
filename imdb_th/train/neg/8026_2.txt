The girls began to side by side to knock and show their true self. (Or as we think), but a man was left to decide who to choose. He thought he could marry and live happily forever. <br /> What is true love? How do you fall in love with someone when you are forced to choose them? This show is unbelievable. Do you think that dating online is not good? But people have to TV to find love? It's not like real How will the girl be with men when he hangs out with others by doing with them? There is no answer to these questions, and finally when the performance ends, you know that you will not be happy in the future. For everything we know, everything is scripted.
