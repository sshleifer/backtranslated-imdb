It seems that the intention of a thriller ends in comedy. It urged me to sing. "Oh, God!" More than once in a complex plan that is just a nonsense. <br /> <br /> A place that is fanciful or unreasonable for novelty or an incredible situation and impossible Understand why it exists. <br /> <br /> If you have time and want to discover how bad the image is, you must see this picture. Otherwise, devote time to watching dry colors for more time investment. <br /> <br /> (Movies released in 2003, shown on TV in July 2003, may be an indicator of the quality of movies)
