Yikes This movie explodes. Weak character, weak plot I think it's not bad because it has Christoper Walken. He must do this because he is bored and wants money. The character should be Irish. But no one has an Irish accent I try hard to find good things about this. I can't except Walken. Works well with the wooden characters. Search for things to read or watch. Discovery never saw this movie.
