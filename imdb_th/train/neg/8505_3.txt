"Semana Santa" or "Angel Of Death" is a very weak movie. Mira Sorvino plays as a detective trying to find the murderer who shot the people. Can't you speak English? All other characters have a Mexican accent. The conversation is not very good and the delivery is wooden. The movie looks good. But still not enough to save this rag The next part of this review has spoilers !!!! <br /> <br /> During Climax, it seems that the villain is about to flee. But then he came back down the stairs to shoot That shows that this script has no originality. Avoid!
