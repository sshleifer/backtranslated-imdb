If you just look at the cover of this movie, it's cool. DO NOT MOVIE. It was a slow walk, with the least violence and bad suspense. The show is the material entered below and the plot while it is cool for other movies. They also kill the favorite characters in the entire movie! I gave 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was the twisted storyline at the end. In addition, you may want to help yourself from this movie trash.
