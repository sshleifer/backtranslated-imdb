I didn't get all the praise that this film received. It is frustratingly unnecessarily distracted and avoids many big problems - such as Nash's affairs and voluntary sex with men in public I think that in the context of commercial Hollywood movies is acceptable. But what is Russell Crowe's performance? The man seems to switch over to catch the bag and wear a ground cover and seems to have the same qualities as a good performance? Anyone who has known people with mental health problems will know that Crow's performance is very short. It was quite nasty. And I dare say just the right of being truly terrible
