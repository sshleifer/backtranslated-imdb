I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman on it. And until Justin Timberlake entered the scene He is a terrible actor and should not be allowed to create a movie again. I mean, he is one of the most boring actors, and nobody cares that I've seen. He doesn't have any emotions with his line of work. Why did he leave the script for Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon should be a better choice. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is a big disappointment again. His character is very boring. It seems that his character is mixed between American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It may sound cool. But believe me, it's not <br /> <br /> Now, Dylan McDermott's performance is great. It's about one of the few good things about this movie. He is just an inspiration. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is a good person. But nothing special He has some really cool lines. <br /> <br /> About the story, though it's quite clear and sometimes exaggerated. It's good. I expect a big twist when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) is killed, but nothing actually happens.
