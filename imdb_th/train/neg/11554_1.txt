This movie is embarrassing for making movies. I can't believe that it has been identified as a joke - not a joke. Not only is it a ruthless script, Gail O'Grady is just a great actress. But above that ...% 99 from the remaining actors ... Oh, quite everyone else ... Wow, it's hard to get ... Wow, this is the first rule about comedy. "Don't try to do jokes." There are many talented actors in Canada who can perform drama and comedy - none of them in this movie. Canadian discrimination and arbitration committees are helping to extend the time to make bad movies in Canada. I know this is a "US" movie technique, but look at the director, actor, place, etc. I just saw this in Bravo - they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to perform this movie. Again, there are many great movies that can't be broadcast and they show this shit.
