The Leap Years starring some hitters in the local and regional movie and television scenes. And yet they cannot record this movie There are many things that conflict with it - acting, too rude drama, bad script and something that happens - good music. This comment is for everyone who cast all local movies into one basket after watching this movie and saying that all local movies are not good Please don't judge the rest of this movie. This is a television drama that is disguised as a romantic movie. My hopes are high when I buy a ticket and my hopes dive into the movie for five minutes.
