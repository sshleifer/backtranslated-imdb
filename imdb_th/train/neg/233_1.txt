This film is an attempt to calculate money in the success of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and funerals. In fact, if they call it Sex at a Funeral, they may do better at the box office. < br /> <br /> But this movie is between two stools and can't get up. The character sparks an improperly bright conversation. But should not act as a human being One of the actions without rules follows another thing to develop things that have passed, and soon the tire of the organization's mistakes. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell received points from the show of small hearts. Her out was stolen by Imelda Staunton as everything the police detective (They don't have the altitude requirement there?) Ms. Staunton doesn't seem to be able to move wrongly. We want to say the same as the author of the director. Makes you feel like you are a fake phonus bolognus on the half shell
