Let me start by saying that I used to like Betty Grable, especially from "Down Argentine Way". But by the time she had to face this disaster, Costarred and Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who had to despair) had no story Good, good colors and movies are too long. It has an old position there, like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner, who will try and stimulate interest. But was not successful The music score is terrible and I have to say that there are no songs that are memorable either in any way ... because I'm a Miss Grable fan. I always hope that I will never see this song!
