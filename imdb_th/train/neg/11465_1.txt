There is no doubt that this is one of the worst shots I've ever paid for watching - the kind of flick that you choose from despair at the mall, the cinema during the Christmas holidays. Set to watch movies! And that's the way I saw this foul bomb. <br /> <br /> At a better distance in the past three decades, I still smell the rotting fish which is the story line. Unbelievable plot - Killer whales have regrets for people not in the sea - a laughable story. And that's all except "Love theme" outside the place where the movie ends without a love story At least Charlotte Rampling is cute (in a two-dimensional role) but Richard Harris just chewed the scenery. He is not Captain Quin (Robert Shaw) and this is not a "jaw" mercifully. I have used most of it from my heart and when I ran across it in the air broadcast on television, I moved immediately. "Watch TV, current advertising shows, husband and wife, watch whales (" Orca-I love Orca ... ") - at least finishing in sixty seconds. This flick shows my life that I will never return for another 92 minutes.
