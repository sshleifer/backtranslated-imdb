SLASHERS (2 outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Not a very good movie ... but I like the idea behind ... and the creator makes it look good when considering the budget. A little that they have to work with this movie is the "scene" of a Japanese reality show that sends many contestants into the "danger zone" and has three creeps that were sent to kill them. The survivors, if there is one person, will gain fame and fortune ... Everyone just dies. The main disadvantage of this film is that the performance is quite poor. There are no "real" people that seem real. Actors who play as killers are fun ... because they broadcast funny pictures and popular cartoons of popular modern horror movies ... and that's how they will do if this is a real show. The movie pretends to do everything in one place ... There is a photographer who follows the contestants around the "danger zone" and everything can be seen from the point of view of his camera ... but the lights are flashing and Always closed (to hide "wounds" from one place to another, I will imagine)
