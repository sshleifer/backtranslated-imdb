This movie certainly proves that the good American people can propagate very well. There is no question being asked. There is no comment on the abuse of power or the fear of police. When James Stewart is strong and trustworthy, as always, he can edit all the stories from Dillinger to the 5th column. June Allison, because of his love for regulars, helps to raise the value of the family and EJ. Hoover is a producer and a child or a non-guilty watcher will not be harmed when a professional performs. Not to mention the civil rights which had never been destroyed or houses that had never been compromised. And if the service of the FBI is not enough, Stewart gives his son life to the country of WW II. Perfectly done if you don't know better ....
