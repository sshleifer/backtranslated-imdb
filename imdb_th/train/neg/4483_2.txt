I will admit that I like the first person and wait for the sequel. <br /> <br /> I was abandoned. Of course, special effects are technically amazing - but it's unbelievable. It looks more like a cartoon. Okay, I agree that I like the 80% chase scene - but fighting with Mr. Smith all? Obviously it's too animated. <br /> <br /> I can accept it all. The thing that I cannot accept is that the non-action part is boring every time Morpheus opens his mouth. I know that I am a non-stop and meaningless person. Frustrated with the small plot, what this movie tells us is that there is no truth in the first movie. (Except for the existence of the matrix) This movie looks like the episode of DALLAS that you found last season is a dream. <br /> <br /> Ah! I want my $ 7.00 back!
