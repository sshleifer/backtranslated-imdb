Actually, when talking about this, this movie is not funny. Josh Kornbluth is the opposite of a joke. But he thought he was hilarious Plot about sending 17 letters is good at first until Josh "Look at me, I'm strange." How to start disturbing every scene. The jokes of Judas Priest can be the least funny thing I have ever done personally, and that can say quite a bit. And for too many uses like "Debaser" of Pixies, I have only one thing to say: What does the Pixies do to get this fate? Has anyone done anything with Josh Kornbluth that made him write / command / produce / act in this horrible movie?
