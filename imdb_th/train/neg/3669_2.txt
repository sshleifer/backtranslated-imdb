I can't think of a good thing to say about this movie ... it's not the only thing. The script is a nightmare. The author blurs the line between chemical and biological characteristics and doesn't seem to understand the difference. You think that at least they will get a technical consultant. The performances are not good by most actors ... even though I don't really blame them. The correction is not as good .. I will stop now .. It is bad for both 2/10.
