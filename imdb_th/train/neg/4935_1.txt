"Cavemen" exceeded my expectations and not in a good way. It's worse than I thought. Basically, this is a show: Cavemen are other races. They face prejudice, etc. It may be the most stupid idea ever created. Almost worth the time in prison for writers. One item featured on the cavemen to enter the club, trying to pick up the girl, then nothing happened. It's reminiscent of listening to the 22-minute Andy Rooney dialog box, followed by dying with a steak knife through the dwarf dwarf. For those who do not see this list, here is an example of the dialogue: "You are sure that you are okay with going out to find the caveman." "Yes, it's okay. The best I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The caveman, 22 minutes, with horrific makeup, difficult social problems ... seems like a fun night. I like the bad idea recently that they used to create sitcoms from car insurance advertisements. I wonder if they will continue to make Gecko so I can have a new name for the worst item I have ever seen. I will say it's worse than "Viva Laughlin". At least "Viva Laughlin" was torn from something that was inspired. <br /> <br /> This performance made me hope to have a comet. There, wherever there is a purpose for the world, <br /> <br /> (Honestly honest ...)
