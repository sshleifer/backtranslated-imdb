Ok, when I saw an example of this movie, I thought it looked really scary and very excited to see it like it was the group that I was with Now living in America, especially during this election, I see many deceptive things. But I have to say that these sample images are at the top of the list. I don't see how much this movie will be. I only noticed two real jump scenes and jumped once. This movie is very predictable and may cause some of my jumping scenes to be messy. For many sound effects that scared me to think that it was the best joke. Oh and Catboy, where did u come from and why? The worst sound in this movie must be a strange wail. How can it make people scared? I can make that sound easier. Now don't understand me wrong, I love horror horror movies that you laugh all along. But I never thought that this movie would make you feel bad.
