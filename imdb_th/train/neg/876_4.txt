Until the last 20 minutes, I think this is probably Jackie Chan's worst movie. (Except his pre-1978 work, which I am not familiar with) The final battle sequence has changed altogether: It's long and good and intense - of course, one of the highlights of Chan's career. But in order to get there, you have to sit through many "jokes" that may cause children from five years old. (Oh, look, there are people throwing tomatoes in front of that guy) and the endless "football" scene. No need to mention copying. (Including the line "How can I close it? It's not a touch" - see to see what it means) "Dragon Lord" is worth it for the final battle only. But the rest of the film is for Jackie's collectors only and for those who have seen at least 15 other movies (**)
