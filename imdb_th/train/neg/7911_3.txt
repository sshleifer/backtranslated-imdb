It is not outstanding enough to be truly scary. It is incredibly lame. The story is not half bad. But the execution was horrible. <br /> <br /> At first, it was too early for us to be emotionally involved with what had happened. It's just a bad walk. The conversation doesn't fully shine, just flat and boring. <br /> <br /> And the characters cripes great. They make Deadpool boring. How do you make Deadpool boring? He is not funny at all. He's not crazy. He's just an annoying person with two swords that he doesn't know how to use correctly. <br /> <br /> Boring tricks And when he has a telekenisis that will make cards float and fly around or special power to jump into the air hundreds of feet? And what the heck is up with every stupid helicopter movement? I mean, we know that they mutate. But they are still in the scope of physics. The employees of bo are not helicopter helicopters. You cannot fly at ultra high speed. Any tricks that can not be done by Nor Deadpool, especially when using it to replace the actual fighting dance. <br /> <br /> And this film is evidence that wire work should be used by combat coordinators who know that What is he doing and knowing better? To use in every single way, photography to replace the actual fighting dance. <br /> <br /> The three most physical fighters in Marvel Comics (Logan, Creed, and Wilson) and bad fight designs. The most I've seen in the latest movie As if the coordinator showed his ability to just shrug his shoulders and let it go up to special effects. <br /> <br /> And then you broke up with mutants that didn't. Nothing Even mutants that are shown in their cells are powerful. (Willing to see nods, get mercury), then do f-all when they go out Only Emma is really disabled for this film - Frost and Cyclops do something. <br /> <br /> And since when Logan is so beautiful and stupid, "Ammunition will make the shape. Remember his lost. "Do not you think Xavier and X-Men will notice a big bullet hole in his skull when he performs his X-ray on X1? I feel sorry for Liev Schrieber. He takes good Sabretooth into consideration. He makes one of Marvel's villains easier than the truth, but he can't help this movie from the great weakness. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is the level of "bloodthirsty" sucking. Good actor value, certainly awesome action
