Started really well, good intro and built for the main character. But after 5 minutes, the charm will disappear. <br /> <br /> The character is in the same style as the main protagonist from American Pie and Loser, who does not support actors or innovative stories that make the film. This is a commercial success. <br /> <br /> Let's talk honestly - the performance of the header is quite bad. Keaton, Daniels and Faris do the best, but there is no storyline or conclusion that will lead them. He entered the movie. This story is planned without hustling or having a clear logical story showing the length of the story. <br /> <br /> While they come - guessing, I mark the spoiler box for one line. <br /> <br /> My advice: Avoid all costs, unless you have nothing to do / listen to or see. You will feel that the manufacturer just cheated you outside for one and a half hours in your life.
