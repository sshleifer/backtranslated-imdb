I will start with what I like. <br /> <br /> I really like music. Everything about them. Great. Costumes. Music. (As long as the translation is good :)) Every choreography is designed. <br /> <br /> I like the crab scene and the cooking scene. <br /> <br /> But that's about it. <br /> <br /> I understand that it is the Arty Blabela movie theater, but too much. Too much silence (It's interesting for an hour. But two hours of hearing and occasional moaning really ...), too much boredom (No more boring movies, no matter how deep! ) Too many porn scenes (I really understand, I understand that they are filming porn movies there, but actually it's really too much). I think the cinema should be watched and this one. Unable to watch for sure. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for music.
