My husband is a big fan of Robin Williams. I like him too But generally found that he should "Stick to what he does best" and focus on funny roles. My thoughts are confirmed with this movie. I was bored throughout the story. This is predictable. I know it is inspired by the true story. But I guess there may be something suspicious or intrigue, even while keeping the truth of the matter There are no characters that are well developed. There is a side story about the main character and his partner. This relationship can be further explored. But more importantly, a deep exploration of the "boy" mother. Her psychological details are very interesting. Obviously she has a long history that is not touched except in the most shallow ways. If my husband is not a great Williams fan, we would spend 20 minutes. Unfortunately, I didn't get $ 20 or 2 hours back.
