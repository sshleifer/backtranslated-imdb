Cafe Lumiere is a void that captures beautiful images. I am not familiar with the director's work. I am familiar with the filmmakers who should pay tribute to - Ozu Yasujiro, although not approaching Ozu with greatness, but Hou does not communicate anything about Ozu's mood and concentration. With meaning within the closed area One of the things he completely missed was the character's attention to Ozu - we didn't even "recommend" Hou to his lead character. (Perfect blank face) His people have no medium or close picture. One of the special DVDs offers interviews with the actors and allows things that can't be taken - see their faces well. <br /> <br /> There is a great Spanish movie by Bardem called Nunca Pasa Nada which translates to some. Things like "Nothing happens." That would be a better name for this pointless exercise. Throughout the story, we received clues about the vague Taiwanese composer, some of the work that we heard in the song. But the knot as well as everything is increasing This movie has nothing to recommend to you unless you are a train instructor.
