Good night, Mr. Tom begins in a beautiful village that is impossible in the south of England where the sun always shines. Before we had much thought about the time we heard radio announcements about the announcement of World War II. More recently, a train of mist that blows away refugee children from London, and when the shy little William is bound with old hesitation (which you just know will become the gold heart), our story begins. br /> <br /> What is the burden of emotion? In fact, it's just an old couple's formula. <br /> <br /> As I suggested, there was a time that was not felt in the village and not much in London, besides the strange old hospital, and of course there was no hint of horror. Of Blitz as a citizen of London, which was politely put into an air shelter Even when the husband of the school teacher was declared to be presumed dead But he raised up later. <br /> <br /> I found `Mr Tom's good night 'cliched and clear. The two Ronnies with straw in their mouth made their bumpkin country accent. <br /> Incidentally, my wife enjoys this movie for all the reasons I don't like it and see imdb reviewers. In a little part <br /> <br />
