The movie is surprisingly enough to have the quality of redemption when it moves to the end. In other parts, this movie is a terrible and lame movie with a low budget, a scorning script, and everything that happens More <br /> <br /> It's stupid that all the money in it Christian circles that they are not able to get enough funding to create a good movie I'm not a religious person, so I don't care a lot. But making movies is like a good tool to reach new audiences for churches and make people more interested and curious in reading the Bible, such as In that regard, these movies seem to be a wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> The low budget creates damage to the movie and makes it worse. It makes the movie laugh with the effect and it makes the movie as a whole as a movie B like feeling. <br /> <br /> But what makes this movie hurt is writing. Things that just happened in this movie were insulting, clever, and I didn't complain or talk about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the movie proceeds is unlikely, and the people in this movie do things that are not very likely, which is an insult to the audience. <br /> <br /> I hate that movie. It is sometimes like a TV series. It seems that they have a difficult time to make this movie full and they add amazing characters and developments to fill things. I can't be less attentive at times. <br /> <br /> Still, it must be said that the movie is stable and stable until the end when its story focuses on the content. Still, it's still all predictable. But it prevents this movie from looking like a complete ruins, and as far as this type of film is concerned, there are even worse things to watch. Although I don't think this movie will win a new soul, <br /> <br 4/10
