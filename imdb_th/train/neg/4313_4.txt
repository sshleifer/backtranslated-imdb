Like last year, I didn't manage the whole thing. OK, Chris Rock, as the host, is a good choice because he is vague. Or more, from the total amount that was put in his theater, at least not in the Top 10 Most Boring. On the other hand, many presidents are in the top 10 who are coveted. By auto queue (Although I know it's being used for scripting) but it's terrible to see that these things are really good. Actors can't insert expressions, look out of the queue and stumble on simple words (Natalie Portman ?? If there is no director, she disappears.) The night of fancy dress and boring speeches are long and boring. Beyonce Knowles has written good songs and has very few words and good response clips. Adam Sandler won the worst presenter award. <br /> <br /> To help me write a review, I want to thank my mother, my father, my lawyer and my manicure for all. People who believe in me and I want To point out that I have a high metabolism and of course I have not starved myself for a month I won't cry ... Thank you.
