Remember the chain channel that smoking was revealed 60 minutes ago a few years ago? This is her. Many people criticize the film without checking the credibility of the filmmakers. Manufacturers have used promotions. "Word of mouth" is a very successful fake without revealing the financial support and philosophy for this marketing rag. If you believe in the new Advent channel, the new age ruins and the old Balony days, this movie is for you. If you want to discuss about quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this film is to convince you that Ramtha is not a stranger, so you will give a lot of money to you. If you can nudge through the Ramtha website without being very convinced, maybe you think that the money you left in this infomercial because of madness is used <http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
