Just saw yesterday at the Sao Paulo Film Festival. Before going, I came here to see how it was rated and at that time was 7.4. The rate was quite good ... <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, I'm going out. (Never did this thing) but was embarrassed to do that as the creator of this film was showing. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it. Than all conversations Leading to everything and the worst and worst: Siemens and many organic advertisements in movies Despite the fact that I have paid to watch movies and entertain myself But I still have to be attacked by the main characters, chatting on the internet Or other characters that have a bath or a haircut just to make organic shampoos appear on the screen so much! All of this can be accepted if the plot, characters, love stories are good but bad. Really bad! A "Don't know how to do" Sex in the city <br /> <br /> Don't waste time or money.
