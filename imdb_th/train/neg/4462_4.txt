The "true" story of three girls entering the forest of Connecticut and ending up being hunted like crazy in the forest. This is a type of movie that should be played in a drive in America thirty years ago to mix acclaim. No, there are so many things that this movie works with a low budget to get a variety of results. This film can be viewed. But not scary at all (Blame it for some of the attack scenes for this story) It's a movie that you might have forgotten when you're done. Odds is that you never thought of seeing this unless someone sent you and said "This Look here "which is what happened to me. If you send a copy to return the film, it is not worth the effort to watch, even if it can be viewed.
