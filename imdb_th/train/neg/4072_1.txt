I watched bad movies. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't good enough to be a bad movie. It's not a joke. Oz is not an all-round talent. <br /> <br /> I'm a lazy person. <br /> <br /> Usually I see bad movies and curses. This is terrible. Actually, I checked to try and save others from the completely boring mess that I fell victim to. <br /> <br /> I broke the copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> It is too weak to wash the room very boring. See 'Bloodsucking Freaks' or 'Shock, shock, shock' for the exact shit that has benefits as entertainment. This sludge has a terrifying horror and anyone who makes it feel bad
