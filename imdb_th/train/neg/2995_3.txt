The episode of the x-files that are very rare cannot create excitement or when there is something that is totally boring to watch the detective and his former partner. Both die in an unexplained situation. Death is linked to The presence of a little girl who was there when death occurred. Mulder invented the theory that the police were killed by his colleagues, reborn as a small girl and a strict revenge. There is no connection at all and it seems to be just a random person who has been chosen to come back. I think this is a slightly lazy work by a writer and is now ranked as the worst in the history of File x!
