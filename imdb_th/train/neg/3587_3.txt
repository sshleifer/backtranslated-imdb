How can they get from Joe Don Baker (like Bufford Pusser in the first episode) to Bo Svenson (Bufford Pusser in the second sequel)? Why do they do that just because Bo Svenon looks like Bufford Pusser? Change because the first part is Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and one of the things I want to see in the second sequel. <br /> <br /> I'll give 7 stories out of 10 and I'll give it. Is 1 in 10 if the story is not related to Bufford Pusser's life but it And why do I bring this film to 3 <br /> << br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that anyone who is planning to see this cheese, and I do not recommend watching the first sequel.
