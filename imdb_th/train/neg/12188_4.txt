While I can't deny that his movies are always entertaining. But I felt that Martin Scorsese often showed little of his talent. The use of his flashy stylistic style in his films seemed to scream that "Look, I'm not the director of fantasy, right?" His best movie I saw was one of the least prosperous movies. "Raging Bull" The best <br /> <br /> For remake. This seems to be normal. Boring film stock for the environment in the 1950s seemed to be attractive. Close-up shots that blend in with the classic "Psycho" sub-score mimics tend to stimulate the ridicule of ridicule over fear of the atmosphere. The score for "Psycho" is absolutely shocking. This 'homage' just sounds wretched and annoying. Even talented actors sometimes able to send a show of the nickname "caricature." The notable exception to this is Lewis, who is wise as an impressive teenage daughter of the Bow family. <br /> <br /> The worst offender here is De Niro. Of course, he looked at the danger appropriately. But as soon as he opened his mouth, the aura just drained away. Now I don't have the expertise of an American accent. Originally I came from near Manchester in England. But all this, of course, he should have a more convincing conclusion. As a talented physical actor, he almost overcame this serious flaw, but not so much. It was a story that made me embarrassed as a De Niro fan who wanted him to leave the screen instead of showing anger in His performance <br /> <br /> (Spoiler possible) <br /> <br /> More - The best form of the entire film covers the final scene of the comedy drama. When Scorsese learns that sometimes the situation can create tension effectively as well as making the audience see the bombing of images and sounds? I still think he respects the reputation of using trickery. 'The killer is not dead, but' the price that the less talented person may hire <br /> <br /> All in all. Scorsese and De Niro performed much better together
