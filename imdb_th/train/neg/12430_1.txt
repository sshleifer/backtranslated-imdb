Home Alone 3 is one of my favorite movies. It is the cream of the crop, or if you tend to be more cynical, will rank (or down) there with things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it might be worse. Those two because at least two people made me laugh at folly. This constantly hurt me and claps when the credit starts rolling. There are no movies that hurt me so much. Now I will clearly point out why this movie is incredibly cruel. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is ridiculous. It revolves around the chip in the remote control car (?!) That is misplaced and the way that the terrorists want something stupid. <br /> <br /> The actions that follow are similar to those of the other two Al Alones. boobytraps and all but watching these boobytraps being executed is not a joke that is not worth watching I don't laugh (Or even a smile) even once, but I'm constantly cringed and hope that the terrorists will nail the children Birds instead of giving relief with cartoons are not scary and annoying. <br /> <br /> Performances performed by unnamed groups range from bad to bad. There is no single good performance here. Alex D.Linz is different and doesn't look like a child while the terrorists show (And judging by the movie credits watching) as they were chosen out of the road urgently ... and that is <br /> <br /> I saw some people say: "Man, it's for kids. Don't make "The man, the kids might like this. But they will get better things. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before considering using Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (who suck - see those comments). Better! <br /> <br /> So in the short term, this is an incredibly cruel movie. Obviously, this is the reuse of money because it is almost torn into the first two parts. The only thing is that they insult the first two as well. There should be no human, child or any other reason to see Home Alone. 3. Ever, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> 0/5 stars
