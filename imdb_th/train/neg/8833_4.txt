Not guilty with the actors (They show great performances) The overall story has not been performed well. This film was released with the best singers: the crazy old man forced the car of an Aboriginal woman out of the road. But then we were forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with a whole new character group ... and we didn't know why until 40 minutes. It turns out that they were the ones who finally discovered the body of the girl ... and the story continues from there. <br /> <br /> While the story was picked up at that time after 2 hours, I asked myself: Is this the point or is it just a sight? Continue to play With the allegations of racism and the stupidity of the way they manage to discover? Eventually, the story was not satisfactory and felt that it was not finished. While it serves well, there is no strong enough vertebrae to guarantee that it is recommended
