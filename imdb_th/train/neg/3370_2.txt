Just a stupid old movie Stanwyck's first son made his foot stuck in a really stupid state, and then her husband stuck his foot in a dumb way. In an attempt to save his life, Stanwyck again returned to misfortune and met with escaped prisoners. She had a chance to kill him. But failed stupidly In the end, her husband was saved and Stanwyck told us through the description of what the film's dumb message is. <br /> <br /> I can't understand that a beautiful woman like Stanwyck had made her a top woman in the golden age that emphasizes Hollywood's luxury. The nose is so beautiful ?? Take a picture? This film has short compassion, takes less than an hour. As if the director felt he was doing shit, so he thought it would be best to make that shit short
