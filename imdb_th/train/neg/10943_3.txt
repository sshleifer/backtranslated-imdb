This is a very bad movie with bad performances and Lorenzo Lamas is amazing! Every character is annoying. (Except Lamas) and no one will take root or interest! Including very boring action This film gives us three villains that should find danger and annoy when in reality there are boring, ridiculous and just a group of mental retardation that I want to close! Plus it looks cheap and expert! Lorenzo Lamas has many special abilities. But he couldn't save this shit and believed that the opening was really great, like the ending. However, the middle was incredibly boring and gave me the pressure to press. Fast forward button !, plus the conversation is particularly ridiculous!. There was a really cool bar scene that I really liked, but when Lamas headed to the pier it collapsed and the scene where the villain tortured Jennifer's family and killed them. Should find it disturbing when actually it is laughing! This is a very bad movie with bad performances and very boring steps. Lorenzo Lamas is really cool! But it is not enough, not recommended The direction is terrible. George Erschbamer did a terrible job here with moderate camera work, an unattractive position and made the film boring. The performance is quite poor (except for Lamas). Lorenzo Lamas is great here and while he doesn't need to show, he enjoys watching and has really cool characters and has many special abilities, even though he can't save this life. And he has Do not use chemicals with actors! (Lamas's Law!) Josie Bell is very bad here, and while she looks good, she's not very convincing and doesn't make chemistry with Cheryl Jeans's hotness but doesn't do much except screaming. And scared of her. No matter. Robert Scott is an annoying, annoying person as the main villain and is not scary. He laughs like 2 other people. The remaining actors are not good. Avoid overall! Avoid! Even if you like Lamas (like me) * from 5
