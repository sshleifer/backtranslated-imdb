I am a man who loves men movies ... I am looking forward to seeing the dragon fighting with the army with all the cool special techniques. How did this happen?

Why do you walk out to the beach to relax if your life is in danger? The actions of the dragon serpent are badly written ... and the ability to attack the dragon's serpent is very different in many movies that the main character is likely to die. <br /> <br /> Director Try to insert a love story in In the middle of the movie during the most stressful moments, this movie doesn't look after doing.

Just watch the discovery channel ... very excited. Any
