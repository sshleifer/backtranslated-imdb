I walked out of about 6 movies throughout my life. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't know how I can sit within an hour. I had to be in a coma that night. I saw it in the cinema 8 years ago. I can't remember the name. But I know that Penelope Ann Miller expressed in that. It must have really affected me to waste my time commenting today. Yech! vomit! Barf!
