Summer Holiday is the version of Eugene O'Neill's Ah Wilderness forgotten musical drama, and it is well deserved to be adapted from the Broadway drama Take Me Along, with the exception of Stanley Steamer. No Harry Warren songs -Ralph Blane that is memorable and a suspicious song <br /> <br /> It happened after the release of this movie at MGM. Let Mickey Rooney go and I don't think it's a coincidence. The film was created in 1946 and was released in 1948, so Mickey was 26 years old, playing Andy Hardy as a teenager. He was too old to be a part of the 17-year-old that affected the serious thoughts in the spirit of the rebellious youth. Rooney created four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948. The film killed a remake. Of the crowd of Robert Taylor, laughter, love at Andy Hardy and Words and Music in all of them. Rooney plays as an adult Even in the Andy Hardy movie, Micky also played Andy Andy, who had returned from World War II. Why is he in Louis B. Mayer, who only knows this <br /> <br /> Rooney's poor cast makes Holiday Holiday worse than in Ah Wilderness Traditionally, the significance of the character of the father played by Walter Huston and in the Broadway performance brought me together, which received the Tony Award from Jackie Gleason. The Great One players played the uncle. Uncle Sid, brother-in-law that Frank Morgan plays and this is DeHaven's main character. Came Judy Garland as the girls are cute and adorable Rooney and Marilyn Maxwell Hill plays a young woman who gave Rooney adult education. In the original play, Neal had her as a prostitute. But this is Hollywood of Texans, so Marilyn will get Rooney as well. <br /> <br /> Many talented people have hands on this. One and they do their best But the summer holiday fades quickly in the cold autumn.
