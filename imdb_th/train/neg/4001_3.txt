When hearing about the 1990 Cracker series without seeing them at all Of course, the combination of Jimmie McGovern and Robbie Coltrane couldn't be wrong. I'm wrong! <br /> <br /> Controversy, which is supported by repetitive and frequent recurrences Production tries to be very modern. But the box that flashes and even the characters that the children are frustrated. Robbie Coltrane slept through two hours with "Insights" that are impossible and unimaginable, and the police are shown to be unusual idiots in one dimension. As a result, tension never occurred and the next scene (No details for the fear of spoilers) is a terrible story that the TV series I've seen for a long time. <br />> No, I don't want to see these things anymore But I will return to the 1990s DVD series to see if they match the reputation or not.
