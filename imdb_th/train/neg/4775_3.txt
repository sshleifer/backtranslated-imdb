It's a waste of time. The movie begins with the clone of the Saw series, but with a worse performance than before. Melissa Joan Hart is extremely scary. The ending is nonsense and the story doesn't have twists, no plans, surprises and just a bad ending. I like some characters and I hope that everything will be connected at the end. It didn't happen. It was "wrestler", all ending with a bad show. I can't believe that I take the time to watch this. It's not "fun" as some people wear. Men who masked kidnapped people who were linked and forced them to think out. The connection is stretched and he should act as the main actor.
