This is a bad word. Where do I start ...... <br /> <br /> Cinemaphotography - This is probably the worst thing I've ever seen this year. It seems that the camera is being thrown from the camera to the camera. Maybe they have a single camera. It gives the feeling of being a volleyball. <br /> <br /> There are many scenes that are fixed continuously. When they made the 'split screen', it was ridiculous. Everything was all flat. It looked ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The color tone is different. These people need to learn how to balance the camera. 'This movie' does not work well and does not work well. <br /> <br /> Story - You must be kidding. If I was an SS, I would sue the manufacturer. Looks like Marks Brothers with a radio and Sutherland gun in his '24' mode - I can see this for free. Eva Longoria would probably be better if used less and had More expressive As an action without a brain, she doesn't have much. <br /> <br /> I don't see the real plot. Never said why the mercenary tried to kill the chief I just didn't see the President of the United States running away to find him in the utility tunnel of the building like a rat in the labyrinth. P-l-e-a-s-e <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This movie is a proof. I like 'big screen'. Since I was a kid. This movie is many and I will stop. About what Hollywood made chick flicks forget how to create a real movie. If I was the theater owner, I would start showing old movies, people with real actors, good stories - and good Cinemaphotography. <br /> <br /> 'Movies' This is a dog. Don't waste time or money on it. This 'movie' rating is zero! Douglas is not suitable for this role. I can see his age But he is boring to do this
