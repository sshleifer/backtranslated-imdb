I just watched this movie last night and I issued a warning for others to consider watching this movie in a word - no, I feel seriously that this is what students writing a screenplay will write in the phase. Eddie Murphy, like all other words, is a curse. I do not have many problems with curse as in "Good Will Hunting". If there is help to penetrate more characters. In this case, it's just a hollow teasing that is trying to pull * gasp * or laughter from the occasional audience. All three leading characters are all But its own unique, jerking on the wall, jerking the coffee house and "I'm not gay - Just-In-Touch-With-My-Woman-Side" -a-jerk. You just don't give anything to them! All of them are losers who are unreliable and shallow, who you want to see loss. For those who dare, this movie has a couple of funny moments, beginning and ending. The toilet / shivering scene is a joke in a bad way. "Ah, yes." Only my worst
