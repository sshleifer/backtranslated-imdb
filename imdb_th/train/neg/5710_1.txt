It looks good on paper. Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer collaborate again. This time is a mix of movies robbing Da Vinci, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But my dear, this is Indiana Jones. Speed ​​2 is Speed. Reasons (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) struggle with ridiculous scripts and lose heavily. This film is more than an additional advertisement for Freemasons. However, these Freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf. These Freemasons are the natural heirs of the Knights Templar (and no one talks about 'From Hell' or Jack the Ripper.) I don't think I reveal any spoilers about the plot because there is no one. Almost no doubt, there is no surprise and the climax - it was stopped, the national treasure is intended for Dan Brown. But gained popularity at the same level as Scooby's episode, with humor
