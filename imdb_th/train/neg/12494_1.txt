Nothing about this movie that i like Obviously it is a low budget with bad light and camera operation. (Almost like the Blair Witch project The story doesn't have much, and this movie is always addictive. In fact, I quickly passed through 1/3 movies but didn't help much. It looks like it might be good from the box. But I have to say it again: there is nothing similar to this movie. There are no good actors. The effects are fake. The camera work is terrible and the conversation is terrible. On my personal level, I gave this movie a 0 from 10 Yikes!
