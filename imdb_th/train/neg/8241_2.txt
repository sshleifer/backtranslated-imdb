This film has many problems related to this subject, which makes this film like a low budget project from people in the movie school. I have to give credit to the camp. Many times in this movie I found myself laughing like crazy. It's terrible at times when it's funny, which makes it fun. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a low-grade slasher movie with psychological horror. Then open a popcorn bowl, invite some friends and have fun. <br /> <br /> I agree with other comments that the sound is not very good. The dialog box is next to impossible to track most times and the soundtrack is there.
