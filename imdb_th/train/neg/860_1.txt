Kubrick met the king. It sounds very good. In the spring of 1980, I remember. Then the movie came out, and Kubrick's cult quarreled with the king's ideology. Since then, <br /> <br /> The King's comments say Stanley Kubrick received a great horror story and destroyed it. Cultivator Kubrick didn't give you the king's story. They talked about Steadicams, tracking photos, camera angles. Foreign and they insisted it should be considered by itself. When it happened, the two camps were right. Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> If anyone sees that it is a true adaptation of the King's novel, "The Shining" is a failure, of course, a wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> I used to blame that in the screenplay of writer Kubrick, Diane Johnson. (The author of Le Fort, Lafar, divorce, etc.) has a reputation as a novelist of social etiquette. Perhaps she was chosen because she understood the relationship of marriage or family change, but the small blue-collar Sidewinder of Colorado does not exist in the map in her universe. <br /> <br /> Kubrick, who may find satisfaction yours Of course he is a true director. And considering his own advantages, his screenplay "The Shining" - with the mistakes of psychology, wrong reasoning, popularity, supernatural reasoning and implicit reincarnation - does not tolerate logical analysis. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to consider Kubrick's "Shining" according to my own terms. I am happy to take this role as something other than the typical horror movie. But it did not succeed in studying the separation of alienation and natural madness Parsing both ways, this film is quite broken. <br /> <br /> Is the horror of the Overlook hotel true? Or are they only in their minds - first of all, is a terrible nightmare that is tortured by the tiny Danny Torrance. Then is the hallucination of his father? One notes that whenever Jack Torrance saw talking to "ghosts", he would really look into the mirror. It has been recorded that the labyrinth of the hotel-covered shrub appears to be a symbol of Jack's complex and complex mind. <br /> <br /> But if the Overlook's "ghost" expresses the real insanity of Jack Torrance, who let Jack be locked in the closet Dead clothes Whether he can go to the ultimate ax, ax, buffalo, <br /> <br /> and everyone can explain it with a straight face, a black and white photograph labeled "1921") of Nicholson as a tuxedo party - Who appears from the left field and enters the hotel ballroom wall during the closing time of the movie? We have to conclude that Jack Torrance's badness is caused by experience. "Life in the past" or not? (And if you swallow that since someone reincarnated should be their real physical model of the past?) <br /> <br /> Perhaps Kubrick might not care about his story May just want to cause horror emotions In any case, the movie will try to prevent the betting of the story in order to obtain both the rational and supernatural methods As a result, the story is organized. This film has not developed with age and certainly will not improve if it is repeatedly watched. <br /> <br /> I don't deny that the fear is awkward, bad, and general horror is scattered all over. The film is long, but the blood of those ejected lifts seen in the image of Danny repeatedly is ridiculous and ridiculous. And the infamous Jack Torrent tagline ("Wendy, I'm at home!" And "Johnny's Johnny!") Just penetrate the tension of the movie and spread the energy. The story goes out (I know: I sit in the theater and Hear the audience laughing relieved: "Wow! Glad we didn't have to be serious about this! ") Kubrick was finally in the sea completely - or the most cynical thing - during the scene in which Wendy walked around an empty hotel while her husband tried to Chewed their son A hall full of mummies, everyone sitting there in a party hat? Yes, now I'm really scared. <br /> <br /> From the ability of Jack Nicholson over the past several years, it is enough to conclude that he has performed with eye-catching, eyebrows-wiggle, Shelley Duvall's performance in the form of Don Knotts in "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken" is the best game in silence. <br /> <br /> This movie is not successful - not a adjustment, not a condition of its own. It may benefit from 3 out of 10, but I give 1 because it has been rated too much in this forum.
