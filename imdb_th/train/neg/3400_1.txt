This movie is rubbish by itself. Watch this movie if you just want to listen to Gaelic or enjoy beautiful music. See other reasons and you will be disappointed. It should be charming, but not - it's just annoying. The character is hard to pay attention to and the performance is poor. The story in this film is not charming and scary. I expect to receive a warm family movie show. But this did not attract the attention of my fourteen-year-old daughter There is hardly anyone that I can't watch movies through to the conclusion. But this movie is better than ours. <br /> <br /> Although this movie will be screened at the present time It has the look and feel of the East. European films created during the Cold War In a way that has beautiful views of Scotland and not enough movies to exchange The real shame because this movie is a shame about Scotland.
