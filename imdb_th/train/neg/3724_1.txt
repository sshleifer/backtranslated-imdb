I saw this film twice through the Pentecost church. My family joined Nanaimo BC in 1970. I was 6 years old. My brother 4, then again when I was 8 years old 6. Film This made me and my brother very shocked. It's not just a movie. But it is a philosophy that surrounds many "Christians" about "Mark of the Beast" and rapture This film, the church and the untrained training caused serious paranoia in the future. For many years I was under the influence of the church and feared that Christ would be forgotten. I am now 40 years old. Through many years of counseling I used to describe this psychiatrist and the church and family belief system. I was crucified with hallucinations. In fact, I began to believe in this thing. It was my brother who reminded me that this cultural philosophy actually happened. I am not afraid of the future anymore. I have been satisfied with the fear that injected into the church by members. I use this experience to achieve my objectives. I am approaching a license as a psychologist who specializes in childhood injuries.
