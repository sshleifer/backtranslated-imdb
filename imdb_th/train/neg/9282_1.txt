This film is not worthy of the prophetic name. It's terrible that it destroyed the original nature of the first three. Shouldn't do that, they should change their name. <br /> <br /> They didn't spell the name of Damien Thorn correctly !!!! And without Kris, which is the most important element of the movie. All the Omen pulled out of the rack and then Burns
