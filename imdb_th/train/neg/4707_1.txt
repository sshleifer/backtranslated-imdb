OMG This is the most painful experience in my life when I watch this. I can finish it with what happened to Nick. Their best thing about teen Nick is Drake and Josh and that is the broadcast. Children's songs are annoying songs and my little sister wants to watch the program because she likes everything that comes with Disney or Nick. Normally, after watching this program, she said "One of the worst programs I've ever seen is very boring." My little brother is asleep. I'm jealous of him. In a nutshell, if a 3-year-old child without brain activity, you will enjoy this show, otherwise the channel will change immediately.
