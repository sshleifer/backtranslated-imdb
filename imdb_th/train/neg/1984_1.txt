Absolute cow dung steaming division It was incredible for me that this movie was created. Old hip hop and guava seem to be incompatible. What the target audience is these people think of when planning this trainwreck. <br /> <br /> Not only is the concept and planning a joke. But the performance is brutal and the fact that some good actors have this nightmare The movie makes their entire career as a laughing stock chick from clueless. Shouldn't be forgiven and she is withdrawn from the remaining dignity that she has. After reading the first ten conversations, she should ask which of her friends played this funny pearl. After some research, I found a list of other actors sent through this movie: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah and Marge Simpson. <br /> < br /> Easy to say. I want to watch TV more than watching this movie again.
