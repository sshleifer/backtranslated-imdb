<br /> <br /> This movie (Not a movie - clearly recorded on a cheap cam) may be one of the most smelly films in history This film is not a survey of anything, and it is not more emotional than staring at his own warts. Pointless script and maze with all planning elements that act as segways during the supposed sex scene. However, even the sex scene is lame. Except at the beginning, they are about three seconds long. (After that, again, maybe my version has been cut) and funny. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good movie If you are looking for exciting sex, you don't want this. No matter what your goals, desires, or views of your life are, you don't want to watch this movie. The way they got Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski, and Ed Begly to be shown in this explosion finally puzzled.
