This part of the Masters of Horror is very bad. Clearly, Mr. Carpenter needs to learn one or two things about proper and reliable pacing and dialogue. There are times when I yell at the TV screen to make something happen. Perhaps he thinks he has created excitement, but Carpenter needs to cut the excess score back to give him a simple musical score. How many times did the girl say that "Oh no, I don't have this child!" Of his trademark What is missing here is suspense and energy. As if he was walking sleep through the process of making movies. <br /> <br /> For the Carpenter movie, better try the classic, tried and true My personal favorites: Family, Jenifer and Dreams in the Witch House
