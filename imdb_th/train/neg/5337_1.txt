There are many negative reviews about "stay away Joe" in here. I can no longer be silent and let injustice happen. This is another side that you have not heard. <br /> <br /> Elvis Presley's movie is a mistake I like for a simple reason: they are the perfect movie for true relaxation because I don't have to think when I watch them. That means I don't have to worry about lacking a complex plot because there is no proper plot to start. I can take off my shoes, pick up beer, sit back, close my brain, and enjoy the general strangeness and rock and roll songs that can easily be captured from their greatest decade. <br /> <br /> In the book My "stay away, Joe" will fall "terrible category" - category now, if you like me and admire "Trash Values" This is the best experience of the 1960s. It's terrible that it's almost a bright light to watch, and when you think it's not going to be worse than this, it surprised you in a way that is. As much as possible In the end, you will be surprised by the new level of foolishness that you don't know about laughing or crying. In conclusion: I love it because it's so funny that it was once a movie-making version. - When it reaches the lowest point 100, it will become a terrible classic movie immediately.
