When looking at other comments, I was surprised that there was no warning to those who might be the audience of what they had to look forward to when renting this garbage. First of all, I rented this thing with the understanding that it was a knock that Indiana Jones showed capable. What I received was one of the most disgusting movies that I remember trying to sit and make things more shocking. The film had a rather high production value. <br /> <br /> I don't think this is. Is a spoiler, but if it is warned ... <br /> <br /> If your thoughts about entertainment are watching, Bimbo is raped from behind by the Fearsome clan leader while she is staring at the eyes. Dead Every way to rent this flick If not, I suggest you go to another place for entertainment. <br /> <br /> Come to think of the scene, which is summarizing the movie that nothing else I have to mention.
