I just saw this movie and I have to say it's a waste of time. The girl playing Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) can't do anything. She naturally read her script, and she expresses an unnatural facial expression through the entire film, Rosanna Munter, who plays Petra in a natural way. She plays her role perfectly. <br /> <br /> Spoiler! The story is easy - we've seen it many times before. She broke up. He found another person jealous. He broke up with another woman and they eventually reunited. There is no surprise. Everyone knows that Eva will break up and Adam will "ask" with Petra. The only thing that no one sees is Petra. She became a serious person, all of which was one side of Petra that the audience had never seen before in the movie and told him to win Eva's heart that was really cute. Is the only actor who provides memorable performances. <br /> <br /> This is an ordinary movie with mediocre performers, so I don't recommend it!
