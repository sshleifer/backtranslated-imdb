Nothing special in TV series and movies. Which is interesting for TV programs that are not found in life and entertainment Earlier, David Lynch was disgusting in the style of storytelling and after that <br /> <br /> From the moment when the body of a poor girl misunderstood on the beach And was introduced to the most disgusting character of Twin Peaks. Trance minds. <br /> <br /> The almost dull, almost disgusting mind in this movie seems to be romantic. And destroying human life Psychedelic Phenomena in Movie Twin Peak: Fire Come Walk with Me <br /> <br /> I watched it all to make sure I didn't miss anything. I didn't. It was just one obvious sexual fetish that spread. Expanding into a long series that is full of ridiculous pornographic movies. Help yourself to escape from doubt and see what else has at least the ability to tell a story rather than tricking you into a psychoactive movie. <br /> <br /> I've heard many reviews. And how crazy David Lynch is Because of his ability to determine misery and tragedy and make it a miracle This is not the art of imitating life as far as the art of ill-twisted art. Do the best to inspire a completely illogical life. <br /> <br /> Be a favorite and avoid this garbage.
