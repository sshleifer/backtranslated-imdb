So I started by saying that I saw this movie as part of a bargain. I was bored one day in 1997 and I went to the movie rental shop. I asked the staff what was the worst movie he had in stock. He came to me "Lucky Stiff" without hesitation. He told me that he would waive the $ 1 rental fee (he said it was wrong to charge more) if I promised to watch the whole movie. ... <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Even great God I do not need to go into the plot details. Read other reviews. Funny stories are not reasonable. The performance was terrible. I know it should be a joke. But the stupidity of the main character is breaking down You may try to see it as something to laugh. But it is terrible that it's not funny. Avoid!
