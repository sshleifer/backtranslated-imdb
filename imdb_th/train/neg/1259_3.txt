Thanks to Hollywood, another classic film that was completely destroyed by the new, cheap, shallow effects and redundancy "Planet of the Apes". The original is a clever and thought-provoking movie with a clear message. Much It is a movie that focuses on almost all the dialogue which sounds very boring. But actually it's very interesting. <br /> <br /> It looks like this movie will end with all the conversations. Instead of being a great movie, we received an incredible two-hour chase movie. The dialogue has decreased to a minimum, the interaction of the characters and the development does not exist, and in most cases it is difficult to understand what has happened. We returned to the scene with many pointless action, one that was a bit funny and a boring semi-intelligent conversation. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is it. Looks great The makeup of the monkey is beautiful and the scene and background are beautiful as well. However, this does not distract from the fact that "Planet of the Apes (2001)" is a superficial and simple film filled with some paper characters, stupid conversations and non-existent plans. Please stop Hollywood breaking the great movie by turning them into an angry person. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the ending doesn't make any sense. <br /> < br /> * leaving every star Mostly for pictures <br /> <br />
