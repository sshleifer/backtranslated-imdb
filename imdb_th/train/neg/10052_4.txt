Warner Bros. produced many potboilers in the 1930s, and most of them are fast, economical and fun. I like the way the studio uses less charming elements in our daily lives. This is one of Warner's extraordinary fiercest melodies. Edward G. Robinson plays a brutal newspaper editor who revives the story of a 20-year-old murderer with a tragic sequel. Robinson gave a lively performance. But he was surrounded by actors who didn't cut mustard HB. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff were good, but the poor performances of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second period led to pain for the movie Star is not particularly good during her big drama scene near the end of the movie. In addition, the tone of this film seems ridiculous in the context of pre-code Hollywood. LeRoy's direction is full of innovative touches. But he couldn't overcome bad performances and funny situations without intentionally. Sol Polito's camera work was strong. However, this ruins was nominated for Best Picture (in the year that made us "M," "Dracula" and "Frankenstein")
