The problem I found in this name is I'm not sure whether the director is trying to produce a documentary or movie The combination of these two types is not working and that makes everything hang in the middle of nowhere. This is much more because the director has chosen the most likely thing to happen around in our daily lives. If it was intended to be a thriller / drama, it was too boring and boring. In any case, what is the moral or the message that the director tried to convey to the audience? Is there a person who treats others who are not willing to be treated cruelly? There are many crazy people around us? Then .......... what?
