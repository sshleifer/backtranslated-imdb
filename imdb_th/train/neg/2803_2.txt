Considering the limitations of this film (All movies in a single scene - music studios - including only 5 or 6 actors) should be much better if you have these limitations in creating movies. How can light be bad? And the actors are terrible. I'm talking about me under the acting in Clerks, except that this movie is fun. It tries to do good But really failed. <br /> <br /> It makes a lot of effort to reference myself in a few parts. But the lines are so bad that the actors are terrible. And the main character, Neal, the pathetic guy Clearly, there are a total of 10 people making this movie and they know each other and it may be the real rock band they have. But these people really do not know how they are around This was created in 2005, but they all looked innocent in the prequel era. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I didn't pay to see this. (Starz on Demand delivered again. But it is under the title "The Possessed", not Studio 666. It doesn't matter what you do with the game name. But it can't help This may be a much better movie - there is no excuse for making this bad movie when you have clearly limited parameters that filmmakers have when they do this. Work within the limits you should do. In what you can control You can work best. But they think that ordinary people are good enough And the music video is terrible. I get angry quickly. <br /> <br /> So 2/10 is fair. If you're in b-movie shit, I think you'll go see this.
