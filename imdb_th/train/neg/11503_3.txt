Quentin Chris once said that when things are too beautiful, one thing is romance. When things are so horrible And when things get ridiculously treated, they're spotting Unfortunately, Leon de Aranoa falls into the second category. Obviously, this director tried too hard to create Spanish "Ken Loach" movies without being able to capture the clowns and the warmth between the characters that raised Loch's movie from 'depressing'. Los Lunes Al-Sol is the only downfall. Things are terrible. The character, the last moment of misery, everyone reaches the pinnacle in the same spot, and if the story is not scary enough, Aranoa clears the story with gray and gray visible. This film has been ridiculously rated at Goyas. The film shows sympathy for the weak citizens in society. In this case, the unemployed port workers did not automatically create a good movie, even though I was the first to see Sympathize with the fate of these people This film made me less interested in their fate. In the 21st century, the unemployed Spanish people do not live like beggars and public transport ferries have proper toilets and it's hard to find a bar with a gambler. Little and have little pleasure to meet Apparently Leon de Aranoa had no clue about the Spanish laborers and was not helpful. Is the only conclusion I can do The scene in which men watch free football matches are copied directly from the movies related to More 'reality' in the trap of 'poverty' is "Purely Belter", which is far more charming, more humorous and still sad.
