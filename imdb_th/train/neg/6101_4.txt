Playing almost two people and the interaction and performance of the leader will be important. Not particularly good This may be stronger than if it were created as two plays and then worked as a movie. <br /> <br /> However, the vampire vampire that looks like autism is fascinated by stripper ( Because watching too much porn in a crappy house) he wants her to tell him about the sunshine. He would be better off finding someone who has daily work or someone who is good at drawing with words like poets. But then they may not have a hot body. <br /> <br /> After he received her Do what he wants (And he is not very good), he intends to feed her from 6 o'clock in the morning, which is the time when the sun rises Although the fact that he said he could go without food, it would make him hungry. In addition, he claimed that he could not let the stripper go because she knew about him. But he let a lot of other people learn what he is There are many inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> Why does this vampire choose to stay in a house with lights from the street lights and the neighboring buildings pouring down badly as if it were in the daytime? sure All the time in this world, you think he works better or fixes a little place. Clearly he is not a rich vampire. <br /> <br /> It's probably a remake and I want to know if the original version of this story is Dance of the Damned, even though it was directed by Katt Shea and Other films that she directed for Corman (Stripped to Kill, StK II) were quite bad.
