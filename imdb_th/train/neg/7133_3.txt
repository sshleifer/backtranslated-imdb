I felt like watching Fast and the Furious again, but with different actors and a slightly different plot. I would say that the cars in this movie are very cool. So if you like cars fast, you may find that this movie is mildly entertaining. I also like Nadia Bjorlin because I saw her from our Days of Lives. She is a really good singer. But very bad that they gave her this lousy song to sing in this movie I mean music about cars No matter where you are here on the radio Since it's a Hollywood movie, you have to tell this story. But in real life, I don't think Joe would normally meet a hot girl like Nadia Bjorlin, who can drive a car repair race. Engine and a lead singer It's a very stupid thing. <br /> <br /> The other side, who is willing to bet 25 million in racing, is nuts. But it was very cool at the end when Natasha stopped before reaching the finish line. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: This movie is for crazy cars. So if you like cars fast then I will recommend this.
