When I saw an example of this film, I thought it might be stupid. But at least it will be funny to me wrong, even though some manufacturers have interesting messages to convey to parents who are left alone and reassess their lives But the way they tried to send the message was horrible The first fifty stupid things happened to both of them quite funny. But at the end I almost predicted that the embarrassing thing will happen. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, I like the five lines of dialogue and everything else is the most common. More than I can say for this movie
