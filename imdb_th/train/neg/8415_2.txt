This was longer than the Ten Commandments, the Lord of all rings and the trilogy matrix combined. My Oh, I'm a nightmare. This is beyond the biggest expectation of the year 2006. This is not a non-scripted and lamenting moment. Movie Musicals can do superbly and bring excitement to the audience. Dreamgirls use the path of Chinese torture in the form of endless music editing, low performances and poor governance options (Mr. Condon seriously, you have made the old billboard image. Already? See the rise of the chart and this is the Billboard announcement through to show you again .... and again .... and again)
