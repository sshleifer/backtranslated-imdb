... which is not a clear guarantee. Overall, "DinoCroc" is a much better movie. Of course, in the film, Matt Borlenghi plays a full bag, which takes the entire movie to cry about his little brother received from DinoCroc, but the special technique in "DinoCroc" is better than the plot line. And the performance is better This is the problem of "Blood Surf" - 1) The killer crocodile looks like a kid with a retractable jaw. 2) The storyline is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. was shipwrecked on a deserted island where they met a group of people The Philippines, an ugly Filipino who tries to force himself to approach women in groups Which is a complete waste of 15 minutes of the movie and 3) there is not enough time for the crocodile There are a few redemption features of "Blood Surf" - the actress is charming, attractive, and Matt Borlenghi is eaten by crocodiles at the end of the movie. But if you are on a dead bed and have enough time to watch Matt Borlenghi's movie / Crocodile Killer, skip this movie and shoot "DinoCroc" instead.
