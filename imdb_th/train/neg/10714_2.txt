For the two most funny comedians, this movie is very scary. Fast forwarding and never better than this! Waste time and lose money! Tina Fey is a great writer. I think she would be very good in comedy. The example is great. But they only show the best parts of the movie My husband still thinks for chick to flick it and suck. What happened to that The movie is very slow and boring. I will not advise anyone at this time. I need a refund for this one! BOO from us here in Arizona. Thank you. But don't thank anyone. Do something stupid like this to make others think you are pregnant. I think it will be very funny. I have my own children and I have helped others with children. It may be more practical.
