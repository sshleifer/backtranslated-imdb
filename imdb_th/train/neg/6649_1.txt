Ok, anyone who can honestly say that this movie is great or even good, can be a hoax or get to know the director, writer and producer and try to stimulate the movie. this I watched this movie because my friend worked on this and it was terrible. I have been an actor and have worked in the industry for a while now, in big movies and independent consultants and this film makes me tired of tears. The reason I was so cruel is because this film has a clear distinction in "Of Mice and Men" and they should sue because it's a very scary story. In an industry in which Hollywood seems to be bankrupt creatively ... for someone who will bring classic books and movies "Of Mice and Men" to destroy it with a new spin that makes me crazy. Actors, accents, Conversations and directions are amateur and writing is dismal. I mean, if you are going to revolve around an existing story, make sure it's good or better than the original so that the rotation is justified. Don't like this movie
