This movie is very pathetic. It shows that deaf people like others who hear other people Actually, some deaf people are careful to date people who hear. But they don't have to be angry like Marlee Matlin's characters throughout the story. Deaf people do not go to the bar and dance in the way Matlin concludes. The movie itself is more boring than pathetic. It's so boring that I want to believe that it's a sleepless movie. If I have trouble sleeping, I can meet children in Lesser God and watch it make me sleep. <br /> <br /> Remember that this is a deaf person who speaks.
