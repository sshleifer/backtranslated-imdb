After I watched this movie, I came to IMDb and read some reviews that were compared to Lost In Translation LITE. When I read that I saw the checkpoint immediately, <br /> <br /> This movie is an effort. Not good in a similar theme Interestingly, the format of the movie is almost the same, but PACING is incredibly different. "10 shows" accelerate viewers through the film's 1-day timeline, while "Lost In ..." is better planned. Seems to be expanding for a few days. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that some people will see this because Morgan Freeman and will be disappointed. It seems that his better role now is to support the role of a large blockbuster film rather than the leading role in limited screenings and indie movies.
