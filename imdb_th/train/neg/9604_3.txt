The first thing I noticed in this movie, of course, was the amount of nudity that was not needed. It is not nudity or anything, but there are many things that are not needed. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman, believing that the ghost in her family is her ancestor that resembles her as a werewolf and believes that fate In fact, I found it very interesting. The original Wolf Man was intended to be a complete psychological film, but Universal threw the real Wolf man that you Never seen to find a buck or two I found this idea of ​​people who are not really werewolves. Unfortunately, this is not the movie I am looking for. <br /> <br /> We know that she is not a werewolf from the beginning, so there is no excitement or distraction. They try to make this movie look like the real situation. They fail there. By adding one or two parts of the movie that refer to this as true At first I was excited when reading the description of this movie. But I gradually realized that it was only concealing so that they could reveal the main character's chest as often as possible. <br /> <br /> Anik Borel is an actor who has a good actor role. The role of psychosis Since the character Danniele doesn't have a brain and is just a bean that runs around crazy and annoying and snapping like a wolf, it uses a little skill to play. She had a time when her performance was broken into an eerie time. But was quickly destroyed by camera work and bad lighting The idea is great. But was horribly executed throughout the story 3/10
