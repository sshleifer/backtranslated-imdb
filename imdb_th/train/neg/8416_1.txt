It's reasonable for me that this movie is gaining popularity from Hollywood, because often in Hollywood, it's just a popular contest. It is also reasonable when you think that people who like this movie may respond to countless songs that are spitting out for you more than the story. Still, this movie is being featured and overloaded. Eddie Murphy looks ridiculous. There is no way that Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles will give the performance that has received a lot of Oscar ratings before watching the movie. I can't believe that Condon will be nominated for the Oscar director when he makes the album. Glitz doesn't replace anything. Many songs cannot be created.
