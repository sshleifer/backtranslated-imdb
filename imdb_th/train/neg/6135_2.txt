America wants the best man possible to win the "game". They hire someone a gymnast (Brother Oh!) Played by Kurt Thomas with the skills needed to win in the game. With a ninja, a village of madness and Richard Norton who Kurt Thomas said (His exact words) I miss this in the cinema and it's a good reason because I might be fired because of the laughs that I broke into at regular intervals. The first thing that comes to my mind is how weak these ninjas are. If a gymnast can kick their ass, Kurt Thomas is like 5 feet 4 and he almost doesn't affect anyone as "The best person for the job" for Kurt Thomas's acting ability. If you can't say anything well ... the amount of cocaine is used to give a very stupid idea. Only the decision to choose Tara Reid as a scientist 18 years ago. This is the most stupid movie I've ever seen. No need to say that I can't find an answer that can't be caught. I laughed so hard that I almost breathed twice, only in the 80s. Can create a movie that has bad ideas. Although for recording, it is the only film that has had a terrifying hero. But he could not pull the sword that was wedge out of the ground This is the most awesome action movie ever made and one of the most hilarious. <br /> <br /> * From 4 (not good)
