What happened on this planet with our beloved Ramu? Is this man the creator of Sarkar, Satya and Comapny? I refuse to believe that if AAG is Ramu's most ambitious project, he has jumped off a high cliff, obviously by raising the industry's greatest performance at all times. This movie was created to be like a brick. I'm leaving the theater But I was forced to sit because I could not take the car out of the parking lot before someone else went out. If so, nothing would make me sit beyond the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is nowhere near Sholay. It's not approaching it within a mile. I believe Ramu loves The Godfather more than Sholay. Sarkar is a classic piece. I read Ramu's interview a few days ago, which the interviewer said that Ramu didn't sleep more than 4 hours a day, which was not stretched at all. I completely agree with this, because his lack of sleep may be something that must be done in the movie <br /> <br /> Ineffective in the performance, Amitabh Bachchan doesn't look scary. He looked scary in the posters and the background images I saw. Previously, Ramu's favorite Nisha Kothari did a great job in Sarkar because she didn't have many conversations. (In fact, none at all if I remember clearly) She opened her mouth in this movie and found a place in history. The new man who plays Jai's role seems shy. But didn't handle the role of Jai at all. I can't continue ... I'm sorry ... my pain is too big for me to handle now. <br /> <br /> I promise myself. Myself throughout the movie that I will see the original Sholay again to see again It is still there. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Horror movies, media and critics are cooking Goose Ramu. And to remind all readers once again I am one of the biggest Ramu fans
