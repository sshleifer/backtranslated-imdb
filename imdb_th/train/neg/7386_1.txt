I try to restart the movie twice. I put it on three devices to see if something is wrong. Has Steven Seagal's voice changed? Did he die during the filming and the studio must voice the person who is not the same as him? Or the sound from the DVD is destroyed After about 10 minutes, you finally hear the true voice of the actor. Although it is mostly a movie But it seems that the sound is recorded in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> I'll be ashamed to donate a copy of this film to goodwill. I will check this database before renting his movie again, all of which are good movies. (More or less) You always know what you get when you watch Steven Seagal. I guess not a lot.
