I think my favorite Mars is very boring and pulled out !! It's not funny. The audience just sat down watching the whole movie and didn't laugh at all !!! No, even the children laugh !! That's a sad story for Disney movies !! I think they should find a better person to play as Mars than Christopher Lloyd !! He's really stupid !! And he is not funny !! I think the speech set is really stupid !!! In the traditional TV series, the suit does not talk and move around !! In my opinion, they shouldn't waste time on this movie !! I let two thumbs down !! Really waste of time and I will not recommend any movies to anyone !!! Thank You!!
