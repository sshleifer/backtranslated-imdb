If you want to watch a good movie about how women can fight sexual assault, this movie isn't the movie you want to watch. It is a social explanation of the victims and the spoiler: Rosario Dawson flips the table from her attackers. Instead of using a criminal justice system, the victim turned to use caution. She is in essence a negative judicial system. The movie "The Accused" is a much better movie because the victim uses the judicial system and wins the "lineage". Tell what the victims of the assault should use violence Is the victim better than the accused? none !!!
