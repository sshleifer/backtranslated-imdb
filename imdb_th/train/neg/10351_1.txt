This movie is almost impossible to follow the story of the movie. All points of interest in the book are not available in the movie. They ended up changing it to be the "tweet" of Disney. The movie "Bie" between Meg and Calvin. It's terrible that it should be Hillary Duff, who plays or is one of the likes. This movie is nothing more than insulting the intelligence and magic of the book. I can't believe that Disney will be able to do the right and basic things. If you have read this book, I think you would agree that it can be made into a film that is equally good. This film should not use the title A Wrinkle in Time.
