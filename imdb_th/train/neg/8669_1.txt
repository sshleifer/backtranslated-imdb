First of all, I love Ray Bradbury's novel. It's a horror movie that is under your skin and sticks to you later. It is one of his best books with Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion wine. I just hope that this movie will be okay. It has many opportunities with great actors like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce and Bradbury wrote the script itself. And above all, it has PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> How will it fail? <br /> <br /> May have a spoiler inside. <br /> <br /> First The other is quiet. The horror from most books is lost because Bradbury must be forced to use violence as little as possible. All the pictures from the book ... gone, everything that makes you struggling ... lost. <br /> <br /> And then there is a show. As with many movies that Disney dumped in the 1980s, children in this movie could not be shown. And this makes me very bored. Nobody looks 13 but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship doesn't talk about. It's like an acquaintance. <br /> <br /> You think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce can pull this out in the role of Halloway and Mr. Dark, but here it's like they don't care. What they want to do is pay the mortgage or something. This is their best performance. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier is a good man like a witch. But the contractor of Dust Witch was not pulled out. She is less evil and does not appear in the book. <br /> <br /> Everything left from the ballon chase book, the mark of Jim's house, the true death of Mr. Dark, what happened? Depends on Mr. Coogan about the carousel, the fate of the salesman, the weight loss lever, the true death of the witch and oh, many more. <br /> <br /> And the special effects are even worse In the 80s, a carousel for one thing with a horse Crushed around it creepy and strange green mist that has nothing to do with anything <br /> <br /> I continue to think this movie is different from the original novel. But it makes the blood boil Don't see this movie But read the book It is Bradbury's classic.
