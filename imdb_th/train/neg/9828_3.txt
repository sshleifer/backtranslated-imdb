I accidentally rented it. I think after a brief review of the box that this is a time travel / sci-fi story, but it's "Christian" and I think it's a fairly typical example. If you were sold in the text, you might overlook the awkwardness of the plot / performance / etc., but I found it quite painful. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I pay attention to writing history in the story. This draws the 1890s into a paradise of family values ​​and morals. (The shocking character that the 5% marriage ends in divorce!) But it can be seen in this nasty side of the "high moral" society (gender, race and gender). Social discrimination is widespread as well) and until At one point, the hero complained to the shopkeeper about what sounds different from the complaints of some Iranian leaders about women's clothing styles. (As reported in the latest WSJ) <br /> <br /> Overall think I think it's something you'll like if you like this and it's useful ...
