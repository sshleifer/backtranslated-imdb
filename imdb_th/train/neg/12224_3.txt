Barbara Streisand directed and starred in this Jewish story. <br /> <br /> To have the opportunity to be educated, Babs are eager to disguise themselves as boys, which is not the hardest thing to do because she looks like One man anyway At her new school, she meets many male classmates who don't have any problems in believing that she's a man. <br /> <br /> Don't miss the best moments of unintended humor when a male friend. Babs thinks that she is a man, but pinned him to the floor, sitting on top of 'him' and looking closely into his eyes .... * laugh * <br /> <br /> mediocre movie ; The story about nothing is particularly interesting.
