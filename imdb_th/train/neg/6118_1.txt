This is not a good telling of the Tarzan epic. There is only one reason for this movie. John Derek wants to show off his beautiful wife in the movie! Bo Derek in '10' is the least comedy and rational in nudity and sex. This movie is nothing more than a soft porn. If you are so good, hurry ahead and skip the rest! This film (like Bolero) is another vehicle that Bo Derek shows off a terrifying performance. She is definitely a beautiful woman. But her poster is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris is a better actor. This is one of his little mistakes! Don't waste time on this movie ... go to buy books instead.
