Wow. Who ever said that Edward D. Wood Jr. never had any influence on anyone? The steaming pile of this donkey stool is the perfect case on the spot; It makes "The Violent Years" look like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" also makes Keith Richards's worst event seem like my first night of release. I have a nightmare, you know, woke up and a projectile that would not come close to terror the internal organs that Santa Claus dug from the pure soil that seemed to be mine However, I can think of some parties that this movie might go well. In addition, if you are looking for the perfect example of polarizing Santa-Satan on a VHS tape, do not look for anymore. Do not watch this movie because I have been informed that the MST3K version is ready to use. Move to Satan. This is "Santa Claus".
