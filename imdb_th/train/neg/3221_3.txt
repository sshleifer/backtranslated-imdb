Last night I watched the tube. The actors that were first involved in my interest The first scene is the person who gets the attention. Some people are funny, some are sad. Good character development I felt that the third part of the movie changed. If not at the beginning of the movie, I will stop watching. I constantly watch how it connects. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel that it never happened. I don't like the long stretches that many characters are saying in Yiddish (?). Other shoes? <br /> <br /> Would I recommend? Others say that most slang is the date (60s), but it's not too distracting. All the ending closes me.
