I am a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work in this movie. I don't want to believe other comments and I think it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once ... but believe me it's <br /> <br /> I didn't see the old movie. But why do they want to create a movie like this again The basic idea of ​​a good horror movie is to have the most intelligent script or should be excellent graphics. This film doesn't fall under those things and is still a fool. I just watched the next movie, hoping it would be interesting at some point. <br /> <br /> So this movie is not a big deal for both horror fans and the fans of Cage. You should do it because it appeared on television.
