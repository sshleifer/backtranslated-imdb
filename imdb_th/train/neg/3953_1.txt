I do not want to believe that this movie is allowed to do. These people should take drugs and overcome with blunt objects. They should be tortured. This film is a nasty thing, nothing but images from the first movie. The original thing is freaky and makes any sense. It's like the hallucinations of some drugs, such as resting on a mirror. In addition, things that are retarded on this field are not interested in watching the first movie because they still call Susanna the character of Susanna. I feel like shouting at the screen. "It's a joke. I give -50 from 10 my God !!!!
