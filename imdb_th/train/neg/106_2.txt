1st View 8/3/2003 - 2 in 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): 3-dimensional unconscious movie about carnivorous zombies in 3 stories in film history And yes, we can see zombies eating human flesh in 3D! Wow no !! It is repeated in 2D in the zombie movie. But what is more likely to make a zombie movie better is the basic story, not eating real meat. That is what makes a classic classic zombie good. Eating meat is thrown into a special form. Actually, we are bored throughout most of these 3 parts due to disabled people. (Twilight zone like) easily understood and reveals the final scene of the final scene slowly The last story is the story that the movie begins with. (There is a journalist investigating the ghost town called) and of course we will see the flesh of the zombies eating there. I think I said enough Classic look, not a boring 3D job.
