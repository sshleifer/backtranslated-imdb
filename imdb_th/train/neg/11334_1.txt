This is another blasphemous story in Europe that they destroyed the religion of their country. (Filmmakers who do not believe in these gods do not stop) Here we see the brutal explosion of Catholics and / or the Catholic clergy. That may be because the story makes Catholics and religious beliefs generally look very weak. One of the main characters is a priest and he is interested in food more than anything else. He showed nothing but an idiot. It is not surprising that the world-famous Oscar likes this movie. <br /> <br /> There are also stupid people who are acting too much to play as people who sacrifice their religion. Daughters take turns tempting students "Seminary" (which states that he has studied for six years). But saying that he is an agnostic!) I mean, how is this movie disrespectful ?? !!! <br /> <br /> This is a shame and a wonderful example of mania in Worldwide film industry (Not just Hollywood)
