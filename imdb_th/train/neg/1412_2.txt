While watching this movie, I received the movie "The Making of 10 Items or Less": <br /> <br /> Producer: I have good news and bad news. The good news is that we can accept Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> Author: Great! But what is the bad news? <br /> <br /> Producer: We can only hire him for one day. I guess we have to go find someone else. <br /> <br /> Author: So we hired him one day. Movie one hour and a half Eight hours long working day I failed to see the problem. <br /> <br /> Producer: But ... He will have to spend time with the characters. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we let him play as a character. At <br /> <br /> Producer: But he must understand his motivation and everything. You didn't say that we let him play as a big name actor who made cheap movies. <br /> <br /> Author: Why not <br /> <br /> Producer: That's ridiculous! But at least we have Morgan Freeman in our movie And I think we have to create a movie in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Author: Sure. <br /> <br /> Producer: This script is a shit. We should make money with this thing better. In the case of Morgan Freeman's character plug, Wal-Mart or Target or one of those stores, so at least some people want to sell DVDs. <br /> <br /> Writers: Of course! <br /> <br /> Producer: Wait ... This is about a small body with a quick lane "Ten items or less" <br /> <br /> Writer: Oh, I guess It's strange But we can't change the name now. <br /> <br /> I wonder if my script is very similar to reality. But then not "10 items or less" This is the case of good performances But writing is not good and I hate to see it happen. When watching independent movies, you expect to try to convey certain types of messages. I think they might try to find old, tired messages. "Don't let anything hinder you", which makes the movie die much better. In any case, "10 items or less" The only message I get is "See! See Morgan Freeman! "
