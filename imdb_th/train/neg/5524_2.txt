I do not like this movie for many reasons. Within the first ten minutes of this film, I was very disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie would save itself, at least for me, at least I had to pull myself out of the big hole dug up. Come. Unfortunately, it didn't happen. Two films that attracted me to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I didn't know enough about Lindsey Lohan's work to be interested in what she would bring to the movie. After that, I was disappointed and the three of them, even though there were "moments" in each performance I imagine that for each of them, finding their "moments" is a very difficult task due to the fact that there is a lack of character development and unconventional dialogue. Although the story is interesting But the overall film was poorly written, directed and edited that the performances of anyone who was an actor would suffer and lose. I think the impolite methods associated with sexual harassment and the humiliating and cynical views of small towns in America are the two main reasons that the film failed to mark. As one reviewer noticed and I agree, this film is almost impossible to market because it is a complete form. I wonder if at least hope (For the benefit of the performers) There are real gems on the cutting room floor. Sad for us But if it is true, actors can comfort that matter and feel quite good about giving their abilities and time to fail. Oh yes, and one more thing ... I want only once. I can go to the American movies, which includes sadly disappearing. But surprisingly, the setting of the hillbilly people, like one of the movies in which the main character is not missing In the country with pop cans, smash CDs and other trash!
