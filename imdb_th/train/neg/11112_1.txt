Wow, how bad is it? It's terrible, not in terms of blood - most of which are ridiculous CGIs - but in terms of atmosphere and direction The main thing is all funny. Within a few nights of tracing Vinnie Jones, he became a 'haunted' until the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend. Hmm ... Every New York photographer is a naive, guided and weak child ? Developing his character without any reason or point - and at the end, you will laugh out loud, completely predictable. The weak and irreverent attempt to jump on the modern MTV-style wagons - all the cgi, blood, but still without any real emotions. These are unintentional jokes - and make up. Concentrate by self-consciousness, strange camera angles, etc. <br /> Overall, this film commits a crime in creating other possible ideas. Things that may have atmosphere (Until the stupid monster at the end) was destroyed in favor of This film was not created for the audience - it was made for the CV - a profoundly self-motivated motivation.
