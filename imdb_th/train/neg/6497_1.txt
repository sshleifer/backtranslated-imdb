I have quite a high hope in this movie, so I get what I get from a salt and hope for the best. About a third of the way through movies that I have to give up is quite simple. This movie is a mistake that has occurred without any apparent reason and everything is disconnected. I love movies that make you think But this movie is just a lot of ideas that are thrown together and never really connected. <br /> <br /> Don't think it's a story of David Lynch-esquire. That some people believe is Nowhere near that kingdom Saying that it is an art to disguise the fact that there is no clear story or story is just the nature or reason why you lost 1.5 hours in the movie. The performance is good. But could not help the missing story I agree with one comment posted earlier ... "It's like being in the head of someone else ... while they're addicted to drugs," in other words, there is no reason.
