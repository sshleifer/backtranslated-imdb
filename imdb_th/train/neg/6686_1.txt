There is no entertainment point in this movie at all. There is no scary, funny or interesting scene in this movie. It advertises himself as a horror movie and then calls himself a comedian. It doesn't have any sense of humor. It doesn't try to be scary. <br /> <br /> In order not to be bored with this movie If you like this movie, even LITTLE BIT, more than you don't have a standard for what you watch. I have a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers are trying to accomplish. It's not funny, scary, shocking or interesting. Should it be a drama? Because it doesn't look attractive. <br /> <br /> Please do yourself well and don't watch this movie. Life is worth more than 90 minutes to see this.
