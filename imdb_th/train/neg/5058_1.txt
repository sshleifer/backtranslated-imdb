(When will I learn?) Happy inspectors on the NPR made me think that this turkey is Citizen Kane. Please allow me to drain my spleen ... <br /> <br /> I'll admit: The setting assumes that New York City has never been ugly, seriously and not interesting. I warned that the 70s were a bad decade for men's fashion and cars. And smoking all! If the character's price reduction plan is successful, <br /> <br /> to make the movie work (At least in my simple estimation) must have at least one letter that is sympathetic. Only one Ned Beatty came near and I waited for him not to end Nicky. If there is a shot that falls in the way of Mickey, it may cause most disregard. <br /> <br /> I can't remember when I really hate movies. I think I am a countryman who does not have "art". Oh well.
