I really want to like this movie. I absolutely love Kenny Hotz, and Penny Rice has a charming side for him. Not that I like money. Spenny ruins this movie He should let Kenny and his hot girlfriend hurl the movie. <br /> <br /> Next, it's boring with the scene with Roger Ebert. There are not many celebrities in this movie and most of them seem to. Don't speak more than one line Overall, this movie is disappointing. I suggest watching if you get it with kenny vs dvd season 1 spenny (come free for the 3rd disc). Regardless of this production, I'm still very excited to see The Papel Chase.
