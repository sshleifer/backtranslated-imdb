I still don't know why I forced myself to sit on everything. "This movie" isn't worth it with Memorex DVD-R that it was burned. I think I'm watching the final results of a high school student who steals a parent's camcorder. This is the worst movie ever created. I am truly from the bottom of my heart. I want to sue Aaron Yamasato for two hours that he stole from my life. <br /> <br /> Obviously it should be the purpose. However, if you should end up in hell and be forced to watch the 90-minute doo-doo roll, you will see that Yamasato is trying really hard to flick perfectly. The actors tried to show a big ass kick compared to Crimson Tide, but approaching The Marine. <br /> <br /> Shit performances are just the tip of the iceberg. The camera angle is terrible. The story is the best C movie - the story is not good enough to consider the ability of the movie B. The dialogue tries to be dynamic and witty. But is crap like everything else There are rumors that a copy of the actual screenplay attracted flies. In addition, techno scores are annoying ... not because it's techno. But because it's not a stop Correct. Music played in the background. THE WHOLE TIME acts as a soft reminder of how bad this thing is. I don't care what the disclaimer claims I don't buy. Bot doesn't make this worse than before, because it uses a way that is too harsh for this: a joke. <br /> <br /> "Movies" This story has a very low budget. But that is not an excuse for the recording factor set Great movies are born from content, not budget. Bot does not have both. <br /> <br /> Allow me to talk about the overwhelming power of 90 minutes that I lost if I had three ways with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel in front of the TV. And blood From the samurai, I will go out there sooner than Steven Seagal in the management's decision. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that some people will try to protect the film. Two, maybe three. "It's a chopper!" Or "Wonderful in a good way!" Or "It's terrible!" Those people are idiots. Good or bad movie There is no such thing as a good movie. But there are many things like stupid people who like to watch crappy movies do not get me wrong There are many children that are not interesting to make fun and entertainment. Slither is one. The bot is not <br /> <br /> This suckfest works about an hour and a half, and in my humble opinion it is 90 minutes too long. The best thing about this "movie" is the DVD cover, so the next time you're near the trash, bargain for Wal-Mart. Try it. - Don't touch it. Just look - and walk quietly.
