Inappropriate PG rating at this film has been one of the biggest mistakes of the MPAA. Whale Rider received PG-13, but did this movie get PG? Please. Parents do not be fooled. The primary school children go to see this movie is a big mistake. There are many times that I find myself uncomfortable not only because humor is not suitable for children, but because it comes out of the blue and is not necessary. <br /> <br /> But all that is a cat in the hat. Still a scary movie The appearance of the casting and the overall picture of the movie is just as economical. Beautiful Kelly Preston and cute. (Or abhorrent in this case) Alec Baldwin. Both have a good role, although Preston is too beautiful for this role. Children are air-conditioned actors, and it shows, especially with Dakota Fanning. Of movies that made me watch and not leave things on the screen. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there is a big talk cat in this movie? Mike Myers is a pity. I don't like him as Shrek's voice, and now I truly believe that Myers should not be allowed near the children's movie empire anymore. His depiction of The Cat is a minor version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. <br /> <br /> At the end, the cat shouldn't come. He should stay away. But he came though One day he destroyed my life 82 minutes. Anger and 82 minutes of conflict. <br /> <br /> Cats in the hat may be the worst movie for children.
