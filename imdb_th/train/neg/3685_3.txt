The main reason for watching "Red Eye" is Rachel McAdams, which gave a great performance, and Jayma Mays, who was excellent as the hotel manager assistant. The rest of the movie is filled with a plot hole which I will do thoroughly. <br /> <br /> Please don't read more if you don't want to know what happened. <br /> <br /> Here Is a summary of the plot. The character of Rachel McAdams (Lisa) is the hotel manager at the new Homeland Security Director who plans to stay that night. Rachel is returning from a funeral in Miami. But there is a call from her assistant until the plane leaves In the meantime, someone was sent outside the home of her father, Joe. (Played by Brian Cox) ready to kill him if Sillian Murphy (Jackson) calls Lisa to do is call the hotel and move the director's apartment to Which Jackson's horse herd is planning to fire the missile (From a fishing boat) to kill the director and his family. <br /> <br /> So here are some of the plot holes or ridiculous coincidences: <br /> <br /> 1 in At the end, Jackson convinces Lisa to call out, and in the middle of the phone, the plane is disconnected. Lisa tries to forge that she is calling. But accidentally, the person who was across the path from Jackson called and started smashing the phone to indicate that it was dead Jackson caught and grabbed the phone from Lisa. <br /> <br /> 2 At one point, Jackson's head had predicted that Lisa and her would be hit ... but it only took 30 minutes. <Br /> <br /> 3 Jackson caught Lisa writing a note on the glass in the bathroom. (Especially large) and he shook her slightly Only one miracle heard what was an 11-year-old girl. Of course, her words were reduced. <br /> <br /> 4 Lisa stabbed Jackson with a pen in the neck while the plane landed. His mobile phone and jumped to the exit, causing the passage between the seat and the passengers standing in line 18 rows, even knowing that there was a passenger with a pen stuck in his throat. Lisa G serves to open the door to the plane <br /> <br /> 5 all agreed was justified. (If not very high) but this is the point where it's really stupid Lisa enters the terminal at Miami Airport and doesn't have a cell phone signal. (All major airports in America have excellent mobile signal reception) <br /> <br /> 6 She runs through the airport along with Jackson to pursue and doesn't have one security officer. < br>> <br /> 7 Jackson, who lost Lisa in the airport while the train from the door was pulled out to the passenger station, caused his voice to disappear from the pen on the neck. But he can still understand However, he didn't bother to call his people out of Joe's house. (PS: No trains at Miami Airport But the train that they showed was scary like Orlando Airport. <br /> <br /> 8 Lisa steals cars and drives away. Of course, at this time, when she called the mobile phone, she said "Low battery" and will close soon (When will they stop using this codec?) <br /> <br /> 9 While the phone still says "Low Battery" Lisa arrives at her assistant in time to help the director and his family from a guided missile launched by a fishing boat to the room window on the 40th floor. He expects that we will not notice that this hotel is surrounded by three oceans. Therefore, the missile should be launched in the first suite, so there is no need to have Lisa-Jackson's entire plan. That's where this is? The original room of the director is on the 38th floor. One room in one room in the hotel with beautiful views or not. However, everyone went out before shooting the missiles. <br /> <br /> 10 Lisa drove to Joe's house to help her father only to see the killer outside. (As he was shooting at her) by crashing her jeep into the house But it seems that no one in the neighborhood will notice or stop. <br /> <br /> 11 Jackson came to Joe's house and knocked him out. (We don't see that ... may be the head of another person). Then he explained to Lisa that he had not killed his father because he wanted his father to see Lisa die. (What is this Saturday morning cartoon?) <br /> <br /> 12 For the rest of the movie (about 20 minutes), Jackson chases Lisa around the house and she fights him. Of course, the real killer (As may be played by Jason Statham) will be done with Lisa (or for anyone who is not a trained killer) in the first 30 seconds during this chase. Jackson then stepped over Joe at least once <br /> <br /> 13 Eventually, Jackson wins and he is about to kill Lisa when (you guess). He was shot by Joe. <br /> <br /> So here. Is my advice ... tell Wes Craven to be stuck with horror Or maybe he should collaborate with Michael Bay (director "The Island" that is equally stupid) and create "Red Island"
