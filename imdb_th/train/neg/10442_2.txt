Everyone on the internet snatch this movie very scary. I expect this movie to be more funny than anything. Instead of being a filmmaker, try to make a horror / horror movie seriously and they miss it. There are only a few good pieces and Samuel Jackson is a good line. In addition, it has a lot of blood and lively snakes. All internet plays are better than real movies. Now this movie came out, hoping that this joke will die. Do not waste time or money in trash that is too valuable. If you are looking for something funny and fun, go to the snake on the blog.
