The title song of this film ........... is the most lively ballad ever written! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in 1978-79. When I first subscribed to cable data in 1979, the cable had just become a general place. in the House (Or at least when it becomes common here in Missouri) <br /> <br /> This is probably the first movie I ever watched in a payout called "The Movie Channel" - Which was called "The Star Channel". Later, they changed their name to "The Movie Channel" in the early 1980s ........ I received a "The Star Channel" for a month with a new cable subscription. My "The Van" is one of the movies that are circulating heavily in that network. At that time <br /> <br /> I remember having watched this movie and thought it was normal for a teen to flick. Same as other middle-budget teenagers) ... The plot revolves around nudity and parties. <br /> <br /> I forgot that this movie still exists until I saw the movie. This again when not seen The past decade (I found a copy of it on a DVD for sale in a cheap trash) I remember it and bought it for only $ 4.99. <br /> <br /> It seems like I remember this movie much better (ie ). However, watching it at that time was a different experience than watching now (30+ years later). <br /> <br /> It's fun to see the kids list of rock and roll music. Smoking and having sex on the back of a fancy van (usually at the same time This is what a good teen party movie should have, in addition to the fact that the main character imagines having sex with a good looking opponent ... blowing all his college savings for Buy Dodge Van that was tricked. (There are walls, carpet, shaggy ceilings and water beds) to attract her attention and eventually he will have sex with her. But his rival discovered and followed him (So ​​that the two of them can make a difference by dragging their van) .... He and his opponent end up destroying both van and instead of stealing He is a winner in the heart of a preppy girl (less attractive) that he has half / goodbye to most movies and he decides that he is happier / better and ends. <br /> <br /> The movie has Funny moments But watching this movie more than 30 years later will become a more memorable way. Because I still remember the pizza pinball shop, it also brought memories about sailing around the small town while we were smoking because we shouted at girls who look good and hope to be placed. (Sometimes I'm lucky Looking for a girl to share the joints with me and we will aftermath in the back seat backwords. I still remember many songs on this move. (When they are new) ...... This movie serves as the perfect time capsule for that. Era in those respects (Bring back memories) <br /> <br /> One thing that appears in this movie that I don't remember being honest is .... I never remember when the full size van. are Popular in this film shows that they are. I remember this era as well and I am not a young man who wants them to have a van instead. I remember the young man in the 70s (myself included ) Want Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy Camaro or Ford Mustang hot rod But never Van, this movie makes it look like the van is the most popular item to go. And every young man needs one (Which is not true at that time)
