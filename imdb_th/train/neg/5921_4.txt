What happened during World War 11 in New Zealand when the American troops were there? <br /> <br /> The frightening story of 4 sisters is a fascinating story. Can you imagine Joan Fontaine as Sandra Dee's sister? Fontaine looked more like her mother. Even the joke is that Fontaine is pregnant in the movie. <br /> <br /> Piper Laurie and Paul Newman, which shows the excellent chemistry on the screen 4 years later. In "The Hustler" Laurie plays another sister who goes to Wellington to walk there, even if she is married. Woe comes to her when her husband comes back from the war. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons is a widow and finds love with the peaceful Paul Newman. There is a romance for children. Miss Dee here. <br /> <br /> The picture doesn't mean anything. Do they try to say that everything is fair in love and war? If so, they do not work well in selling this thing. <br /> <br /> Conflicts of interest with Newman and Simmons are quickly eliminated. That is what should be done quickly in this disappointing movie in 1957.
