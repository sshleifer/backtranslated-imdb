She may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe. But this film shows why she is the Razzie challenger of all time. Making a bad movie must be an indicator that she needs money. She can do advertising, why you shouldn't talk on the phone while driving, especially at night, on the way to the busy mall. <br /> <br /> Susan Montford should stick to production ( Shoot 'Em Up) like she is not as good as the writer / director <br /> <br /> She was taken by four gangsters to the mall and the first thing they did was tell her that they had guns. What are you doing? She began to push and curse them like she knew martial arts or something. She can escape But lost in the forest after being hit Why don't you run to someone's home? We got four cylinder thugs with guns to chase women with a tool box. Of course, their guns do not fit in with her wrench! Of course, she has rubber irons and a screwdriver too. These poor gangsters <br /> <br /> Now she goes home on Christmas day and she takes a gun!
