Devin Hamilton may be known as the legendary full moon entertainment. Sadly, his arrival in this independent studio occurred during the budget period and the lowest production value in many years. However, in a short period of time in his career, Hamilton established himself as the creative director who created creative and original stories. This doesn't mean that his movie will be good. But at least they are different from horror movies. <br /> <br /> In his debut, "Bleed" Hamilton presented us with creative ideas for slasher sub-types. Maddy (Debbie Roche) is the girl who finally gets her dream job. Not only that But it seems that she still met a boyfriend in Sean (Danny Walski) It seems that life finally smiles at Maddy after a lot of sad moments until at a party with Sean's friends. They tell her that they have created a "club" that members have to kill. <br /> <br /> <br /> Clearly, they're joking, but Maddy wants to be fit. In fact, someone's murder After that incident, someone started killing the remaining members of the "club" one by one. It was up to Maddy to figure out what happened while anyone could be a murderer, including her. <br /> <br /> Maddy is a very interesting character played by beautiful Debbie Rochon. It is a very interesting story in the genre with leading actors as part of the suspect. This concept is traditional and Rochon's performance is so good that it is a real shame that Hamilton did not develop the whole story better. The movie feels quite slow at times, and in general, the feeling is one of the good ideas that wasted on bad movies. <br /> <br /> The remaining actors are strange people in the sense that the actress. Everyone is very good. While the actor is terrible, Danny Wolske is made of wood and his performance as a yuppie is quite profound. Julie Strain, Brinke Stevens & Lloyd Kaufman appeared in a small pendant and had a small role. In addition, there are many nudity (both male & female) and actors look very good, so it is a real advantage. <br /> <br /> Low budget makes movies in the effects department There are very few bloody scenes and not graphics. (Probably because they don't look good); However, considering the budget, this movie looks good, at least <br /> <br /> Hamilton's efforts in the past, the sex trade "Delta Delta Die!" Is a movie created by Combined and more fun While this film is not as bad as other famous movies, there are still many shortcomings and may be interesting for Debbie Rochon's fans or fans of independent films without a budget of 4/10.
