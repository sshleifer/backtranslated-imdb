Bridges of madison County is a better version of this story. I felt that the ending of this movie was not handled as quickly as they did in the original English movie. If you are a very sensitive person who cries in the movie when the hero dies, you'll eventually love this movie. On the other hand, if you are a fighter in life and think that crying is scary, don't like the ending Overall, good subjects have good management for Indian conditions. Tabu is a good wife and mother. Everyone acts well
