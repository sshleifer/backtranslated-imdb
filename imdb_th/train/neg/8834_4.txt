There is some truth to this movie. I remember the story reported 15 to 20 years ago by four fishermen who found bodies in the water and they chose not to report until the trip was completed. I still remember that they were charged with interfering with the body. (Or have some expenses) I'm not sure if it's in Australia The audience outside of Australia must think that we live in a country full of rapists and serial killers. Wolf Creek and this movie will stimulate this awareness. This film reminds me of A Simple Plan, but as one of Australia's best movies, as many people claim that I can't be generous. Use this method, I will not bother watching again.
