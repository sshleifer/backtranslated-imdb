When watching this thing again recently, I found that it was heartwarming to see how they tried to bring the book to the screen sincerely, even though the shoestring budget and actors with hammocks meant failure. Unavoidable For any purpose, this is a disaster. But I think it's easy to imagine how good the Lord of the Rings movie would be if someone had done it with sincerity and money to hire the most talented artists and screenwriters. Unfortunately, Jackson thanked him for not being able to do it for a long time. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie made me feel that there was a limited budget so that this story could not be beaten. Interesting movies There are many times in this movie that may be more interesting than the way Peter Jackson did, although of course you will have to use your imagination due to bad actions. The way they try to show the world from Frodo's perspective Or the way Galadriel showed Sam what was happening at home. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I admire in this version - quiet moments. There is no time for dialogue. Background music Compare with the great camera of Jackson and the annoying score that seems to be designed to emphasize that each scene is the most powerful and powerful scene that we have ever seen. Jackson's movie is full of their own importance. This is a more quiet and quiet story. <br /> <br /> Jackson and the audience are affected by this production cost of more than 270 million dollars. US at least 90 million dollars for marketing A big tax reduction from the New Zealand government and still receiving a lot of savings from filming in New Zealand, not the United States. However, despite marketing claims, the intention to be honest has never been This is a good document. Philippa Boyens spoke a lot in the interview when she said that they intentionally didn't read the book again before writing the script. Jackson also stated that they originally intended to create a fantasy movie "along the line", The Lord of the Rings, and what he really wanted to do was Return of the King because it had many fights. But without character development. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie tries to be more realistic. Of course, there are many things that are wrong. The performance is terrible and everything sank and the pace went too fast. By nature, they cut a lot and adjusted other scenes and hence they deserved credit. While Jackson added many action scenes without the planning objectives, Bakshi cut the book scenes that didn't do anything to plot the next story. Actually, there is a strange similarity between the structure of the movie Jackson and Bucy near the beginning, both of which deviate from the original book in the same way - although of course some may be a coincidence. <br /> < br /> This is not a good movie. But there is potential there. Bakshi said in an interview with the Onion AV club that only animators can act as a master of justice. His version does not work. But he may be correct
