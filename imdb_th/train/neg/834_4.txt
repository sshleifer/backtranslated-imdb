I found this to be the most time consuming effort and money. I know that Disney always shows lack of creativity when creating a movie. "Straight to the video" but making the original plot of the original movie with "new perspective" is very low all the time ... release the original movie with new animations and new songs and call it "A new version of the movie that we all like," Nathan Lane returned to play the role of Timon again, surprisingly. The original story in the way that it actually happened ... as they saw, <br /> <br /> Of course, Tim is now the hero of the story. br /> Music sequences are weak and animation is nonsense. The singing ability is impressive for video features. But then again when the last time you remembered Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane was commercial. Overall, if you like the original, you will hate this. It is an insult because it is unfair to children and adults as well. And that is the sum of it
