There are two types of musical theater in the 1950s. The first time you have the MGM glossy productions with big names and wonderful songs. Then you will have a minor league with less famous actors than less famous songs and second director. 'Girls can't help' as the latter category. Tom Ewell or Edmond O'Brien is not famous and Jayne Mansfield is famous for her ... It doesn't matter. It seems every decade there will be a share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. The story is as thin as razorblade, and no one can help wondering if it is an attempt to sell a record for Fats Domino, Little Richard or others if that song attracts your attention.
