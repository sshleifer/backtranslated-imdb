This movie is very disappointing. From the notice that made me decide to see Phantom Love (why is it called this?) I expect to have something good and creative with beautiful images. It has interesting images. But these images are usually random and unreasonable. In fact, they seem to be inserted to fill time. In the end, the result is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I believe that this movie is meant to be the atmosphere. But it is not The lack of a consistent plot does not help anything. You might say it's mysterious. But I think it's not continuous without the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The main characters seem to be disturbed. But the plot didn't draw me enough to pay attention to her situation. If you don't see the list of actors, I don't know if you saw the main character as a child. This film has very little context for time, place or character. I'm not a rude person, but the sex scene (many times) seems pointless and makes me more confused. I remember Lulu. But I'm not sure that it is the same man, different person, lover, her husband or she is a prostitute It was only when I saw the credit that I discovered that the hair was meant to belong to her lover. This film manages to make things startling. (The dream sequence associated with Lulu's mother) looks a bit boring. <br /> <br /> The nail file is more practical. I will not be the fault of the actors because I do not have a lot of work. <br /> <br /> I don't know that the lack of context or circulation in this movie is because of incompetence or because it's a pretense But the result is boring. <br /> <br /> I don't want to talk about it anymore.
