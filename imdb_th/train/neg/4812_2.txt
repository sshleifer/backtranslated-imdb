I think horror movies with Orson Welles in it will be strange. The shaman is sure to be But it was a little too strange for it to be my own good This film has an eerie feeling as it deals with Satan's covenant / witch in a small town and the young woman tries to escape them. It seems that the director is trying to confuse the audience by using the scenes and dreams. In the last episode, there are too many unanswered questions. The worse thing is that the story is very confusing. It's hard to take root for any character. It seems strange that Welles will accept the headlines in this movie, especially since he has nothing to do. Maybe someday they may use tape, outtakes and bloopers from this movie. Now it's really fun!
