Such amazing actors are not wasted. Griffin Dunn, Rosanna Arquette, Ilana Douglas, Ethan Hawk, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walk and John Turturro, everyone jumping on board Attaching this name to Martin Scorsese may be a draw. But the end result is less than the sum of the parts Similar to the horrible nightmares that have been devastated, each scene seems to have been fabricated more than the next scene. "Search and destruction" is nothing more than abstract, nonsensical, nonsensical, indulgent, and the whole movie is absolutely boring .... MERK
