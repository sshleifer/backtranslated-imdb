I was bored with the misuse of the name of God in order to extend the life of my own world. Well, I do not abandon the idea of ​​Armageddon or the resistance of Christ. I do not think that only some people have a truly good life. (They seem to be mostly white Christian children) going to heaven. The rest of us have to suffer from hell on Earth for thousands of years just because we are not good enough. God may be a judge. But I do not think he will measure good at all levels Credited to the creator
