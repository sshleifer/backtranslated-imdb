As soon as I started to see the poster and heard about this movie, I was immediately excited. The Matrix is ​​incredible, and I can't wait to see the second scene, especially after starting to see examples for other movies. However, when I saw it, I left the theater with great disappointment, just like many other moviegoers at the theater with me. While the action scenes in the movie are amazing, as always, there are only a few scenes. In the first movie, there was a constant struggle. But the second time received a more edifying view (And very unfortunate) in conclusion, the plot has not much unexpected. The machine is digging for Zion with the intention of destroying it. (That is not a spoiler. Everyone sees it in the ad.) The dialogue of this movie is really scary. Unless you are an important psychologist, you often do not understand what is mentioned in the movie and because of this it is not interested. It is quite a romantic movie that shows the events that happened in the life and relationships of Neo and Trinity Agent Smith because they were bad people while he was in the first movie. Personally, I don't need to listen to that story or pay to listen. This movie is a waste of time and I don't think I can see the first story anymore. The monotonous dialogue and monotonous monologues from every character made me lose interest in the movie quickly and a small number of good fighting scenes pushed me near the edge. Which movie ends with "To Be Concled"? The traditional method is the person who I wonder if the Wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to come with that one. In conclusion, this movie is terrible and that is the end.
