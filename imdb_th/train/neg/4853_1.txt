I am a big fan of war movies and as a veteran Vietnam veteran has experience with technical details. I work with a group of bombs more than once and nothing but respecting them. Other veterinarians and especially the veterinarians of Iraq have summarized the inaccuracies in this film very well. The right to use poetry is one thing. But this movie is a complete fantasy and fails badly because of it There is no bomb disposal unit or any unit that will tolerate cheating practitioners for more than 5 minutes. The award-winning military unit has reconciliation and discipline for reasons to save lives. The opening scene made me particularly annoyed. Men with mobile phones will be fired immediately. Shouting "Stop calling" is not an effective deterrent. It's getting worse from there The scene with the sniper is so serious. As others notice, your average EOD person doesn't know that Jack is about being a sniper. The kidnapping of Arab businessmen for some kind of revenge will not happen. Some people may shoot him. But this risk is limited to movies. I can continue. But as I said, other people have pointed out these things thoroughly. This is not a good movie and if receiving any awards, it is an additional reflection of why "La La land" has a name.
