This film is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a Catholic school that looks at the RAWANDAN genocide without surrounding him. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a short description of past history and competition. Of Rawanda, then crossed over to the story told through the eyes of the young ideals "NEW-COMER", a young teacher who didn't take life or the situation too seriously. As he and the driver approached the obstacles he drove around with the ID driver, he didn't know that this was a serious time and if the driver could not identify himself as a legitimate tribe for the military. They will be killed And that is how he treats the story of chaos and unfolding around him Suddenly realized that everyone in Rwanda (Including his driver) is involved and European soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help The media camera could not stop the Machete knife and there were many firearms that had military weapons fired. The name comes from the army captain, saying that he will shoot a dog to eat dead bodies around his area. But will not shoot volunteer soldiers who killed people around the area The main reason is that they have not shot at the soldiers. He finally realized the hopelessness of the situation and the man who told the immigration team that he wanted to give his seat for one of the victims to accidentally escape his tail during his legs rather than face to face. Death of school children He promised not to leave behind. <br /> <br /> It's more of a character study and comes to Jesus' time for a character rather than a story about genocide in "RAWANDA". It doesn't have to happen in RAWANDA. It may happen in any Hell Genocidal hole that travels around the world at any time.
