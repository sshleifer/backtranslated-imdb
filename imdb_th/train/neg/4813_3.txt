I stopped trying to figure out what model I was watching. The copyright at the end stated that in 1983, and although this was not important in my objections in this film, I would say that watching movies created in the Aquarian era (including hippie chicks with long hair and wagons stations) The 1980 synth song is not stable. Strong insecurity. <br /> <br /> My main objection here is how brave the filmmakers BURY CUTE-AS-A-BUTTON PAMELA FRANKLIN ALIVE. How daring they are. > <br /> Seriously, she is Starts cute and everything. But in the two films I've seen her - this movie and the great myth of hell - they kill her out. <br /> <br /> I want to inform the film industry. Clearly, Pamela Franklin has left the business. But if she decides to make another movie and the director who tries to kill her, I will ask him to step outside. <br /> <br /> Nobody wins PAMELA FRANKLIN and goes out with it. I am a cross The anger is released. <br /> <br /> For the B movie fans looking for a crapfest, you can do much worse. On the positive side, this is not a movie that is related to Satan in the peripheral and prudent way - this movie is a movie that is not easily Satan. <br /> <br /> Satan-style wall-ritual rituals, baphomets, psychedelic rats - you Can ask for anything. <br /> <br /> This wonderful thing is almost destroyed by the soundtrack that was bewildered on the 1980s, which is not as consistent with the movie as possible. The soundtrack reminds me of something you will hear about The Equalizer. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> They also make Pamela Franklin squash her charming English accent, which is quite Rude, if not cruel cruelty, human rights. I said that we have the right to hear Pamela Franklin speaking in her own voice. Who is with me I can forgive everything about this movie if they don't use Pamela Franklin in the wrong way and I send the gloves down to you - anyone who has confessed to PAMELA FRANKLIN MESSES with me. <br /> <br /> Even in the context of FICTIONAL <br /> <br /> Good day to you
