Like watching a neighbor's summer home camp movie, "Indian Summer" is a boring time. There were eight camp alumni introduced when an incredibly boring past event started for the character that we didn't know anything at all. The top performers Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton have completely lost in this movie. One observer observed that "Everything seems smaller than I can remember." Repeat several times at least ten times enough to make you struggling. Predicted prank is not a joke or an original, unless you think that the short sheet is "Howler". Actually, this movie is very disappointing considering the ability that concerned "Summer of India" didn't make me miss home, but sick - MERK
