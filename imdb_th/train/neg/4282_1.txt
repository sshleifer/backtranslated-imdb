I cannot understand why all these relics from the Ceausescu era did not let go. Can clearly see how frustrating they were during the censorship that forbade many shows in their movies and now they imagine what they see as a matter of full artistic freedom With people Swearing and other ugliness. This is not a movie. Friends and neighbors! This is just a distortion of the image. Forget Bunuels Chien Andalou about David Lynch about Forman and Neorealism and other filmmakers who can work with the aesthetics of ugliness. Those people can control their work well. You can't! Please follow all our favors that you Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus and Margineanus and other old-fashioned and leave us alone! It's time to see some Romanian movies on the screen enough to torture your underage! You are not a director, you are illegal !!!
