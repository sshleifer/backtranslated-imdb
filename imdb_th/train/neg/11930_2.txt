Time is difficult for Angel Town gangs controlled with an iron fist and for most reasons do not know. (Mostly due to embarrassing writing) gangs want street children. Martine joins the gang so they beat him every day However, due to the appearance of the Olympic boxer (Olivier "the world's most famous actor" Gruner), the name Jacques, the hope is coming. Angel Town is one of the most inappropriate text movies I've ever done.

(In the cemetery in an awkward starting point) Angel Town has no doubt that failure at all levels Laughing with martial arts movies that have a level of crazy action that doesn't make sense at all levels. This is the perfect movie for you. On the other hand, do not forget tequila, such as the opening song details that are laughable. "No mercy in Angel Town" <br /> <br /> * From 4 (not good)
