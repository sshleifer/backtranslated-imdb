I enjoyed the criticism of the first reviewer more than I had done when I saw it in a theater that was performed in the early 80s. After that, I was impressed that I was taken care of in creating a costume. Simulated closely after the Tenniel painting, but for me, most actors were landslide, their personality suddenly obscured the mask, while the direction I thought was statically wrong. And the shooting was dark What is the score recorded at that time, which means "Not worth the ride even once." <br /> <br /> Still, I will jump to have a second chance.
