The mysterious thing about this film is that, according to the director, there is a problem finding a distributor in the United States because most people who can't see the conflict between Christianity and Americans. The idea of ​​everyone who sees this as a religious movie in that is a laugh Is a religion that is mocked in "Land of abundance", which has more content than can be done. The best mission to do is to send out soup, bowls and Bible verses. There may be many misfortunes or destruction. There are many useless homeless missions? How many Vietnamese veterinarians? As a survivor of the "pink" drug that is deceptive, we think America is "Land of abundance" of paranoid patriots? Maybe we have many mental patients? Of course, we do not have many people involved in the politics of Palestine based on phone conversations, the main characters in the movie. Of course, if you work in a homeless shelter in Germany, misfortune will be more concerned about peace in a land that is far more than their own personal survival because the world knows that Europe.

Life is too short and even Americans do not have enough time to see this work.
