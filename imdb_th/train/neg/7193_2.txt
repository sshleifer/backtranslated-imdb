I have nothing to do last weekend and tag it with my friends to watch movies ... any movie. And because the only film that we have never seen is Inspector Gadget, we decided to do that <br /> <br /> big mistake This is a movie that may only attract the attention of children. Oh, and it's not like I don't enjoy movies that target children. But this movie has nothing to pay attention to If you don't have anything to do at home, go to sleep. Better than losing the hard earned money this time. Go to the movies if you are a child or if you are a parent with children :)
