Salvage is the worst horror movie I've ever seen. There is nothing terrifying about this from a distance. It should not be in a good category. First of all, I don't see how many people think this movie is a great movie. If I write something boring and ridiculous as much as possible, I will laugh and be embarrassed to let others get stupid. Third: The story is worse, used before, and the excuse that the cheap movie of it has no excuse. Read the summer on the back of the case. It reveals the whole story. I do not advise you to watch this movie until you waste 80 minutes with some things that will make you regret that you watch it. I feel really bad for those crooks and the irony of their name, Anthony Perkins hail everyone !!!!!!!!!
