Oh, I heard this story very well about this movie. Go see with my close friend (She's a woman, I'm a man) Now please give me a different opinion from the mainstream. After the first few dozen "Take off your clothes." We both felt strange and boredom. We laughed (that it wasn't with it). We slept (and probably better to sleep in bed). The money goes away and we have a plot of inconsistencies and the characters are people who can't care. Lose celluloid waste This film does not deserve one of the ten points. But that is the lowest I'm not sure why this movie has a reputation for being excellent. I don't recommend anyone who has the same taste or intellect.
