This movie shows us that there is nothing original. Every idea or scene (action) can be found in many previously released movies. Fantastic novels are completely plain here. Although Patton is calm and bad, Mr. Duvall doesn't matter, but there is very little. How did Angelina do that? How can we judge her newly-regarded star? Overall, there are too many characters, so no one and no more details. Makes this film easy to forget So bad, don't you think?
