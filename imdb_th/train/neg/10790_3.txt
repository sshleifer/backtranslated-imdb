First of all, I'm not a big fan of contemporary Turkish movies, which is because the normal form of box office success is by pressing the button below the waistline. This film is not a masterpiece of art related to the prohibition, while the director and marketing advertisement implies. In my opinion, the only purpose of this movie is to make money by touching with morale. (In fact, it is considered a prohibition in the home country) Cheap populist may have a short definition. However, the show is close to perfection. Actually, most actors have the background of the drama and try hard to compensate for what Altioklar lacks; talent! Every member of the cast team is suitable for their role and has the qualifications suitable for the job, even those with less experience (such as Janset). At least Altioklar deserves a little admiration because he knows how to choose. show In addition, he is just a media monkey who assumes himself as a director with artistic talent. Come on, art is not something that only consists of dealing with naked women / half. And because the media did not have any director, became a major event in Turkish film history Just close your ears and something that is true art. I wait to applaud your next work. Hopefully this time you will be able to achieve an artistic approach. <br /> <br /> Briefly; Advantages> Good performances, popular women (joking!) :) Cons> Everything other than acting
