Poorer Robert Englund has caused other players to fail and have to pay Tobe Hooper, who often creates a good horror movie. But he was not bad in this regard Others too This story is confused with the flip flop from one century to another and I'm confused what happened and what the purpose of this film is. All I saw was a young woman who was attached to a strange lesbian who wished to keep her with herself and this Arab woman was fascinated with a lot of money and found him out to kill her. Another century claiming to be a descendent of De Sade and trying to kill her because she reminded him of Madame Momosel (misspelled) or anyone in the picture above the wall of De Sades. This movie is terrible. I was surprised that Hooper hired Jane Lund in this film and fake special effects and laughs, especially about the eyes. Englund tried to return from his single attack. "Nightmare on Elm St. "by using a needle to pull in and out to draw the human eye Terrible, really bad.
