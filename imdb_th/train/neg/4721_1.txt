Before watching this movie, please check the comments on the internet about the forgery of the movie, especially the story about the widely accepted truth that 7-8,000 Muslim men were expelled. From Srebrenica, a documentary belonging to many American Serbian organizations Please watch this movie and read the reviews first. Most comments confirm that the documentary uses his arguments too far, even though he questions questions targeting conventional wisdom about the war. Reviews in NYTimes by Stephen Holden say it will. "Invalid in the pro-Serbian documentary labeling", but we should ask questions, both presenting facts, mostly from reliable sources and ignoring those facts. Serbian forces I do not recommend viewing this document. But I remind you to check with a particularly important eye (As should be done all the time)
