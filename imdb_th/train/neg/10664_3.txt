Burt Reynolds, who looks very tired, plays as a mercenary fighting with his former employer. For some Gizmo who is not a hero, plans to sell it to "Iranians", a ridiculous video that is rented low by "Silk Stalkings" producers. Proper action and many inappropriate "drama" scenes ... The lack of logic and dialogue that is truly scary is a given aspect. Should be the end of the movie better Bert continues to appear, although it means that you will notice more when he mouths "baking torpedoes" insulting.
