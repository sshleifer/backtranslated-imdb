This movie wastes time and money. Throughout the half hour, I continue to wait for the better and never do. It's moving slowly. The plot is jumping around. It's not scary or interesting and never has anything to do with it. Credits during the introduction are long and drawn, which is basically the same as the rest of the movie. (Long and drawn out) Many parts of the plot are not reasonable. Many times in this movie, I think maybe I "split" out because of the disagreement of the story. But my friend had the same problem and made me confident that I didn't "separate" out of boredom. In fact, I never posted here about movies before and searched movies in IMDb for many years. The fact that I'm taking the time to write something should talk about the amount of the film that is bad and you should not waste time or money on it.
