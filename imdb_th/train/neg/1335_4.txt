This movie is great !! (Not as good as Leif Garrett Longshot's masterpiece) but still great !! I think Ashley looks very strange compared to Mary-Kate in this movie. I wonder why. Who would think that they can use that kind of place and almost escape with it? My father is quite angry and my mother is too small with Helmeth Head. I give it to 4 people who like this movie shoudl. Try to see Longshot.
