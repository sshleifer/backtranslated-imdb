This is one of the most interesting movies, lacking stubbornness and unimaginable! Almost felt like everyone involved in this project didn't try to create an attractive movie. This is not only the continuation of the boring film series that is trying to earn money from Smokey's success and The Bundit, which I think is the best of all of them. For the stock of this film, Bert Reynolds went sleepwalking in the movie, both Jim Nabro's wasted. Other actors did not do much. Stock humor, uninspired In that scene, it looks boring and lifeless, rather than staring at the wall for two hours. "Stroker Ace" is a simple movie, nothing special or unique about it.
