"Fever Pitch" is not a bad movie It's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Is it possible for American audiences and film critics to be bored and throw away the tombot with the sounds of the turbulent Hollywood that they would Praise the sky, even ordinary movies. That's the only reason I can think of why scary romantic comedy. (And I use this word loosely because there is no joke in this movie) received good criticism. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie. Ganz and Babaloo Mandel immediately thought that their script He is a joke. <br /> <br /> The wonderful Nick Hornby often translates to movies. He adapted "Fever Pitch" for the British film starring Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell in 1997; Peter Hedges found the voice of Hornby for "About a Boy" (2002) and when "High Fidelity" was Americanized for In the year 2000, writer DV DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg did nothing because they kept Hornby's ingenuity and humor. They created one of the best movies of that year. <br /> <br /> Why is the American version of "Fever Pitch" so painful? The English version is not a masterpiece. But it has a charming, funny, unexpected, and gives us two characters that we like to respect and understand. <br /> <br /> But Ganz and Mandel have done everything funny in Hornby's work to make their stories He is an American. They kill him by taking good and unique things about Hornby's work and replacing it with general drift. <br /> <br /> They turn funny stories into jokes. Romantic one When amenable from the miserable formula Lindsey (Drew Barrymore), there are three fans, each with a different duty. The excess body weight of the second person is disdainful and ambitious, and the third person is a romantic person. Want to guess Ben's male friend How many people (Jimmy Fallon)? <br /> <br /> This fun "High Fidelity" is not only a good male and female leader in "Fever Pitch", six fellow supporters. This makes or speaks something particularly funny. They are not important at all, they are not decorated. The only reason they are in this movie is because the formula wants it bad. Ione Skye ended up being one of Lindsay's friendships in an unappreciated role. Skye, that cute, would want Lloyd Dobler to hover. Come and take her. Imagine that Cusack will make Ben excellent. Of course, Shack is too clever to bind himself to the most boring chapter. <br /> <br /> There is no single moment of solitude. In the picture Foreign This appears to be an original, not mandatory. Every plot of the plot can predict every joke, telegram, labor, Ganz and Mandeland. Laughing in the first 45 minutes is very slow. You are wondering if these chaps knew that they were writing stories. Joke You can mark the turning point in this movie with your watch. It's almost as though Ganz and Mandel wrote this with a guru's screen writing formula that was placed on the wall. When they reached the front, they searched for the recipe and said "Okay, the philosopher said that this thing must happen now" and presto! <br /> <br /> Director Bobby and Peter Farrelly didn't help anything. They have no idea how to introduce their stories and characters. (They deliver the lecture V. Not for the protagonist. But with another man behind Ben at Fenway Park), we have to see Barrymore and Fallon stumbling upon meeting with the first non-stop meeting. <br /> <br /> Barrymore makes it more cute and cute than anyone. Most She did well like Goldie Hawk in his heyday. However, her cuteness was unable to record this horrible movie. She tried hard to squeeze the energy and humor out of this story. In this movie, about 30 minutes, Lindsay told Ben that "You're funny." The only explanation for her words is that it's in the script. For Bendon of Fallon, never say anything, even a farce from a farce. Fallon is not witty and funny. When he joked, he acted too much. <br /> <br /> Fallon was never good at "Saturday Night Live". He might be the least funny person in that show. Do you remember the weak figure about the radio DJ that made all sounds? The only reason for the "Weekend Update" to work occasionally is because Tina Fey of Fallon knows two or three jokes. <br /> <br /> Actors who think they are funny and behave like that are not really funny. That is the truth of Fallon. He thought he was a joke like crazy when he almost laughed. His stuttering wasn't sure about himself. The shtick didn't work on a small screen; It's disgusting on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Fallon, his role in this picture still takes a moment. If you think that his comedy isn't good, wait until you get many amazing things. Especially the two scenes - the first scene in the park, the second scene in front of Ben's school - painful to watch That scene requires actors with dramatic abilities. But Fallon has no knowledge or ability to make them work His emotions didn't use the boundaries from A to B. <br /> <br /> Ben had no personality or depth. Often he finds a madman. And not a cute person It affected what Lindsay was interested in him. Compare the work of Fallon with the Firth in the English version and you will understand how Bendon flattened, messy and forced, and how much he felt guilty about this role. Watching Fallon in "Fever Pitch" causes a huge length for the incredible depth and funny distinction of Ashton Kutcher! <br /> <br /> Like "High Fidelity", do too It needs a better writer, a director who is more capable and, of course, a leader that is stronger, fun and smarter. Doing things that are very pleasing: Avoid bad movies. Rent the 1997 version of England and read Hornby's book instead.
