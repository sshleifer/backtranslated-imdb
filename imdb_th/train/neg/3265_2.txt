I don't have any idea that director George Schlotter is hoping to sell this comedy. With Foxx in the important role and the printing and polyester sets for carpeting in the 1970s. "Norman" plays like a picture blaxploitation Combined with stupid sitcoms related to misunderstandings in cartoons From the plays of Sam Bob Rick and Ron Clark, the story of this separate married couple. (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) Learn the difficult ways that their sons are gay secretly - and living with love - humorous to humiliate the first episode of "Three's Company" Bailey maintains her dignity and the true confusion of Fox is good for a few laughs, but other actors feel ashamed * from ****
