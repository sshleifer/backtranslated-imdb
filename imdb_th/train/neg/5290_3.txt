I am not the only one to slate the movie. I try to see the good points and do not focus on the bad things. But in this case it is hardly a good point In my opinion, if you are doing something bad, why bother? Part of the film was filmed with Anne's face as she breathed deeply and the violin was played as a backdrop. Other parts were filled with bad performances and made with Rupert Penry Jones wood. Played the role of Anne's sister in a modern manner Anne plays a gentle and humble person who is the beginning. But she remains the same in this movie and you do not see the reason that Captain Wentworth fell in love with her. Overall, production lacks any feelings with too many errors to overlook, such as Running out of concerts, kissing on the street, running along the road without a hat (Why is this scene in the movie? The scene in the book is one of the most romantic scenes written). In conclusion, it's a very bad movie. Very disappointing.
