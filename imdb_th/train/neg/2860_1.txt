This movie is worth only 1 because you can't give zero value! If you have a weak belly that doesn't look Animal rights that you don't want to see as well It makes people vegetarian. I swear that I saw it happen! The coolest part is the case and the fact that it's true. It's really awesome that this guy works at ADT while he kills people! Still feel safe when you press the little code? I do not! He can access every code in Kansas !!!!!! I hate this film. It's not scary. It's a terrifying story! Do yourself a favor and don t rent / buy this movie. I think it costs about $ 20 to include their actors to pay !!!!
