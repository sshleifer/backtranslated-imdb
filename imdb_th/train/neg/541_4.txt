I found this movie quite strange. From the beginning, I found it very difficult to like this movie, and now, after thinking a bit, I can justify the reason why Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him in pieces (I think Zentropa is One of the best movies ever made) is quite straightforward and even though I can't think of my life better than anyone. May replace him easily and make this film work Everything is good, except for a funny joke (A Meet The Parents Joke isn't really a filmmaker!) And I like Richard E. Grant as a Major Major. It suffers from one thing .. Jean-Marc
