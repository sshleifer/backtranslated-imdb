I like bad movies I like to rent bad movies with my friends and tear them for a period of time. Then there are nasty movies like this. The Redline not only is a bad movie. But it is a sign that the American film industry is likely to be satisfied with at least a proofing script before funding movies. <br /> <br /> If this movie is a movie Shit, this movie will spawn from The story is unbearable and the show itself is ridiculous. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin may be the worst screen chemistry I've ever seen in a good time, and even one by one they should be separated from humans and Defeated by an orange bag until they changed their career as a merchant In addition, the way Angus Macfadyen believes in making this movie is far beyond me until I can't think of comparison. I am a big fan of him But this made me ask him. <br /> <br /> To summarize, many people want revenge for different reasons. (And if you are interested enough to know what they are, you are a bigger person than me) so much that they become violent (I guess). At the end of confusion and dialogue that is not suitable for human ears This movie is a big car that is commercially available in the first half of the year and is an action movie that is garbled for the rest. Avoid all costs. <br /> <br /> Hopefully I will meet one aspect. The movie and I think it is in the fact that the credit finally rolls. <br /> <br /> PS Nadia Bjorlin If you like that, you sing two songs in this movie. The old age will destroy you. <br /> <br /> PSS If you rent this movie to find a laughing experience, listen to the lyrics of the great songs of Nadia Bjorlin.
