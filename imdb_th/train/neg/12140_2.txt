Imitation of a long name, the movie will find a way to approach the 90 'mark. The beautiful scene is here, with everything that makes Hamer's production worth the trademark. But Paris, drowned in the mist, is a sign of discontent. The story is clear and can be summed up in one word, so there is nothing unexpected and nothing worth more than 5% of the interest you expect. <br /> <br /> The director is as hard as Direct transfer from Most stage actors are as solid as wax. (Okay, this is the properties of Hamer. But sometimes it has better advantages in all packages.) My conclusion: This movie is a trash, not worth the time I spent that evening. Eternal life is boring and I should hope that those responsible for programming at Cinemath√®que should know each other better.
