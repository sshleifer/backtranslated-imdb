No good plot, lack of proper performances, lack of good CINEMATOGRAPHY, lack of good looks, special results, ... Do I have to continue? MAY review, with spoilers, actors seem to read their scripts and are not very good. Most "actors" act like in the drama "SECOND GRADE", a story that appears to be written by two elementary students mentioned above. ... It's not a complicated matter ... It's a simple matter and it's easy for people to think that they have to think about something, so they think it's complicated. No, it is as simple as you think. I understand "movies". That's how I know it's amazing! At the end of this film, there were people sitting talking. (Read their line) Try to look scary. Annoying narrator "Special effects" have been laughed. I love cheap movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry and Michael Berrymore ... not just in this movie ... you can tell that they don't get paid or don't get much money because Their minds do not have The talent is there. I love Tony Todd ... but he is enough in this movie. In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony was there for two minutes. (Seriously)! I highly recommend sending the DVD to the Tony Todd segment for two minutes quickly. If I go to the theater and pay more than a dollar to see "this movie", I will be a PTT and ask for a refund. Hopefully those who do this will do better next time.
