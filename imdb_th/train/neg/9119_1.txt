I saw this movie in a traditional cinema. It was painful to see Peter Zeller selling himself badly. The story is incredibly weak and difficult to follow and the ending is ridiculous. It is sad when seeing how the great man fell. I will not say I am a big fan of Peter Sellers, but I thoroughly enjoyed the Pink Panther series and I feel that he has shown a strong presence. But this movie should not be done From what I read, he followed the production of this film without getting advice from the people around. It's okay, but it's not an excuse that the studio actually released the film
