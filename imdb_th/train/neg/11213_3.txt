OK ... I watch many bad movies. I am proud of that truth. Many times, there are some gems in B bombing, but this movie is one of the worst things I've ever seen. I like good horror movies ... but one story has a plot and movement. The opening scene looks quite good. Valuable music and images Then it went down from there. One of the main characters has disabilities. (Ringing in the ears is called tinnitus). Now this thing threatens to reveal his secret. They create the focus of the movie too. So what he resounded in his ear and accidentally plugged his ear where he should not be No need to bring it up. So this guy has a relationship with this woman and in the motel she falls and hits her head on the end table. So instead of letting everyone know that he has the intention to leave the body Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her. After seeing her sister over and over again (Like a ghost-like zombie) and even pointing at the body's position, she finally finds her. Now the body has disappeared, so she set out to deal with the only suspect who killed her. The bad thing is that she doesn't have a lot of plans. Just pretending to be her partner and meet the man whose body was left. An idiot does not believe that he killed her. So everything will be revealed there, and even if you have a gun ... However, you can strangle yourself. Therefore, the final scene of this film is her "spirit" and her partner is walking out of the water. So you have to tell me in this movie that the bad guys win. And not just the two innocent people who died Performances from some actors are not all.
