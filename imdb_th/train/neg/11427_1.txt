I don't know who is director Sue Kramer. But I doubt very much that A) she is a lesbian and B) she is embarrassed by anyone who has participated in this project to prove that they are not homophobic People are thinking "God, this is terrible, not funny. Pedestrians are lame." But closing their mouths in fear, they are identified as anti-gay or they "don't understand" the way of life of gay (This may be the reason why Kramer did not cast gay men to play as gay). However, it is not worthwhile to review. All actors were directed to play every scene completely, so there was no sincerity or belief in what they did. It's full of old ideas and nothing about this movie that is a little fun - less funny. <br /> <br /> I hate it and I'm not afraid to say that. Unfortunately, the merciless people who gave money to Kramer to create this bomb were not neutral in their judgment.
