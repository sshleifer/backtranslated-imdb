Luise Rainer received the Oscar award from her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role was not wanted. She didn't say much and faded all the time. Louis's character was a slave, then went to marry Paul Minami's character. (He did a great job for his performance) In ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian. But believe in their role. I hope Paul Muni will receive Oscar for his performance because that's what Luise has to get from her Oscar. What Hollywood does often Al Pacino played in Italy and Cuba. I felt that Luise's performances were lacking all the time, and when she died, she didn't change the expression from any previous scene. She remained the same throughout the story. She changed her face or mood just twice. If her great performance was so fragile, I thought I didn't see it.
