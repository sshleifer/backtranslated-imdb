Recreation of the 1950s (London) Soho and people who are hot Based on the novel, <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is the video director. No more, no less. Give him 15 million dollars and he will make a 15 million dollar pop video for you. Here, he forgot that two minutes with someone who could not really show is the only thing. But two hours? What is he thinking In addition, who is the audience? Who is interested in a book that is thought of when? The story of a driver in London who gets an opportunity. <br /> <br /> What makes this film drag down? Oh, I know. The third song that sounds like they have been created. David Bowie has repeatedly screened this movie and that is the highlight The soundtrack album is a material of clay pigeons. <br /> <br /> There is one good thing. Good recreation of the Soho period. It's a shame that they can't think of anything to put forward.
