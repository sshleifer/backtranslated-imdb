The fact that I watch this movie all say something about it ... or I'm not a good movie. In fact very bad But scary in a way that makes me interested in an unusual way that is similar to watching a tragedy and can't look out It will make a great MST3K course. <br /> <br /> Most of the things that make the movie fun are scary here: bad conversations, inappropriate music, wrong planning sequence, devious plan. Subject You will be thrilled to have executed the poor wicked person with your mouth, mouth open, and waaaaaaaay. There is too much time to ponder their imminent punishment by facing those who saved from death. Your heart will be warm with old-fashioned action scenes when two women fight for a gun and it goes off, but who will shoot? Both of them looked at themselves, then another person, then themselves. (See 15 minutes later) One of the people finally went down. You will sing along (In Latin, of course) with the street carolers who became the awesome death choirs that at one time threatened to turn the movie into a distorted song. <br /> <br /> So if you Believe that I do that when the movie gets worse, they are better. This may be a good choice for you. It's not as funny as sci-fi enthusiasts like today. "They Live" with Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's more fun to watch than movies that look like Omen II or III. <br /> <br / > I gave it 4 out of 10
