Sunshine is a product imported from Europe in Hungary between 1880 and 1980. It is a great story of the Hungarian Jewish family Sonnenschein. This name literally translates to sunshine. The family had a humble beginning, then flourished to become a mobile upward, changed the name and hoped to absorb into the Hungarian society so that future generations could develop their careers. This story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each generation. Ralph Fiennes has three roles. For those who missed WW-II and the catastrophe in Europe, the way of life Sonnenschein didn't work very well. <br /> <br /> Sunshine is regarded as an artistic achievement. But it is a chance to miss the story line that is dominated by world history is predictable and transparent. This is supplemented by audio cover and movie news. Family planning is based on one predictable event, Hapsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, Fascism, Communism, etc.] to the next, with continuity, depth or little detail. The Jewish swallowing theme does not focus on and the main sub-topics ('The Secret' Diary and Family Philosophy] that may make the characters in the family and credibility be like that until the end. Alternatively, the filmmakers create a continuation of the creation using a common theme of incest / cheating. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes shows the glow of light. The casting style "3 to 1" is a distraction for the audience and feels like a cheaper cinema than a good theater. Sunshine is a material "History Channel" of Hungary. It has the look and feel of the Winds of War that was modified with Forrest Gump that was adapted to Something About Sex. <br /> <br />
