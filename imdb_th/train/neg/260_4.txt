I can and will be very short. This is an unbalanced and unbelievable movie that will be a little better. It seems that the script doesn't know where to go ... from jokes to serious vices ... it's quite stupid. Plus too many sentences that we've heard before "Does the hacker stay in Florida? He's in Madrid. He's not in ... He's sending a signal." <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
