As a "deceased Catholic" with a Catholic school for 11 years but never went to school for 35 years, except for weddings and funerals. the movie It's all the standard - the teachings of strict school, repressed sex districts, etc. But then suddenly the movie really changed, meaning now, your heart, I saw this before the pedophile scandal... And maybe I wouldn't. Feeling angry at this nasty and ugly church if I knew about these nasty things. (Like Catholic vocabulary!) And coverups <br /> <br /> It's been a few years since I rented a video and I won't go back to rent again with a new perspective. It's just a dirty, disgusting and ugly taste in my mouth .. I wonder how all actors have experience with the Church because they hate it or they play adultery with payroll. It is an incredibly anti-Catholic film that is offensive for everyone who has respect for Catholic education. Which I still do because there is no better teacher in the 50s, no matter what those nuns do. They force me to learn how to read and write English. They made us remember (Today, how many children can do simple arithmetic in their heads?) The truth is that there is nothing more important than success in America. Can you read it? Can you add / subtract / multiply / divide? Great. You can get the advanced degree you need. And the discipline of Catholic education will help you to stand well not only But while you continue to study But still for the rest of your life, whether you think about the "myths" of Catholics, we all have to learn anything.> <br /> Great actors like nasty and bad scripts. I feel really bad (and not not "bad" - believe me, the nun teaches me better) for writers and directors. <br /> <br /> I think I have mixed emotions about Catholic schools. But the participants in this project must be a bad boy (ie.e, stupid) sitting in the back of the room if they are willing to do this movie
