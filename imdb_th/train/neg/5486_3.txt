First of all, this movie starts with a lot of stupidity: a 10-year-old girl plays a car. The vehicle decides to be a joke that will cover the eyes of her mother with her hand and cause a terrible accident. Uh .... I'm sorry. There are no plus 10 years that stupid. The rest of the movie doesn't get much better. After the death of the mother with the most foolishness in the world, 10 years old, his father moved his family to Genova, Italy, where he would teach at a local university. But here is hard to understand: He doesn't speak Italian words! Then the little girl had a "picture" of the mother (which she killed) and often later phobia which often ended by the father holding and compressing her. Then we were forced to watch this family wandering and found and hugged and cried and lost and found (Followed by hugging and crying more) to the point that I needed some kind of natural disaster Just wiping these nonsensical things and not knowing people from the world. Don't understand me wrong because I love indie. But indie about stupid people (And I mean really stupid) is ridiculous and ridiculous It is really embarrassing that this movie is based on such an interesting character in a delayed situation because the place is interesting.
