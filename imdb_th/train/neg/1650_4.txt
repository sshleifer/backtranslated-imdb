Four young best friends, young men, chauvinist pigs (with a focus on pigs) meet every week at NYC restaurants to tell their dating sexploits in comedy, horror stories and visceral peet as a participant. The appointment of three undergraduates in the group led to the conflict and the "flogging" that was inevitable. Although the evidence of the film has potential and funny moments But the overall flick was not effective, especially at the end, where the girls were made to look no better than men working opposite the story. One of the bands, a young man who has a dozen "Whipped" producers, seems to be a favorite, especially for young men who think "The Man Show" is Emmy's content.
