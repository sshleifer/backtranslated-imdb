We have an average family. The father of the famous rapper, we have "Rebellious teenage daughter" Adopted white child and cute little boy And we have a housekeeper who carelessly shows what has neighbors like that? Do we have a busy Brady Bunch? Yeah! When it came out for the first time, I thought it was really cool, mostly because I was a kid. The music wasn't good. Rap ​​was terrible and g too ranked. Father is the type of "Danny from Full House". The type of father always gives advice. But he is not a fanatic They have people to take care of the house for that matter. Remember? In general, Lil 'Romeo's plan is having some problems or ... not like that. Oh and maybe there are thirteen plays. Yes, that is not a good thing, but it is a good performance for children, but Nikelodean can do better.
