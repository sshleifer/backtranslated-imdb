This movie is terrible in the worst way: you just don't care. You don't care what happens in the plot; You don't care about the characters. Everyone without heart I ended up walking out for about 45 minutes because I didn't want my heart to do anything anymore. This movie has too much sex. Fuck is ok It can also make movies (for this reason, Karma Sutra), but sex here is not beautiful or sexy. It's ugly Didn't see this movie
