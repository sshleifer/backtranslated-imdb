Not long ago, "lipstick" that just looked again for the first time in a few decades, I also supported "Descent" even though I had heard more negative comments from friends. Other films with different tastes like I <br /> <br /> It's interesting to contrast that the niche of the Rape Revenge movie has evolved over the last 32 years from the full blood of "I Spit On Your Grave" to the clutter. Wa The "lipstick" to tackle the problem in a tastefully. "The accused", but "descent", even if doing important issues, never truly offering us something new in terms of the meaning that is revealed. Not "descent" is created badly in terms of picture and sound quality. That it deviates from important messages that hope to make --- the message that when examining closely is not a strange matter. <br /> <br >> I know what the plot is going on. Where i am A * is "descent" or the deterioration of Dawson's character. As a big fan of Rosario, I was worried to see the layers that had been removed and her mind slowly being twisted ... Did you know that DeNiro's drawing led to "Taxi Driver" Unfortunately, the script options and the director / writer's options don't have a reliable change. <br /> <br /> The biggest point of failure is the second action. Obviously, the filmmakers' intent for the group of jumping, drug use and obsession with the big black horse Adrian (the nightmare of every white boy) from questions and answers on the DVD. But getting into Dawson's impressions, we don't know exactly what Hell is doing, half the time, what she's doing, or why she's doing that. The sound / video quality isn't good again. But the order is too long and pointless It destroys the momentum and investment of any of the main characters in the period of special action. By the time we reach the end, our interest has waned. <br /> <br /> One point of success that Dawson points out in the question and the answer is at the end of the scene. "Vengeance" that we were pumped for revenge Then realize that pulling out and the reality is just how ugly. Even if it is practical <br /> <br /> If you have a DVD, take a look at the deleted "classroom" scene. This is an excellent 8 minutes plus the energy-filled crackle. And provocation (All verbally) and actually showing Dawson's slow break while admiring Francie Swift's pity if adding this commentary and cutting down The third part, more, we may have interesting psychological studies about the effects of violent actions without consciousness. However, what we get is what we've seen before in rendering more graphics. What then?
