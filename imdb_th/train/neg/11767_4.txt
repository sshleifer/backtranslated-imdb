I have quite high hopes for this because I like Tim Roth. I am not satisfied with this movie. I like Ang Lee The Hulk a few years ago. First of all, I was very disappointed with John Hurt's performance here. He looked as if his eyebrows were newly created for this. His performances are unbelievable. He is not as good as he should. Tim Roth is as cool as ever. What Gama does not adhere to the original story that I do not think. I guess the best part of this movie is the end. It has a cool look. The same problem with the original is that it is too long. This is not long, but it's a bit boring. I remember recently when Walmart had this movie selling really cheap. Now I know. I hope to be blown away. But i can't
