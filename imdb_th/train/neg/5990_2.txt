I haven't seen all of this yet. Now it's running on the cable and it looks like I'm coming in the middle of it. The main reason for my interest is that I am a Bill Paxton fan; He is a very good actor and has consistently worked well throughout his career. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that while never being a true fan of the old series, I like Thunderbird. Derek Meddings may be the best in the business during the sixties and seventies, and his designs for international rescue vehicles are wonderful. The current team is doing a great job of translating his work to the big screen. <br /> <br /> But ... <br /> <br /> This is a lame story. Children are asked to drive. Cars and while they work well, it is difficult to suppress your unbelief, especially when you have an 8 year old son of a brain that flew T2, which is a heavy vehicle with tons of Buick aerodynamics everywhere. As you look, you will see the Ford logo. Positioning the product through the top and annoying Ben Kingsley works well as a hood. But he can only do one role If you can accept this film with the advantages of the slim, Thunderbird is a fun and fun player. Don't look closely at the machine that drives it. <br /> <br /> Appendix: Finally, I have to see all this and it's worse than I thought. The performance is not quite as good, and while the effect is quite good, the story of watching it many times causes hard acne. Excessive product positioning for Ford is annoying, and children who are the main characters are still worried as the Avengers. If you are not interested in the original content, it can be received but not much. Show original and you will see what I mean. <br /> <br /> and advice for Jon Frakes. Take a course review at Director's Guild. You can do better. Old friends <br /> <br /> Another footnote. ... <br /> <br /> I Last night. On Telemundo dubbed the Spanish language with funny sound effects and yes I came in the middle with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their fight scenes on Tracy Island. < br /> <br /> I don't think it is possible for a weak movie to be worse, but it is a shameful thing. <br /> <br /> If this is done straight away There is no help for children. There is no tongue-in-mouth joke. It may be used. As it was only the happiness of the beloved one that was destroyed
