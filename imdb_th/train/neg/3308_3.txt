When you get a British movie, you expect some quality. And when talking about acting, camera work, lighting and others, this movie does business It is made by highly skilled craftsmen. Only that can make you happy one and a half hours But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you won't find anything. In addition to making you feel good and supporting the liberal viewpoint, nothing is there. The script has a medium length, predictable plot, and the ending must be one of Hollywood's worst east sides. In all English, it's a shameful and disdainful attempt to create "Full Monty" again. I have no clue other than making money, of course.
