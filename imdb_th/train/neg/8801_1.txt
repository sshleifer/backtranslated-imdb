Pieced (modified) together from the part of the dead body (Deleted scenes) from the corpse (Anchorman), Frankenstein's monster (waking up, Burgundy Ron) is not a nasty thing for the eyes .. may be only one time for the story <br /> <br /> More often than not, the relationship of the scenes in WURB is related by the third speaker. The worrisome thing is that the characters in WURB are not consistent with their own version that we have at the end of Anchorman (in the opening lecture, we say that WURB will come after the original) at the end of Anchorman, Burgundy. grows up Since the beginning of this film and embracing that hybrid has joined the anchor / lover in this movie, he returns to the underage comedy show by prank the phone to Veronica. (It is quite clear that these scenes are the same scene than the original Anchorman connected to WURB) <br /> <br /> The part that makes this thing The movie, a story that is constantly evolving, involves a group of bank robberies without a cause called an alarm clock. These scenes are almost painful to watch. This part was removed from the original script for Anchorman. <br /> <br /> Most of the other scenes related to our Channel 4 news team are clearly chosen / deleted in the scenes from Anchorman. They go to the same party. With those in the same group "The same group that has a girlfriend about the scene" and the same cat fashion show group Veronica opposes reporting. <br /> <br /> Burgundy rebuild their first day by driving in The spot overlooking San Diego and dinner at his favorite club Tinos. Both characters did not mention that they had been to the driving point before and when Burgundy entered the Tinos and Veronica, he advised her to listen as if they had never been before. Oh and they wear the same clothes as the original date. <br /> <br /> Still, I have to give credit to the filmmakers - even though WURB doesn't have much more than delivering cleverly deleted scenes. Tied together with the description Between the two stories of Ron Burgundy - this is a weaker story. Looking back, it was quite good for Anchorman to be raised from WURB's Ashes. You still have an IMDb level. Thank you for stopping by.
