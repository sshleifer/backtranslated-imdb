Some men were languished. As soon as he saw this man shot him He has some bodyguards and they hit the killer. But the reporter was interested She went to the hospital where they took the guy She walked in and made a corner of the guard. But he didn't want to talk I can't find the cause. It's not like anyone interested. She is the only reporter there. However, her editor made her not want to work on this lame story. But wait, she's doing anyway She goes to see the sister's sister & mother. A few minutes after she leaves, they get a big hit - someone blows their trailer - a big fire ball. Then she searched for a bodyguard from the hospital. She found him hangover on his boat. But a few minutes later, both of them were sucking under Scuba's tank because there were three men trying to hit them. The journalists and bodyguards hit two men trying to hit them. <br /> <br /> In the next few hours, a man was languishing across the road, shooting with many people in the warehouse, driving along. Ruins and suicide, suicide, etc. etc. hard, killing all kinds. <br /> <br /> wonderful things But what the journalists and bodyguards can't think of is: Why is it in hell? The first guy was beaten. What is motivation? Of course, it may help us to understand why journalists are interested. All the time, she is the only reporter in this story. No one is interested in the media anymore. Not even with large fireballs and corpses Actually, the guy that has been beaten is not a celebrity. His work is a little boring. He is just the president. Yes, people living in the White House Oh and the bodyguard is the secret agent. <br /> <br /> Is that a spoiler? <br /> <br /> It should be. After that, there is no television camera. No other journalists. . Another person who is watching the police crime ... <br /> <br /> What is a spoiler? <br /> <br /> Lemme thinks ... <br /> <br /> No ! Wait! The spoiler is where his wife does it! Yes ... First Lady She is a good person because the president is fooled. And she went with it Are you really good? But who can think of it? Why are people disturbing? In the end, there was only one journalist who was interested. <br /> <br /> I gave this post as "1". It was so stupid that I had to continue to watch. And it's just stupid! That is the real spoiler! But even if I tell you, you have to see it to believe it!
