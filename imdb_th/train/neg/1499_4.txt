Tourists travel to Ireland to study at the school to learn about Druids. What they found was a terrifying story of a carnivorous killer. <br /> <br /> If I had to summarize Evil Breed, it would be a low-level festival. The movie Dead Alive, Evil Dead, Wrong Turn all in one. Too bad that the film has many inconsistencies to track that it will lose "fun" that anyone must watch. This movie has a lot of random "horror" pornography ... even though the movie This will be a movie star. Pop star But there are still four others, so there may be many more This dog still has a lot of blood. <br /> <br /> Evil Breed has a terrible beginning with a laughing conversation and a terrifying performance. That is a straightforward video horror movie. But this requires a cake I can't determine who is the main character because a woman who "has life" at the end is not in that movie. Speaking of the ending, it must be one of randomness and forgery that ends in the history of the movie. It has no purpose for the rest of the movie and completely changes the perspective of the film. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie to believe it. There are two scenes of death that came into my mind. One scene inbred killer ripped the intestines from a naked woman through her chest .... Yes. Her breasts do not ask me another ID when the man gets. His gut But again tearing through his asshole That kills men? No, the killer still strangled the man with his own intestine. These scenes remind me of the many Dead-Alive stories in each story. I also recognize Evil Dead by mentioning horror movies and Sam Raimi along with Halloween. When the female characters are in the closet, crying for her life, the killer tries to come in. < br /> <br /> Although the sound and nudity are not enough for bad sound and picture Movie quality When the teacher woke up from her bed and walked down the stairs, her footsteps were loud and heavy, so she seemed to wear boots. Absolutely distracting Like the continuation of this film, is there one inbred killer? As well as the characters that are now dead I can't tell if Chicks breast augmentation is Jenny or Gary's sister / cousin ... I can't remember the same as a random naked chick with a dead baby hanging out of her body still stuck with The umbilical cord <br /> <br /> The horrible correction is also distracting. The opening credits are too fast and confusing. It's a bad start and better. But the ending brings the movie back to a horrible level. If perhaps there are better production values ​​and more faith in this film, it will not be killed horribly. Stay away from this film unless you are happy with the bad movies with low budget.
