Just watched American Pie: Beta House finished. Having said that, this is a disgusting garbage dump. The first 3 American Pies are the last 3 hilarious jokes. It's funny and shouldn't be called American Pie. When you think of the title of the film, Beta House is about brothers. All female students and their original parts fall in love. Of course, the guy with the bird is Stifler, who tries to make the impossible work clear. It's really unrealistic and fake. It's really predictable and the plot is very weak. Both sides of the fight in college to see who gets the whole thing (like that) to summarize: an awesome show + a boring script + using the American pie franchise wrongly. This film is unbearable. have I give two-tenth But in most cases, it has a nudity and beautiful women like 2 funny scenes :)
