In the opening scene of "Malta Story" Mr A.Guinness was bored with the similarities with Noel Coward that I fully expected that his first words were "Some women want to stand out regularly - like gongs" or a world that is weary. His dialogue is almost a prose without death, and even the teacher has a problem to bring it to life. Of course, Guinness walks through the picture as if looking for a focal point and can't find it and the softness. The app of the movie, Mr. J. Hawkins surrendered early and ended up performing. "Jack Hawkins" without being independent of it, probably from dozens of British war movies, many of them in their early schtick for very little purpose The army failed to bomb the Maltese in the same way that it failed to bring the knees to London. The courage of the Maltese in the face of the unstoppable danger accepted by the king and the island won the screen Cross You may think that it is valuable for movies, but "Malta Story" does not qualify for the word "precious". In most patronage it makes the image of being paved with stones hastily together to meet. Schedule To live
