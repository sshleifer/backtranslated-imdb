Firstly, I have to admit that it's not a good movie. And I will never see this movie if Pacino is not there No time i After 20 minutes, you might fall asleep and I don't understand why Pacino wants to be part of this horrible movie just because of money or anything. <br /> <br /> Since I am an avid Pacino fan, I bought this movie that people I know in 2002. If you haven't bought it yet, don't think about it. It's a waste of time.
