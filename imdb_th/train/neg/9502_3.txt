This strange, completely inexplicable film, and crazy about watching with friends while drinking in an empty big house. I like the things that really opened with Lisa who lost his way in the beautiful city. I want to be a beautiful stranger who disappeared in an exotic place in Europe, though probably not in a horror flick with a limited budget. Get the exact end that there is a strange sex scene that isn't strange Cut off (In my DVD set) Don't try to understand, just follow along and watch out for strange bits ... which is everything. Don't look at this if you want a plot or style or anything that makes sense. Very beautiful, even if you give up on this and decide to watch real horror movies like Dead Alive.
