I just got to catch up with Marilyn Miller's movie because they didn't perform in TCM in the UK. I was amazed over the years because this is one of the 20s superstars. What do you really like? For some stars in this era, like some magic Jolson still shining. But not for Miller, her dance looks awkward and poorly choreographed. She sings quite limited and as an actress she makes Ruby Keeler look like Hepburn. This movie, while people are getting bored with musicals Almost did not remove all numbers, so we left But the comedy of that era, along with a little real appeal, he received $ 500,000 for this. So I have only two conclusions. No matter if she is being played by a movie theater or she has no ability, I think the truth is closer than in the past.
