While watching this movie, I'm sick. I grew up with Pippi and every time was truly happy. When my wife came to Sweden, she looked at the Oldies and laughed really well, but this American version should be renamed and will not be shown again. It's terrible from beginning to end. How can they manage it badly? I guess someone has a penalty for translation. Hahaha, but they have never been close to Pippi. Probably this movie has never been seen again and has never been broadcasted. Burn the movie and help the kids if you want to watch Pippi. Then watch the original movie and laugh. Well, we love PIPPI INGER. NILSSON apologize to Tami Erin. You will never get a Pippi .. Oh yes .. when reading the description "Spoiler "" Surprise "and surprise the audience." Well, I guess the director means this ... You are watching this movie at your own risk .. It's really time consuming ...
