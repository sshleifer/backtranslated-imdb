This show is not boring, lame, and generally tearing all things to make it "original". First of all: the animation is so ugly ... Johnny is ugly ... and everyone annoying The twins looked like Dexters, a teenage girl from "Dexter's Lab" and Johnny almost like Dee Dee, a smarter man (for example, from "Dexter's Lab.") The gags are repeated and nothing makes me feel forced to laugh a little ... especially when it tries to be funny. I only saw two episodes. But those people closed me. <br /> <br /> Close the third: All theme songs start with copying Green Day's "American Idiot" and while I'm not a big fan of the band. I found that it was really boring that they would use the same melody, then change it thoroughly to make it their own. <br /> <br /> In the case of the point ... it is a fat Hate big 1/10
