I have to watch this movie for my work so I don't pay. (On the other hand, I get paid) but I still find that this movie is more than average. The jokes are crippled, two leading actors ... good to use "First Wives Club" in the age of women in Hollywood. They are no longer in their "hot chick" age. The thing that makes me the most angry about this movie is the main plot that mimics the story "Beavis & Butthead Do America". (All the boys were stunned by some friends who offered money to them. Expected to kill her). Overall, it's a ridiculous piece.
