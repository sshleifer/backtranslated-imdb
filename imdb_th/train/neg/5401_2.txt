Should have a much better strength by making it to the limit outside. <br /> <br /> 50 minutes too much extravagant content and things like the head of a bad guy who seems to have escaped From The Phantom of the Opera doesn't help anything. The 'Night of the Living Dead' sequence is all very stupid and unnecessary. Finally, if the deceased has to punish anyone who has sinned, now remind me that everyone killed everyone again.
