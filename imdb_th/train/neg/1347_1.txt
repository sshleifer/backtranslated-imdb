Inspector Gadget is probably my favorite 80's cartoon of all time. I enjoy both the first season and the second season of the series, as well as "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas". In 1992, some Gadget fans quickly criticized the second season (1985) of the show, but they needed to compare with The launch of "Inspector Gadget Final Case: Claw's Revenge" in 2002, they will find that the second season is definitely gold. <br /> <br /> Being a gadget fan I can't resist the opportunity to see animated gadgets. Of Inspector in something The boy is not related I bought this movie and I swear to myself that I will be the target; I know that sometimes artistic freedom may be taken from the original series. I didn't prepare myself for what I was about to see. <br /> <br /> Hardly anything left for the original program. <br /> <br /> Here is a short list of some. A list of disadvantages for this movie: * Humor does not exist in the original series. <br /> <br /> * Penny and Bren (originally almost as much as the series as a gadget) disappeared from the action. For fifteen The duration is about twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> * The original song by Saban & Levy is not there and the score is a sub-section. (Understand that Saban has its own production company at the moment, but at least "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" has good music, even without a blog) * Don't expect to see gadget gadgets that make the show. Beloved, such as gadgets - helicopters, gadget-brella, gadget-mallet, gadget-coat (which is actually used, but does not call the same thing) as with his hats and other hand accessories. In this movie, his legs are Telescopic arms instead of springs Those things make fans crazy about the real show and don't need to change <br /> <br /> * Mobile gadgets from the original series now quickly change to "hip". The original series is like mobile gadgets, turning it into a van gadget and vice versa. <br /> <br /> * The chief Quimby is now very short-tempered and refers to gadgets. He is often dissatisfied with the original series. But it makes the situation look a bit worse. <br /> <br /> * Penny doesn't have a computer book anymore. <br /> <br /> What's in this movie? Ok, here ... <br /> <br /> * Maurice LaMarche works well to capture the great Don Adams as Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> * In the same scene, Chief Quimby alludes to The real villain from the cartoon series: The Great Wambini ("The Gadget", a classic from the second season voiced by Louis Nye) <br /> <br /> Looking for factors More ransom for this film or not, unfortunately, life is a matter of choice and life by those choices. Most situations in life have a purpose, even if it is a lesson. Lessons learned here: Follow traditional recipes! "If it's not broken, don't fix it at all." The true gadget fans should be avoided from this movie. You will definitely be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hope DiC and yell! Factory will continue to launch the original series after the launch of "Inspector Gadget: 2006 Original Series Volume 1", which contains episode 22, the first episode of the series. As a true fan of the 80s and many DiC animation programs, I recommend you buy "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas". Sure to bring back good memory.
