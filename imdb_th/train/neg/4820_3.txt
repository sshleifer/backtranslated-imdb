During my teens I was quite a bigfoot story - I read books and according to reports of sightings As a more boring adult, I quit the big man now. But don't mind to watch strange movies when I meet This has a few strengths - most of the more famous two-foot rest - Ape Canyon event in 1924 and the Bauman event of c.1850, which is related to and by Teddy Roosevelt. Bert, which I both I am quite familiar with the youthful reading that I do. The film acknowledged that both events were related to squash, while both events had a more reliable explanation. But recreation is very good In addition, there is a reverence at the beginning of Patterson's famous movie again to be accurate. The saxophone encounter at the end of the movie was very well done and gave a very creepy feeling when the squash was conveyed mostly in shadows or hairy feet. Unfortunately, the four things may consist of about 20 minutes while the overall movie takes more than half an hour. <br /> <br /> It's a fictional story. (Made in a documentary format) of the movie, traveling to remote areas in northern British Columbia to squash the suspicious home area The computer has targeted this area according to sightings and in another comical scene in computer movies, it is used. "Seeing sightings" to draw a sasquatch that looks like "animals" of Patterson's video! In addition to the 20 minutes I talked about, we generally see this tour, which means that we have watched a group of people go on a long camping trip. I went to camp with them. Let me tell you - they never had the value of the movie. (Although there is a suspect that the use of canned animal images or may be captive animals that act like wild animals) and have beautiful scenery, except for scenes that are not in the north of England Columbia comes from the national park in Oregon. <br /> <br /> I am so grateful that we have never received a true picture of a sasquatch, so we don't have to deal with bad makeup that will be part of. This. 3/10
