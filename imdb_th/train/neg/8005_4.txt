Gwoemul (host) - due to pollution in the Han River, mutated animals become rampant animals The youngest member of the Park family is captured by the beast and it is up to the rest of her family to find her before she becomes the last meal of the beast. <br /> <br /> At first I love monster movies: mutant bears, large crocodiles, crazy Komodo dragons. The living thing is my favorite horror movie. So I really want to like The Host, but it's not so. <br /> <br /> There are three major problems: <br /> <br /> The first thing that can be seen quickly is the IMDb page. <br /> <br /> Type: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thriller <br /> <br /> Too damn kind. It is too serious to be a comedian and is too light to have a real message (although it seems to be trying to make certain commands anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-government). Misplaced and confused, mixed with other styles of confusion. <br /> <br /> Secondly, after the first attack of the monster, nothing happened in almost everything. Central families lost their way to look for themselves while the Korean and American governments did nothing. And that is, they just walk around, sometimes impacting each other, probably a little funny The lack of this action made me interested and it was clear that it was done in the same way as the director because all the topics were not resolved. (The mysterious plague invented by the evil American people was forgotten and never solved) <br /> <br> Finally, this movie is politically awkward. It depicts Americans as stupid and evil. But makes us no more American characters that are deeper than cartoon villains The opening scene has the most clear moments of American Americans and smart people. With the Korean morgue assistant asked his chief, the coroner said that he had not poured chemicals into the Han River. All American coroners are all But madly crazy as he instructed the assistant to proceed Like racism, it is a lazy movie and no excuse for it. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the monster is a good mix between The Relic and Deep Rising. Quite cool and chasing the first monster in the park a lot In addition, there are some beautiful pictures in some movies, making me think of strange things like fireflies filming. (Camera shake from focus, etc.) There is also a beautiful scene at the end, where the hero and the little boy he helped sitting in the family Mobile food stalls It was at night and the snow fell. The street lamp shone cold light, but the food stall had a warm light that shined from it. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'm very disappointed with this film. I waited for a terrifying creature and I was given a political scam. See comments about IMDb. I can't help but think that if it's a US production, it will be determined. Just because it's a foreign flick doesn't mean it's a good thing. There are great movies from Korea in recent years. (For example, ending vengeance and brotherhood) but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> For one time, I liked the remake, tightening the director to improve the script and this may be a good movie As it is, it's not worth a few hours of everyone's time.
