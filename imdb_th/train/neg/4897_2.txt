This movie came with the greatest disappointment in China Ming Liang for me. It has laziness from every frame. So I will not analyze thoroughly as well. But some observations: <br /> <br /> 1 If this place is dry, why do we see the view of the city with green trees that bloom? I wonder if it should mean something in the comparative context of the movie. (Which thirsty, alertness, intimacy and watermelon instead of minor sex) or just a matter of creating a punchy movie that does not give a curse about the connection. <br /> <br /> 2 we can't Knowing what happened to the porn actress, why did she feel awake or presumed dead? It seems that the question is not important, as long as the message of the highest distribution succeeds in delivering (= bombastically), but when looking back at her sluggish body, it proves to be a cheap drama mechanism. Just like being free and being an exploit like an active activity. <br /> <br /> 3 There is nothing expressed in this movie that Antonio did not show well over 40 years ago ?? And without needing to be humiliated by his actors. <br /> <br /> 4. Music numbers (recycle from 'The Hole') give the impression of the thoughts of high school students about art problem solving. Perform at the high school skill level If that is the point, that point will be sucked.
