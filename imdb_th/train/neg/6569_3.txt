Max has V-8, Trace (the last of the Wheels of Fires and is the only hero) with a jet engine behind his car, allowing him to create unintentionally funny faces as he hurls around the area. Wilderness Surprised like Mad Max 2 (aka The Road Warrior) that was cut and edited back together as a new movie, even though filmed in a lackluster manner with bad actors and poor stunts. <br /> <br /> Why is the wasteland after death? Simple. The Road Warrior is! Actually, any question can be answered by: It's like that on Road Warrior! Except for the mutant actors who did not work from the Time Machine 60's movie that created the image of the pendant so that the audience could see non-vehicle actions to chew in minutes. <br /> <br /> In general, fashion In the 1980s, all cars were driven by bad guys who were bumped or bumped into a big explosion. The inevitable chase will occur near the comfortable cliff side. In addition to sitting in the cinema in the 1980s, still a woman who is crazy about this movie. In general, I waited for Thrace's rocket propulsion to speed up and shoot the flames, so there would be another shot that he squeezed his face as if he should have difficulty getting out more when he looked constipation The bad choreography coupled with poor performances makes this movie a true sinker. Unintended humor makes it possible to wear some. <br /> <br /> Mice: Night of terror Afraid that Bruno Mattei is superior And in itself it speaks a lot! Since 2020, Texas Gladiators is a movie masterpiece compared to Wheels of Fire, a poor street fighter who has not had enough cheese to make the movie look. <br /> <br />
