Michael Callan plays the perfect photographer who seems to be "perfect" by a woman who runs across him. What does this have to do with the fact that he also co-produced the movie? He is a "hero" that is hard to pay attention to. Therefore, the movie has a problem from the beginning. However, the problem doesn't end there. It has the production cost of a TV movie. (Try to see the head made of clay or something near the end) and the ending cheats in a way that I can't reveal in the event that anyone wants to see a movie. To know that he knows (* 2/1)
