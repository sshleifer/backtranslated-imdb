LL Cool J is much better in this movie that I expected! He did a great job acting as a "traitor" in the department of the "traitor." From the beginning, he worked well to create audience attention for the characters and situations in which he came. "Gentle, giant" - People with rough outward appearance can make anyone the right place from the start - and they work amazingly. He is quite clear that it is the best character in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is an exact show that will not receive any awards from Morgan Freeman after starring in a powerhouse movie such as Shawshank Redemption. definitely His role in Edison did not allow him to show his true abilities as an actor and in terms of grouping of various characters. There are many ways in which his character (Moses Ashford) may have a more important role That he was not disappointed and actually fell I hope to see him more from this movie. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should be in the music industry. The depiction of one of his young journalists was not good or bad. This movie is a typical action movie that (At least at first) is similar to the police business that LA had experienced in the past As an action movie, it has a share of the shooting scene, blood and courage. In general, these scenes are often unrealistic and difficult to predict. Look at the beginning of the movie with very little suspicion of what will happen at the end - think of what you expect in a good conflict / police / bad police - and it is similar to a little REAL police shooting. -out. <br /> <br /> The thing that annoyed me the most is how the character of Timberlake behaves during the filming scene. He started to have a gun and didn't use it. Then, when he was finally able to use it as if he had shot his gun for the rest of his life Then he ran out of ammunition and had no guns - and 30 seconds later without any movement or anything - suddenly there were 2 guns filled with extra ammunition and extra ammunition! This little plot error really destroyed my movie. <br /> <br /> If what you are looking for is a blatant story in a fantasy world where everything becomes real, you may Love this movie Personally, it doesn't matter to me what kind of movie it is, as long as it's realistic. Makes me believe that this is true This is a fictional story that is evident in many areas until I feel dissatisfied.
