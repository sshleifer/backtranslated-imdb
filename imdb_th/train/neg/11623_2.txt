From everything I have read about movies, I am excited to support films with Christian content. Everything about this movie is done without much professionalism. Especially writing! If there is no good writing, the movie doesn't have a chance. The writer / director said in an interview that he didn't want to say how the title relates to the story Believe me, it's not surprising. I'm still waiting for the story of a teenager / adult to unfold. But it has never been done As someone who had been divorced, I was very disappointed. This film is not comfortable for me when I pass the first emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a Christian!
