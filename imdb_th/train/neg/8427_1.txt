Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series. Despite the tragedy of a middle-aged man who seems unable to pursue his dream because of his stubborn father But it has a very light and fun mind that has been observed in practice In my opinion, it is one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. My TV series has a score of 10 out of 10 without reservation. <br /> <br /> This film that separates on the other hand is a real tragedy in the meaning of every word. The essence of the TV program is almost impossible to transfer to movies. This film has a sad voice that makes me tear many times. Seeing Harold smashed in the pub (And not in comedy) is not my opinion about jokes But is one of the most exact reasons why fans in the TV series would not like this movie This film is painfully painful, except for the scene in which Albert bathes in the sink and the neighbors see. <br /> <br /> The love story between Harold and Zeta is not complete. And makes me wonder if the manufacturer of This movie used to watch TV series. In the Harold TV series, always follow famous women, not dancers. <br /> <br /> Albert's reaction to the words he did to Harold's fans was not there. The value in the TV series In the movie Albert did not say anything when such opportunities were increased. <br /> <br /> Most movies that are separate from the British sitcoms are not boring, with the exception of ON THE BUSES movie (which in some matters Respect is better than TV series! But the steps and the child must be ranked at the bottom of the pile, even under George and MILDRED. <br /> <br /> My advice - skip this one and see the split twice, step and ride SON. Again, instead. It has a much lighter tone, more faithful to the television series and really funny.
