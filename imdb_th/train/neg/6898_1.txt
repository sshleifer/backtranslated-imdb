Avoid this shit at all costs. Invalid script, bad governance, bad performances, bad editing, bad sound and bad music. Get ideas? This movie is not a western style. It can't try to use hard violence. It tries to present new styles in the old style. The actors try their best and my heart goes out to them. But with materials that are ineffective in working with it, it is difficult to make something shine For me, this is the whole image of "The new movie outta school that will make the world of fire" The first time new movie makers tend to bite over them or their budget can chew The best thing they can do is go back a few steps, evaluate what is possible and work within the next limited budget.
