scary! Avoid like the plague. I will rate this thing in the top 10 worst movies that have ever been. Special effects, acting, emotions, sounds, etc. seems to be done by students at daycare ... Wait, I have seen a good program. than Opened like a soft porn show with a naked woman blurred, making a shower scene from it was bad from there. The nude scene was good, but that's the sound and light problems still taking over the entire movie. Sometimes I swear to hear the roar of the camera motor. YIKES! I want to watch other movies in this story. But made by others Actors and teams in this series need more lessons for acting and filmmaking. Votes 1 out of 10
