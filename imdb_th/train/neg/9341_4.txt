The comedy Hal Roach, a short story A Winter Winter, is a nine-story movie in the series "Our Gang / Little Rascals" and the eleventh Talkie. Basically, as a cartoon show Stepin Fetchit, who collects extra money here, we see him go to his cottage. Farina draws a love letter from him and receives advice from Stepin to read because he can't read it during the day He went to the NIGHT school. It was caused by his lover in Tennesse. So now Farina must have his ears stuffed with cotton because it's too hot for him to hear! In another room, Weezer sent advice to Mary Ann to make food from the radio. But because he ran back to the kitchen, he thought of making a girl's rice pudding, the news of a Spanish woman and confusing Spain After the cooking is complete, Jackie and the other gang help themselves with a scary taste. But the substance is very sticky when everyone is stuck on the wall. As a result As they tried to clean up the Stepin mess, work in the basement on various pipes and plugs that combine the functions of electrical appliances such as phones that vacuum vacuums that are loud and the refrigerators that play music! The ending. What I explained just describes the winding nature of this short "Our Gang", which serves as a pilot for the short series, entitled Stepin Fetchit. It never happened because of Fetchit's nature. The lazy negros are only small in fun and are considered to be very disgusting today. Many of the scenes that I just explained are good for some people to laugh, even though the final scene causes confusion until the results are too boring for me. So in summary, A Tough Winter is a curio that is worth watching at least once. Stepin's real name is Lincoln Theodore Perry.
