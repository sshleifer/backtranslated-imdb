I am a very Stooges fan, but the only quality that can be exchanged in this movie is Curley. It was done long before he started drinking heavily. He was a classic in this story. (And Larry is not as bad) Moe's character is the most direct part (most) and the film has a better name than "The Curley and Larry Movie". Regardless, any Stooges movies are very good ( In my opinion) but as a reviewer says that this story is so sad that this movie has real potential The casting is good, well directed, filmed and edited. But the story tries to deal with something serious, just a comedy of stooges and musical numbers (Which I guess is good at that time) do it for yourself in this movie if you really believe it must be better than mowing and eliminating garbage (Which may be debated) is to wait for the Curley / Larry scene and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat. During the rest of it
