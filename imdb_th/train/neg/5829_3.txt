I watched this movie as an example of the Matthew Barney art exhibition. It certainly prepared me. I almost skipped the show and in retrospect, <br /> <br /> In addition to the bjork and the diverse and colorful photography, the most boring and predictable content. I want to see someone wearing pearls to find out what pearl divers are doing. This film is a ridiculous mixture of Japanese cultural references and industrial images of modern whale hunting technology used in hunting / harvest simulation. The movie "peaks" with enough art to change your stomach. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of the movie? While others may argue that it is a piece of anti-whale, who would argue that it is the reason for the whale. Personally, I think it's Barney's attempt to "blink" the audience with anus, stool, self-harm, and eating meat. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: If you don't like art Don't want to watch this movie The message is unclear, slow pace and cultural references claimed. If you are shocked with art, you will do better in the many Undead movies or hunt down the old detective Hustler and shoot in the cartoon stool.
