First of all, come here: a) I'm an anime fan - it's always true (I've watched Speed ​​Racer all the time in kindergarten.) B) I like many B movies because they're hilarious. C) I like movies. Godzilla - A lot <br /> <br /> When the first movie appears, it looks like it's your usual B movie to a crappy FX, but all of a sudden - boom! Anime comes! This is when the movie is downhill. WWWAAAAAYYYYY <br /> <br /> The animation is terrible and the price is even worse than I can remember from SPEED RACER for those struggling! In fact, it is very cheap. One of the few scenes in the movie that I remember "vividly" is that when many children in the school run out ... and it is the same child over and over again! The FX is also very bad. Dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, switching to live action is an animation, dialogue and sound. (Especially the English language that I watch) is very scary and I urge my father to take the tape out of the DVD / VHS player; The only thing that survived me was the breakup of jokes and comments, such as Robots & Joel / Mike in MST3K (You choose the season). Actually, this is the only way to enjoy this movie and survive. Come at the same time. <br /> <br /> Heck, I plan to show this story to my friend Otaku on Halloween for B-movies at night. Because it's stupid and very painful to watch and hilarious. At the same time, I gave this movie 3/10 updates from 0.5 / 10 that I received in the first place. <br /> <br /> (according to my rating level: 3/10 Means both boring and not as good as fun, counting up to three, unless you find a way to make it fun, then it will be fun like counting 15)
