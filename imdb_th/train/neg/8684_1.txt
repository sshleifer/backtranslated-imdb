Abysmal with the capital "A". This will be one of the most incorrect programs on TV right now. I'm about to resist the bushes as I received. But this show didn't laugh from me What do you think Bush, as the president, has nothing to do with you or whether you like this shit show? "Funny" isn't a joke. For example, in the scene in which Bushlil had a bra on his head: "Welcome to the Al Qaeda camp!" There is something funny about that Should it be a joke? The ads that appear in the week leading up to the advertising show are more fun than acting themselves and that's sad. Hopefully this will not be considered for the second season. It shouldn't have even before.
