And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love the quirky and irreverent humor. But this girl was bothered by Barna B-O-R-I-N-G She still lacks anything completely amusing. The innocent way she tried to deliver her line was dead when she arrived because she wasn't funny. I watched her two parts and ready for Novocaine. <br /> <br /> My son Geez (19 years old) saw her promotion in Comedy Central and said she was "Stupid chick" I think that's a compliment. Where she said "See my list or I'll kill my dog" is true. I know that you want to be a comedian. She just found a case of warped knots. I don't want to see you around me.
