This is a direct consequence of 'The Mummy's Hand' (1940) because the characters lead Stephen Banning (played by Dick Foran). Now thirty years old and over and related to the story. (With the help of the archive image) with the son's fiancé. There are only two unusual aspects in this film: Banning's early death and the presence of Turhan Bey <br /> <br /> Lon Chaney on Kharis mummy receives the highest bill There is nothing to do more than limp or strike his arms. There is nothing terrifying about his appearance, except his efforts to carry out the fiancee. Isobel (Elyse Knox) ​​Dick Foran received a second bill. But he was killed within the first fifteen minutes! We have to wait until 'Psycho' (1960) when the lead character (Janet Leigh) dies before the movie ends! Banning's close friend from the first movie, Benson Jenson (Now Henson) appeared a little after that, looks very old and doesn't do any funny things he did in the original. It's hard to believe that it's the same actor! Unfortunately, this great performance was wasted because Caris was killed after only two short scenes, then based on John Banning's son. (Played by John Hubbard's bit player) to bring the chase to the cemetery - no! The sheriff brought the torch to the house of Banning to burn it and kill the mummy. Sound familiar at the international level? <br /> <br /> Turhan Bey was introduced to the audience as the new High Priest, Mehmet Bey, to take care of and feed Kharis to Tanah with his exotic tone and appearance. Too easily that he was killed The better movie should have 'Babe', served by Von Helsing. Follow the story of a mummy with his final fight with Mehmet Bay. But we have a pattern that is different from Universal's horror film earlier, with Griffin J., who is the author of other Universal episodes, although he did 'Don Winslow of the Navy '(1942) as well. Don Winslow of the Coast Guard' (1943) featured on Elyse Knox. <br /> <br /> Elyse Knox played Anne Howe in the movie Joe Palooka, six stories (1946-1949 ) And Turhan Bey, which has 43 movies and TV credits, are excellent in the title role of 'The Amazing Dr. X' (1948 ) <br /> <br /> The movie has more intensity and atmosphere. (There is a shadow in the sheriff's office) more than the first movie of 'Kharis' mummies, but with little interest or excitement. <br /> <br /> I'll give you 3.
