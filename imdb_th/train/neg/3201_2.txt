Joe Don Baker is a good actor in a small role here and there ... He's okay in the Golden Shy and has created a beautiful Willan in The Living Daylights and appears in other movies. One of the many things he could not do was to bring the movie as a leader, which he was in a very bad revenge movie in Malta. Jodon's friends were killed, so he killed the killer's brother and took the killer to Italy. But some men made the plane down in Malta and the killer escaped. The rest of the film is to see Joe Don chase the killer here and there. Joe Don has been detained many times. Joe Don tortured the bartendar and was interrupted. This movie is quite bad and you won't find that Joe Don's character is definitely pulled out. You will be surprised at how many times Joe Don's hero is hit by a single punch and he proves incompetent. The top part of this film happened when Jodon chased the murderer all over Malta with the murderer in the priest's suit. Then they boarded the boat and he pursued them all over Malta. This movie is also one of the worst closing lines in the movie ending.
