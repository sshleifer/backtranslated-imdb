I rarely criticize very much on programs or movies that I don't like in IMDb, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are so terrifying. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't mind if it's like that. Animation series - probably better than I thought But as a live-action, it makes the word 'cheesy' and 'campy' a type of power ranger. Where is it? Multicolored spandex, wearing five teenagers fighting evil by using their martial arts skills. Horrible costumes - they look like reminders of what athletes and trackers and women gymnasts wear. The performance was so bad and the fight design was not as good as it was, and it wasn't as good as it was. It made Jean-Claude Van Damme look as good as Bruce Lee, which was a self-talk. In fact, they seem to be jumping and dancing about; As if it were some 'Nutcracker' versions or they were dancing ballet instead of fighting There are also some cartoons that focus on martial arts. But it was made in a fun way But it doesn't look funny. <br /> <br /> Does the kid show it? This is an idiot and Insults on irrationality And even though this version will be released in America, you can forgive to think that while you look at some of the fighting sequences that they didn't shoot in America, but in Japan, so the fight and the images are quite 'fake'. Was borrowed from the Japanese version only to be attached to the US version. <br /> <br /> If you like this type of thing
