The flick formula of a man who wants a woman to lie next to the girl, the person who will get the best friend to help in the evil way (comedus reliefus, not?) To help fool the girl, etc. This person is dead. And with the rare exception of a little z rating, it can do better. <br /> <br /> Plot, hold the leaderboard interesting and have a few good moments. Jonathon Schaech has done better. And his performance here is close to the incoming call, not a complete loss But nothing new in this matter
