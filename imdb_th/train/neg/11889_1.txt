Very funny to watch "Beretta Island" is a natural junk movie. It's like the answer to Jess Franko's b-movie. Face to face!) For the very stupid attacker! : Unbelievably incredible shooting scenes (shooting), better looking, hand-fighting, ridiculous scenes, incredible scenes shooting, stupid scenes, strange scenes that are very strange The film is beautiful scenery. Don't miss: Arnold Schwarzenegger's jokes at the beginning of the movie and the list of relatives of Franco Columbu. Lost voice - French can sing!
