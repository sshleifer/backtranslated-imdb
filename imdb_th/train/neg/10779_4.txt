I found that this movie is the most objectionable. The talent available to the director - especially Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (without mentioning the four main leaders) - has completely lost to an unsightly story. Introduction to scary characters and stereo prints Julia Roberts is a weak Zeta-Jones, is just an ordinary person annoying. (Appearing to show her role from high-fidelity, negative humor) Crystal recently played a hyper-active, agile, neurotic, annoying and Cusack went through his part. Obviously bored with all projects. <br /> <br /> For what should be. 'Romantic comedy' is certainly not a romance between the main characters. In any way, and for comedy - (possible spoilers) there was only a moment with a little humor coming out of the role of Cusack in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Archin. Writing a screenplay could not show any originality (spoiler). Azaria is quite amusing as a Mexican lover and Walken turns to be a parody of the Doghouse art director - who doesn't. Concentrate on Knife - but these parts consists of very little screen time. With his groin sniffed by a dog Pure genius. <br /> <br /> For the big fans of John Cusack's most part, not to mention other great actors, I get a lot of good screenplay ideas. At the same time, they are not willing to explore or explain anything in detail to them, instead turning to old music that is monotonous and even reduces the depths of humor, humor, and sometimes teen movies. Terrible 4/10
