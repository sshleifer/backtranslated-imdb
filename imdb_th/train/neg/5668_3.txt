First of all - no flirting in this film - with Anthony or others. These people are not flirting - they can do your first endurance test is to wade through violence and sexual distortions for more 15 minutes, this thing is not bad - I like violence and perversity as much as the next critic. But without the context to be mentioned, it is a nasty thing So you have to go through torture and physical abuse. Then we met Donna and the movie became a different thing - no better - different: the road with no heart There are frequent jokes because of the pendant - written and played by broad bands like Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (including hookers and drag queens as well). They deserve better all. The shooting is intended to be confusing, so if you are drunk (Or any disease) - this flick doesn't suit you Think about it. I'm not sure who flicked this story for - except for S&M fans who are gay and two people who like bad screenplays.
