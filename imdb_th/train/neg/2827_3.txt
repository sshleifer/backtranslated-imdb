The first story is interesting: slaves in the late 20th century from West Africa to the Middle East Arabs The problem was that it was intended to create the enemy that was the favorite of two directors, Richard Fleisher: Arabs and Germans. In order to convince us that the Arab-looking people would be free to travel around and capture blacks in West Africa easily, believable, as well as white people who are looking for slaves in "root" Obviously, both trades are performed by local people and involve (d) more complex networks. While Arab countries are complex in child trafficking and sex slavery today, Israel is one of the worst violators according to Amnesty International. Why choose only Arabs and choose German as the only European buyer? It is a clear prejudice and hatred of those people by the Jewish director. <br /> <br /> The performance is above average, especially Peter Eustinoff, Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is as good as ever
