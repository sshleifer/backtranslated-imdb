Scary. I saw a lot of user comments about this great performance. It's truly Wanna-Be-Friends - made in Taiwan. Knockoff, jokes are lame like ... and ridiculous Obviously, the actors are struggling to be funny and may cringe when they come to those horrible punchlines. (If you call them), many users who express their opinions clearly from other planets (Or at least another continent). Obviously there is a reason for the TV company to cancel the show ... and then the list is not good. Does it make sense? However, be careful - even if it rains and there is nothing else on this planet to do ... to stand in the rain instead - more fun
