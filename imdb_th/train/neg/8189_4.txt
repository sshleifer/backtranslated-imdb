It is always difficult to have brothers who do better in their lives than you. Always try to leave under that shadow and don't let bitterness keep you away from the family. So imagine that your brother is Santa and imagine how difficult it is. That is the evidence here. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn plays Fred, a bitter loser who uses his energy to make sure people don't expect good things to happen to them or give. His younger brother, Santa (played by Paul Giamatti), has been praised too much for being a staggering Marquette, who is hungry and a little creepy that Fred wants to show him. are If so, you don't know. Fred needs money and needs to be compensated by helping his brother run away from Christmas. And lessons of hilarity and life. <br /> <br /> That's what will happen.

Unfortunately, there is very little to recommend those who have a foul odor this season. Aside from Vaughn's words, the script hardly threw good things, except for good scenes, especially involving hilarious support groups dealing with specific issues. The direction of David Dobkin is mediocre and quiet as the 20p Christmas card. That you sent an aunt that you didn't see in 10 years and it seems that he thought that just putting the ingredients together without a good combination or proper care would take Can be considered a delicious Christmas pudding No, we have burned flat lumps with too much sugar at the top. Forget about this and stick to the hilarious elves again if you want a wonderful Christmas comedy. <br /> <br /> See this if you want: The Santa Clause 2, Santa Baby, The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause
