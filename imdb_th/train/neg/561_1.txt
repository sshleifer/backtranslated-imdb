I watched this movie yesterday and it's worse than you think. First of all, the plot is stupid. It has no meaning. The screenplay is full of deliberately funny conversations. The audience laughed many times. And the suspense is very low The actors play so well, except Sharon Stone who has a good time. But there was a very bad acting time The saddest piece is when you try to be sexually outrageous and say things like "I want * beep * you" and it looks like she speaks lightly. The emotional tension from BI1 is completely gone. From the technical point of Basic Instinct 2 is an ordinary movie - better than going to a typical DVD, but using a lower lever than the original movie, much like a crazy joyride scene. Not good. Director of Basic Instinct 2 is not Paul Verhoeven. See The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and its performance. This script was made by someone who does not match Joe Eszterhas. Nothing replaces Michael Douglas in that. This movie looks cheap and can be edited badly. Sometimes I'm sorry, but my first thought after I left the theater was: "Why didn't they make this movie before and had the original talent behind? The success of the first film "Every movie is like Citizen Kane compared to this. The first basic instinct is classic and is a brake game in popular theaters. It's provocative, sexy and controversial. It has the best performances of Sharon Stone in her career. It has Paul Verhoeven's unique style. Unfortunately, Basic Instinct 2 is an unintended comedy, and is the winner of many Razzie Award categories. It's a shame that they created this movie.
