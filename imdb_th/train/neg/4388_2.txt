Oh man, I know what you think: "With that kind of name, I'm not wrong!" Uh, yes, you can. "Satan's small assistant" I also hate my mother and sister / daughter and her boyfriend. Men, it's a pain to watch this sometimes! The only reason this thing doesn't get 1/10 is because of the low budget. They are ok. But oh I don't hate those stupid actors! I know that it's not good. I guess they save a lot of money just by using a Halloween mask for the murderer and Jesus' dress also ends. Oh, torture. Don't watch!
