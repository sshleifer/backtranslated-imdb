I think everyone is quite disappointed with this sci-fi movie flick. One thing, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing is to create something that should be classic. I find it boring, nasty, and ridiculous. If you've seen, you know what I mean. Everyone at Imdb says it's nonsense. If you don't have it, avoid it as a snorer. 1 of 10
