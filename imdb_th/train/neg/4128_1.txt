This movie is one of the most scary stories I've ever seen. Scary conversations, not just But will not end only You will think that it will end, but not for how long. 140, 160 minutes? I don't even know I know I won't look again. It's like having someone joke out a funny comedy and decide to insult the romance, leaving us with a shit that manages to get to the screen But do not take my words to find yourself how bad this movie is.
