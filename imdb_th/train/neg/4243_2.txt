The most fun scene of this movie is probably when our savior receives coins and shields and whatever. Therefore, the basic idea is that the police have more numbers than these gangsters like millions per one. But they have no power because the guns of the villains are a little bigger than this. I guess the police bullets just hit back. They decided to film this movie in a documentary style with fake interviews and seriously what these guys are. They are talking about how they armed with newspapers that rolled up. Okay, I agree. It can be dangerous if in a fire, even if the situation is very helpful to you. But don't go nuts And why did it take 44 minutes to solve all the problems? I will say that it is a very long time when you surround them and you are allowed to shoot. They were like ten feet away. They didn't hit anything. Then they went to buy a cannon to increase courage. And yes, you have a police officer colliding with someone. Ammunition may be deflected by fire poles or something. I am happy to laugh, I guess.
