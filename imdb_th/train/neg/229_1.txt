Follow this story with IFC yesterday and don't believe the positive comments! I am the only one who thinks these "women" have nothing but? Kate tells Jed that she will be fired because she should be a pillar of the community. But come out to him! Suddenly they decide that they are in love? And she was very sorry for his death. She did not go to his funeral. By the way, how did the Americans be the principal of a very suitable English school? Janine should be fired from work due to unfair use of power. But nothing happened! And she gave up the scramble that she brought to investigate! And the more you speak the less about Molly the better! <br /> <br /> For the guilt of Janine and Molly with Jed please! It is the fault of the punk that he has become a Roadkill! Gerald's Poor Guilt Who Was Puked? If only I could do the same with the bozos behind this "movie"!
