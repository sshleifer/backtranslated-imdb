This movie explodes - it's exactly right now. There are some gems in this shit. But no one can exchange the limp plot. Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in "12 Monkeys" and acts the same way. I normally hate Colin because he is a typical angel. But he is ok in this movie In this movie, there are two stories - = a story about a child who threw stones through an animated windshield and another story about a woman with a mustache. Let's face it - this movie has no strange idea of ​​things. Who want to say or want to go somewhere The characters of these characters gather at some level. But should not be included in the script Everything is weak and pointless, and then there is an occasional scene, but overall - don't worry until you love the Irish accent so much that you can see ordinary people and be helped by everyone who sounds like Lucky Charms elf. - American fetish
