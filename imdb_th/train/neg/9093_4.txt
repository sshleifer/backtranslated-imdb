I used to watch this movie for the first time today and have never heard of it before, probably because of a bad message. <br /> <br /> First of all, my self-direction is quite good. I'm not a CGI fan.) It's great. But only did not create a movie There is no story. There is no message behind the talent. <br /> <br /> Or I have to make people remember the director's art, not just your vision. And this is the lack of 7 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are 4 easy points.
