** A possible spoiler ahead ** <br /> <br /> Geraldmore, the B movie actor who is busy during the Forties and the Fifties, leads to Mars exploration. Before we went to the Red Planet, we were entertained by the juggler Mohr with a scientist named Nora Hayden, Jack Kruschen, residence and sight of Les Tremayne as another scientist with a male goatee. The exterior decoration of Mars has a backdrop and fake colors, ranging from red to pink - the "Cinemagic" process has been dubbed in the ad. A really interesting monster, including a giant amoeba, three-eyed animals, a large Venus fly-trap insect and a rat / bat / spider that will never be forgotten. All strange adventures were restored by Hayden survivors under the influence of hypnotic drugs. It is reported that the ANGRY RED red planet has a cult following, and it may pick up a majority of followers during the psychedelic age of sixty.
