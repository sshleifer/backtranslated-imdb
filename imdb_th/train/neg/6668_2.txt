This movie is getting longer and seems to be tedious. - The more I get annoyed, I have to waste time watching all the nonsense. How can people create movies like this on the planet or get real money for such garbage? Don't be fooled by the relatively high rank in IMDb because it proves that you can fool some people at any time. And in this picture, the main player has a passion for guns, so it is not difficult to figure out how the movie will finally be revealed. America cannot understand that the rest of the world finds it strange that society in the United States has <br /> <br /> 'Gun culture' that is disgusting and serious. <br /> <br /> However: <br /> <br /> The actors show the losers who fled into the world of fantasy as a cowboy in Urban Sprawl. Found two families with children. Girls and teen boys Received care from only one strict parent who could not cope. The cowboy was seduced by a teenage girl or vice versa and the impressive boy seemed to be possessed by the loser of the loser. <br /> <br /> The cowboy spent all the time in an unrealistic and depressed state. All the losers who like to go to the beach and work for a living, then steal in his family because he is too lazy to earn money legally. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: <br / > <br /> Who wants to see the loser who fails in the fantasy world with a desire for death or see a poor family that has no better results than a white trash? <br /> <br /> This movie is pointless. Drift <br /> <br /> It will save yourself from getting the lowest mark possible by half of the songs that can be heard. : <br /> <br /> 2/10
