I bought this movie from the DVD to get a part of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. Luckily, Mike Crow, Crow and Tom Servo watched. Although there is a plot that can be tracked and some actors can perform But nothing else This movie is boring. I firmly assert that I will no longer look without Tom Crow and Mike. As mentioned above, however, it is better than movies featured in the episode MST3K that preceded it. Mitchell
