Don't get impressed by other investigators that this movie is related to the Japanese whaling industry. (Which is morally not worse than the US meat trade or Scottish selection), it is because it is the guff up tosh-it-own that receives modern art, bad name That said there are some beautiful images But there are incredible images in the average bus ride if you use your imagination, so there is no reason to go and see this ridiculous. What happens in this movie happens very slowly and often comes with a soundtrack that looks like a cat that is very sad and when you think it's finished, it will start again. I saw it in a porno theater in Rome that was hired over the weekend to show Barney's film work, which is an admirable and clever way to restore what was once an escape. Local from the dirty old people, the brigade, but if the trendy boys and the big fans of Bjork, who are slightly smiling, must be honest, everyone may have more fun if they Just show one in porn!
