What used to have Martin Scorsese to create this new movie? And not only will he create it completely, destroy it completely? The ridiculous decision to make the character played by Robert De Niro (In too many shows and talks) in religious fanaticism is a ridiculous and exemplary attitude of Hollywood (And especially Mr. Scorsese) thinking that the best way to create a crazy character is to cross on his back. In any case, this movie is scary. <br /> <br />
