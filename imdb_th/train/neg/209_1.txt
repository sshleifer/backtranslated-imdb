I couldn't stand watching Happy Days after Chachi joined the actors, so I knew I had a problem when the best scene in this movie was Scott Baio (the chase skateboarding scene!) Jodi Fos. Peter, in her first "grown up" role, changed her normal professional work. But that is not an excuse for this boring mess. Two hours from my life that I will not return! There are no memorable characters, unbelievable stories, suspicious fixes and terrifying movie shooting. But the worst is that I can't care less The story of a teenager in California in the 1970s, where children lived miserably and their parents were silly. Don't waste time watching this ugly excuse for movies.
