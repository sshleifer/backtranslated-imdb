When this cartoon first aired, I was impressed at least half way. I was wrong. I have to admit that watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin and George Clooney many years ago. I watched a few episodes and the two of them had Batman get his ass kicked left and right by the penguins that fought like Jet Li and beat the shit out of Batman and I watched another episode that Batman got. Butt kick again by Joker Who apparently was using Jackie Chan's movement while turning in the air like a ninja Since when the Joker or the Penguin ever competed for Batman? And worse, when Joker and Penguin Kung, Jackie Chan's partner and Jet Li, were embarrassed, depressed and sad, as Batman's image was shown on this show. The animation is terrible and the conversation is terrible. Being a Batman fan since childhood, I can advise you to stay away and avoid this show without any cost, because it's actually not the true image of Batman. This cartoon is like a kung fu flick and if you want to see the classic Batman cartoon, I recommend the Batman animated series. But this cartoon is nothing more than S --- T! Get Batman: Animation Series and don't waste time on this cartoon.
