As an impressive 10 year old boy, I like philosophy. "Love overcomes all" of the 70s sitcom "Bridget Loves Bernie" I understand the conflict, which is about the romantic complications between the Jewish taxi driver (David Birney) and the Irish Catholic school teacher ( Meredith Baxter) and both parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents, Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents) who have problems with the marriage of a young couple. > <br /> When watching the show now With many years experience in this life, I'm surprised that this show was a success for one season, though, has been popular. Created by professional television writer Bernard Slade, which a few years after the cancellation of the program will write a successful play "Same Time, Next Year", "Bridget Loves Bernie" is a light and superficial comedy that Collapsed. Br /> <br /> There is no denying real-life chemistry between Birney and Baxter, but in the following years, both actors have shown that they are better performers in other projects (Birney In his short role in "St. Elsewhere" And Baxter in "Family" and "Family Ties"). Here they try to breathe life into a program that requires serious humor, which may cause more confusion for the debated topic. <br /> <br /> The show airs Saturday night between two CBS power plants: "All in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both programs are intelligent, funny and have an advantage. (More than in the past) that made me interested in the situation and the character "Bridget Loves Bernie" was not very smart and only laughed at times. <br /> <br /> This is another example of The performance is not as good as I can remember.
