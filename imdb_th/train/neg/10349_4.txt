First of all, I am a big fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was very excited to see that the film was made for my favorite book. A Wrinkle in Time However, this movie broke my excitement. Explain in the book that there are curls and glasses and are considered not very clean. In this film, she has straight hair and does not wear glasses and is "Sport type" with deep sound This is not the way Madeleine L'Engle imagines Meg to be true. In fact, Meg depends on Madeleine's character and explains how she feels when she is young. This is just one important example of how different books and movies are. So I would say that if you want to watch for entertainment, see But if you are a big fan of Madeleine L'Engle and Wrinkle in Time, I would recommend skipping this movie.
