Wow. This may be the worst DCOM ever. I watched the first half hour and laughed. Brenda Song plays as a popular female Wendy who has a hot jock fan and meets a friend who is determined to be a homecoming queen. She should help the world as a warrior and Shin come to help her to help her in the martial arts. Shin teaches her skills with the snake snake and she must learn some techniques to help the world. <br /> <br /> This film is suitable for children who want to learn about martial arts and Chinese culture. But the performances and performances are terrible. <br /> <br /> Brenda Song is a comedian and I can't see her playing a serious role. It laughed out loud. Funny. She cried with Chin. Shin can't be shown at all and everything is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and tried to think of something similar. This movie is a fake and has to break up with Power Ranger-esquire. That it looks repetitive and stupid The characters are not pleasing and I can't bear to watch it. Disney takes time to create a valuable movie. High School Musical is the only movie that should be received by the Disney Channel, along with other movies such as Jumping Ship, Color of Friendship, Go Figure, read and cry. You like action, adventure and humorous jokes. You will like this movie.
