Please note that I haven't watched this movie since I discovered it in 2007, and my city is smaller and doesn't carry it. However, I want to say something about it. In fact, I am doing research for the university as the character Richard Maurice Bucke and want to point out that the people they hold on the main characters are completely different !!! The idea of ​​people in Hollywood and the artistic license received. The real Bugs endorsed the hysteria of keeping the insanity in women completely. I think it's ridiculous to see many film critics writing for legitimate newspapers that say this movie has some historical background! The truth I can see is the friendship between Dr. Buck and Walt Whitman Please do not waste your time on making movies without ignoring the horror stories that real women have ever touched by the hands of this doctor who has been praised by the film industry.
