Jared Diamond created the point at first that other people in the world do not have pets. But Europeans do, and that's why we are able to make iron and invent complex machines. <br /> <br /> But in the third episode, he said that when Europeans in South Africa went far beyond them Ran into the Zulu and other tribes * cattle and planted crops *, so what explained their lack of technological, economic and artistic achievements if they were important to the author <br /> <br /> The diamond also claims that the pathogen in the form of a black slave smallpox) is our biggest weapon if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and people. South Africa, who are not 400 soldiers, can beat 10,000 Zulu without injury once. In either case, I think you have to conclude that the disease is not related. We will succeed whether or not there is a disease. <br /> <br /> He said that Malaria prohibits Europeans to colonize the north and kill thousands of Europeans while not affecting. African (I want to know the real number But he did not speak.) Finally, he said that today Malaria is killing thousands of Africans and that is why they cannot contact us. Who is Jared? Malaria helps Africans by stopping the Eurpeans or hurting them? And why does Europe even agree to a great disaster in our history? <br /> <br /> He seems eager to say that the reason Europeans are successful is because of good fortune. Sometimes when evidence threatens to dominate his daze theory, he is reluctant to admit that perhaps Europeans may succeed because they work for it. It is a sad story to see that this neo-Marx is clearly a true story trying to prove his point.
