In the case of nuts being killed by a student, can the new teacher stop the madness? <br /> <br /> Believe me, you won't care. <br /> <br /> With the name Splatter University, everyone wants to get it right away. Gathering that this film is not a high level of art But even worse, Splatter University does not have the features to make fun junk. Splatter U is not well built - the story is meaningless. The characters are left far away and the whole movie lacks imagination. There is no need to say that there is no doubt or atmosphere or fear. This drift is not brave enough to throw any nudity (for the cheapest excitement of all). So around this endless slasher, there's nothing in the way of entertainment. (Not even laughing properly) and becoming completely bored The bottom of the tank - the fans die suddenly, wanting to think twice before watching it, to be alone, paying for this flick. <br /> <br /> Blow out ****
