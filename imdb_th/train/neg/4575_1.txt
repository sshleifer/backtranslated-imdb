I will accept that I am only a college student at this time. English is important in that. When I watched this movie, I was a high school student - I would like to say that the junior year But it may be senior and difficult to remember My experience with quantum physics is quite large for my physics, which is of interest to quantum mechanics that made me read the stories in many books in the theoretical aspects of the field, including the articles I can. I found and liked. I'm not a doctorate, either way. <br /> <br /> Saying ... <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. It is designed for the scientific appeal of the average modern philosopher who is desperate to believe in the specialness of everyone. My mother is such a person and since she saw this movie, she tried to let all my friends see and buy a copy of this movie. I try to point out the flaws and problems I've seen with the logic of movies and science - and they have a lot - and she canceled my claim because "Oh, so high school students know more than all people." In this case, obviously, that is the case. <br /> <br /> Leave behind the fact that finding a doctorate doesn't have to be that person right or in Reality is a wise person. Leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to clear half the film The movie producer has arranged an interview with at least one participant in order to show that he supports their beliefs. In fact, he completely opposes them. <br /> <br /> I can go and But I think instincts work very well in breaking the film, so please read if you're interested in doing <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
