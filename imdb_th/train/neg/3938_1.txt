Even Timothy Hutton or David Doughfow could not help the fish that died from this film. For starters, the script was certainly written to be the B movie. Duchovny (looking for star vehicles for And elevating himself from the television) and Hutton (looking for "two" from "one-two punch". He hoped to define his career after "ordinary people") stuck with the magic lines, wipes that weren't Good size (Come on - who used wipes after the grade 12 telecom?) And the old bad performances, sinking the film, even Duchovny did not escape from the plague caused by A bad performance that is this movie Only Timothy Hutton is higher than the material. I have to accept Duchovny's pain as he read the voice-overs. While I found myself laughing when I was sure that the director wanted me to be scared, there was nothing. Prepare me for the conclusion. Duchonvey's speech: "If you want a doctor to call 911 for sure" If only The only studio called 911, the dog of this movie will not be created. Avoid all costs. <br /> <br />
