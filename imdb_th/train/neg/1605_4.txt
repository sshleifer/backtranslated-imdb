Recently I saw a documentary. "The revolution will not be broadcasted" or "Chávez: Inside the coup". At first, I thought it showed a genuine point of view during the Venezuelan coup in April 2002. What disturbed me was the truth. That the tone of the narrative and the accompanying music is what Hugo Chávez directed. This is strange because if the documentary gives a story that is not biased what happens, there should be something likeIn the end, Chávez was certainly not a saint. Fortunately, since many years of documentaries, there are many additional information on the Internet today and it is not difficult to find such. "Urgent investigations about Chavez - the coup by the five European TV companies showing blatant falsehoods about Venezuela." It will list a large number of errors and intentionally or unintentionally forge in the documentary. (Just use the name as a search string on Google. You will find it.) Another interesting document is the video registration of the presentation of the results of many errors in the documentary "X-ray of a lie" for me. It seems to be a good clutter for "Chávez: in a coup" available at video.google. I suggest you after watching "Chávez: In the coup" to see "X-ray of a lie" and then Express your opinion My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brian are involved (knowingly or not) in Chávez-propaganda.
