One night I was waiting for my friend to come back to the smartest and "Gymkata" happened. I watched it too much. It's really funny and scary. Think of it like this - if in your job you have an idea of ​​this bad thing and do it in a very bad way. Not as long as this movie It's something that shouldn't be missed.
