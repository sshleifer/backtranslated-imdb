Lynch, this guy has something really great! He knows how to annoy us and then rewards us by making us think in different ways. However, this thing is completely different. Dumland's reward is 1% joke, ridiculous. Received from enduring folly 99%. I may laugh once. But somewhere in Episode 4, I just started to look forward quickly. Do not miss anything I was relieved when it ended and that was part of this series. It is an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations, including annoying animations and sounds. But realizing this and other unreasonable features still fail to make Dumbland worth it.
