I should listen. I was warned and still I paid for this after reading all the reviews after knowing that the original was "very bad" and the second episode didn't fit in that category. Even then I still Can't resist What happens here? The first part is hilarious. It has a lot of political inaccuracies and other Crazy, Fat Entertainment and this one may not be the worst sequel on the green world of God. This is the worst sequel in history, and this is what speaks of considering the quality that never existed. Criminally Insane Episode 2 is just a completely different brand. The entertainment center value, 1/3, consists of the original retrospective value and, above all, madness, fat Ethel loses part of her circumference. I mean, honestly, is this a joke that is sick ?! Thank you very much Nick Milliard 1/1
