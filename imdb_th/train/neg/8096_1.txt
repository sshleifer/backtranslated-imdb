Most book adaptations are not good. But this film does not have an important part in the story and changes the description and some characters They walked the story and included scenes and changed the order. They add ridiculous things to it that never happened in this book and will not happen. <br /> <br /> If I didn't read the book in advance, it would be an incredibly boring movie. Believe About characters like them or don't like them It makes the character become a joke. <br /> <br /> Awesome <br /> <br /> Laughing <br /> <br /> Wasting two hours of my life
