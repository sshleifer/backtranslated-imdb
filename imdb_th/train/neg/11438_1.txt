If there is a joke that's worse than 'Gray Matters', I don't know. The New York Jewish comedy 'comedy' movie, Sam & Gray brothers, is mistaken for a lover and decides to repair with the girlfriend only to find that Gray attracts their goals equally. - Charlie. Gay is secretly seeming to be a surprise for her. There is a deep nasty wedding sequence. A very embarrassing 'drunken action' from Moynahan and Graham, and a show that would make the woods everywhere difficult for Tom Cavanagh's wilderness. Acting funny and will want this from her work history Molly Shannon plays a warm friend with the burden of obesity. Only Alan Cumming appeared with any credit but was serious about work and didn't receive anything. All of the devastation was caused by Graham's strange performance, which coincides with the final scene in which she wears funny hats and robes, even with scenes in lesbian bars. It is surprising that this film had already been released that it had no qualification for redemption and should be avoided at all costs.
