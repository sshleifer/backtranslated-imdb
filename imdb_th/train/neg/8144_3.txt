I just saw this at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2006. The conclusion in the festival guide sounds very good, so we decided to try it. I'm sorry to say that I'm very disappointed. <br /> <br /> In addition to writing badly, it's boring. I will not be taken away from the actors because they do not do well with the script This movie should be better if Hunt Hoe is full of horror filled with camps. He takes serious effort instead and this results in boring movies. I can't recommend this movie. It feels too long and too weak.
