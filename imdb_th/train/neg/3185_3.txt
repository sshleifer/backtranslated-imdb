This movie has just been made by MST3K and has a good reason. First of all, it is the movie "Police" starring Joe Don Baker, which we all know is a police actor. Michael Jackson is a Western country singer. <br /> <br /> Every police movie subject Equipment behind their ugly heads, bar fights, hostage children to shoot, acting outs, poor, weak police chiefs acting badly, revenge / justice, endless henchmen and of course a bad show. Do not watch this if there is no MST3K filter group.
