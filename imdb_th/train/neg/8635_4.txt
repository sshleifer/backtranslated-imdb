This is not a better measure than one of Lucio Fulci. The plot is not good. A millionaire is killed and his husband calls her daughter to find out who did But the biggest problem I have with this (In addition to knowing who killed him within 10 minutes of watching a movie) wonder why everyone is interested. Father came out as a very big jerk for everyone he met. (Including the daughter he asked to help) which made it difficult for everyone to take care of anyone who killed him But nobody looks at Fulse's flick to find a good story to do. It's like watching porn movies for script writing and incredible performances. In general, his movies try to compensate for this by adding too many blood scenes. But even lacking in this film If you are looking for a good Fulci flick, try The Beyond.
