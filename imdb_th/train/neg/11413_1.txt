Seriously - Avoid this film at any cost. I just saw it the first time. "Sneak preview" of me ever, and even though I paid no refund for it, I walked out of the cinema after just 15 minutes, which included a 2 minute conversation among my friends or not to leave. The first time I ever left the movie And I live through some bad things It depends on the oldest, easiest and cheapest joke in this book in the army ("What do we do when we reach the battle zone" - "You go out of the car and die." It's really fun. So much to read here that the way it was delivered in the movie) drugs (one man eats "Space cookies", some of them are stupid and miss his wedding, or have to live through it while being high-writing and acting badly) with women in the army ("Why can we But only horns? gun! "-" That's what it is. That's the way it will remain. ") ... Okay, you might find these really funny, but in this case you seriously scared me. <br /> <br /> In addition, I have seen better performances in the soft porn movies that you get from late night European TV. So it is a weak joke (Poorly delivered) in addition to the lower average performances, the steps that are not smooth, being badly dubbed and resolved? It doesn't work, at least not at any level used as a metric for movies. <br /> <br /> I still dare say that this flick proves that there are people who can funny zan zee German. Less And that's what it says if you like the pattern (Which I can't do, it's a good thing to play with them in case someone thinks I'm not a PC enough) <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this movie Try teaching crochet to shrimp, paint your toenails with annoying colors, remove the bike, change the lamp, try to understand Einstein's theory, turn into different religions and return - in fact, listen to "Last Christmas" By Wham! In endless repetition of anything but do not see this great flick
