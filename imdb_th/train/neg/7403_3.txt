This is not the worst movie I've ever seen. But it's about this enough to say It started with a good atmosphere. The hospital is suitable for disinfecting and alienating emotions, being set to "creepy" ... nothing good, just something that is clearly not suitable ... and without any effort to explain. Connection between strange things But did not intimidate, especially I mean, come to a biker girl? Some bands watch Gwar too. <br /> <br /> The thing I like most is the demon head that looks quite like a middle-aged truck trying to make a great threat. Dropped on the couch covered with Afghanistan, discharged his belt, opened a cheap beer (Maybe Schlitz), and watch the game. Actually, I've seen a terrible truck driver that truckstops are drinking coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! <br /> <br /> Other monsters are more cartoonish and less scary. At least on a video DVD explaining their existence in the hospital ... It seems that they appear randomly in places that play "precious" metals and make people die. Except for some great special effects and performances that are not totally scary if lacking good writing. There is nothing here at all. It is a background movie with only noise.
