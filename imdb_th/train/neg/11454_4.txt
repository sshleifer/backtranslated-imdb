So I have low expectations for this film to start with. While there are some funny parts, even one or two, laughing out loud, while this movie is very short from what I would call good. The funniest jokes were unexpected and quickly caused us to sit there for "WTF just happened?". There was also a little joke that had just been dragged on, as he fell from the mountain causing I yawn The correction is also lacking. There is a bad scene change. But seems to be the current style It makes me laugh But I will not see it again and I'm very glad that I waited for rent Give you a chance to enjoy it But don't think that you are going for anything along the lines of a 40-year-old virgin or Superbad.
