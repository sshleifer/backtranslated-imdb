I love Seth Green. His appearance on the 70-year-old program of THAT is always worth watching. But last night I felt that the item had to be fixed Four young men inherited an apartment in New York City, where most of us died for Grandma must be the heir to have such a space from the beginning. So I felt that the need to use realism should be brought out. However, the plot of four close friends who received this apartment was unbelievable. I would be excited if they had to move in with their parents, which would make them more humorous and unusual about the show. Seems to not have much humor in it I watched it just because it was in front of me. My name is Earl on Thursday night. I think they should go back and leave this story and start a new one. We need more family-related series. Seth and his friends moved with his bizarre parents in the suburbs. After the fire burned down their place, they might give Dabney Coleman a role. Father and Christine Estabrook play as a mother and an unusual sibling. The list of possibilities with someone like Seth Green is endless and the network is blowing it.
