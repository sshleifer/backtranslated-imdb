This is the sequel to the official thriller action movie of '92 sci-fi. In the original, Van Damm is one of the dead Vietnam veterinary veterans who are resurrected as the perfect soldiers (Unisols) in This one, I guess about a dozen years later, because Van Damme has an estimated age daughter. Now he is working with the government to install a secret model to train the latest Unisols code name Unisol 2500 for some reason. As usual, there is something wrong: the supercomputer in the place (Seth - like a snake in "King Cobra" in the same year). The crazy power enters Unisols' command and even downloads the computer brain into the computer. Super-Unisol body ( White mind) We are looking at the next step in the evolution of people! Most of Van Damme's battles are from Unisol (professional gold wrestler), especially those who participate in the competition: leaving him out of the building - badly; Down the hill with a truck - don't go! Shoot him, burn him - forget! Most humor is traced to the way that Van Damme is now obsolete and not in class. (He is still gray around the edge), but even though he is a favorite player But he still continues to play! The most sequel of this type of game is quite lame - the original pale imitation and while the film is absolutely no genius rhythm. But it is constantly entertaining, especially if you are a professional wrestling fan
