First, I won't tell you why I rented this movie because I'm still confused ... <br /> <br /> Air Rage is like every movie that I saw where the plane was hijacked. Of course, an important person on the plane and a hijacker looks for revenge. The sad thing is that some methods of stopping the hijacker that has been used in other movies We really became a primitive tribe. <br /> <br /> Although it was Ice-T (which, for some reason, which was difficult to understand, made painful attempts to perform while he was busy) With the "c" back to the front of the rap) on the movie cover The rest of the only actors I remember were Steve Hytner, commonly known as Kenny Bania from "Seinfeld". <br /> <br /> I can't forget the part I like. The movie when the hijacker uses about the POUND of PLASTIQUE to blow the keys away ... BRILLIANT <br /> <br /> The story is wrong. <br /> <br /> Script - Evil. It arrives. The point where I can say something that I feel will make the comments stupid and it will be the next line in the movie. <br /> <br /> For special effects ... the only thing special. About this movie is that I lose the electricity cost for using my TV and VCR for 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the title - DID movies happen in the air. But due to the lesser performances, the only protagonist in the movie is the audience. <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood to split the movie Please help yourself. Don't choose this.
