I have to slap myself behind to watch this movie forever because it's really painful. An incompetent painter becomes a fully capable killer? The film is full of nonsense, which if I talk about all of them, I will give this movie to Norm Peterson, also known as George Wendt, to be in the groove to make this movie. That performance was a shame and the story became even worse. As a rational and rational person, I cannot understand where the author came from or where he went with this movie. There is an improper part of every main character, a shameful and ridiculous event, and the movie ends. One nonsense action after another conversation did not create a movie. But it made the train wreckers talkative
