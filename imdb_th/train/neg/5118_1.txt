I am a Christian and I say that this film has horrific performances, unrealistic situations and a complete front for Christianity. You may watch "Remember the Titans" and at least should not mix Christ in football movies like Troy. Formulated specifically for losers Let me express my opinion urgently that what bothered me in this movie <br /> <br /> 1 The school is in Georgia and is a white school. I didn't notice black students or single players in school. I dealt with a white "Christian" school in the south and they were created without any reason other than creating separation again. This is a worrying story when movies about Christianity and Christ change lives ... How to change the heart of separation? (Note: I like coaches, black tokens, like it's built for all white teams and players. <br /> <br /> 2 all the cheers of all Christians about this movie. I asked a few people to say that it was a bad performance, bad filming, bad writing and short versus other movies. If we compare this to other football movies, it will have The same charm and energy? <br /> <br /> 3 half-published religions that make me feel less than an unrealistic ending If Christianity is about reading a little scripture and praying to begin a complete life change, do not doubt when no one listens to what Christians say. We want to sell Christ for all treatments. He doesn't want to sell, and he doesn't have to be stuck in a strange way of life. No wonder everyone thinks that Christianity is against wisdom with unrealistic presentations. <br /> <br /> I know movies. This story may inspire a few people. The most it will not be It will not give a true picture of the fight and the tension sincerely. The most important thing for me is not being a Christian by any means or stretching. It's valuable, but it's as short as the 'pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps' that is shallow like positive thinking. If you live alongside the people who fight and / or those in the third world living conditions, this movie will be a niche like most churches in their religion.
