This movie is a strange story that has been hacked together. You get the feeling that the bond company has to come into this movie. I'm not surprised to have no credits about it. The performances of all those involved were proudly stilted and the plot jumped all over. There was very little reason. As I said earlier, it seems that the bond company must come in because it seems that there are a lot of pictures that are not filmed, which need to have and all songs are songs in the library that are not appropriate (Cheap, I guess). Very strange. Actually, I might buy a DVD of it if it can give me what happened and what happened to this movie.
