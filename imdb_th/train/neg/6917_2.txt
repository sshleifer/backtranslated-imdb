Another familiar story about a man (The author here) who sells his soul to the devil in order to have the most desired ambition in life: success. Unfunny script (we should "go home and write better") in order to understand "strong "Christmanish" (Our only ambition is to find love, respect and good friendship) and long trials. The final scene of the scene in which Agent Hopkins defeats the devil. (Jennifer Love Hewitt is not sexy or evil at all.) For all the bad things she did with unique characters. Not a bad attempt from the actor. (Baldwin is also the director of Cattrall in the role of "Sex and the City" again. Aykroyd with a comedy role in his limited role) PS Let's look at popular movies from Greece called "Alloimono stous neous" which Is an excellent modification of this legend (The old man gave the spirit to the devil to return to youth)
