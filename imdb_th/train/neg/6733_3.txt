The exclamation point in the title is appropriate, even if there is little to say. This film is not only <br /> <br /> The filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone create a thrilling thriller without humor and try to create a semi-documentary. Here they filmed in real locations in New York with acoustic "real life" to add realism. But the naturalness of the recording was to expand the maladroit dialogue of the Stones and the oral histories of tortured butterflies. Inger Stevens <br /> <br /> In a performance without complete adjustment Stevens plays the wife of an electronic device. Whiz James Mason (Looks pale and bored); Both were detained by the extortionist Rod Steiger (see puffed and bored) and his slim group of people in a plan to blackmail an airline with a deadly bomb that Mason had created unconsciously. <Br /> <br /> Instances of criminals mastermind therefore pay attention to every detail. But enough to hire a bad person who is addicted to being a supporter The nostalgic idea of ​​the nail-biting tension is the one-stopping Stevens trap with Benzedrine's Neville brand that pops up to fill the frame with his sweaty kiss. But the camera works well and is a brand so (Never before) showing that the effect is almost unquestionable. The Stones, a pair of hearts, do not have the courage to lose their confidence. <br /> <br /> Movie This story ended with Steiger chasing Stevens on a fast foot on the subway. The track is clumsy, being heavy, ungainly with Angie Dickinson as a big fan of Steiger, Jack Coleman, Kenneth Masters Bay and Barney Philips.
