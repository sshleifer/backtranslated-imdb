Is another example that makes Stepehn King's book not a movie (Even Carey, one of the best destroyed in the adaptation of the book to the screen) The location of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet that "accidentally" kills old gypsy women. In the court with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he got off the car even though the accident was his fault because he didn't pay attention while driving The father of a dead gypsy woman placed a curse on the 3rd, with our main character, Billy (lawyer) getting thinner and thinner on the day. Although the movie is stored in the book But mostly and with the end of the general king But the performance was presumed and felt forced We went from one scene to the next, without much in it. King himself created a movie in one movie. (For example, Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that the author should be there: the author left the show for the actor Not everyone in this movie will be great. I've seen the main characters in the movies that they have improved a lot.
