As a historical bean with a special interest in this historical event, I was very disappointed with the movie. Received quite a reliable costume and drama But the Hollywood picture of "British Little Big Horn" is truly boring. <br /> <br /> The number of movies devoted to the march. In the movie history of Eveytime, I heard the background music that had started. I knew I had to prepare for the difficult scenes of the filler that were no longer meaningful. Obviously, the manufacturer has invested heavily in "preparing" and striving to get their money worth. <br /> <br /> Despite the outstanding actors, their dialogue is Again, boring and their characters never develop. Whenever Peter O'toole or Burt Lancaster finishes one scene, I will cringe with disappointment. Their songs are weak and meaningless until I hardly believe that these are two of the same great actors who portray Lawrence of Arabia and the Alcatraz Bird Man, respectively. There is a worse poem. Not so good
