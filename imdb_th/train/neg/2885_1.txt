I can't say what I think about this movie. It's contrary to the guidelines. I watched many movies and it had to be the worst movie at a very low budget. The slaughterhouse scene allowed me to work better with an 8 mm camera and a monkey crew. It's terrible that I signed up to comment because I have to tell someone that the movie rental location is not enough, but this is my 2 cents worth. See for yourself Because I'm sure I won't lose my money again Now I leave you with this comment. I hope you do not do at the rental place when they will not refund you .. =)
