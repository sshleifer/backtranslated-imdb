"This movie" is an impersonation. No need to wait. - Nasty things. Don't wait. <br /> <br /> I think "Inspector Clouseau" and Alan Arkin (!) instead of Peter Sellers, laughing and blasphemous. But still daring to "rebuild" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are lazy and lazy. <br /> <br /> Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy have died since last year. . Fri. 1964 and 1965, why would anyone start to think that the proper improvement for L&H will be in the Bronson Pinchot character and Gailard Sartain is beyond me? I fully expect to be scared and embarrassed and of course I am not disappointed. Everyone involved in pathetic, moral, shameful things should be blackballed from everything related to Hollywood and making movies. Avoid this film at all costs - you have been warned correctly.
