All day now, I watched the dinosaurs and the whole day had the same basic problems. <br /> <br /> They didn't believe about firearms. They seem to have never had a story about them or anything. The bullet _bounce_ from dinosaurs! Probably because they were extinct millions of years ago. The invention of gunpowder and the laws of physics were different at that time ... Eh, didn't come at all if they were close enough to carry out the chemistry today. He must be at risk of leading to It's that easy. <br /> <br /> See the most reptilian skin in the world. Today, crocodiles and crocodiles are vulnerable to basic rifles They have nothing magical. You can shoot a round pistol through the heavy scales on the back. They do not use armor piercing ammunition or anything special. Small bullets penetrate them, they do not kill them. Large bullets (But not really) is needed because of the challenge (Like most games) is killing animals with a single shot, so it doesn't work. (Hunters think it is immoral to escape and die without harvesting) <br /> <br /> Most animals, including hunters, are shot with guns. Between the sound and the pain of even the most undead wounds fleeing The exception is the big bear, which is not afraid until they are infuriated by only human wounds. The shawl buffalo is considered to be extremely dangerous. We have watched a video of a large number of bulls from a buffalo herd who saved the calf from the pride of all the lions. The big cat will run if it can. But if it is impossible, it will be charged as the last act of desperation that T.Rex does not recognize on this spectrum is unknown. Their behavior was not observed. With animals that are larger than this, hunting safely becomes a matter of using a large and powerful projectile. Of course, with T.Rex, this may be a serious problem. I have seen T.Rex's skull (they have one in the museum in the city) and hold a gun big enough to catch that might not be able to. Chewing a neck with a small amount of fire can be a better way. Small bullets will still _penetrate_ them. They won't bounce just because the animals are too big to kill easily! <br /> <br /> So here we have Cortez and his people (this is obviously _before_ the famous Mexican campaign) that was captured by Native Americans and has a pyramid sacrifice schedule. It appears that all human sacrifices are about the release of the bloodthirsty of T.Rexes that threatens the continent that day. Rather than letting their hearts be cut and fed to the chameleon, Cortez et al talked with the Aztecs so that they hunted and killed them. OK, maybe they may not have the M-16 like the ones in the "Carnosaur" series, but they _do_ have flip locks, crossbows, spiked (large, made of trees) and swords. With full automation But they have many men and I will bet on the dinosaurs very quickly. Oh wait, there's _cannon_ about 4 inches. That's just a ticket for catching a skull. Tyrannosaurus'! So they set up a trap with a group of men, an artillery pointing at the valley and the first T. rex enters, using a beautiful brown girl as a bait. Cortez points out that they won't have time to load, so they Will have to close the session until they can be sure that their goal is T.Rex completely ignores their musket fire and we see both the lightning bolt and the cannon _bounce_ off! Forget it. End it. Trust. The lightning bolt will overcome Cortez's body armor and the 4-inch large ball may penetrate the wooden hull! Will this _certainly_ pass through the ribs or skulls of all animals that will walk on this planet? Think _whale_ can bear a 4-inch ball?) And this is T.Rex, which still stands without bleeding. So Cortez lured it to the valley, where it fell on a spike which (I guess with magic) Drill it and kill it. Yaaay spiked wood! <br /> <br /> The dinos are not completely damaged by gunfire - they try to keep an eye on the second gun. This thing ran out, so it didn't mean that at least the bear or buffalo, at least in the movie <br /> <br /> They killed the second dinosaur with a bomb - made of gourd filled with gunpowder and jewels. My money will remain in the cannon. The engineering designed function is to combine all gunpowder energy in one direction - to the goal. Explosive is an application of explosive force _real_ (not a zucchini bomb). There is an iron casing which contains a very high explosive force (think: bomb pipes and firefighters). POOF (believe me in that)
