Pier Paolo Pasolini or Pee-pee-pee as I like to call him (Due to the love he had for the penis), perhaps the European director of the Marxist too - and they were thick on the floor The way everyone can see "art" in the mix of sex that is cheaper than me. "Stories" Some things here may come from soft porn movies and I don't mean nude. But it is simple and repetitive. Anyone who likes to look strange but stupid should put his teeth in the movie series "Der Schulmaedchenreport". German porn movies of the 70s are soft because that's what "Decameron" looks like. With me, <br /> <br /> This movie is sloppy at almost every level from beginning to end: <br /> <br /> 1 editing, for example: at 1 hour: 15 minutes: 45 seconds with chasing scenes The hunt is quite clear in places that are not right. the It should be placed about a minute later, but I guess Pasolini will have to hire an editorial editor with a little time for "Good details" in the making of the movie. Pee-pee-pee's fans may respond by saying that it was intentionally placed there - which I doubt very much. Moreover, even if it is true that it will be even worse because the story is useless by following it (this is not "Eraserhead" or one of Tarantino's broken films. ..) <br /> <br /> 2 Acting Vey sloppy Triple Pee fans (8 people) proudly announced that 3P-O uses "real people instead of actors" (not actors or they are The Martians, of course, many actors With IQ below standard But that means that we should treat them as insulting ...?) Other directors use amateurs and be successful (such as Alan Parker or De Niro). The most in his movie? The answer is a terrible recklessness again. Pasolini is a sloppy person in everything and that includes trying to get out of the amateur without his teeth as much as possible. He is a lazy director. IMperfectionist If you like anti-Kubrick, I think ... Pee-pee-pee's main goal when selecting will be to find as many seniors without teeth as possible. (And his favorite young man) in Pasolini's world. There is a simple formula: lack of teeth + strange face = realism. It's good and good to have them without teeth. But at least try to show a semi-dramatic performance from a new, inexperienced musician. Otherwise, you are an amateur - amateur director in the case of Pasolini that 3P-0 cannot. Can do or do not care, do not change anything (who knows ... maybe he didn't notice the great performance?) <br /> <br /> 3 sound synchronization if 3P -0 feels that the microphone is very complicated In the filming of the movie, he should try at least in the post production, that is, make these bum actors speak the studio. So that the audience will not have to move the mouth while the wrong dialogue floats elsewhere in the movie. <br /> <br /> 4 Lack of ideas We have dozens of intimate stories that are not linked in a way that Meaningful Some people resist the church. (More later) while some are just sex yarn like the cheap men fantasy (Sometimes gay) designed to enslave and nothing else The story and characters are not amusing (if at all) at the intelligent level. But at the basic level, a 10 year old boy laughs here ... and it's nothing wrong. But then don't call it a noble intellectual art! <br /> <br /> 5. As a result of point 4, there is also a lack of logic in the order of the story. That goes without saying Pee-pee-pee can be sorted in other ways and we will have the exact same movie It also means that you can start from the middle, then return to the beginning, etc. "Decameron" is like a spaghetti bowl this way: when you start eating it, you can start with the thread you need it. makes No differences. <br /> <br /> 6 Pointlessness of the story's resolution. Most stories end in a cheap joke, that is, some people are dumb, straight lines coming out of pornographic comics, while some have no conclusion: they just finish Finito the best. The story is anecdotes. Can see, which has almost no meaning there - unless you find "deep" meaning in pornography. Of course, there is nothing easier than searching and searching for "meaning" in an absence of identity So even hard-core porn movies can still be philosophically / endlessly simple and fun. Try doing it. Oh, there are 8 PPP fans! <br /> <br /> For the beatings of the church ... Some viewers are excited about the attack on the Roman Catholic Church and not anything. Essentially, all are good and good - I am an agnostic. But what those people ignore is simple facts. But it's important that Pasolini is a Marxist. It's like a pot called a black kettle. Marxist criticism of the church about hypocrisy and stupidity Where is he nervous? In addition, Pasolini is not a person who does not believe in God, so his posture is high and has power and righteousness in himself is not justified. In the end, Marx was a believer. But instead of accepting gods with the concept of utopia, which is another fantasy fantasy that desires supernatural So I am not excited about the PPP's resistance He doesn't refer to this stupid little movie as a work of art, isn't he ...? In the event that he is a poor-deceived person - then I have to wonder why he doesn't just let it in a dream and not make those bad movies ... <br /> <br /> Want to read the subtitles that change my movie Bergman?
