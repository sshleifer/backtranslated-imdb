Too bad I have to agree with the critics written by Halopes <br /> <br /> for short films, movies, costumes, sound sets, editing and everything else is great. This may seem surprising at first. But I was informed that the technical team working on this matter consists of professionals, so expect quality. The usual problem lies in the story itself. <br /> <br /> That is not true. To tell the story (Or in the case of the theater SHOW a story) you must have planning and conflict You want something that happens to the protagonist: these events happen because the protagonist needs something and for some reason he can't get Tim Watcher without a problem or goal. He is a supernatural type who only observes humanity. So what we have here is pure expression. Instead of showing the story, we just learned about this Tim Watcher person. Of course, considering the timeless nature of Tim Watcher and the short period of the film, it was difficult to provide enough basic information about him. In this case, it is used in the worst possible sense, which is to provide information that otherwise we will not collect. In fact, if not for VO, we think that the character is just a cowardly old man. Look at things to make it worse. VO also explains what happens on the screen! The pictures we show are just decorations for the messages we are listening to. <br /> <br /> I can say that this short movie will create a good video for a band or something. Stand alone, not to say that. The rest is clear that there is value as a measure of the technical capabilities of the crew (unbelievable but good), but can not create entertainment, fun, excitement or at least show the story.
