The story of the character development and jokes in this movie is very weak. Quite a waste of time The conclusion of saving grace should make you feel warm and vague as if the characters grow through the fight. There is no such development to make such a warm, fuzzy feeling possible. Pulpit, lament, and most movies are not as loud as real life The story builds things that should be tense. But the characters have not developed enough to be interested Then it will go through all the great problems in about a minute of the screen, making the audience feel like just wasting time.
