This movie accepts what I call an emotional rape to the audience. This movie should be a thrill for critics in Cannes. But for me, the final scene is just a pathetic effort for the new director to notice himself. There is almost no sound in the discussion of violence, drug use or juvenile delinquency. (Or other problems for that matter) <br /> <br /> The main character changes from good Barely existed while the rape scene (This version is too dragged and exaggerated by the rape scene from "Lan Orange"). There are some things that an artist should not do to try and achieve his / her goals, at least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> To summarize: cruel, nasty, nasty, and not worth your time. "A clockwork orange" or "Le pianiste" instead
