Former actor, actor, actor, actor, and actor, all cute Rob Boye, in a movie set in a highly secure American prison. I have a feeling that his character is gaining popularity for the wrong reasons, such as Tobias in the first series of OZ, but PROXIMITY is not that type of film. It is more like "Man on the run" than FUGITIVE. Nods on the subject of punishment and justice, with James Byrne putting as a spokesperson for justice for pressure groups But any wise discussion about how society should treat criminals will be completely ignored. Of shooting outs and car chase
