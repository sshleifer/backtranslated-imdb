Men, even Plan 9 From Outer Space, are better than this movie. This flick has not enough plot for half an hour. But they can extend it for more than one hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are quite good, especially in exaggerated fighting scenes. But the story like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is better than the apology to make it better.
