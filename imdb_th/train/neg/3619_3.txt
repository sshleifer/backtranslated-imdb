In general, there is a family where the little boy (Jake) thinks that there are zombies in his closet and his parents are fighting all the time. Suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombies. <br /> <br /> Ok, first of all, when you make a movie, you have to decide whether it's a thriller or drama! As a movie drama can watch Parents are divorced and argue like in real life. And then we have Jake with his wardrobe which destroys all the movies! I expect to see BOOGEYMAN's similar movies, and I watch the dramas with ridiculous thrills instead. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 just for the good conversation of parents and descent. For the shot with Jake: Just ignore.
