To be honest, I don't like "Executive decisions" - which is clearly a template - a lot, but compared to this crap, it seems like a masterpiece of art. <br /> <br /> Not only that. People moving in this movie (The words that the actors are insulting for other actors) should attend more acting classes. Those who created this scene never saw the plane from a distance. It's very ridiculous that only 747 flights, 3 flights are on board. But this is just a small part of the iceberg. This movie is full of irrationality (eg: use the gas to sleep and not use it and continue to use it) which causes my score to decrease as much. <br /> <br /> You can have more fun in Arrange the socks, socks or drill holes in the knees and add milk.
