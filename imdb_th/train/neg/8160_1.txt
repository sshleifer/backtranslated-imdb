And it's not fun. It's terrible. It's shocking that people post positive things about here. Terrible story, poor performance, not scary, special effects, not special - no! The blackboard has a hand out! Oh gee - the mirror turns into water! Hair, clothes and make-up in the '50s' scenes are wrong and they have middle-aged men with hair that are retreating to play their own version. This is like a nightmare later in what Elm Street I enjoy sitting down to watch as many horror movies as possible, but there are better people to choose from.
