Although in some aspects, Seven Pounds is strong and interesting in some areas of storytelling. But Gabriele Muccino's project is quite normal. This film is becoming more and more happy as it moves towards the end: the human heart and the physical eye emotions and comparison. Seven Pounds is an amore game of Amores Perros of Alejandro GonzálezIñárritu and 21 grams, which has events Many past The problem is easily predictable from VERY through movies. It's terrible because Seven Pounds would be truly "good" if Ben and Emily were put in the right hand.
