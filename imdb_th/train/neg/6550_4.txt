I almost made myself foolish when I started this review by saying "This movie reminds me of BILLY ELLIOT." But then I only searched the history of Lee Hall to find out that he was the author of BILLY ELLIOT. So it was a hall that made myself a fool, not me. <br /> < br /> Am I a cruel person? No, because Lee had what other screenwriters wanted from England - he stepped in. He had previously written a successful British film that won and made money at the box office and he would do. what's next He gave the audience more. <br /> <br /> Young Jimmy Spud lives in some kitchen sinks. He was bullied at the school and no one loved him. The only thing that made him move forward is that he was inspired to be a ballet dancer. In fact, he had no desire to be an angel. But considering his household, he may be a ballet dancer. He has a man who is a father who thinks "The ballet dancer is a bunch of stupid people, while his grandfather says," Ballet dancers are strong people like everyone else. I remember seeing the Bolshoi ballet ... "Yup Ballet is The main talking point about the assets of the British Council in those days - don't think that it's not a left-wing politics that seems to be the middle class. Sole Gourmet who live in a great big house, so everything about this setting will feel ridiculously ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Another important criticism is that this film has no clue. To attract attention, I usually Criticized Channel 4 for broadcasting the movie at an entirely inappropriate time (For example, The Land That Togot at 6 o'clock in the morning) but they presented this at 2 o'clock in the morning and when they received it when considering this I hate it) Lung cancer and poverty are not considered suitable for family audiences. But because the main protagonist is an 11 year old boy and an angel and a ballet dancer (Don't blame me if I'm obsessed with this - no need to refer to them). There's nothing much here for an intelligent, mature audience. <br /> <br /> Of course, if the director Lee Hall Was told in the script development process that he should write a story with students and angels and refused to say that he wanted to write about other topics and then I would apologize. But throughout the story, you will get the feeling that when the film is complete, it will be marketed to the same audience who are happy with BILLY ELLIOT.
