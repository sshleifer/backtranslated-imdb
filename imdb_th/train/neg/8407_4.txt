From strange travel books "African foolishness" with our overlapping director who acts as a narrator to a terrifying fake ear that transforms an untamed elephant elephant into an African elephant until there is no reason. Wailing "Tarzan! Tarzan!" There is nothing about this movie that deserves the classic status. <br /> <br /> 4/10
