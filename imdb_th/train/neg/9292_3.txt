First of all, I expect to have another hero, which is a great art work for action. I only saw some parts of the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I can imagine that it is better than HoFD. <br /> <br /> The basic elements from the Hero can be found in HoFD: the wonderful landscape, mesmerizing movies and performances. Sincere (I mean if you don't understand the words they are speaking without subtitles But you're still interested - it's a good show) <br /> <br /> Is there anything wrong? What started with political intrigue began as a love story. Worse, it's a soap-loving triangle. You have three characters that I guess fall in love with each other for bad reasons. In general, this film is separated from each other after escaping from prison. (I fell asleep for about forty minutes) as if they had changed writers at that time. The rest of the film is about the character of the character "like the wind" ick. In addition, you have to extend the time of disbelief to believe that the action scenes. This is not a characteristic of this type. But because of the weak story, you can't wait to proceed. Beginning to grab you But then this movie doesn't have oil
