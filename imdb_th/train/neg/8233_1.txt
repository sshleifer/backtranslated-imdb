This may be the worst movie ever. In fact, I can do better than myself, it is not set correctly. It looks like this movie has a budget of $ 5 and is left with changes. Don't watch it. I didn't go through this movie until I had to close it. I gave this 1/10 because it was hilarious that the film maker wanted it to be a horror Morale, but actually became a bad joke Basically, many girls crashed into the car in front of the car, and the owner of the car chased them. The bit I saw was a woman with a gun telling the girls' loads to take off their clothes. It must be a wonderful porn movie as well.
