I'm sorry but this is terrible. I told people about this movie and some bad performances that were there and they almost didn't believe me. There is nothing wrong with the idea of ​​a modern Japanese soldier being drawn back in time to the era of the Busido warriors and their modern weapons matched almost everything. When the soldiers realized what was strange, everyone in the back of the transport needed to say that "Hey, my watch has stopped"? Imagine 15+ times of this melody, before they say anything again, and you lack the greatness of this film.
