I am a great sign for Neil Young's songs and with the joy of the movies received in the press industry for many times, the first performance of Greendale that I can find. My excitement is short-lived due to the boring story and the short-lived momentum that makes most movie viewers sleep or disappoint. <br /> <br /> Neil said that this movie started with the soundtrack. Just taken the soundtrack Not the best way to create stories. There are no characters that have curves, and when the "important" event occurs, the audience will not be interested because the level of annoyance of the movie technique is very high at that time. This movie is the whole song, and because of this, the characters at the end of the lyrics of the lyrics while they are singing ... This technique is used for the first chapter that is done. It doesn't feel that it's real or fake. <br /> <br /> Great performance with characters that search for emotions and play all. Sometimes bad light The only glory I can give to this film involves many scenes shot in live broadcasts. But this technique has been used in theaters today, in which this movie can do nothing more than this. Good soundtrack But nothing I could buy quickly Bad movie
