I saw the goal that changed .. Overly .... and always the same feeling ... You see that Olsen twins do the same movie ... They like to play different sports and then fall in love. Boys .. Now about movies .... First of all, little boys and girls do not play in such a great goal ... 2.football not playing at the specified time ... 3. if this game ends at the referee Working overtime (minutes or more) ... and the end is expected .... I think this movie is not good because of lack of football knowledge .... If it's done by the manufacturer In Europe, it will be better .. and the mane actors are not a terrible choice ... They suffer from lack of authenticity .. They play in the full season of the season. But that doesn't make them a big star ... You have to show your talent ... and that's what is missing in the Olsen twins.
