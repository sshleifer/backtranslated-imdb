This movie is scary. Everything in it has been done before. Nothing original I can't stand when the writer doesn't think of his own plans. <br /> <br /> A woman wishes her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult. Um, sounds like a movie in the 80s called Big. What is more annoying is the performance of Jennifer Garner. She's not acting like she's 13 years old. She just acts like a fool. <br /> <br /> Then you can guess the whole story. She got a good job and it happened when her 13-year-old friend worked with her. Wow, great! But not .... Her friends are not good and turned to find her trying to find work. But of course she eventually won when she had the idea of ​​"good". <br /> <br /> There are also thousands of dance scenes that I've seen thousands of times. Hate this movie
