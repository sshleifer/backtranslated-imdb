I fear how bad this movie is. As a pastiche of the early 20th century Hollywood artists, it set a new low - even in the past The Moderns or (gasp) Cradle Will Rock & I never thought that I could watch a bad movie. More than the two of them. Period. However, Intent & the results are surprisingly similar. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is an awesome selection of actors: Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN? Sorry? Peter, you owe this guy, right? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? These sacred smoke people do not start trying to capture the image or sound of the moment they draw the original image. <br /> <br /> Okay, the final picture is a good movie. But this is a disaster And the image of the rest of Bogdonovitch has not improved much. Guessers rub against Welles & Hitch & Ford. Wearing out for a long time is also good for hosting TCM.
