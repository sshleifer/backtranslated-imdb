The worst movie in the world I don't even know how to start. But I hope I can help others from punishing themselves with this movie. When talking about acting and lighting, this movie is like a bad porn without having sex. The actors are the worst people I have ever seen and not worse than this, even if they try to mock this movie. This film must have a record low cost, which I am sure is almost wasted on the cover of the movie only. Now this movie became a joke with my friends and became a benchmark for comparing other junk movies. I want to point out that no other movie starts to compare. I felt responsible for introducing friends and I watched this movie, and I was surprised that she still thought I was a friend after the torture that I gave us. Don't see this movie!
