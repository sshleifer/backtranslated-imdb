Why, when the stars reach the highest point of the constellation, they destroy all good works by creating a bad movie. Burt Reynolds pitched and began to perform a horrifying car. Arnold Schwarzenegger became the hottest real estate in Hollywood, just to mock himself with the scary Last Action Hero and here, the tireless Eddie Murphy will erase Memories in the trade and 48 hours with the "Family" adventure, which is a boring misunderstanding, boring children, the most attractive aspect of this movie. <br /> <br /> Story the Is really boring It deals with social workers. Murphy is contacted by a mysterious type and says that he is the chosen person. Choose what I hear you ask. His job is to help Tibetan boys with mysterious powers from the demon tribes that want to dominate the world. As the main devil, Charles Dance, the actor who has a very shy look in the movie But hey, I'm sure he gets a good reward from sacrificing his talent. In all Murphy's films, this is the worst. I have read reviews that suggest that it is good to see Murphy in an unusual role in a movie that is not a specific formula and while both are true, there is no forgiveness of the fact that May be - a sure burden. Trash <br /> <br />
