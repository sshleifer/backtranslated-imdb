After Chaplin created one of his best films: Dough & Dynamite, he created his worst thing: Gentlemen Of Nerve. During the first year of the film, Chaplin created about a third of the movie Of all his movies Many people were experimenting in terms of advertising, editing, gagging, photography, places and more. This happened at the racetrack where Chaplin and his friends tried to come in without paying Mabel Normand. Being there with her friends and Chaplin was able to get rid of his friends and Mabel. He then carried Mara Mabel in the grandstand without the obvious impact of his behavior. Very sluggish here But there is very little to recommend this movie for others and see the Chaplin development The print work I saw was worse, which could affect the enjoyment. Charley Chase can be seen * from 4 stars.
