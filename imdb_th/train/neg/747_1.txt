Finally, I thought that someone was doing justice to the classics of HG Wells, not other models that were in the wrong place or era. It follows this book closely and is only positive with this mess. <br /> <br /> This is 180 minutes (yes, 3 hours). The book length is only about 150 pages. <br /> <br /> If Timothy Hines had the courage to come here and say "If you do better ..." I will say "Yes, I can." And I never used a video camera or anything or School drama in my life <br /> <br /> I paid well to get this shit to the United Kingdom from the United States. Don't make the same mistakes as me.
