I watched this Canadian video tape, "The Witching", which happened in New York. The sound is quite bad, I have to lift it about 7/8 to listen to it and the soundtrack often has many conversations. Orson Welles is a poignant worse than usual, and some of his conversations and other people run through the room to resonate. The ghost body that appears again makes her sound distorted. Some closed captions will really help. <br /> <br /> A group of witches or worshipers. (The last credit says that the group doesn't really mean being a group representative!) There are rituals that they are naked and cause. Preterm birth by stabbing dolls The premature woman and husband moved to a town called "Lilith" where he was given a job at a toy factory. Although there is one of the AKAs of this movie, apparently "The Toy Factory", we have never seen it and it is only sometimes referred to <br /> <br /> On the way to Lilith, her husband Impatient From her question about what his new boss, Kato, wants to know about religious persuasion He drives hard and makes other cars run out of the road and explodes. After the police arrived, she took the doll that had fallen out of the car, which is the second handmade doll in the movie. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Kato and all the townspeople are witches and they Is someone who makes her abort even though she doesn't know They want you because you have the talent that comes. Born for the use of magic that she didn't really know. <br /> <br /> Some pictures in the movie have some impact. But overall, this movie is not very relevant. This movie seems to be a bit of a mess, and this is without a doubt the cause of new revisions and new videos. The original version based on the ending credits is called Necromancy - A Life for a Life. The magic of DVD can make us see both versions on a single disc. But releasing the movie again may not be important.
