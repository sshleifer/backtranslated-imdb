This is a movie that exemplifies the fear of D & D of the 80s (and even today). Fear that people playing D&D (or other role-playing games for that matter) will be "sucked" and lost Lose the ability to distinguish reality from fantasy Great movie for everyone who likes to blame social problems about inanimate objects. But anyone who plays role-playing games, video games, or even plays, will see that this is an insult to their intelligence. It's D&D. What Wargames uses with computers In addition, as a movie, it just sucks.
