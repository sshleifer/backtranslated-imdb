Guy is a loser, can't get a woman, wants to build, is chosen by someone who has a stronger success, etc. See, see it, move. I must say that Rob must move through Adam Sandler part of his life. And leaving the plot. Adam Sandler has two funny parts in this movie. I can't do it in the last 5 minutes. I'm getting bored. "The Animal" is a good movie. I often enjoy Adam Sandler's movies with the same story. But this is too difficult to impress Very old jokes So believe me This is not a movie that most people can really get into. But some people can do it, so I will be good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
