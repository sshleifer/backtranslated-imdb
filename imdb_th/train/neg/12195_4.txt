The story is not traditional if someone sees "L'ultimo Bacio". Nothing new. A wealthy family in Rome uses everyday life that is boring and unreal. Everyone asks others to think about them. Really boring after half an hour because it's easy to understand that the story is about to end. Because it's easy to see the moral view of Muccino in this movie, so even the hardest parts look normal To summarize, during the first 2 minutes of this movie, it would be enough and the goal of this movie was already told. The family has seen since 30 years old. I don't like watching movies that want to show reality. But because his ideas must be more consistent than normal situations It was really good that Muccino placed the camera in the correct position, moving with the carathers and it was the only reason that I didn't sleep in the cinema even though it was the scream of the movie from the beginning Perhaps it may be good to see the family that they are in reality and not to blame for something from it. Morante is normally concentrated and wonderful. Unfortunately it's a bad movie!
