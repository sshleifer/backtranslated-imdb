Although the preference of some people who focus on this opinion in 80+ for this movie is low. But I feel that I have to say something about this I am not a movie watcher who is interested in the value of production, thought-provoking conversations or excellent acting and directing. However, I claim that this movie is terrible. I do not know why I do not like ... I mean, it has almost everything I need from horror movies: blood, evil, unintended humor, etc. According to this evidence, it should be my favorite, even so. Zombi 3 is a movie baaad. <br /> <br /> There are many things that force you to shout at the screen. Like when a girl leaves the army when their car breaks to find water (This causes nothing to lose. Don't worry.) She walked into what I saw as an abandoned hotel or something. Did you see that there is a friggin lake in the middle of the building? Yes, she's looking for water and passing the lake. Why? Because she wants to know why people (Who was not there because of being abandoned) would not answer her when she called out: "Is there anyone?" Oh, this is just a small picture, a little insignificant that I am drawing. br /> <br /> There is a reason, but why do I give this movie more than 1 star to be one of those movies if you forget that it's really bad, like I have a couple of times, you want to look again because it's great Very much in all aspects I called it the blood in the first paragraph. But this movie has no blood, it has a blood ocean In addition, there are also amazing creatures: zombies, babies (by adult size hands ???) and heads that fly astonishingly to name just a second. <br /> <br /> You know When you try Think of the worst and worst movie ever created. You will get the 50th sci-fi movie. I believe Zombi 3 and the movie as it should be. It has all the elements: scientists argue with the government, warnings of revelations in the radio, the army fighting monsters and others. This is the 9th plan of '80's! While I won't say that this is a waste of money if you want to buy, just expect the worst. And when you find that the expectation that the worst thing is that Zombi 3 is low, it will not be worse You might like it. I didn't say it wasn't possible. <br /> <br /> Don't think I hate this movie. I'm not ... really. Oh, PS. Bird killing rules (aka Zombie 5) ! (How did I just blow my credibility?)
