Of course, it's a funny movie that I shouldn't forget for a while. <br /> <br /> Usually I don't bother to comment on this movie: It is a minor story that no one can see. Is popular with p2p sharing networks like Kazaa and therefore the production of saaad must be revealed what it is. <br /> <br /> What is it? Of course, it's not a joke. But it was intended to flick the horror - "intended" is the key word here The script is a disordered and unbalanced regulation. Special techniques are only special in the story that they are pathetic, and for the performance, it must be said that if this is a drama that graduated in elementary school <br /> <br /> Of course, I know that this is a movie with a very low budget, and in these cases we should reduce our expectations. In addition, even though I'm a big fan of horror genres But I know that these movies don't have a place for interesting scripts and great performances. <br /> <br /> But still. <br /> <br /> Movies B often have redemption properties to compensate for the lack. Funding such as humor The only laughter in Cradle to Fear is ridiculous performances. If you can find humor in that story - and I can do it in the first 20 minutes or more, then slowly sleep after that - that's the only thing the movie has to offer. Oh, and two or three breasts. <br /> <br /> How woo looks so exciting. <br /> <br /> For this, it's not about trying to communicate anything: Victims may use drugs. Addictive and / or involved in serious crimes. Lesson: Watch out for mischievous boys and girls, because one day you will have to pay for what you do. <br /> <br /> I stay here. <br /> < br /> So all overall sex A little dose of moderation. But without rock and roll. <br /> <br /> I give this 1 in 10, but it's equal to 0 if I can. Or maybe I don't: It deserves 1 for spelling the actor's name. Correctly in the name I mean, it's something.
