But this movie is boring The history is good. But not music Not the only song I care about and there is no soundtrack to hear. <br /> <br /> If Sweet Jesus "is suppose to be a relief cartoon, it won't work if John Adams is considered annoying annoying They try to overthrow him in every scene. <br /> <br /> Hancock and Jefferson are the only characters in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Historical quotes And debate about slavery in history The context is interesting. But not enough to overcome the lack of musicals. <br /> <br /> You shouldn't humble after a musical, except for a few chirps. There is nothing worth the breath.
