After Highlander 2 (which I still refused) I thought it was impossible to create a sequel that could make me cry because it was bad. I was wrong. I like Wargames. Details about the original Wargames original movie. There are hacks that can be used. Anyone who writes this movie knows nothing about computers, except how to use a word processor. I wonder if he or she will watch the original movie. The acting is unbelievable. Please help yourself in any situation. Watch this movie. I don't care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can't turn off the TV. This movie will destroy your life.
