This thing is terrible and embarrassing for Canadians. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the top of the world. The national ballet has been ranked as one of the top five companies in the world, but we make horrible movies of blood! This is not particularly bad. It is especially unusual and terrible that it was filmed in two hotels and a park with some direction showing high school and "Wow, wow, wow, wo wo, wo wo, wow, wow wo wo, the picture, if Michael Moriarity is intended to imitate Jack Nicholson Can he not imitate GOOD Jack Nicholson? And if this film was filmed in Vancouver, one of the most lovely cities in the world and the center of the yacht building (Part of the "plan") Why do we let the name of God in Canada become a complex that conceals Seattle? Not only am I crazy about this movie, I'm more embarrassed and shy. Australians turned out to be great things. We produced a piffle at an awesome rate. Gawd !!!!!
