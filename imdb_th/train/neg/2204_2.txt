I love sharks and mutations and explosions. In theory, when considering those parameters, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy is probably the best movie ever. <br /> <br /> It's not <br /> <br /> The monster looks like a villain from Power Rangers and has a movement of rubber around the same period. This may not matter if the manufacturer is not proud of the design as it should. That is to say for men in a large rubber suit in a flick / scifi / horror action figure that can benefit from some mystery. The shark gets many screen time. It's true that it is unstable and unpredictable. I guess you should assume that it is scary, even those who are crazy about camera. <br /> <br /> The camera will go to find someone to eat. The camera will go with the shark. The camera will return to find someone to eat. But now they scream and have no arms and so on. <br /> <br /> Costing is not good, bad performances and special sub-effects. But writing is the worst. Things happen completely randomly so people can eat more or have something that can explode. Because let me tell you, the person who created this movie came with more explosions = better ideas. The character shot the car and had a big explosion. They fired a helicopter with a big explosion. The stone barrels, trees, what they all explode, so scary sharks that even explode at the end It's hard to believe that everyone would think that trying to create half a giant shark to have sex with a woman in order to make a shark a freaky baby is a good idea. That is, except that the person is a mad scientist in this movie. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is that this movie is so random. (And sometimes boring) that even though badness is not enough to hold Long-lasting attention of people It may be a good thing for MST3K with your friends, but in the past, if you accidentally caught this bad boy, make yourself and change the channel.
