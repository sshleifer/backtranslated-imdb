* Spoiler and extreme beatings waiting ahead * <br /> <br /> When this program first started, I found it fun and enduring. Oddparents are quite cartoons that kids and adults like. In addition, there was a high rating with Spongebob, but it started to decline because of the following crap that Butch Hartman and his team pushed into the show. <br /> <br /> First of all, the humor in The bathroom is not a joke. You can pull out laughter quickly from the little ones with burp, but that's just the audience that will laugh at the ancient comedy. Next, there is a small joke. Haha. We can see people in their underwear and we can see people dressed up across lololol !!! I can't stop laughing at gay happiness like this! Someone help me too! But of course this show will not suck that bad thing if it is not a pattern. Do you see how the Australian team shows? They saw that they were nothing but a kangaroo that loved boomerang playing in the hot desert, but now ... why is the coup? Why does this list suck the most loud of all of them? ... Joke that is over used !!! The show has caused a lot of jokes (mostly jokes). Think of it as the greatest thing ever! Cosmo is mostly to blame. I hate the way they talk about "Super Toilet" (which also has a blend of kiddish humor in it as well) and Cosmo is surprised and anyone will forget that the dumb battery ram is a joke that every goddamn parent in Dimmsdale Will be used in one email Do you know that all the parents (Ignoring other parents saying) will say the same sentence before breaking into the children's room? Yes, it may be a first class humor for some people. But it is true for others. <br /> <br /> If I'm not mistaken, I believe Butch Hartman says something about finishing the program. thanks to God! Everyone around my area said that it was the funniest jukebox show ever. I disagree with it? I think it is just another pony that we go to our cartoon station every day.
