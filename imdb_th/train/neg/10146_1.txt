'Flight Of Fury' is a scary movie. But the most scary for boring action movies - I didn't expect much from the Seagal movie. All I expected was moderate entertainment for 90 minutes or more. Even with low expectations, the action scenes are not far away. (Which is not entirely relevant in this film) is complicated and unnecessary, with confusion with large holes throughout the show being truly ridiculous And his whispers, the best facial expressions among those who voted 3rd - I thought it was hard to believe that something close to $ 12M was spent on this ruffled mess unless That $ 11M from 12 is Seagal's salary. One interesting moment for straight men or gay girls is that there are two hot chicks that end up in a complete lesbian sex scene with ba big ps on display, besides that - is a common thing that is not different from many people.
