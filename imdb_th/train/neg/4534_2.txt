The book that this movie was created from changed my life seriously. But to say that this movie is a disappointment is to say less The acting, directing the film and the stories are scary. I will not recommend this movie to anyone. I have told many people about this book. But now tell them all that they shouldn't watch the movie for sure! I did not expect that the plot would definitely follow the book. But they have released too many key elements of the book Movie trying But failed to deliver a powerful and inspirational message and reduce the importance of the main theme of the prophecy only While keeping myself in a position that did not read this book, I saw Celestine's prophecy as a bunch of hoaxy B.S. I was very disappointed with Redfield.
