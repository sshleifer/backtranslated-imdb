After seeing the poster from the Smother movie, I knew that I was going to live one life in an unbearable movie experience that made me want to take my eyes away. However, I felt a bit optimistic because the film had a strong actor Which I think it Going to help this movie, unfortunately, didn't happen again. She's a scary movie. But it is not likely to be executed. This is the best thing I can say about this story. <br /> <br /> The screenplay from Smother (written by the same person from License to Wed, what explains what they have But the talent for writing a movie) is full of cheap humor and serious guesses. I don't even laugh at one time watching this movie. Wasted after the large amount of waste she was involved in (Such as vicious and scary because I say so) Some people may think that the career from Diane Keaton goes off. However, it is impossible for me to forget the great performances she has brought in previo. Decades in movies like Annie Hall or Baby Boom in Smother. She takes all her effort to perform. But her character wrote horribly until she couldn't do anything about it. Shepard impressed me with his strength. Acting in the movie Baby Mama and Idiocracy. However, he does what he can with his character. Mike White also tries very well. But he didn't go far, he was a very talented script writer, such as The Good Girl and School of Rock), so I wanted to see that he was one of the writers of this film instead of only in this film. Liv Tyler suffers from the previous situation of the actors mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> The worst failure from Smother is boredom and not watching the screenplay of it. There is nothing more than compiling the compulsory scenes and situations that we have seen in sitcoms far from this comedy.
