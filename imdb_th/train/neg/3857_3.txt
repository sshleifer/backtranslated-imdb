I hope this movie will be mildly entertaining as well as other types of movies. However, it is lame and I just don't find myself laughing a lot. Watching on HBO may or if you have a free rent to lose and you want a movie. To pass the time But I do not recommend paying to see it. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and straightforward and can be funny if the script is better. Jason Lee can be hilarious and he laughs here and there, but the movie is flat. Don't just watch this one. The director lacks clarity. But what is directed is not important. I guess the main drawback is that it's not very funny. See other things. Don't waste time here.
