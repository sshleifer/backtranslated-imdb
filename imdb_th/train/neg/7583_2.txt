The worst movie of David Lean, even 'what we serve' is not that bad. Usually, movies that have a good reputation, like this movie, have the ability to exchange, at least to understand why it is classic. But after watching this, I couldn't understand why this shit was so popular even in 1945! I do not like the strong British posture, featuring scripts. (Which may have flair sometimes Elvira's character is attractive and attractive. But in reality it's ugly and strange and annoying, another story that makes me not trust in the movie's reputation. Another too classic 'Classic English'
