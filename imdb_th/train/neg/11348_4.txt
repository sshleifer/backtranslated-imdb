Six GIs are going to be sent home and fired and then join the Asian Cult Conference. Surrounded by a cloth-covered figure, two male dancers pretend to fight The back of them on the altar, the basket is opened and the body is drawn and started to imitate the snake. Imitation snakes are worn in thin stockings that look thin. (This is definitely a female imitation snake.) Cult members who secretly enter secret meetings have repeatedly warned six men that the ceremony must not be interrupted and, of course, must not be photographed. Otherwise, they will be followed. Hunt down and kill naturally. GIs take a flash shot, sending members of the hysteria to anger, stealing a basket with a "snake" and running away with it in the night of Asia. <br /> <br /> One of them. The most disgusting and miserable was the death of a cobra biting on the neck, although no one could explain how the snake came into the hospital's room. <br /> <br /> Go back to New York. Looks like the old news. Men settle in civilian life, still maintain mutual ties. Their work ranges from bowling managers (David Janssen) to graduate research students (Richard Long), James Dobson, Jack Kelly and Marshall Thompson as part of the Richard Long neighborhood. Good Kelly is a rather careless buck. But they all get together well enough and everyone looks happy. <br /> <br /> Then the mysterious and mysterious woman (Faith Domergue) appears and Marshall Thompson Like her. <br /> <br /> Guess what happened? The first Jansen was scared by the shadow in the back seat and died when the car crashed. Then Kelly will receive a visit from Domergue. Some things make him so scared that he fell through the window and died in the fall to the sidewalk. Try and Dobson began to wonder what the audience already knew - Domain School was involved in death. They also think that she may become a cobra, which is the case. Dobson confronted her with suspicion and she proved his point. <br /> <br /> Now, try and Thompson is extremely confused, especially Thompson, who loves Domergue and finds That she attracts him as well Although he had to explain to her what "love" was, it was not a final reckless attack by a Cobra woman and Long's friend - not one of the six original offenders - and Thompson had to throw a snake outside the window. On the sidewalk below, the body will turn into Domergue. Finally, <br /> <br /> I think I will skip most questions that are plotted. I will mention one of the more ordinary people in passing. Who paid the fare of Domergue from somewhere in Asia to New York? Who pays for utilities in the hotel? Who paid with her beautiful wardrobe Why do you speak American English well? What happen? Writers and directors have clearly seen Val Lewton's modest horror film, and although it didn't take much effort to produce, they have unscrupulous stealing from Lewton. For example, in Lewton's "The Cat People", the woman was transformed into a black leopard. But with a few exceptions, this threat is always kept in the shadows. Most changes here also use shadows as well. But unlike Lewton, that shadow is clumsy and not vague. <br /> <br /> Lewton occasionally uses what he calls "buses" with Lewton's first "bus" as a real car. Those who may be victims are rushing through the dark tunnels of Central Park with only one footstep. There is something or some people follow you She stopped with shock under the street lamp. There is something that makes the branches of the bush above her. She looks higher. The loud screaming loudly makes your hair stand at the end. It's a bus that uses air brakes to stop her. Manufacturers use at least two "buses" in this movie. For example, a man is distracting across the intersection and the loud noise of a truck that almost hit him. No shooting settings It's attached to the shoe horn. <br /> <br /> I don't care about movies that extend the life of the snake's style, which is slippery, ugly, ugly, and is a penis. As a matter of fact, there are no snakes that are slippery, most are not dangerous, and most are especially beautiful. In addition, they are more women than men in their tricky movements and the way they wind up towards their goals. Do you want reptilian symbols for masculinity? Try using six racers. It's a really fast lizard. When it sees something to eat, it will rush and swallow it. <br /> <br /> However, if you want to watch horror movies with a low budget, don't worry about this. Find "The Cat People" or One of Lewton's sub masterpieces, which is an obvious copy
