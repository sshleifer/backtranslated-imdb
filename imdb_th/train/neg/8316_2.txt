Cedric Kahn's movie looks like a character instead of an action (I think of L'Ennui and Feux rouges), so it's funny to see the chase of experts in this series interspersed with attempts. I didn't find Stefano Cassetti to be an interesting actor. He reminded me of a professional athlete who haunts movies like Bret Favre, staring empty, looking like a really fierce deer attached to the headlights. The true actors will force us to reflect the personality of Succo rather than admiring his abilities at carjacking. <br /> <br /> Most little performances come from Isild le Besco while the poor students of Succo. Faced with a storm The interview at the police office is a formidable miracle with a little fear about the future that was mixed together. Le Besco separated, there was little to introduce this movie.
