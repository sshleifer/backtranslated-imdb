I bet that Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they were willing to appear in. Now, Gene doesn't plan to change to play the ladies team and big pussy? What the hell is "Look at me, I'm a rat!" Shit. Second episode? All the clich√© mafia banter-come! The big names that voted out had just received their money for charity. Hmm ... This is not true. But it's the scene that shows! Other items of Mark Burnett "The Survivor" also asked me when Johnny Fairplay displayed his departure process when he clearly saw a short time before his child was born. <br /> <br / >
