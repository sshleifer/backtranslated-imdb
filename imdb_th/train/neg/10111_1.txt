Scary performances, bad stories, magic makeup and this is just a small part of the iceberg. I have never seen a movie that is worse than before. In 5 minutes, I decided to move fast to see if there was anything to be exchanged or not ... (in addition to a good shock) This movie was filmed in some furniture warehouses and the same warehouse used for at least 90% of the scene. You can also see the same red chair in many different "places". At least rent an office and apartment building, not a warehouse that will reflect all of your actors' responses. (Note to manufacturers) Small office space and apartments for one month is cheaper. Both warehouses and both are quite diverse and more reliable) If you use this money for rent, I hope you get it with a guaranteed return ... will be called Your money ... I only spent $ 2.99 to rent tonight and I felt robbed.
