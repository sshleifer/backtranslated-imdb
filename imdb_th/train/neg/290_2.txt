The movie Tomato Killer has this special humor - you love or hate it. I like it personally But in the fourth movie, that feeling has disappeared. Tomatoes are not the same. The jokes and even the actors are not funny. Because that's the only thing that this type of movie should be - funny. <br /> <br /> So, now after following the laughing plan They should not do the fourth episode in the tomato killer trilogy.
