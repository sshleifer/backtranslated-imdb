I look forward to watching this movie. It's a good family movie. However, if the editor of Michael Landon Jr. works better in editing the movie, it will be much better There are too many contexts. I hope to have another movie from the series. They are all very good. But if someone else does, I ask them to take care of the correction. This story takes place all over the place and seems to have no center. Which is unfortunate because other films in the series are excellent I enjoy the stories of Willie and Missy; They are both good examples. In addition, the romantic side of the audience often enjoy a good love story.
