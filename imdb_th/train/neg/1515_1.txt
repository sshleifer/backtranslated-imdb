I watched the movie "The Flock" because of the selection of Gere and Danes and because of the short story sounds interesting. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. (And I've seen turkeys before) I never posted online before But this movie is very bad, I have to do I think the problem begins with an unbelievable script. This story is unreasonable and the conversation is repetitive. It's disgusting. Poor gear he deserves a lot better for Gere / Danes on the friendship screen due to scary writing. No one believes both characters in a single minute I would bet that Gere hoped that he would buy back the negative. It's a shame to see a lot of lost talent, not to mention I hope I get 2 hours back (I know what you're thinking. How do I feel?)
