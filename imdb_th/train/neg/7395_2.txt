As far as I can understand, TIW WATCHER is the first work of a young director. My doubts are if this is the work of a normal person who happens to love movies, or if this is the work of a film student because of the reference to the Oporto School of Arts on the final credit. <br /> <br /> However, those who Directed by Ricardo Pinho, showing the film without realizing some basic concepts about movies. What is a movie How to tell the story It is not important for novice directors. One of the first things you learn in school when you are studying movies is how to tell stories. You learn that, like in a movie novel, you should create your story in three actions: introduction, development and conclusion. You learn that your story should have a protagonist and an enemy and should have a climax. You learn this right for 3 epic hours for regular movies, for short movies, and even believe it or not for 30 seconds of advertising. You also learn that the level of ingenuity in approaching the study structure and ultimately You can distinguish <br /> <br /> in rough terms. TIM WATCHER introduces us to the main characters. The movie ends. - All movies sound like the introduction of characters in Jeunet's AMÃ‰L. IE There are no second or third actions in the TIM WATCHER. This is not a parody or an art movie, so you cannot prove disrespect for the academic structure. You expect to receive a storytelling and it will not happen. The worst, TIM WATCHER defines itself as a warning; And another one that has no real purpose It doesn't create points or at least not the correct point. The issue is children with vengeance. The situation that is shown is the most simple and the way it is Manichaean. <br /> <br /> I expect more from this short story. This film is released with a credit rating that is quite good-looking and you quickly realize that you are accepting something that has a better production value than a typical Portuguese short film. I don't know the budget for this movie. But judging for the program, thank you in the end credits for making merit, have to go to the production team for a good connection in a country that is difficult to open the door for new filmmakers.> <br /> TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise. In style, color and carefully selected plans plus good scores That's all There is nothing else, no plot, and that is a shame because it feels like losing production. You can hardly see the diversity of such places in short Portuguese and there are many special things to add to the story. <br /> <br /> That is ridiculous. When comparing, may sound like I have to reference BMW shorts as Good example How can you tell a good story in a short film that has serious conditions for placing products and movies with superior style?
