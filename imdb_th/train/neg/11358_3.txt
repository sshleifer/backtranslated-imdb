When I saw this example on TV, I was surprised. In May of 2008, I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and this was an interesting 4-dimensional show (you know the place where the seat was moving). Rebuilt to add motion effects It's a cute movie ... but it's like that. It is to educate and tell about the first mission. But the end of the CGI spacewalk seems ... I'm not a big fan of this movie. But I would like to recommend this movie for parents who want to inform their children to have fun with Moonwalk for the first time. I will say that the characters that are chosen very well and the characters themselves are cute. So all I would say if you want to take a younger child ... go to find it, but if you want to take the older kids to take them to see other movies ... they will thank
