The real head scratcher of the movie by Bill Rebane that seemed to be worse in his trade throughout the eighty. Three robbery millionaires invited nine people to a remote hotel to compete in the last person contest that the last contestant would receive $ 1 million, which he or she had done so far. There are some pranks of guests while others participate in what most adults do in situations that are satisfied at the hotel bar. Most scenes are just an excuse to focus the camera on different parts of the female body, including the crossover dance that is American Bandstand. Meet the elderly aerobics with hookers. If there is any hesitation, white people Can't dance this scene, nailing the last nail in that coffin Watch the nipple slip closely. This continued for about forty-five minutes until Bill Rebane began throwing darts at various plot points and what he had received would become an inspiration for the next scene, causing this scene to be messy. It's a game until it's not a game. Three old coots are in complete control until they don't. The hotel was occupied by supernatural powers until it became just a props. They will die until they are not. Even the narrator at the end responded that he didn't know what had happened. I challenged who gave what the Rebane was doing. The performance is the ability to perform in the theater. Most actors may go back to work at Stuckey's local day. I rate the scene where Yupee opens the closet and the skeleton inside the skull. Try Gone With the Wind. Do that! This collection of Chilling Classics is really a disaster. Toxic, get it! Like Rebane! I hate myself.
