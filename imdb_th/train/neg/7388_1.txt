drss1942 Really speaking words from my mouth I love Segal's early movies and felt like the only person who remained faithful to him. I just saw this movie (About 90% of the secrets went through, so I didn't see the end.) When I woke up and saw that I was on the DVD menu, I was grateful that I was no longer under the movie and didn't know what happened Up at the end There are some strange things about Segal's voice and others. Kinda reminds me of the original Mad Max that sounds dubbed. But in the same language (Australlian is English, right? :) However, if I have a 10 inch thumb, they will point to this injustice of Segal.
