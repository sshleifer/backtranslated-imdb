If so, start from here. Straightheads Present me with a little dilemma If this film came out of Italy in 1975, directed by Ruggero Deodatto and starring David Hesse, then I would beat it faster than Labrador who drank water on a hot summer day. Because while Tarantino and Rodriguez were busy elsewhere with respect for the theater, Dan Dan produced his own rape / revenge image in England and seemed like a budget that would make Ricardo Chat changed the Rose McGowan machine gun, because if you want to play bingo grindhouse, then let me call 'number': <br /> <br /> 1 The rich and tall girl flying can find roughness. From the side of the track In an unbelievable manner, and on the other hand, he was incredibly popular. Check out <br /> <br /> 2 Pornography of such high-flying professional women in many states of nudity. Check < br /> <br /> 3 The complex and extremely unlikely development that created the characters with Only in doing what they do and who can't imagine that there are any creatures outside the scene that they come to investigate. <br /> <br /> 4 unnecessary rape scenes Made by a group of men who have no visible personality or background other than rape. <br /> <br /> 5 brutal and bloody scenes of murder and vengeance go to Bingo! <br /> <br /> Frankly Straightheads It's basic: Dyer meets Anderson and invites him to a party at the country where her boss owns. On the way home, they killed three villagers in Landover, who avenged Dyer by wearing good shoes and raping Anderson. Both began to revenge on them until now. "Straw Dogs", "Late Night Trains", "House on the Edge of the Park", "I Spit On Grave" etc. etc. Why don't I think about this much? Several reasons: I think first of all, having people like Gillian Anderson in the Prima performance makes me expect better. But it is a complete lack of integrity here over the top. <br /> <br /> Because whenever anyone Sit down to see Hesse and his scary girl and kill their people. During the time of the 70s, they always knew what they were getting - a low budget limit designed to make Shocked and attracted attention, the baddies threatened and murdered various goods. Open the table on the baddies and kill them back and everyone returned home. Pleased with the desire to see the abominable violence destroyed and safe. The knowledge that the world order has been restored. <br /> <br /> As a writer and director Dan Reed clearly believes that Straightheads There is more to say than the status of the human mind, and try to absorb his film deeply with a philosophy that is not there. For example, when Anderson and Dyer are planning revenge on their attackers, they know that One of the rapists had a fourteen-year-old daughter who was also the object of sexual desire for the two men he hung with. Finally, when Anderson met him face-to-face, he confessed that he had raped her so distraught that his two friends would get the attention of his daughter !!! A comfortable and courageous way that Reed, this little revelation into the story, is something that happens when he expects that a simple reference about child pornography is enough to throw the moral compass of audiences Just sitting through something important To make sure that we 'get' at this point, we show clearly the second rape sequence, clearly from the perspective of the attacker and his concern for his daughter. But Reed is confident that we will get more shots Anderson managed roughly and was raped on her car hood. Not willing to go in. <br /> <br /> After receiving his reason for rape, Anderson tied him on the table and destroyed the end of the sniper rifle. (Finishing with a big cannon Not clear about the phallus) up his jackie But lack the courage to pull the trigger to tell Dyer (those who do not have such moral principles) that 'it is over.' Dyer argued otherwise and their moral dilemma was presented as something that Wittgen Stein and Russell may talk in their room in Cambridge on tea and cakes. It hardly refuses to make sense of its ridiculousness. <br /> <br /> In the fair, Ms Anderson shows her courage throughout the story. Obviously she wanted to leave Scully far and bless her. She did that; There is one thing that suspects Mulder will do from his former partner before squatting on the road to go outside the road. On the other hand, Dyer did what he did in every movie he did today - that is, playing with chappie, geek type, blimey gv blimey gv blimey guv cockny and a face that most people never get bored of. The true story, especially in the closing scenes, after killing his ruthless raiders, Dier stared at the camera for what I was sure to have as a look of anguish that invited us With the fate of the hand Deal with him and the moral uncertainty he must overcome. But instead of reminding Oliver Hardy to look at the camera angrily after Stan got him organized Which, incidentally, that the film's overall effect is quite good
