There are many things that are clear when watching this movie: 1) The performance is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so bad, but the conflict between parents and children occurs in opera. Two other boys: a crazy boy who is crazy and your stereotypical. I'm a baby. But I am a sensitive child. 2) The overall movie is depressing and frustrating. 3) The dream and the episode of Robbie are being disturbed. (Performed by Tom Hanks); 4) Combining love ballads, starting as a strange choice. ("We are all special friends"); 5) Strange lines and side plans are not better than scary performances and 5) This is a really bad movie. Expected to be disappointed - and may be disturbed
