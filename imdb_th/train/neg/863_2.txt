I got to know from watching the Euro horror movie, especially the movie created by Jets Franco, that you can't expect a reasonable story. However, Franco has gone to sea with this film. And despite the surreal atmosphere and reputation of the movie as one of the best directors - Succubus is a really scary movie. I have to admit that I saw the American version of Scream, which takes about 76 minutes, but if it's just a logical cut, I'm sure the longer European version is boring. The story relates to women traveling to practice S&M and talking about junk and it's really boring. There are no gaps and the sex is boring and most of the runtime is caused by boring dialogue and even though it is a short film. I have trouble making it to the end. I must say that the place looks good and Franco works well using his surreal atmosphere. But the positive elements will end there. Jess Franco is a talented director who makes classic junk movies - but it seems like it's something he has done for money and overall I recommend skipping it and watching the work. Interesting director
