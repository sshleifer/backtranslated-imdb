Charlotte's brutal beauty and kicks make the movie look more cool than ever before. The story is terrible and Charlotte's character dies in a stupid manner. You wonder if this is the episode. End they think I hope someone can tell that there are other options. But I am afraid that it will not For the rest of the cst well, I can say that they do not do very well. Although the offense is placed in a poor role, this movie reminds me of Zhang Ji Yi's Rush Hour 2 in a ridiculous way because she is the only one who stole the program during the entire movie I'll give this movie 2/5
