My sincere advice for everyone: Don't watch movies. <br /> <br /> Don't go near the cinema that is playing this movie. Even a glimpse of it is not good for serious health. There is no joke. It's 3:30 am in the morning and I come back from the worst movie in this universe. Four hours !!! I'm proud that I survived after all! If this is called survival. <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed. I was disappointed. It's a waste of time! Money goes in the drain! No plot. Hope tomorrow I will wake up and have no memory of tonight !! RUBBISH MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Happy Republic day for someone :)
