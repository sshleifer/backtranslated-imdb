Can anyone help please stop John Carpenter constantly and deliberately destroy his reputation? How low can you go? It seems that this man will lose respect for himself. <br /> <br /> Now it seems that it has been done by film students and it's not worth it to start talking about bad things because it's just Directed by someone who doesn't have the ability as a director or an inspiration ... <br /> <br /> Mr. Carpenter, please retire immediately with self-esteem and stop this kind of garbage. In a bad tradition from Escape from LA to Ghosts of Mars. <br /> <br /> Let Mau instead
