Remember the movies you've watched in the past that don't have an adult feeling? Happened to me when I returned to school .. National integration of Lamphun This movie has the perfect opportunity for laughing. But surprisingly aimlessly when we saw the strange collection of characters, such as women who sold her souls to the devil and could fire flames from her mouth, people who looked like vampires And a mad killer dressed as a woman and wearing a sack on his head You have a class president who believes he is the best thing since slicing bread. (But as we saw in the movie, he was a coward and a joke) Two smokers who didn't know they were in their own class and A man named Gary who knows that someone already knows (And no one can remember his name ... this is a joke that I like) has spoiled the plump that likes to grab a woman in an inappropriate place, a deaf and blind woman who has shouted when demanding her dog Singing and cooking (You know her from "goonies" and "throw mama from the train") who loves to put food on people's plates with her hands! This film is about a nutcase (or at least trying to) revenge on his classmates to gag them, pulling him. (They arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister!) The movie follows the character while they search for the canvas, the dark killer, the old high school corridor. His psychologist has been told of a strange-looking murderer. The film has good gags that can be used (very fast), but this movie gets worse every minute that passes. The real problem of this movie is not knowing where to go. This movie is a place, a joke for it has a direction that is not confident .. If it has any direction, the actors are enthusiastic enough. But the content that they will make funny is not quality that will attract attention It is a curia for fans of the early 80s comedy that has been forgotten (this is correct)
