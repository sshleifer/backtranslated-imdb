I am absolutely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is the worst movie I have ever seen. 2) Without a doubt it will not receive reviews additional Is on the list of the worst movies of all time - which it should be 3) I'm lucky - I paid five pounds for it. I saw it in stores for 15 pounds. Don't pay much for this movie! You will be very angry. 4) There are many movies in the horror genre that are not rated fairly. (In my opinion) and make the film have a higher rating than they are illegal The magical way that will appear to everyone like everyone else. Our cunning hero turns into a teenage girl and joins their gangs - sitting on a baby sitting swing. He killed them one by one until he was tracked and discovered by the police. <br /> <br /> Why is it so bad? Beginning with acting is very bad. Some people compare it to school production. No, this is worse than any performances I've seen on the school stage. <br /> <br /> I bought several movies that were banned earlier from the vipco DVD company and didn't disappoint as I was. Poor performance But this film failed to deliver in every area. What was the point in creating this movie when there wasn't even any blood! OK, there is no other movie blood like this offer. Can there be anything else? Breats? Not even with any excitement. <br /> <br /> It's true. This movie may have some charm in nature that is unique. Only one tenth
