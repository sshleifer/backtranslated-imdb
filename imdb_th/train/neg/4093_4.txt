The story and characters are ridiculous and have almost no features like AS "Story" and "Characters". The biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark, out of focus and blurry. The fact that Fulse filled the entire movie with fog didn't help anything. On the other hand, all things are completely strange and full of sex and violence. The inconsistency is quite fun. One of the main characters said that he had no friends. But he was bound to a new man in a few minutes on the screen and had a group of women Although he showed his anti-social trends by placing an arrow in the poor, b ***** d, who is interested in his business, blood or blood images get more attention than the characters. his But it's not stupid than the Zombie. It's worth the rental if you like blood-filled or hopeless Italian flicks about swords and magic or strange things. You sleep through someone who is sucked into a 2-foot hole from your head and shouts for help.
