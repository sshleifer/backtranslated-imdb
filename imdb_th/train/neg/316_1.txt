This movie is the worst movie ever created. If you have to make movies that are costly, people who play Lars in heavyweights than do not have to create damn movies. I must say that I can see the Leprechaun in space 6 times before I preview it for this film. Adam Sandler should be limited from any movie after this shame Watching this movie is like a mix between listening to Cher's music and willing to put your device in a blender. Anyone with half of the brain cells will know that this film is not worth it. If I have extra money and have to spend, I will give it to the Lorraina Bobbitt Foundation before buying this movie.
