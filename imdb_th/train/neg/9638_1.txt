"Boom" has garnered some reputation. With a large version of Taylor, Burton, Noelle Craven, Tennessee Williams and Joseph Logos, one might be tempted to think how bad it will be. It's worse than you can imagine. <br /> <br /> The sad and annoying truth of "Boom" is that it seems to signal the decline and fall of such a large model. It was only director Joseph Losey who had reduced the depth with "Modesty Blaise" and "Boom" (some people might want to add "Secret Ceremony") to revive and in 1970 created his best work "Go <br /> <br /> The most regrettable thing is the work of Tennesee Williams from the mid-fourth decade until the beginning of the sixties.

His best Williams is an actor's dream that gives many memorable performances. (Eva Gardner or Deborah Kerr used to be better in "Night of the Iguana"?), Especially Taylor. "Cat on a hot galvanized roof" and "Last summer, immediately". There is little story that John Gielgud should ask, Taylor. He will teach her to play Shakespeare, which he replies. "If you teach me to play Tennessee Williams" If Gielgud sees "Boom", he will probably hold his tongue. Taylor has never been worse than before. Even though her face is well photographed In addition, from physical deterioration from now on, she will lose credibility as an actress who has a role. (And worse) on her credit But the body of his work from this point onwards (1968) will have no meaning to say that at least <br /> <br /> Noel, cowardly, has stopped working for a long time in the theater at the theater in the living room. His was replaced by The likes of Williams and England "An angry young man" seems to be happy with camping. But almost no fun at all from people who claim to have special abilities. <br /> <br /> The only member who still maintains her dignity is Joanna Shimkus, who is a child a few years ago. Career screen that tends to become Mrs. Sidney Poitier. <br /> <br /> "Boom" reeks of release. It can't be controlled A rather sad pointer for a career that made more mistakes than the camp festivals that some people have suggested.
