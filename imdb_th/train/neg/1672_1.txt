This is the only movie I have ever seen that motivates me to write reviews on internet sites and that is an important statement from people who like "The Attack of the Monolith Monsters". danger For example, without sex and violence I believe this film is safe for children of all ages. This film is suitable for anyone who doesn't want to entertain, challenge or motivate in any way. Adults can easily follow sleep on the TV while the children watch this movie. Don't be surprised if you wake up to discover that the kids have turned off the TV and started the game board. As an adult who enjoys being entertained with happiness from everything from ordinary to miracle in realism, comedy and action, these things for adults reflect real life on earth and / or motivate. Imagine this film. Nothing is offered.
