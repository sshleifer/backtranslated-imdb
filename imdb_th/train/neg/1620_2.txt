This film has little to suggest, even though it is a dramatic scene, movies and the direction of wild animals, it is difficult to bring its weaknesses to comment crazy. However, it is precisely these things that make no satisfactory plot and the operation is very disappointing. <br /> <br /> I watched this with my children and no one in us. Impressed at this time Yes, great pictures, wide scenery, beautiful forests and mountains But what happened in the foreground? A rather tedious narrative about the stupidity of a tasteless girl who learns a basic lesson slowly about being friendly with wildlife - and goes out very easily because he is saved from that. Of course, it is not new. In fact, there is nothing new from the distance about how to tell and we have seen this before and certainly more by eloquently Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. <br /> <br /> Things The only thing that can be collected from this movie is the feeling of working with excellent lenses and light from the forest. The rest is a waste of time.
