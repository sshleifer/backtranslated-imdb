I bought this modification because I really liked Anne BrontÃ«'s novel. When I read it recently and often enjoyed the BBC drama especially, but I was very disappointed. I never thought it would be as bad as: The whole set made me laugh more than I felt like a novel. <br /> <br /> First of all, music (and music) seemed to go out of place entirely in the retro drama. (Sounded like it was written for contemporary horror movies) and like other critics, I was particularly annoyed when the camera rotated and revolved around the actors. I've seen some scenes filmed like that in "North and South" and all seem to be there, but in The Tenant it's too real and annoying. The movement of the camera cannot make the show lively. <br /> <br /> The second role is mostly difficult to differentiate at first and the script lacks clarity. No characters were introduced correctly at first. The little boy gives a very good performance. He is very cute and is the ultimate feature of the movie. <br /> <br /> Helen Graham's character spoiler. Tara Fitzgerald's character. She seems to be unable to cry in a realistic way. I can't believe that Markham would fall in love with her and I didn't mention the horrible hairstyle that she received. I can't help but feel sympathy for her husband! The fancy that has been married to virago ... In addition, he is also the only main actor who listened to me. Toby Stephens I found out that Helen Graham's brother wasn't good Novels that are related to bleak stories such as alcohol and cruelty In addition, what has been hinted only and from the reader's imagination in this book relies on acceptance in the adaptation of the TV: causing some scenes to be funny and amusing. (For example, when Huntingdon's eyes began to bleed) I mean, are we not enough of those bed scenes in contemporary drama?
