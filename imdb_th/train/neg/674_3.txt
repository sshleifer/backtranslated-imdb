It is known that I slept in the movie. But often due to the combination of things including being really tired, warm and comfortable in sett and eating only a lot However, on this occasion, I fell asleep because this movie was rubbish. Fixed plot development Slow and boring constantly, things seem to happen. But without explaining what makes them or why I agree that I might miss a part of the movie. But I watched most of the time and everything seemed to be due to my own consistency without having to worry about anything I can't recommend this movie at all.
