This is Peter Falk's movie. <br /> <br /> I'm 10 years old when this movie is released. I was a filmmaker at that time. Of course, my parents and I didn't see this movie when it came out. But I love the characters of the ads & the aura that it's an important movie. Okay, 34 years later I finally saw this movie - never seen the film directed by Cassavetes. He's a total hack. Do not waste time editing Gena's acting, which reminds me of Dustin Hoffman's excessive restrictions on "Rain Man": Technically, but always notes Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man". Falk received a cake for this movie /> <br /> I was really annoyed with Gena's performance - it seemed to be suitable for "Awakenings" (blecch!). It wasn't all her fault: she was the basket case from the first scene to the last We never know why? But the character of Falk seems to be true. & Was shown perfectly by Falk as a man with serious flaws. <br /> <br /> Shave at least an hour (Must have an editor)! Under the influence But it's easy. Cro-Magnon, who came to catch with a wife who didn't work But still can't handle her three children and her long working hours. <br /> <br /> I'm quite remembering Cassavetes for "The Dirty Dozen" or "Baby Rosemary's". He should be a good director. Than if he tends to exceed himself - as he shows enough to this movie <br /> <br /> Bob
