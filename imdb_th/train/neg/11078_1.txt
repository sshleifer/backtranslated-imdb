Where can I start ?! This is a low budget. HORRIBLY shows movies. It's great that we all explode with laughter, that it is totally moronic! The sword fight scene is not even a sword fight. They play with the plastic sword they bought at Wal-Mart and what they are doing is just lamenting to try to make them seem struggling. I and my family were in the mood of a really good action movie one day, so we decided to go to the store and look for one and that was The Sawtooth Island. I mean, it looks very good. But when we look at my house, died after the first scene, <br /> <br /> Oh and the plot of the film, storyboard, script and other junk that I didn't even know why the director and producer lost time. Do It !! But if you happen to stumble on this movie, don't get it !!!!!
