The symbol of the classic film is that it is like a good red wine. This movie is not Kakanet and of course no Casablanca. I agree with other critics that the children in this movie become unfortunate that now we have to sit in the computer and the conversation is full and preach. But we come to see the outdated themes of the movie. <br /> <br /> With the story of a history that has sixty years since Watch on the Rhine, the author Lillian Hellman has been revealed to be a copy of Bidenesque and The story called "Julia" in her real life from her book "Pentimento" as one of the most disgusting people of the Soviet Union's critics, which is very disgusting. At most, it was clear that her role in the movie theater, and is urging the United States to take action to preserve the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and the Communist International from fascism. Their military superiority in Spain <br /> <br /> As one reviewer correctly stated, this is not an American play and the movie because Lillian went to the grave of communist communist people. Nasty American This film records the familiar stupidity of the intellectual class created from American Left. At that time, Left Mooner on the left side of The Daily Kos and Michael Moore bought into conspiracy theories and provided help and comfort. To those who will destroy America
