This movie is just awesome. It's terrible that I have registered with IMDb to warn you of its dangers. <br /> <br /> I'm an expert on many famous horror movies. I watched "Redneck Zombies", "House of the Psychotic Women "," Slumber Party Massacre II "and many others. And I know that this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> Three-quarters of the film consists of people who are scared of running from one side of the screen to the other. When they are not running, they are spraying lines that are not in order without emotion or motivation. When the actors began to accept, the direction would fall into pieces. There were many shocking low-angle shots. I thought Leif Jonker had a 3 foot tripod. He used what I called "Leif Maneuver". Millions of times: that is, zooming out of interesting objects like an amateur Obviously, the film crew couldn't wake up early enough to shoot the sunrise, so they shot the sunset ... and played in the opposite. With this lazy direction, you will be impressed by the last scene that is full of blood. The only thing you can think of is the last five minutes, filming first eighty-five minutes. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie (bad), rent "Riki-Oh" or basic "Dead Alive . "If you are a person who likes schlock and is looking for a challenge to" Darkness "stop. <br /> <br /> Refer to the movie - Vampire / Vampire: It's time!
