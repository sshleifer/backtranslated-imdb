I try to really like this movie. It relates to important issues in any society: Sex addiction <br /> <br /> In this story, we learn that you can lose everything when you are sexually active. In this case, the main character and our hero who has sex with non-stop sex with all types of women (crazy, weird, neurotic) makes it vulnerable to marriage, work and even his life. Production is very bad Mostly shows Oh, you won't enjoy any sex scenes, most of it will do in a terrible taste, and you might think you're watching it at home. <br /> <br /> The two plot isn't feeling. How can such a wise and beautiful wife insist on the nasty things from her husband? How do you believe him! Three situations are worthless and will make you laugh for a while. <br /> <br /> The scene with the black theater administrator is pointless and will make you think "wtf?" <br /> <br /> Scenes like you can find a lot. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please avoid it. It's not a soft core, not a document. It's not an amazing feature. It is a formidable effort called the documentary director or whatever. <br /> <br /> Only Mrs. Kinski's legs are worth the watch. I caught it at HBO and I'm glad I didn't spend money on it, but 90 minutes of my life won't come back.
