Beyond the fact that the madman actually exists and has a religious fanatic on the outside. <br /> <br /> The characters are basically unreasonable. <br /> <br /> This movie has no point. Real start, middle or The ending and never explained much. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a young man with the unlikely name of Hazel Motes, who seems to be returning from detention. The army <br /> <br /> He drove to a two-story house with a very dilapidated window. He entered the house, walked around, and eventually wrote that he left there. This scene has nothing and we do not learn anything more about the house or its history. <br /> <br /> It was never explained exactly who was the home or where people disappeared. But we have been impressed by Hazel May be there once. <br /> <br /> Why does Hazel decide to go to the city? - We don't know. When he came to this city, he wrote the name & address he saw on the bathroom wall and visited this woman. Which is a surprisingly obese woman He saw her for a moment and apparently he didn't see her anymore. Like everything in this movie, it is worthless and has no purpose. <br /> <br /> A young man named Enoch tries to be friends with him. But Hazel is not interested. Br /> <br /> Enoch is crazy. One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of a cage in a chimpanzee and talk to them cynically. <br /> <br /> We never knew why Enoch worked like he did. As he made more than a reality, Hazel had an overdose of an old time, a horrible religious fundamentalist passing his grandfather. <br /> <br /> Enoch later became enthralled with the men dressed in Gorilla suit and manage to get the gorilla Suitable for him and running around it I was impressed that he tried to free himself from the infidelity of the religion that had been penetrated into him. <br /> <br /> He had a confrontation with his preacher and daughter many times, even though their interactions were Do not do anything special Point and without plot lines <br /> <br /> Eventually, Hazel let the religious heat end and hurt herself. <br /> <br /> It's a strange movie. Interesting in the matter of bizarre But other than that, nothing really happened. <br /> <br /> Actors get outstanding results. But this film has failed completely to give a perspective or story.> <br /> The film also has characters that revolve around N words occasionally without connecting to the rest of the conversation. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
