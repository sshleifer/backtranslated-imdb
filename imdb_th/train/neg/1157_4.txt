I ended up watching The Tenants with my close friends who rented movies based on the nature of Snoop Dogg (their fascinating amulet) on the cover. Understand I didn't expect much. I think this movie will include the behavior and images associated with Snoop Dogg that are often seen in clich√© rap videos. However, my general implications are largely wrong. Unfortunately, this didn't make the movie better. <br /> <br /> Most of the time it was explained that this movie was a serious drama that was dark while I explained that it was an amazing drama. Seriously bored This film tells the story of two struggling writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create a separate masterpiece. Their opposite lifestyle ends by creating a highly unlikely and complex friendship. This friendship moves throughout the film, such as the wild roller coaster - mostly from the Snoop character - reminiscent of someone who has a severely personality disorder. And even though this movie is a drama, but acting - which has a scary and serious tone - from snows and companies looks funny than anything else. <br /> <br /> I won't recommend this movie. For those who are interested Defective because there are many conversations and many other conversations after that. There is a slight conflict. But even if they are caught up in the conversation Finally jumped at me with a sudden surprise. It is a slightly distorted story that is unexpected and is the perfect way to combine movies that need to end. While watching the ending credits, I couldn't help thinking of the director thinking "Oh my God, how do I close this snooker?" By the way, the director carefully placed the planting instructions and subtleties that led to the climax - all of which are more visible than Waldo The crowded streets of the dwarves wore nothing but black.
