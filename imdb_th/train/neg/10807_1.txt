This film proved that we all know that professional basketball players suck everything apart from playing basketball. Especially rap and performances I can't begin to explain how bad this movie is. First of all, it's just me or the most ugly kid you've ever seen? I mean that his teeth can be used as a can opener. Second, why does the devil want to have a career in the music industry, even though he has magical powers? Third, I read the Bible. Never had a shape or pattern that said that Jesus created the devil Fourth, what is the deal with all the crappy effects? I can assure you that teenagers with acne problems with computers can produce better results. Fifth, why is the ending so badly sucked? And what is djin stark
