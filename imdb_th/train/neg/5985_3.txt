This movie is just a child against the devil. Thunderbird is just a hook for people to see. But almost a coincidence in use The fact that the actions that take place on Tracy Island are just a way to pull in public. It is interesting to know how filmmakers can see the future of London, how it is and how the world all together. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is some. As for the screenplay at Lady Penelope. These things provide a relief for those who expect to get a replay of the TV series. <br /> <br /> Have to say that it's over 90 minutes or more. In a 'fun' way Each may be worthwhile to watch.
