Been lurking for a few years or more I've never been moved to post here before, so maybe this movie might be worth it for that star. But i was wondering I just watched it on DVD without watching it in the movie due to illness and never went to watch it until now. I did not read extensively about this, of course, did not think about movies in some months. It is something that friends keep in the store, so it looks <br /> <br /> terrible mistakes. <br /> <br /> The pictures I mention in the top summary are in The trailer and on the poster from the right, Jason Statham has me, unlike GR's other movies or JS movies I've seen. At least not in the amount shown here and Ray Liotta in the pants should be warned in advance. It's scary and funny But not in a way that is haha, humor It's more in a way almost-office-but-slightly-mutated-and-so-failure of a sort of humor - they all say: "This movie is not like what you expect the movie. This story is going to be "<br /> <br /> Now, from the extensive movie viewing experience before, I expect this movie to be something like: <br /> <br /> () Connected, <br /> <br /> () interesting or <br /> <br /> () Not the perfection of the navel, <br /> <br /> () Some things are more important than novels that are unaware of what is just belief. According to the Eastern standards, the mystery that was composed "Modern art that is modern and self-aware" <<> <br /> () Hope to be better than "The Idiots" <br /> <br /> As you hear my voice, but it is: <br /> <br /> (x) Poorly modified {Going around the shop, jumping, jumping, style, 70s, amateur, high 8 people, "plot", "can not understand" sent through the past montages that Hackney I can go ...}, <br /> <br /> (x) Take a picture as if a 14-year-old German who is depressed, just spent a weekend to see Truffaut and Godard with a cloth covered. <br /> <br /> (x) So Depends on myself, "I'm really smart. I'm the" norm / message that feels committed. To repeat every 20 minutes to make sure that the fool (ie: everyone who doesn't like) in the audience makes sure they get points <br /> <br /> (x) Real time wasting <br /> <br /> For some of the undoubted abilities of "getting" something from now I'm glad you enjoyed it. One poster speaks of things that attract my attention: under 25 years of age may be better understood because the correction may be, but corrections should make your work more accessible, no less than in the "Genius" section. Only known by a group of enlightened people to suck onions and grow up There is nothing more formidable and self-serving than those who say that the reason others do not know that great art is because they do not understand the 'skill / material / cycle of the moon / fiber of the most rational mind'. The author / poet / artist / palm reader / idiot maniac 'used to describe' vision / project / unity with Gaea / the big bucket of sick dogs' <br /> <br /> For me and the The people More people, junk of it. <br /> <br /> Humans, art, stories, poetry, everything that is designed for others to see should be involved and moving. In some directions, whether it is a metaphorical, spiritual, emotional, or whatever you have, <br /> <br /> The only way this thing makes me move forward in two hours is near the inevitable death. Get my own "The greatest trick he has ever made is to make you believe that any part of this movie has any meaning." <br /> <br /> And now please give me bread and bread.
