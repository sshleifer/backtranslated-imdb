Just like last year, WWE New Years Revolution 2006 was said by competition to the screening room. The difference between last year and this year's competition is entertainment. In fact, only three people had the opportunity to come out of Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York with those WWE Championship champions. Currently, John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels have no way to Vinnie Mac to put the belt on rookie; Carlito or Chris Masters and Kane? Kane held the WWE Championship in June 1998 and that was just one night. Obviously he is not one. Last year's competition was exciting with the best WWE. The six programs that were presented for 2006 were predictable and disappointing. But still being a nightly competition. <br /> <br /> The only surprise of the night after the bell rang at the main event. Went out for a walk, Vince McMahon and asked them to lift the room Then it was announced that Edge had received money from his money in the bank championship match. With no time to prepare and leave after winning the competition, John Cena did not have the opportunity and left the position after the spear, one of the most entertaining heels in WWE. This is just part of the entertainment that has happened throughout. The whole night <br /> <br /> The last year was truly cruel. Triple H and The Big Show held a snoring festival that made me struggling to get closer. HHH chose to win. But that never really has a doubt, right? Any pay-per-view that includes both Jerry Lawler's wrestling and the same card will not be successful. (Who booked this?) And Bigwis tasted the defeat of Shelton Benjamin, who had lost little help from his mother. <br /> <br /> The woman of WWE has a busy night There is a regular Diva nonsense with Bra competitions and panties. The pants, which were won by Ashley and the women's champion, were in line. In the match, I thought I would be left to go to the match until WrestleMania 22. Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good match. Trish wins the race But it is clear that this is going to continue in the near future. <br /> <br /> The opening of the night pit race will soon become the WWE Champion Edge and Ric Flair Champion of this continent. Should be better But it was brutal and blood that was kept after the disqualification was completed Obviously, Edge has a bigger fish that can be fried. <br /> <br /> So the New Year's Revolution began in the pay-per-view calendar of 2006 in a disaster. The only good thing from knowing that for WWE, the only way to get up. They are not worse than this anymore.
