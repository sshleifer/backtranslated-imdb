This film failed to explore the humanity of animals that left me with an empty feeling inside. [Advance spoiler] I do not believe Dr. Well, there is a really interesting reason before agreeing to buy a big business to help his furry friend. While naive (traditional) tends to be very popular with the focus on the benefits of animals and humans, all animals in this movie are nothing more than caricatures that anyone Grinder (moreover, if anyone can understand their nonsense) without Eddie Murphy's strange behavior, this movie will be a failure.
