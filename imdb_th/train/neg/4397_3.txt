One of my sister's friends borrowed this game and it was too hard! It has the appearance of a game for children, but you have to learn many complicated movements that you have to twist and rotate your hand into all sorts of awkward positions. You have to find hidden puzzle pieces that are impossible to want you to do. Impossible! And me only up to three steps !!!!! Maybe if you don't have a life, you can stay at home anytime you may get pleasure from this. And it is not for children of course - they will pull their hair out in an hour!
