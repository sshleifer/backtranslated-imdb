I'm pretty sure this is the worst movie ever created. If you can't make a 13-year-old boy laugh with stupid humor, you should stop acting comedy forever. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers chose differently. This film is full of predictable jokes. (Some are racist) and funny jokes. In particular, memories are scenes in which doctors say that the characters lead the dead rabbit and his stomach. (As I wrote it, I can't believe that this is a real movie scene.) The man rushed to the rabbit to die on the doctor's table and tried to mouth ROTFLMAO! Not! The punch line that can tell you that the bad thing in this movie is "I know I should be on top." Hahaha.
