The late girl who witnessed the murder and became the next target of the killer Director Brian de Palma is here. Actually: His camera dives around a corner in the museum. (After mentioning for a long time over the monkey's drawings) divided into separate screens for sequential art (again in the split screen) in which the two characters are watching TV programs about transsexuals and entering his final scene (episode First) During a thunderstorm, "Dressed To Kill" is exhausted, mostly because it asks us to swallow a lot and not give much. Most performances (except Keith Gordon, who are still young) are common and the ending (second) is the last scene of De Carmel's "Carrie" - not to mention "Psycho". Explanations of dirty actions Playing like Hitchcock's spoof, not showing respect There is a style in a cold way. The result is clear half baking ** from ****
