Not good at all. The MooCow will accept the unbelievable truth: I like this. The price is a parody of 70 magic. The idea that a lot of tomato killers are destroying the US is a great idea. Good But there are horrifying strange images running from large tomatoes This movie, along with The Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the first attempts to spoof, which became popular in the 80s and 90s. Thank you very much to the plane! This one is very disgusting. Very bad. Many attempts about jokes are a depressing failure and will cause a lot of groaning. But thanks to the hungry tomatoes, "Nasty Puberty Love" and the terrifying helicopter crash Attack of the Killer Tomato gives some products But mostly for the wrong reason There are many things wrong with this movie ... and right, difficult to explain. A lot of people have to enjoy it with tomatoes, create 2 movies, Moore and the cartoon series !! Most of the time spent with tomatoes is rather boring. And digging the clothes in the 70s !!; = 8) This tomato has But seeds and magic But worth it to laugh or two; MooCow says grab pizza and pop in tomatoes !!: ??
