Anyone who posts a "good" message about this must be a friend of these people. This is a bad thing even on the wrestling field. In fact, this is not even a fight in the backyard. There are really a few people colliding on the trampoline. Each person weighs about 45 pounds and doesn't have an ounce of entertainment. It's just a little boy who is tired of telling bad names if possible. If you want to see entertaining backyard wrestling, try picking the Backyard Wrestling for Pleasure for Pain. It is the second biggest star in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition. They have really gone from the beginning and have trained professionally as a "real" professional wrestler. They go well and get better. I recommend checking 2 people. MDogg is crazy. So don't waste your time or pay your money on this crappy DVD. There is a "better" video there.
