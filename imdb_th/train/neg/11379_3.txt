When I saw a small scene for the first time in some announcements, I thought the show would be enjoyable. The little robot looks cute. The animation style is familiar with classic performances. Before the program aired, I studied through some sources. There I became a little disappointed. Three children (Tommy Gus and Lola) are properly voiced, but Robotboy is an exception. Would be better if he would be playing a young boy One good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from "What happened to Robot Jones?" The performance is not really bad. But Robotboy's improper display method is my only comment. So i didn't watch it very much
