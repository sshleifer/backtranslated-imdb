This animation came out of the dark dungeon of Full Moon Entertainment. This production company gained fame and fortune in the first half of 90 by producing horror and horror movies. The most famous disaster in their ouvre is "Subspecies", "Seedpeople" and "Trancers". It is not recommended to use these things and not Morrison. The director exaggerated the Charles Band to be a company that is suitable for his movie. Dr. Morrid is stupid and amazing and almost without humor. I saw only because it was the star Jeffrey Combs. I learned that it may have many disadvantages if you are his girlfriend. For every good movie, it seems that he will create a movie that is less than 5 stories. However, the story about the struggle between the two ancient wizards, one good person who has been here since 150 years to protect humans (Jeffrey as Dr. Mordrid) and another person called Kabal. He wants to destroy all forms of human life for some reason that I have forgotten. The honeycomb received advice from the counselor. "Man" has only one eye in space. That is wonderful! Every time while the light that is not seen will appear on the screen But that is about the only effect that this movie has. The whole thing is just whining and nagging, and when the two wizards face each other, it ends before you know ... I expect the evil wizard to fight at least but nooooooo .. .. in Some scenes can detect originality and creativity. (Eg Jeffrey's lecture example about the influence of the moon on criminals) and if you really care, you may find that there are some small aspects called Edgar Allen) but Overall, it wastes a lot of time and energy. I am a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe he is a superhero in my eyes ... but he is sure that there is no need to wear a silly Meijer.
