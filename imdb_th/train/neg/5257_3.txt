For horror movies created for TV, movies start from very interesting. I was fascinated by the story and mystery of this movie. But the ending was a total disappointment This film is moving fast and is creating it. It seems that it is over. But guess what is endless This movie ended after about an hour and a half. The audience wondered what had happened. Why are all unanswered questions in this movie not answered? There is no explanation of any important issues in the storyline. This movie is like watching a mysterious murder case and never knowing who is doing it. Very disappointed. at all The real bomb!
