The complaint is correct. For me, the biggest problem is that this TV drama is intended for women too. I was okay with the soap at night, like Gray Anatomy or Ugly Betty or the West Wing because it had an interesting story, even though it never ended. However, when this idea is similar to the daytime soap that aims to bring the tall man (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and rape and many difficult situations ... or Girls and Baywatch. That's what men want and they have. So if this is what women want, be it But the idea that this is a high eyebrow show (Or what men will see) is unrealistic
