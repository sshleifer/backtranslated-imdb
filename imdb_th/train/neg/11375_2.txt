Are you talking to me? (1987) It's a terrible movie starring a friend I haven't seen before or since being an actor from a neighborhood that is trying to be an actor. He had a lot of shouting for the taxi driver because he tried to use that shtick to make it big. When he learns the difficult truths of life, he does what others do to change his image! He went from a good friend to a friend surfing the night. His friends couldn't believe the change. (But he scores with Faith Ford and gets a great payout). Can this young punk maintain the credibility of the road while making it bigger? <br /> <br / > This is a really weak movie that tries too hard to combine many interesting ideas that are separated from each other due to poor work. Who knows, maybe someone will pick up the ball and run because the filmmaker fumbles the ball at this time. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time with this movie. If you don't want to see the hottest Faith Ford and the young Bubba from Forest Gump, <br /> <br /> xx
