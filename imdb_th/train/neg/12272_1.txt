In simple terms, this movie is the worst since "Police Academy: Mission to Moscow" (if you like this movie, you might like this movie) <br /> <br /> What are they thinking? Some ideas should be like that. The fact that this idea can be filmed should be a crime. <br /> <br /> The bad thing about this story, I heard that you asked one word ... Everything. <br /> <br /> Cost of employment: $ 4.50 Cost of viewing: 89 minutes <br /> <br /> I want both cash back!
