0.5 / 10 This movie has nothing good about it. The performance is one of the worst things I have ever seen. The really amazing thing is that everyone is scary, not just a few people here and everyone. The direction is funny, low budget, can see hopelessly, the score is very bad. It includes continuous killings, voodoo and silly tarot cards. Stupid. Stupid. Not scary at all. Special effects are completely hopeless. Not as good as laughing. The writing is horribly bad. The movie was cheap and sometimes very grainy and the camera work was terrifying. Once again, what this movie does in real terms is how all the actors are terrible.
