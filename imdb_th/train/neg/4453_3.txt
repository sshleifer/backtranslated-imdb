I'm sure there will be people watching this movement outside of Britian. This movie will be an entertaining watch. But for someone from the United Kingdom, it is painful for mistakes. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie Close the pipe at the bank station which has been dumped in the trash. He spoke to his sister that he found "What happened here" and she replied "Yesterday Tottenham is in town" !!! Tottenham is already in the city .. They are part of the city. They don't have to go there! And if Tottenham fans want to fight with other fans, the last place in the world they want to do is a bank station that may have more security cameras than anywhere else in the world. <br /> <br /> The mistake, but the biggest failure for me was the actor who played Hulikan. He made a clear decision that it was not worth trying to speak with the East End accent and chose Dick Van Dyke's style instead, which caused my ears to fall. It is highlighted by the fact that the rest of his gang all speak the way you expect West Ham fans to say. This error made him unbelievable in the role and made the movie lose.
