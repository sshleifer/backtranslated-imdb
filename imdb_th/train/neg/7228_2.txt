Advantages: <br /> <br /> Effective color tone Good outfit Top notch dress production The buildings and CGI vehicles that are well-detailed CGI shows look worse than video games a few years ago. Defective logic The giant pyramid appeared and no one was researching, no one even questioned it? And there is no explanation as to why Horus was driven out and there is no reason for him to do something that is not as important as the angry Jill. <br /> <br /> Hate: <br / > <br /> Great script Many unnecessary sub-plans that have too many concepts that are not fully realized. Sometimes the conversation is almost laughing. Random characters and unnecessary events Boring character Jill should be this puzzle. But apparently she was just a writer's mystery Nothing for you She looks boring and boring. She has no content, no texture. Her character has no redeeming feature. In fact, there is no one character in the entire film that has any purpose (other than the obvious Horus) and any motivation. They are weak and feel bad. There are no stakes - keys to writing. The screen of Horus will not become immortal. But the big deal, he's a bad guy. No one can decipher whether Horus or Jill is the main character. That is the problem: dedicating half of the movie to each character means that the writer has never fully explored one character. They are cardboard cut outs, those who walk around and talk and do nothing but explore beautiful parts. The first director walked slowly, slowly, slowly. I still watch movies as I write this. I can't care because it's boring. Everything is flat. Even the action is not interesting because it's short and sometimes unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Overall: <br /> <br /> Not worth the watch. Threadbare, sub character development, CGI, corny, did not save a good batch production
