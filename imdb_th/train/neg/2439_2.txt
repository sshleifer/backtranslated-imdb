"Intensive Care" by Dorna von Rouveroy is one of the worst horror films ever made, the dabbing of a very cheap Dutch makes a very ridiculous situation. The slow action and the climax is a joke. The famous surgeon has a car accident. He is in a coma for seven years and he wakes up and goes in a rampant blood. "Halloween" and "Friday the 13" series. Killing is funny and the conversation is very stupid. If you're in the right mood, you can make this junk look. You will laugh until Pain with this You believe me!
