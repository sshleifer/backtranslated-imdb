1st View 2/16/2002 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery ?? / Thriller with too many distorted plot Although there are many talented actors, this movie is too predictable. Films that are released to the public are not stupid and I hope not to replenish some stars over and over again, even though they are related. We think this movie will be about something with Connery's confidence towards punishing government agencies at first. But it turned out that there was nothing except the standard that was designed for the audience of this movie. We were drawn into every stupid character because it was transmitted to us when it was needed in the story and we were ready. Will finish this before it ends Yes, there are some good performances here, especially from Blair Underwood, Fishburn and Ed Harris in the role that supports the mind. But the story didn't work from the beginning to the end that was waiting for so long
