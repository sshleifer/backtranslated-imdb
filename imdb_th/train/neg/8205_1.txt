Terrible performances and stories that are very shallow Not even a good B-movie. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable events that people will be shocked like a ship that is boring and crippled. The worst sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw 5.0 stars and decided to watch since I liked the genre. <br /> <br /> There are many good movies in the story about aliens. I think because most of them are low budget. <br /> <br /> I give 3/10
