This film is a phoniness incarnate which corresponds to the 11/10 phoniness level, the distinctive accent and the tightness of the spandex cardigan pants. Just Yanks. Although true Scotland may have bright colors. But if you go there, don't expect to get many opportunities to "argue" with the local people. Also, do not try to induce local opinions through other tapdancing dance art. <br /> <br /> There are a few scenes of singing and dancing infecting the scene. But the scene is too long and is straight and Conversations are often too weak. I also wonder if everyone will be stuck in the 18th century Scottish village in the Boondocks area rather than being gay in New York City. Perhaps it is not a big sacrifice for that priest to leave Brigadoon or maybe he just tries to get rid of the hell from that garbage. <br /> <br /> Look at it for a realistic alternative perspective. The Christopher Stade Day Parade in Scotland will look like LSD. In addition, I would like to recommend to those who respect Hollywood.
