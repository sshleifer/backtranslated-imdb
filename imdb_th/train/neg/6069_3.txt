Never surprised me how you would be a great actor and make him lose in this movie. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time. But even if he can't record this movie In fact, his character is like he played in Cape Fear, which is really good, but I can't stand when the actors do the same thing more than one story. I believe it is old and this is the case here. <br /> <br /> There's nothing surprising in this movie. But then the story has been told a million times before Wesley Snipe is your general baseball player and his ideas show him in his style. But his role in this film is less than entertainment. <br /> <br /> However, since De Niro is in this movie that makes the draw if you're a fan) who sees everything he does, no matter how bad where But if you want to see De Niro the best, see "Midnight Run", "Goodfellas" or "Cop Land" or even go back and look. "Taxi driver" or "Godfather II". Don't waste time on this miracle. <br /> <br /> My score: 3/10
