This movie has no beginning or end. And it's really unbelievable. Mary-K and Ashley should be trained in the mail room for Italian fashion companies, but for some reason they were set up in a 5-star hotel (located across the street from the Coliseum) and All other internships that they work with seem to be an unusual example as it is. One thing that I found clearly in this film is the way that one of the twins didn't end up with men. I guess they try to twist their normal plan a little, try well.
