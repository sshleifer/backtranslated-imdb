Although the movies with Bruce Willis look attractive all the time But you should skip this matter I watched this program on television, so I didn't have to waste money. Luckily, <br /> <br /> The storyline develops very slowly, even though the first 30 minutes or more can be believed. But it is increasingly unbelievable. It is highly suspicious that if an experienced soldier like Al Walter would not obey the command directly And though he would, if his remaining categories would They know that they cause them to be in direct danger and they know that they will definitely die if they follow him. But what he is is our lieutenant, so do what he says. <br /> There are still some good scenes in this movie. They would rather help the village where the entire population was massacred by rebels. They helped a dozen or more villagers, the rest were killed. The strange thing is that they left the truck that the rebels left. They are quite on foot. It may be because the road is not safe. But no explanation so anyway. I think this is what makes this movie the only point I give. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie insult the brain and is unbelievable is complete because 7 soldiers can kill those. Many rebellions Being abused or killed Near the end, they released only a few companions. And that is only because they have to fight with nearly 500 or more soldiers Do you believe it? <br /> <br /> They fought with a large army, killing hundreds of them and releasing only a few people. And they have rounds and rounds of ammunition Never ran out of it Explosive mines and Claymore, M60 machine guns and even RPG games. Where did they get this? Carrying around or anything They also have laptops that show the activities of enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery that can be used for many days really? Who would think of this shit? <br /> <br /> I guess if you close your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a group of stupid people, you will rate this movie high. If not, skip this one. Help you save time
