Two years ago at the Berlin Film Festival, we watched the movie Amos Kollek "Sue" in the panoramic program along with the excellent Anna Thomson in the leadership section. It's a movie about loneliness and sex and one thing is compensated by another thing. In the same part of the festival, we now have to complain about the extravagant things of Su "surname du domaine de la lutte", which is now trying to convince us that loneliness and sex are not the only problems Unfortunately, we can't sympathize with "Our Hero" (the way he was called by the storyteller) because he was tired from the company and himself unnecessarily My own fault, I'm sorry I don't understand him Not enough. Writers / directors / actors want us to accept him, that is not the feeling of self-destruction or the sloth of his personality. What brought him But the society deteriorated and the image of sex Yes, have a deeper understanding of sexual relations But we will not follow him until now ... and the point is that there are signs of contemplation about the part he has for fate without sex Who hasn't yet noticed it is a rather depressing movie ... <br /> <br /> At first, there were some people who began to have accurate drafting situations. At the "Hero" bed shop, talking about obstacles in buying a new bed. Maybe it is too wide to get up the stairs. You have to stay home for half a day ... This is a joke about the characters who don't know how to live and the heart is in their hands. Don't follow this path. But dealt with his character in vain No one believes that "Our hero" can stimulate Tisseran to kill. Too boring, too kind-minded (not talking about Tisserand's complex. But of course, he shouldn't be a female murderer!) To finish: There are women and the world. It is not a device of modern sexual society. Help you as much as possible But do not follow the text and the "wisdom" of this movie, which declared bankruptcy on human relationships without having to confiscate the real conflict within
