Yes. Quite sure I saw this movie years ago when it was about Supremes. <br /> <br /> The reused story is popular in Hollywood style. And borrow scripts from movies that create the music industry. Br /> <br /> There's nothing here. <br /> <br /> Make-up, glamorous costumes and choreography = more money For drawing Beyonce that "has The car "hit wonder <br /> <br /> Like a gangster style, you should appreciate the real struggles. (Without digital sound and Hollywood realm) <br /> <br /> Beyonce's participation makes this solid waste.
