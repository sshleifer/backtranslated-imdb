1st View 11/7/2002 - 2 in 10 (Dir-John Bianco): A lovely gangster film about a family that is like a godfather in Brooklyn. The only thing that is interesting is trying to show that the feds are like gangs. This is the only attempt to create a good movie. The rest of the film is predictable and done correctly. The quality of shooting in certain scenes inside the bar and dirty joints makes you think that there is a problem with your DVD player. Due to the difference that is not good and some actors are hard to hear because of poor sound. Performing as a character to watch on your favorite gangster from better movies with repetitive names such as Vinnie `Knuckles 'and Jimmie` Tattoos'. So go and watch a better gangster movie before you take the money You go out
