How do I express my feelings to this movie: the most ugly? headache? Lack of consistent writing? Common stupidity? Try all of the above for this imitation. And that is in that direction. <br /> <br /> The story, right? I guess there is a story Two silly blondes looking for work after they crashed into the golf course. They mistakenly believe that 'The killer who gave the world' (innuendo) and 'mercenary' by 'mobsters'. Two of them thought "take him out", referring to the date and others that received the secondary actors she dreamed of. And of course, the turtle reserves for the turtles that they created with the prize money from the casino. <br /> <br /> Sounds like all this can be funny or not. Guess again. They try to make it funny. But not so The shooting sequence is not good. I've seen better filming in Hong Kong. The picture is the average for the late 80s movie, but the problem is that this movie is about 2007. <br /> <br /> Not worth the time I will see again. It still doesn't beat Danny Glover's "Out" movie from the early 80s, which is the worst movie of all time. But then again, that movie is at its own level "F"
