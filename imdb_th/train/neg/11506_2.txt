The story of this film is not good enough to happen in real life. I can't understand much when they show us this bad movie. I say it's not good because there are some reasons 1. If Madonna is rich and able to do everything she wants, why do you fall in love with that bad guy? 2. How can the story script be weak? She is very rich and can do everything she wants. But did not dare divorce with a husband that is not possible. <br /> <br /> Words that I love you
