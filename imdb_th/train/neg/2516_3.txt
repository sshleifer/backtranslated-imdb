Sadly, I don't remember this book anymore. But I remember that I was impressed with Edgar Wallace's story. This film shows the typical German production of low quality. It doesn't attract my attention - even if the story is good. But it was terrible At the center of adversity is a character that is completely exaggerated and exaggerated - they have no difference in their performance. Even the famous German actor and favorite Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Ar were unable to help this poor phenomenon. However, there is hope ... I was informed that the movie that follows this story is getting better. So in conclusion, I have to say that this movie does not deserve a movie screen But maybe enough for a lazy afternoon
