Watch this movie in my English class this afternoon and feel surprised with this bad version. Don't understand me wrong. George C. Scott is excellent as a Scrooge. But the remaining actors are not good Sometimes I can't stop laughing at stupid performances and the lines repeat: "Merry Christmas to everyone!" Sometimes I almost fall asleep. <br /> <br /> This film is made from Charles Dickens short story. About the rich who do not think Christmas will be anything but shame. After 30 minutes, the rich came to meet three spirits who persuaded him to celebrate Christmas. After all, <br /> <br /> I can't understand that the movie This machine has a bad script to write in five. Minutes can be rated well. Instead of suggesting this junk, I suggest you a comedy about Bill Murray Scrooged, at least funny ...
