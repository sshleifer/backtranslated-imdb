This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm not sure if it's serious or just words. One of those films that are stupid, everyone who doesn't like the old idea, they can think of defaulting. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is really good, but otherwise it sucks 10 years ago that I saw. But still hurts and will not stop my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line in the movie concludes how stupid it is. I will not destroy it for you if you want to tempt the fate by watching this movie. But I guarantee you for a moment * nghya * at the end and a few more If you have nothing to do better and you like to point and laugh, then maybe it's worth while you. In addition, if you are forced to date someone you don't really like, recommend watching this movie together and they may leave you alone after they see it. That's a fair price that I have to pay.
