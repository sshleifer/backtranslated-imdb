This is the story of a young woman who was tempted and left her older lover after her pregnancy. She avenged herself with him and everyone in his family with black magic? Which is disappointing, she didn't do it herself But others have done for you Good production value for the Thai horror flick. But the gentle script never created doubts, the director approached all the content conventionally and the final action made the audience sympathize with the victims by using logic in the wind. At one point, the characters had an important opportunity to shoot the dead villain and she got up and ran away without picking up a gun. You are immersed in it! <br /> <br /> Some of the strongest blood effects, including the deadly, deadly baby bodies and another man who is dying from the hundreds of eels coming out of the stomach. Recommended only for the surfers who have to watch all the horror films produced in Asia in the last 15 years.
