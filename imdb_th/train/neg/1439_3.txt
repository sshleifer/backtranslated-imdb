I only give 3 stars for beautiful African pictures. The rest is ... very boring. About 50 minutes. We have the plot of the plot ... In the war of the world, the introductory part must remain. Oh, about 10 minutes? Then it was real action! Here's what: "Try walking in the savannah and gaping at the beautiful sunset!" And may send messages like "Don't kill elephants!" Very ecological. I expect from the new movie "Steven Segal", not from this story ... The lead actor makes me miss Suntan, too much hair dye and foundation! And I didn't see one scene where her hair was messy or sweating or her clothes were dusty She doesn't look like a woman in the 19th century! And in the bar where they searched for our heroes, Swayze commented on the commander that he looked like Dracula Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896 and became known in the following years. Stone and other explorers traveled to the central part of Africa from 1840 to 1880, so if that action took place between 1896 and 1900, we had a problem :) Swayze made a good impression .. It was difficult - Outside, hard but soft and cuddly inside Not that I would hug with beans. But you understand He handled the puppy that was hit on his face many times. The movie has a foul odor. Too long and more boring, don't watch it! Do not buy it! It's a waste of your money!
