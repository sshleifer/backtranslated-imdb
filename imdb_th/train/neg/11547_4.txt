What is this sh * t? Power Rangers vs Freddy? It can be viewed and as good as the first movie in the first place. But from the part that the protagonists have received the magical power of their dreams, this sh * t should be rated PG or PG-13 more than R. I expect to see very mature content. The rest is for small children. In addition, it focuses on Christianity too. I know Freddy's devil, but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons. Why is it always Christian? This is all Oriental and full of white people / Westerners who are superior. Do not watch this show for small children who love power rangers.
