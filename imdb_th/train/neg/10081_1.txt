I have read some comments about this movie and can predict that some people are easily entertained. What is this movie It is poorly written, directed, and performed almost without making an impression. The characters speak in a bored conversation and the situation is not completely reliable. While this may not be lively and fun, because everything is not lively, this movie is boring. As if Lee Rose decided to write a drama about women struggling about sex But she was not allowed by the studio executives to tell the true story of the delectable gusto This film can go in the encyclopedia as a TV movie.
