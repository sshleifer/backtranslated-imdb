I remember going to the movies during the summer of '78 with my parents. Of course, at that time I was seven years old. <br /> <br /> Before the movie Jackson came out, my wife and I rented this movie because she had never seen it before and I felt a nostalgia. < br /> <br >> Ralph Bakshi doesn't have money to do animation for this movie and is forced to cut a lot of angles in creating this movie. Because this film is made with a rotation around the main animation creation techniques for those with limited budgets, this is to say something. This movie is mostly an animation only in terms of words. There are some scenes that clearly show that only the person standing in the screen may have overlapping animation effects. <br /> <br /> Due to movie budget constraints - compression of "Fellowship of the Rings" and part of "The Two Towers" - more separated What you get is like the Cliff Cliff version of this book. <br /> <br /> It's not bad, even though the animation brings warmth to me. I found that Jackson lacked the movie. It's good to imagine. What will it be like the proper fundraising? <br /> <br /> This film is worth noting that there is a sequel that has never been. Many years later, this special TV program for half an hour and a half has already been broadcast. All I will say about this is that it is a musical.
