This movie started funny. But quickly deteriorated I think it will be the humor that 'More mature', depending on the first period, but then the movie turns into a mode created for Disney Channel, especially the incredibly long kart racing scene. There is a fake Italian accent. This movie looks and sounds independent and has a low budget. There was a very lovely time when I called the peaceful scene. But overall, this scene is a yawn scene. The laughter is very small and far apart. The surprise at the end of "Mr. Fix It" is so ridiculous that I am more angry than anything else. Might be worth watching if you can catch free or TV But don't waste money on buying or renting this movie.
