This is about the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie matches the quality of the movie, such as "THEY" and "Cabin Fever". However, even though they have an actor named "The Eye Candy" of this movie, it seems to be 50 women with a face lift. not good (It's just an example of quality) I will give this movie a negative rating if possible. Ladies, I have to tell you that men are not bad to watch. But not too much If you plan to watch this movie, I highly recommend you to save money.
