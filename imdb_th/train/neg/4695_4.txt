I used to watch this movie a few times and never thought it would be funny. But still fun to watch and good for a moment of laughs. <br /> <br /> It's about women who work in the company and their boss is Jerk and they end up giving him a taste of his medicine and trying to get the respect they deserve. <br /> <br /> The performance is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of the 80's stars that Playing as a bad guy is not really bad, like no other. Dolly Martin is cute and fun to watch the comedy, and she in the south is bright. Jane Fonda is so good. For me, Lily Tomlin is the best thing about the movie. She has the funniest chapter and makes me laugh out loud many times. Must love you. <br /> <br /> I can recommend this to anyone who likes comedy. 80s. I like movies, but there is something about With this matter that I am not the It was a great start and had a good circulation and then everything started immediately together and made me less caring for the characters. They all have a little imagination about what they want to do, the boss, and even though 'cute', I just think it will slow down the flow of the movie. When the movie continues, picks up again and the most fun thing happens, then again, only slow down to conclude in a way that is too fast to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 Stars, but let's see if you haven't seen it yet. I think it depends on the mood of the person.
