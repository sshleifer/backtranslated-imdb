This film is heavily destroyed by Steven Seagal's presence or as I should say Steven So-dull! Previously, Seagal was too good or too stupid to dub his own line, leaving someone to imitate his voice for the sound that the sound needs to be repeated. A few stories earlier that he did this But I don't think so! In fact, this movie looks very good. The screenplay can be used in some parts. But some parts of this movie look like real movies! Of course, every story says that this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> It would be better if there is no Seagal that becomes your own cartoon. Don't bother. There is nothing more than a buck for this one too! I honestly think that this is the last time I and Seagal's film. How long did it take me to realize this!
