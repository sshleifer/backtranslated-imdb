I read "Lorna Doone" for the first time about 20 years ago and really like it! It is a classic historical romance set in the 1600s when Western countries traveled for many days from London and the law. Sadly, this book uses a lot of freedom and disappointed with my incredible ideas. The performance and production cost is ok. But the way in which the story is messy is terrifying. Why does television adaptation do this? Why do they think that thousands of book fans want them to change the story ??? One of the great mysteries of life !!! BBC made great news which aired on Christmas in the early 1990s, which I still tried to follow the copy! Use my advice to read books and don't worry about the little version!
