"The victory of love" cannot overcome everything. It was a 4 hour hard suffering. Actually, it took less than 2 hours. It seemed a lot longer. It made me think of the unskilled performances of great actors such as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. Players who don't support are quite scary. Sometimes they try to be above the highest level in order to be a clown. But if so, I didn't see that. Mira Sorvino didn't make any impression. She (he) was there. My guess is to play the same name written by Marivaux about 270 years ago. Much It will not be worse than this. Clare Peploe, the writer and director of the film, was inspired by the production of the latest drama. I don't know what she thinks when she creates this bomb. <br /> <br /> Maybe it will disappear in translation.
