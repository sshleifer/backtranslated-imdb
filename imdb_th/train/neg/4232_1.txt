Carl Jr. and his father are working as soldiers on a remote island. They captured three men who stumbled on the island. soon later (Good survivors) This person has blood, does not stop stabbing and killing, which is good if there is a real thing that is far away or if the production doesn't look like it was created with a 1 week lunch fee. That might be just a couple of days worth it.) Scary voice dubbing doesn't bother me a lot, and I wonder if I'm really drunk. Some people may have a little bit of humor ... but as it's just 78. The movie still feels too long .. Oh, I don't know ... 78 minutes. Don't waste time. <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <br /> Special DVD: Movie bonus: " Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence "; And the movie trailer of Shock-o-Rama released
