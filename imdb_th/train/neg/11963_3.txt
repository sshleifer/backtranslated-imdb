I like Billy Crystal and I think it would be fun to watch this movie because I know he admires Alan King and they will joke together. I think I've watched all of Billy's movies. But can't remember now and now i know why It is full of clich√© and fake emotions; You can smell each scene that is coming (and go!) Billy is not often funny. He was busy trying to cry, tears, disguise or show anger that his father had disappointed him. Alan King is quite a favorite as well as a special subplot in the movie. But it was a coincidence that Billy had just happened to visit his father, as well as a major health crisis that occurred, etc. When the end came to the boys, it would come quickly! As if the author knew that they painted themselves in one corner and the only solution was to make a dead scene Mostly disappointed with a glimmer of good mood.
