I won't spend too much time here just wanting to state that Darkman 3 is awesome. I have all 3 on DVDs. Add these things to my DVD movie set. Darkman ranks with the best things like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars , Die hard. You will get points There are not many good horror movies. Thank you very much for the whole team and setting up for the dark spiderman trilogy. If you wonder how I found this DVD I bought it through the internet. It is the 4th region because you know that most US DVD players are region 1. If you own a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player because it is a player in all regions. Just go to Settings and select the witch regional settings you want (1-9).
