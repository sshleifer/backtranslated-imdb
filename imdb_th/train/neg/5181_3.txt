This is Horrorfest's first film that I watched and after I almost thought I didn't want to see others I was told that "Horror movies, thinking about men" and must say that if this should make me think that I think myself what Don't understand me wrong, even the boring stuff in this movie is worth it to sit and watch. <br /> <br /> The story has been washed out too much. Camera effects and music are not in most places and the characters speak at least. The characters and scenes look worthless at the end when they begin to reveal some parts of "Hamilton". I think Lenny is who, about half an hour, when I thought of the movie I was under sight and confused by Lenny, revealing that I felt completely torn off. I expect what I can But they can go a lot further than in reality. All the blood falls completely. When a movie comes out like "Hostel" and "Saw", you have to be a little better for the movie that "Considered to be a graphic or disturbing general audience"
