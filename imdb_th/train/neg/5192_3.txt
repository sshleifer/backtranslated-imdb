It doesn't take long to see why the code name: Diamond Head can't be done on the network table. The movie pilot of the TV did not pass the credit before it became clear how bad it was. Maybe I miss something because the story is not reasonable. From what I received from the chaos, terrorists or thieves or things called "trees" (Ian McShane) went to Hawaii to steal some things made with secret weapons The most scary spy in the world is Johnny Paul (Roy Tinnenen). Banning him may be more than that. But trust me It doesn't really matter. <br /> <br /> Action movies should be animated. Suspicious moments should have suspense. And the amazing moments should have drama Nothing in the code name: Diamond Head. I've seen other people use the word "turgid" to describe this thing created for TV makers. And it's better than any explanation that I can find There are no characters that are the least exciting or interesting. And Roots Tinnes led to the worst possible leadership His special talents in the north of the little shell Ian McShane is the best thing the movie can do. Unfortunately, other people involved don't appear to be returning to be a regular cast member. Now, if McShane is starred in the series, you might have something else. <br /> <br /> I searched. Quickly found that movies created for TV in the 70s made this great Gawd create 3000 Mystery Science Theater. And that would double if Quinn Martin was involved Very funny things from Mike and Bots. So while I may give the movie only 3/10, I give the episode # 608 4/5 at my MST3K rating.
