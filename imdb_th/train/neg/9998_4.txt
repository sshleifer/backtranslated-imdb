At the end of the movie, I felt that it was too much. I felt like being in the classroom when I saw how our fleet helped in the sea. I like to see that the engine has a fire extinguisher. I guess I should understand it earlier. But I never thought of it. Using 747 to move old paintings that have little value and safety is strange and unrealistic. The performances are quite good because they are mostly experienced professionals. But if you are going to stretch out from what will happen most, it should be something like fantasy, comedy, etc. Everything seriously. At least this film has Felix Angar as a pilot, along with Buck Rogers, a night dancer, and Dracula is on board. The movie is full of well-known faces. I understand that Hollywood must be a bit exaggerated for drama. But it will hurt the quality of the movie when serious matter is created as a caricature That's why I say it should be more funny. My pet is angry with the movie about the airline's journey. Everyone is moving. They walked around with drinks, laid down and picked it up in the next 5 minutes, as if they were in a building or something and acted like no chaos. In addition, I know it's a disastrous movie. But the suspect does not need to include 30 seconds of error after pressing something. However, skilled actors and actors kept this weak script from becoming a movie that had been canned after the first screenings. I like Lee Grant, but it's fun to watch the psychopaths get decorated ...: )
