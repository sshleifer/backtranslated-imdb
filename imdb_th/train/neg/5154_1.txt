This is the only movie I ever walked out of. Bad performances - Bad plot - Bad selection - Bad governance - Bad movies - If they set out to create bad images I hope they are proud of his turkey. I was surprised that everyone involved in this film had been hired again in Hollywood. Do not waste time!
