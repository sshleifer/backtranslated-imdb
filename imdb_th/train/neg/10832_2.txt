Normally I have no problem with swearing in the movie. But this story really annoyed me. All they do is swear. For all movies (And as other people observe as cancer) it's boring, travel and pretending I won't, if you're you <br /> <br /> It's not that I don't like movies that most people like it claim to be. 'Observe life' I love Eat Drink Man Woman and what happened here is that there are many Taiwanese people taking their lives. But i can relate to them I have never met anyone who has sworn as much as an 'actor' in this film and I used to work at a construction site. 2/10 Avoid if you don't enjoy boredom.
