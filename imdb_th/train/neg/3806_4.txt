My wife and I both thought that this movie was a Manhattan murder game. Murdered the mystery that was made for the TV. (BBC) It's a good character. But not very good The story has little tension between the characters or the chemistry and there is not much story. Woody Allen's character walked close and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johanson didn't have much to do. It's quite disappointing. I have to say that the role of Ian McShane is just the appearance of the pendant. <br /> <br /> The first thing that happened to me was "I wonder how much the BBC has to pay to Woody Allen Who will drive him out of Manhattan? "He will have to use the money and they have to have his appeal to expand their target group apart from the attracting youth market to two stars. I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it was not a good background sound. If you want to have something while you are knitting or sorting your stamp collection, this thing will work. I will not pay the rent again.
