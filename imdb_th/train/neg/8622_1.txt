Since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon came to have a lot of discussions about the revival of the Hong Kong film industry. Don't believe it. Now, people making movies in HK give a new meaning to the word crass. Timed 2 is a perfect example. Is the name drawn here But he spends most of the movie just smiling at the idiot and turning the coin Why did he flip the coin over and over again? Who knows? Sean Lau is a policeman who chases a cute boy, but again: who knows why? There is a female actor in a group of female actors who perform certain activities and she has to pay a ransom or something. But she looks like she likes the spa or shopping center more than the camera. Nothing is reasonable. No action No sex No jokes All have names: Ekin Cheng and you know what? Who cares?
