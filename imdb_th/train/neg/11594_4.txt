Like Freddy's Revenge, this sequel uses strange ideas and doesn't try hard to squeeze the story out. In general, Alice from No. 4, pregnant and her child, was haunted by Freddie, which gave him a channel to haunt her friends. This has the least death from both the series and the clever cracks that are so bad that both horror fans and comedy fans are happy. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying this much A student It's interesting enough to see Alice's characters and Dan come back from four stories. But not worth watching this movie Surprising and unsatisfactory, there may be only the direction of the competitors to help protect it from the worst in the series.
