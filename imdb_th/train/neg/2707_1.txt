This is one of the most rotten movies in the 90s. I would not recommend if you have something better to do. <br /> <br /> This picture presents African-Americans as sociologists. Brutal, immoral, violent, disrespectful, and not like smoking the Ice Cube and his filmmakers are constantly abusing others in the dormitory, not just white people. But as an Asian, and never be punished by their actions Despite the patience they still wailed and wept about the evil white oppressors who carried their lives and stood in their way. In fact, it is Fudge's influence that makes Remy have ties to the movie head, quit school and eventually kill Malik's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Skinheads are taken. Offered as a hidden group of underprivileged people. University cushion and generally stay away from others They never blasted the music to annoy people and didn't mock the police. They committed serious crimes such as battery and rape. But they are not obnoxious and not as scary as Fudge and Dreads (Busta Rhymes). <br /> <br /> There is a lot of content in this movie that is almost dissatisfied. Me or make me laugh Some are as follows below. <br /> <br /> Fudge and Dreads indicate that they are students at the University of Columbus. But we have never seen them in class and it is unclear how they pay tuition fees Has anyone left to predict whether the weeds they smoke are related to their finances? Although they are students who look like private universities But they cannot speak English properly Their characters were developed through whining and hated foreigners. <br /> <br /> Looks like Kristen. (Christy Swanson) knows why drunk Billy took her to his house. She also asked him to buy tires so that they could start. The fact that he pierced her without using a condom became a rape while it would be a good sex if he had benefits. Later, Kristen was convinced by Taryn (Jennifer Connelly) that she was not responsible for that and even intentionally jumped into the bed of a man. She was not ready for sex and was taken advantage of. By sex hunters Then, a week or more, she found and slept, who made good, sensitive to the perception that knew how to avoid rape and bring condoms. The director emphasizes thorough contraception. <br /> <br /> This film is complete and the garbage that makes blacks look like cheaters and women look stupid and weak. Cole Hauser's performances and Lawrence Fishburn's accent are the only reasons I can watch. Obviously, the writer / director is a person with limited intelligence. Go ahead and limit yourself by watching this shit if you want. But remember that neurons do not grow. Just follow the instructions at the end and understand.
