Originally aired as an ABC movie of the week This story involves two innocent young women who entered the concentration camp in a small town in the south. They were not allowed to call and no one knew that they were there. The following are rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and decay which lead to many annoying conclusions. <br /> <br /> The TV version is scary. There are no nudity and bashing is quite tame. But the overall feeling of laziness is reduced The version with no rating is even worse - there are lots of pornography. The violence is intense and in a disgusting sequence, especially we see female prisoners crying that are forced to undress while the lesbian "uses" her yuck! There is nothing wrong with the movie about exploitation. But this movie has just passed You will get the feeling that filmmakers enjoy these poor and tortured women - these things are pushed onto your face as if you should enjoy it. The unnecessary ending doesn't help. <br /> <br /> I give 3 because of the good performance - but actually it makes the movie look harder. Movies that look bad and lazy are not recommended.
