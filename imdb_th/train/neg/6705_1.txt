This movie is just a shame. Orlando, Florida seems to have become a more well-known movie making area. The Brothers were shot in Central Florida and this short film was a slight defeat for the area. (Which made great progress with indie movies, Walking Across Africa and the top HBO theater from Earth To The Moon) <br /> <br /> I'll try to be as honest as I can. I think Orlando is the perfect place for filming the movie "The Brothers". It has the potential to create a popular 'Boy Band'. Finally, both N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys come from this area. But the brothers may be short because of the weak script Both leading characters are flat, almost no development at all. (Part may be an amateur actor But some people, of course, are the way to write scripts. <br /> <br /> The problem is to choose a joke. Too many jokes (They came out funny the first time Some scenes are not good (and many of these scenes do not seem to move in any way) <br /> <br /> I have high hopes. In this regard Disappointing effort I also hope that the best for the features that will arise from this information But I think the best thing for filmmakers John Figg is to move to a different genre (soon). Funny, not his strongest set. But it was indisputable that he was one of the famous filmmakers in Orlando (Unfortunately, now he is infamous, not famous) <br /> <br />
