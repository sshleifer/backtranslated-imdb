I watched this movie last night and I struggled to remember this much. A story about a criminal group that escaped from a space prison colony. They flew to the moon in trash for garbage collection in space. When there, they threatened trash men who worked on Moonbase. <br /> <br /> It makes me feel that low-budget sci-fi movies are often associated with desert planets or like the film. From a criminal colony. Why don't I know But I can say with confidence that this film is often cruel. This is really no exception. It started well enough with a good credit sequence and a half-way dance soundtrack. Then will deteriorate into a boring sci-fi thriller. So what really happened in this movie that I struggled to write useful reviews, so if you are reading this, I apologize that I can't. Teach you about the subtleties and differences of this film For that record, I remember being a group of boring baddies, a group of boring goodies, nuclear warheads and holograms of naked women. In addition, I'm struggling. <br /> <br /> If you feel like you might be interested in the activities of the men trash the moon, I don't hesitate to recommend this movie. I would recommend to those who want to send their friends to sleep and steal their bags.
