What I can say is that there is a B grade movie and there is a B grade movie and this story will definitely fall behind. However, since it was clear that even the filmmakers knew that it was not a reliable movie. (See the closing credits) can be forgiven In the snow The killer now uses the form of a snowman - if you believe that Jack Frost, a snowman behind the town of Cheryl, who puts him behind bars In doing so, Jack Frost ended up killing half the city. <br /> <br /> This film lacks fear and the only effect that reminds me of grade A movies This makes it worthwhile to see laughing. Movies that will pass the time
