This movie wasted a lot of time with me half an hour. In general, I liked the horror horror movie genre cheap. But this movie is disappointing The main flaw is the lack of explanations of living things. When they enter the house and find that the man he can explain to them to rent He didn't say anything about them other than that they killed his parents and if I didn't get something that didn't say he managed to escape either ... not to mention the fact that it gave Clues or reasons why Only one survivor remained and raised animals after her near death experience. It seems that she has a chance to leave after "Cross event"
