In contrast to the film's title, there is no spice and the audience is faced with tasteless food. Every sense of humor seems to be forced, acting, about machines, scenes, reminiscent of the Pakistani drama that is included in the video, including even gestures. Everyone screamed, shouted and made strange things without reason. The place to look interesting because of the lift from Boeing's Boeing Hollywood, John Abraham, who is naturally in almost all of his films, is not suitable here if we continue to maintain morality. Kumar and Paresh Rawal There are two experienced people trying hard to raise the film with nature. But at least ridiculous, the characters of three girls should intersect to bring interesting elements with bimbettes buxomed (3Bs) that talk, behave and even scream in a somewhat similar way. The key hole in the story is what makes The protagonist gives three girls at his same house pretending that they will not know each other. What can you do with sex? Can do hundreds of ways. Dramabaazi is very unreasonable. It's not something that the audience can easily digest, but of course, showing a great meat. The first movie was fantastic. Now for those who call it funny, the situation I call it a pathetic taste. The sense of humor of the film's audiences will certainly disappear and frenzied at the level in which they are connected to the sadistic, strange and terrifying humor that is not the characters they laugh at. But stay at yourself and yourself What a disappointment to see that we are ridiculous in order to laugh. Do we have to endure these things?
