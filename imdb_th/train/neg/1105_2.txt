Oh, how can they create a movie that is so beautiful? But it was so bad I mean, even Uwe Boll didn't do anything like this. There is not even a hint of a proper story, multiple characters, or an appealing thing. It was just a random talk together to create a 'movie'. I think that children who are less than 3 years old can enjoy it because the world doesn't have much dimension and the story is inconsistent Until anyone who is older is frustrated But again, it's too scary for people under the age of 6 who may not have watched this movie. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and stay away from this movie. Your little daughter can create a better story, and even though she may not be able to draw beautiful pictures, her tales are worth listening to. And please in the name of anyone you trust He deserves a negative score. <br /> <br /> And if you decide to watch it anyway ... remember that I have warned you.
