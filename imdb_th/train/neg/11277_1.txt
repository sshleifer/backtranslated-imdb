There is no doubt that the film has an impressive actor. Unfortunately, this does not help reduce the importance of the movie. I never understood why the director asked the actors / actors to use their own accent. When everyone couldn't clearly convince, Fiennes couldn't do Irish and Fitzgerald wasn't much better than Russian. When the sound is not correct, regardless of how good the performance is, the characters will be unbelievable. For important problems .... Plot .... Is there any? I guess there are some related stories. But full of holes that I can't wait for the movie to end ... It's ridiculous. Save your life for 90 minutes and don't watch this movie!
