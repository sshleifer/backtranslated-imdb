Tarzan the Ape Man is a movie that was rebuilt in 1932 at the same time, and as with previous films, it has a slight resemblance to Burroughs literary character. But while in 1932 Tarzan was reduced to the words "Tarzan - Jane", Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe, doesn't speak or even grunt. He made Tarzan shout a few times, which looks like it was randomly sampled from the previous movie. <br /> <br /> Not Tarzan, playing the second banana for Bo Derek as Jane or more like the third banana on the left breast Bo Derek and her right breast This film has no issues except showing that Derek nude. <br /> <br /> Two action scenes in the movie presented in slow motion. There is more evidence that nobody cares. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Tarzan has an orangutan in this movie. Perhaps he may include a car from Sumatra and an Indian elephant on the screen.
