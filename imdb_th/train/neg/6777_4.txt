While I just criticized the OPERATION PETTICOAT, I don't like this movie, although there are many similarities. Both were only a few years apart, both Cary Grant and both were World War II comedies. However, the overall tone and style of the movie is very different. KISS HER FOR ME Overall, it seems to be a cheaper movie - with poor writing, low energy and a very wide performance - even when compared. With OPERATION PETTICOAT. I think at least to blame for this in the casting of Jay Manman Field. The combination of sufficient talent and her limited acting ability makes the A-budget film look like it came from the 3rd rate studio. There is also a chemical or energy to match her and Carrie. Grant is not so much. Actors generally like his grace and class. It's like matching Sir Lawrence Olivier and Marjorie Main.
