This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And I don't mean that We want to see horror / crappy thriller, so we choose one that seems to be the best punch in the store. Once this movie is everything we expect and more! (Or should I say less) <br /> <br /> The actors seem to be reading the lines from the poster behind the camera. A special technique called created by inserting red plastic through the front of the camera to create the impression that we see through the killer's eyes and the script? Don't even start the script for me ... and when you think it's not going to be worse, it turns out that the first part of this film is Oscar's content compared to the ending. <br /> <br >> Coming from me, this movie is hilarious if you're a crappy horror movie. But if you want a movie about GOOD, let's look at it. This isn't for you.
