I am a big fan of old horror movies, and since I am a middle-aged man, I was a movie created before 1970, mostly created in the 1920s to 1960s. I'm not a fan of modern horror movies, except for one. Creepshow 1, which I think is great I can recall the story there. But I really enjoy the monster in the box with Hal Holbrook and the man who is really clean guy is a great ending. The whole story is great. And why do I like them so much The characters are well developed, simple lines about good people and bad people, a bit of horror, heightened with faces that look terrified by fear and a bit funny, it's really funny! The sequel to this story lacks these elements or is completely absent! I wrote this thing just by watching it in part because the movie took a lot of time and I turned off doing other things, such as writing movie reviews on IMDb.com, lol when George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamoure were billed The maximum tells you something ..... 4 of 10 In addition, Romero's expertise is hard to find here. They have to tell him to make a standard PG sound (I don't want to. Do not know where this is ranked But it looks like PG for me) and that's not a good thing for movies that don't happen. It will be shown on the Encore cable channel. If you die (yuck yuck) to see
