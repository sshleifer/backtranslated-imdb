This movie is a good example of the lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people are paid to make this waste show that there is a lack of traditional thinking and talent in the entertainment business. The idea that viewers pay to watch this movie (And like the madman that I rented this movie) is discouraged. <br /> <br /> The teacher who is passionate (3 years ago) kills a teenage family because he wants her There is no reason for him to kill his mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes, you will see bad performances and directions. Many years later, a teacher who was immersed in prison separated from each other. Well - normal writing - no one in the city that he was afraid until the last minute. A passionate teacher will become like Navy SEAL and can sneak in to inhale people and with a knife as a great killer. Of course !!! Now, a teacher who is obsessed with killing a hotel maid without a reason, a knife, a thief for fun and starts looking for a teen friend. Now there is a perfect way to make that girl love you. A teacher who is obsessed with sneaking out of the hotel --- again. It's stupid. The police will recognize his face - but he follows them. Now he kills two cops outside the teenage house and sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> There's nothing positive about this piece of garbage. If other occupations use low quality works, they will be fired. But these stupid people make hundreds of thousands of dollars to write and control this trash.
