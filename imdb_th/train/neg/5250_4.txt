I love books written by Robin Klein, so I was so excited when I heard that the movie created from this book was in the process of creating. <br /> <br /> But I was very disappointed with the movie when I saw it. Because it doesn't capture what I love about the book - Erica, ridiculously ridiculous and interesting ways that you see the world. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the movie, I realized that things Happened like I imagined in the book So I went to the car It's not that bad at all. I guess Miss Belmont is completely different from what I imagine you are! I don't think she will be a smoker and a drinker - Jean Kittson, who plays. She is hilarious. <br /> <br /> By myself, I think this movie and the actress / actress in this story do well. But alas, I'm a fan of this book. (One of my favorite books of all time) that I can't help but feel disappointed = P
