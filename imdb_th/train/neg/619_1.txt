Wow is all I can say if your reading is either watching or thinking about it. Believe me. <br /> <br /> I laughed so hard in many parts of this movie. I can't believe they crush school signs! I have to play that scene over and over again, just laughing more often every time. If this film can be created, then we all have the hope of creating our own movie. Even the set is bad It seems that my 7 year old cousin should do better. Heck, I bet he will write and act better as well. All I know is that I have to watch the second episode so that I can see that it is as bad as the first episode. It's a wonderful idea about the killer scarecrow. But can do much better Hope that the movie about another killer scarecrow comes out like this movie.
