I don't know what the fool is doing, this movie is the Palm D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival 1999, because it's cruel! I really watched everything because I didn't believe that someone would make a movie worthless. There is nothing interesting about the story, the characters are without depth and there is no attempt to create an atmosphere with music or sound effects. In addition, if you decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this movie, don't forget to throw something away because the movie is just someone who runs around with a mobile video camera. This has been successfully used in movies such as "Blair Witch" because it creates doubt in Rosetta. There is no plot and no doubt that the style will lend. I should know better when it comes to the second hit in the morning that it will be scary.
