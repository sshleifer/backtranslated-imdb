I still trembled when thinking of EVER to see this movie again. <br /> <br /> I've seen action movies. I like these movies. <br /> Not only will There are some of the worst male actors (Sly Stallone) playing a leading role, but the plot of the film is very stupid from the beginning. (Why not rob money while the plane is on the ground) is much easier) which requires a person with less IQ than his believer. <br /> <br /> In addition, the story has no twist. Actually, a three year old can guess what will happen next. It is a cliches set (of action figures) that is more effective than his other movies (he's better than Rambo III if you Watch movies This is more funny than action movies.) Now, there are actors who can't act. A) Surprised. B) Sadly, something other than his basic face. <br /> <br /> I'm still. Would like to point out that this film has two factors that may cause some people to like The explosion is outstanding, but then ... You can see better on the 4th of July. The landscape is elegant. But then ... there is a documentary about the Alps and the Himalayas, so you can see the scenery better than that, instead of wasting time with the flick. <br /> <br /> Go to see another movie instead. There are hundreds of better action movies.
