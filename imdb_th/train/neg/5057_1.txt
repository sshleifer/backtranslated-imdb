The movie is very outdated, with scary and boring conversations and terrible construction. In addition, Cassavetes and Falk continue to work. Deceiving "good movies" doesn't take long to discover the destruction of intellectual turkey this The first scene was a scene full of bloodshed and histories, horrifying sounds, camera movements without imagination as well as character creation. There is no poetry, no profound psychology, no interesting images. Actors continue to smoke and we see beer advertisements. Very cheap indeed (One exception: the good and simple way of Ned Beatty to play the killer)
