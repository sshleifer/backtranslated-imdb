Hey <br /> <br /> If you will make a documentary about Leonard Cohen, try to do something about Leonard Cohen! This is full of Leonard enough to make the audience angry that he is wondering why they listened to these other singers (some people wonder). Talk about yourself. Puleeze .... Listen, it seems that they keep their daily records at the middle school level - who cares about Leonard? Guess what people, if you "Do something" should have someone make a documentary about you I found that the profanity of the U2 member parade, especially as though it would add credibility to this movie - no. Leonard doesn't want Bono or Edge to talk about his soul A delightful thing for filmmakers to gather their souls through the movie Gee. What ideas! I will give props to Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for their Cohen song - the rest of the show is boring and some people can't bear it. <br /> < br /> Cohen fans, you!
