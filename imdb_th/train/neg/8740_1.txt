My friend and I rented that movie last night and we have one of the greatest laughter in a moment. This movie shouldn't be funny. But it was very ridiculous and without any truth at first Is pathetic But it was great when his greatest effort was to find a awesome Lego room that hosts the ultimate computer. This is a normal joke. The emotional tension that we should experience is a room that looks like a child. The ending, like everyone else, is wonderful, especially when the lawyers of the bad guys show 'Right on time.' However, this movie is a good laugh. If you want something that will make fun, definitely watch it.
