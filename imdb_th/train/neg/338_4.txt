Of course, one of Eddie Murphy's comedy films, this nonsense about a mysterious boy who was kidnapped by a three hundred year old dragon and "Chosen One" <br /> <br /> Murphy is "Chosen One "in question, the opening song, the story suggests that he is "The best man in the world", a tool to find lost and missing children. He was approached by a mysterious Tibetan woman. (Charlotte Lewis), who says that he is "The Chosen One" and is his destiny to find and help Because if a child dies, sympathy will die with him while he is the holder of mercy. <br /> <br /> If all this garbage doesn't destroy you now Movie begins Suffice to say that the story is a disgust and destroys the entire movie. Means being another vehicle for Murphy's humor brand (Comedy movies are not a great thing for you.) The film failed at many levels. Even Charles danced as the evil Sardo Numspa couldn't do much. Stupid and very frustrating. <br /> <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.
