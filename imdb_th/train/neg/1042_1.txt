First of all, write the script on the napkin. Who needs more? We are not Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> Then pick up an amateur actor. It will be good for the advertising festival. In the end, who needs people who spend many years creating crafts? Then, hire a filmmaker who doesn't know how to illuminate. You will see that if it has enough light, it will not look like "real" and people in the festival will not like it. Who needs professional photography? Then hire a ten year old boy who never holds a camera as your service provider. It will give your movie a touch of expertise, no matter how the film festival will make a mistake with "truth" and guarantee that even if you wash the seats from real people, critics and audiences with intellectuals will scream " Genius "because they do not believe that this is just a complete amateur hour. <br /> <br /> When you're done, buy your ticket to the Bad aka aka Sundance Film Festival. <br /> <br /> What is Significant sad waste
