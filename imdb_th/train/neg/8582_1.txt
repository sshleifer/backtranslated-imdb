This movie is the sequel to The Full Monty, about men who are unemployed in Sheffield. This movie is a fake. <br /> <br /> As someone born in Sheffield and still connected to the city, I am extremely disappointed. This movie. Some people say that it should be held in Oklahoma and that is just a sum for me. This is a romantic view of the northern England created for the US market. May be many Americans - and the southern British - do not know that Sheffield is a large city with a population of about half a million, along with a complex city culture In the Giants, it was described as a dull, semi-dying semi-urban town in which everyone in Sheffield seemed to drink in the same old pub and the idea of ​​people at the party as a dance in the village. In the village it looks like. This is a small, close-knit community, not a big city. <br /> <br /> Sheffield's workers are totally different from their real lives, which are quiet and quiet. Communicate with each other with words short notes are dry, they do not talk nonsense, and certainly they are not /> <br /> Chorus, even in rural areas <br peaks in the Peak District. I remember a few places that I had been climbing. But the picture of some antennas that stretch out from the cold terrain reminds me of Wales more. Of course, on credit at the end, I saw a reference to Gwynedd Wells. During the summer, the hilltop district will crawl along the path and tourists in the car. Located between two large cities It's not a wilderness. <br /> <br /> For the idea that a girl can fall in love and desire Pete. Postlethwaite That is ridiculous and only a man's dream The reason that she became a lover of him was never clear. No man shows that there is a partner or family. They are in vacuum. <br /> <br /> Everyone who wants to watch movies about unemployed Sheffielders will be misused. This Sheffield is in the minds of mid-range movie writers and producers. <br /> <br /> It's a huge fake. <br /> <br />
