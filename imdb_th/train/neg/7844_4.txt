No one is watching the movie like The Hills Have Eyes 2 and it is expected that Citizen Kane will arrive the second time. This is a true story for a low-cost horror movie, especially Roger Ebert, who is dubbed "Dead Teenager Movies". The Hills Have Eyes 2 is definitely a Dead Teenager Movie. Only here that teenagers get Superficial appearance of military trainers <br /> <br /> Some people may argue the line. "It's just a movie" when suspicious facts Was raised in movie reviews But I always believe that all good imagination must be rooted in reality in order to be effective in the Mysta Hills 2. We will believe that the main character is a soldier in training. But they looked and talked like a high school boy camping in the desert The dialog is too scary and rude. Although the movie is not similar But I still imagine these "soldiers" in the category and trembling with fear. <br /> <br /> Very little about the characters, causing the soldiers apart from rifles and fatigue: radio transmission is Act like a telephone conversation with a teen The Colonel's address is "Hey Ai" personally and it seems that no one has a little idea of ​​how to do or feel the command structure. When things start to go wrong, I think of the soldiers in the Aliens of James Cameron. And those future marines act like real soldiers, even though they are amazing situations Imagination is rooted in reality. <br /> <br /> I tried to start watching movies at level 5 in level 10 and decided that it had strengths and weaknesses from that point. You have to allow concessions for materials. There is no way that Star Wars is as good as The Godfather in equal terms. But both are excellent examples for their genre. <br /> <br /> In that sense, while the Hillside 2 is a formidable exercise in writing, amateur and underage. Much worse than the typical Dead Teenager. Movies in the movie technique seem to have appropriate production values ​​and are made from that point of view. A scene that is intended to scare or intended to cause urgency or suspicion will generally work. So while watching The Hills Have Eyes 2 may be a fate worse than death. But there are horror movies that are getting worse. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching for those who like this type of thing. Normal boy's suitcase or those who don't like to think of every movie they see is Best Ever or Worst of all. If you don't "get" horror, especially Dead Dead variety, you shouldn't have a range. Good times with this. <br /> <br /> 4/10
