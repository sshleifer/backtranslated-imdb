When we are when people like this, Joe Swan - whatever is considered a good filmmaker ... or even a filmmaker! Where are the new filmmakers with brains and talent ??? We want it bad and hell with mumblecore! <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing like what the characters in the movie stand for. It's scary to call Gen Y, which is full of madness, which some people declare as filmmakers without having to pay attention to learning anything about vehicles before shooting. Orson Welles is the filmmaker. John Huston is the filmmaker. Fellini is a filmmaker, Dreyer is a filmmaker, etc. At present, such shows show that stupid young people called "Filmmakers" can happen when they believe that going outside without a script has no direction. There is no idea. There is no law "camerawork" DV), not skilled in editing, nothing at all, means creating movies. That "rebellion" or "advanced" is not. It is called ignorance and laziness or just to fully help the cinema. (And actually have "Jack-Off Shot" in your face ready) <br /> <br /> Watch the movie at the beginning of any successful "Indie" filmmaker: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Jost, or Herzog ... Nobody does anything boring and pointless like this, but Swan - whatever the hell is still SXSW every year and is regarded as a talent. New brave, it's shit! I can't imagine who would like this and everything that the filmmakers call it. (All I see) is a bad thing (new things that are clearer to attract more mainstream audiences Clearer unless you are a friend or family member of the person involved ... In the second thought, if you are a family member or friend, you may be embarrassed to see family members or friends in a compromise situation ... <br /> <br /> This sort of garbage is not an art. This is the opposite of it.
