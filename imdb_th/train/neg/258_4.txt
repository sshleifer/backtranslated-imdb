This is the first time I've watched a movie with Jamie Foxx and I think it will be my last time. I failed to see why he was funny. But people in the audience thought it was very funny when he turned his face toward the camera or said "I'll shower." The plot is completely predictable. Bad people come after good people A good man has a woman, so the bad guy uses her. During that time the officer made a mistake. The final scene is unbelievable. You spend 2 years with millions of dollars to chase men. But you do not work the house to solve the mystery. <br /> <br /> There are no great performances. And filming is MTV style Don't waste money on this matter. <br /> <br />
