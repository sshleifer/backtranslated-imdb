I ordered a movie from Korea because I was a special person and interested to see how it came out. <br /> <br /> When I watched, I can say that I am ashamed of having any part of it. I feel shame not only But for myself But for others who are involved in creating the "funny" ridicule of England, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> from the beginning to the end of the film Cringe to the point that many times I actually looked out of the screen in faith. Until you see this movie, it is difficult to understand how romance and humor can be romantic. <br /> <br /> It's not just a bad thing. But it is a movie that is not good In one scene, you can see the runner or assistant director who displays the SAS when wiping across. I will post the details of this in the 'fool' section. <br /> <br /> At the top, it makes me full of emotions (disappointed, angry, angry, embarrassed).
