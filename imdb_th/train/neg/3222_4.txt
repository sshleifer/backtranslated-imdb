I was very disappointed in this film in the 1970s from the story of Bernard Malamud. This is a story of possible redemption, racial bias and unrequited life based on mistrust. <br /> <br /> The black Jewish angel was sent to help the struggling tailor and his seriously ill wife. If Zero Mostel only believes in the angels (Belafonte), Fanny (Ida Kaminska), his wife will be healed. The problem is that Morris surrendered to life and just refused to believe Belafonte was an angel. <br /> <br /> When he believed that Fannie developed But in the end he wondered It would be great if there was an English translation in the final scene when Fannie spoke to Morris. <br /> <br /> Jan Kadar, the best female lead director in Mikael of Oskar In 1966 "shop on the main road "Directing this movie as well Kaminska was scaled down in the movie, mostly in the bed scene and her kindness in her words did not convey the situation she faced. She called for their daughter Ruthie, who disobeyed them by marrying Jews. Most of this film, she did not realize the presence of the angel in her apartment. <br /> <br /> The drug store scene was messy and the scene of Angel's girl friend confronted Bela. Fonte in their apartment is too short. <br /> <br /> We don't know why Belafonte is in danger and why he died. <br /> <br /> The audience of this movie must leave. From the cinema in a state of depression To desperation
