This film proved to be a movie theater. "Commercial" or Hollywood movies are in a serious crisis. There is no reason that this movie should be produced in addition to the fact that some people expect success. According to Shaquille's name, it should mean Lot: It is rather bewildered than anything else. The screen is quite dim. O'Neal is a bad actor, but Francis Capra is even worse. <br /> <br /> Score: 1/10
