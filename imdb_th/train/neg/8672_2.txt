Most action movies are Hindi movies, especially Sonny and his family. <br /> <br /> This film is a sunny type with errors, large conversations and melodrama. <Br / > <br /> The film also has a general Rajiv. <br /> <br /> The starting point is ok, and the change to Kenya is good. But then the movie will continue to show. <br /> <br /> The sequence of the events. Slowly, and nothing great happens. <br /> <br /> They are stupid scenes like Kenyan police who act like gangster, especially Sharat. Especially Sharat <br /> <br /> The top spot is Too long <br /> <br> Rajiv Rai doesn't work. The song can only be used for 1 song and that is the latest TOOFAN. Camera - Good job. <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol is normal. He is serious Laughing scene, Naseer is the heroine. It is pure wood. Amrish Puri is not half scary while he is in the TRIDEV. The rest is ok.
