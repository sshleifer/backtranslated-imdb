This movie makes me feel as if I missed some important scenes from the beginning. There are errors and ongoing plans that stop immediately at the beginning. I was very disappointed because I loved Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover. In addition, he also trusted and respected Danny Glovers in choosing his "Grand Canyon" role. I couldn't finish this film after what seemed like a run. Dry But may take only an hour We have to close it No jokes, nothing about the characters that make you sympathetic or sympathetic. They don't have any emotions about the film and their past clips are badly edited, confused and unnecessary. Things that may be a good idea for a movie, even if it is a drama and not a joke (Although I think the comedy in this situation would be better because I like to watch white people who are crazy about. Make me laugh) lose $ 1 credit at the video store
