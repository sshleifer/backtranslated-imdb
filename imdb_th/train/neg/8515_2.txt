I was very disappointed with this performance. After hearing and reading all about it, it is "live performance" and all types of wild contracts. If there is quality, I try to watch <br /> <br /> something that is down !! Actions are forced and exaggerated The story has very little meaning. "Looking into the life of a teenager" that has been exaggerated. I can see a little effort that is as real as the reality show. <br /> <br /> Some people wonder why there is. many Negative comments about this show The reason is not that everything will be better than the quality drums in this performance, just to attract attention that it's not doing well.
