This is not a horror movie. But a boring sex movie A terrible movie that must be avoided by serious horror fans. No scary plot and annoying music. If you look at the example, you will know enough ... It is a shame that such things are available on VHS or videos while there are many good movies that are not available. If you like vampires, try using Hammer Productions or Italian Gothic from Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti instead. These are masterpieces if you compare it to this trash. Score = even "1" too much! And believe me, I'm not the only one who has this opinion
