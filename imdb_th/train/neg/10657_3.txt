I have many hopes for this film and watch with many expectations. In general, because of Kamal Hassan, he is an amazing actor who marks his step in the sand forever. But this movie proved to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After watching this movie, the cruelty and violence in the triangle and the orange color of the watch looks much better. <br /> <br /> The protagonist Raghavan is a very brave cop. Raghavan who was assigned to investigate the ongoing murders of the criminals, effectively finding threads linked to each other in this case and close to solving the murder case and placing a psychopathic killer, two medical students who were mentally disturbed. But excellent in the back of the bar. Finally, Raghavan kills both of them after spending a lot of innocent lives. <br /> <br /> These two psychotic killers are people who will not let the audience go to the cinema. Murder and sexual abuse and rape are clearly displayed, which the film may have survived without <br /> <br /> Even though teens and children are watching this movie in The cinemas and the forms that are bound in their minds are not beautiful. The director Gautham should realize that he has a commitment to society and his audience. Of course, I have never been to movies like Gautham's name in Production
