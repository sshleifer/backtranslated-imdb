I saw this movie a few days ago ... What the hell is that? <br /> <br /> I like movies with Brian O'Halloran. They are funny and fun. When I saw the name of the name and type that I thought were excellent, this might be really good ... Parody for slashers or other blood movies ... but .. Then I read the example and thought it might be good. ... but it's not ... <br /> <br /> My opinion: If you like movies, they look like a little funny, slightly funny. Try watching Moore's movies or Alien autopsies. This one is empty. <br /> <br /> Put A comedy to title ... don't show Comments ... is a terrible joke.
