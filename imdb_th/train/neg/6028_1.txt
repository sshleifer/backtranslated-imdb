I am a Christian ... and I feel that this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> Christians who are wearing belts in the Bible will not like this movie. That message is in your face as well. If you want to experience a wider audience, you must deepen. You can't let your father waved the Bible around and hold it with him in every ridiculous scene! <br /> <br /> The direction is not good. The revelation of the lost person is horrible. But it was laughable Do they leave clothes on the floor? It reminds me of the old Ed Wood movie: "Oh my God! People disappeared! "That scene in the plane was really stupid. Imagine: If you find your cousin clothes next to you, you won't just scream. "Oh God, they disappear! They disappeared! "And began to cry and shout.

In conclusion, they do not know what "heck" is doing. <br /> <br /> I would like to compliment the effort. Receiving a message to a large audience is a great concept. The movie is the best medium possible. Watch movies like WIDE AWAKE, Signs, Contact, Christ's Love, Even O'BROTHER, Where is the art going? The most important thing is that movies must be created by talented and visionary people. Unfortunately it's not
