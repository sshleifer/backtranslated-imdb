Men, I love the police movies that are full of action shots, chases and more. <br /> <br /> The boy, I was left after watching this short film that wasn't satisfactory We had seen it before the hostages, the banks surrounded ... but there were 2 bad guys who shot many officers and innocent people in the fire - without being attacked because of Kevlar. Not just a few shots, not hundreds of shots. Returning to the bank where the hostage was not locked, the safe or the door when the villain went out The director thinks we are stupid. <br /> <br /> Okay. The picture during the filming of the fake documentary is a good story. But after watching this movie A good shot course? And why are there so many police and SWAT in really long breaks Truly bad
