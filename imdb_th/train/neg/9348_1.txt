I found this movie to be interesting. I felt like pushing the storyline down to my neck as if I couldn't get the subtleties that I needed to say to spell them all for me. <br /> <br /> Having a father who is still Alcohol. I didn't feel it was a movie about alcoholism like this. Of course, in fact, alcoholics are lonely people in my mind. They find it difficult to communicate what the main character really does, except he has trouble saying that I love you at one point, which is a weak attempt to create his cold character. He is surrounded by people all the time! <br /> <br /> I felt that I was deceived that there was no point. We were really alone with the characters who would be feeling loneliness and chaos inside of him. I cannot connect with the characters and feel that there is no connection with my father's consideration. I don't feel anything at all. Once finished, just relieve it. End it. <br /> <br /> Kevin McGild is an actor. But not a strong lead actor! Things that the orange courtyard is subtle like bricks. McKidd is too old for teenagers. They should have three different characters or avoid teenage terms and focus on McKiddie. Adult <br /> <br /> In a good note, I feel like Showing a really nice little man At the beginning of the movie !!
