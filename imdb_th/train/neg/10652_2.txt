You know Jason. You know Freddy and you know Leatherface. Now get ready: The Safety Pin Killer! Yes, in a funky dumb killer workout. If I ever saw anyone, a murderer who could not see, would send his (or her) victims with a new, large safety needle. It is a strange choice to be sure that it is the kind of thing that deserves explanation. The movie never tried to explain clearly where the murderer had been that In fact, this movie gives a little clue about the identity of the murderer. Everyone in this movie is a potential murderer until they are killed. And because about everyone But the murderer was dead. It was just a removal process. <br /> <br /> Oddly, while all names were killed, aerobics classes continued to be serious In fact, nothing can stop dancing. While three men were killed in the next room, exercise continued. Death is not a factor. One character dies But still noticeable during the exercise. Director David Prior knew what he was doing when he named the movie Killer Workout and not the Logical Workout. <br /> <br /> Chase the police, tanning beds, bombs and bullets. Touch hundreds of women Like a woman caught on a sun bed, I was uncomfortable at the end of the Killer Workout. Finally, luckily, the ending used a spark on the screen. What happened next You already understand the image of women exercising. Even the end of the movie can't stop them. <br /> <br />
