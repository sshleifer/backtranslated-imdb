This film is a pure failure. I'm a fan of Steve Martin. But even then he was unable to record the tiring ideas and the Swiss cheese script thought "Police Academy 7" and applied to the parody of the military. Of other users, reflecting the bad ratings that this movie received (And deserve it correctly!) It is very misleading I often see this film marked at $ 3.00 in the grocery store and now I know why of course. <br /> <br /> If only I could get my 90 minutes ...
