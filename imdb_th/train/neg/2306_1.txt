I found myself wondering who gave this thing 10 things I didn't see. This film has difficulty tracking and / or plotting. If someone tells you that it's a joke, don't be fooled. It's about 98% strange and 2% joke. All actors are shown in great performances that can't be ignored. But it seems that it has lost something Do not know whether the original script is good or not and need to fix it? This thing has potential and instead of being a real failure. I want a half hour that I invest in this movie. But video rental locations do not return on time Save your money and see something else.
