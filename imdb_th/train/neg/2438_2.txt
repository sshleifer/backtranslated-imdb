The infamous ending for Koen Wauters' career came to me with 'Night of Bad Taste'. Judging by the comment index, I was not the first one and I wasn't the last person in Western Europe to learn that this musician. (There is no doubt that it is one of the best in our contemporary pop scene, even the Dutch agree.) Actors. Whether he should try or not be able to judge <br /> in ' Intensive Care 'He is very fond of But he seemed to feel uneasy with the flick he joined No one can blame him. It deserves a ranking in the Hall of Fame of Verheyen with all the methods and standards. The story of a Murderous Maniac that should die in an accident. But still alive and angry, has been told dozens of times before, and even without the same twisted player, the director can broadcast a simple story through a strange scene. IC itself, with wings, hospitals and two middle-class homes Boring pace The slightest tense decrease of credibility towards the musical score for every murderer's appearance will occur with an annoying melody followed by an explosion of the orchestra during the murder, or suggest. And in any case without blood Can make them The sex scene is free. But not attracting couples from Amsterdamned may make it work While dealing with the matter of lovers: all sub-plans between the Wauters and girls do not work. More powerful emotional links can be created on the screen if they are just friends with victims, which loosens their nerves halfway through sexual intercourse. I will not honor the other members of the actors because they should be chopped into small pieces. Actually, most of them do. The person I remember in the obvious position for the type: beautiful nurse and two policemen. <br /> <br /> So in the slasher, the cavalry came to the time to help themselves. Most of the villains go through smart thinking because the red berets do not participate in these movies. They may overcome the illusion of invincibility that surrounds the killer. Translate to the Wauters event, kill the doctor and save your life in distress. <br /> <br /> No people. I'm not finished yet. This is not a story that happened. Wauters tried bravely. But was struck by anger that came close to "A Clockwork Orange", so it was up to the young woman to play the killer, sniper and penetrate through the doctor's brain Although this method will help ensure that the killer will die more than the usual 9 mm bullets, but the doctor is still alive, so the IC can mark it at 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> Now I should understand. Intensive Care is a bad movie that Bad Taste enthusiasts can enjoy only to check Verheyen's interesting statements and create them for themselves. For example, parody values (Not intended) of the clown mask of the doctor (Halloween) and the final confrontation in the park (Chase at the end of Friday 13) <br /> <br /> However, I would like to conclude by Gives an overview of the vicious elements that make the IC have little credit. George Kennedy is not one of them What he had to do was to endure the frightening speech from the French doctor / actor and look scary when they let him go into the flames to tag his big name on the stand. Play his Naked Gun again to end up as a beef. But with a longer duration The ending may be one of them. I never saw a madman being brought down by fireworks into his courage to crush him from a flexible fence. It is good to laugh. <br /> <br /> Tell a good name about intensive care ... Koen Wauters learns his lessons and devotes himself to his music career. It made me wonder how many models he had to cancel in Paris-Dakar before he felt his feelings. <br /> <br />
