This did not reduce the depth of Creepshow 3 but came very close. In addition, the same technique is used to use some actors in various roles throughout the poetry which distracts the least to speak. <br /> <br /> It is also quite annoying to tear off the Twilight Zone. It can be compared to the Night Gallery of Serling later). Unfortunately, the producers and writers forget that Serling will create sympathy for his character before confusing them. There are no characters that are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the final episode. <br /> <br /> Framing story: Adam West is ... He doesn't go to the Bruce Way route. / Batman in the 60s camp, but he rarely does. He plays as "Jay" that is not particularly mysterious. (There is a terrible name compared to the name of Dr. Terror, Eramus and The Cryptkeeper) and makes some awkward / creepy messages. <br /> <br /> Abernathy: Rod's actions Serling saw "A Stop in Willoughby"? Then you saw this. Wife's red herring, nutso is not recommended for purposes. But even the main character's friend stated that he was boring Directed as well as they should expect <br /> <br /> Nex's Diner: Reminiscent of the time travel stories in various Serling, combined with Steve Allen's "A Meeting of Minds". Most actors do not. (Except Josh Astin as Cassius, who can walk, talk and breath awkwardly) and that idea is a little interesting But like Abernathy, it doesn't go anywhere. The main character makes a question that is quite reasonable, a little bug (who wouldn't?), And for some reason he was exiled to the nuclear waste. <br /> <br /> Replay life: Not a small piece. That is not good and manages to dated before the real day, both click and Creepshow 3. I think it says something that people are fascinated in the magical features of remote control The main character is gentle sympathy. There is nothing new here, but it's ok. <br /> <br /> Fighting Spirit: You see that the rotation is one mile away. But like the main character, it has a heart and it is a good story to overcome and redeem. <br /> Ending: So ... Why do people end up in a cold room in a silver suit, unaware and unreasonable? So ... all the protagonists went into the bookstore and trapped? Kinya undermined the end of a happy boxer (Thank you very much!) And the man in the first segment died. So how did he get trapped? He used to go to the bookstore before he died and was not dead? What? Ha? I support this, not expected to be reasonable, because it is supernatural, but still ... <br /> <br /> Overall: In general, it is not different from the new Twilight Zone series or some episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Monsters Two final stories and some parts of seconds may be worth your time. But here is nothing really exciting.
