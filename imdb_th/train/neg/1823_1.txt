Jack Black's character, Tim Dingman, who dreams of Envy, searches for wealth and success in the idea of ​​spraying "Vapoorize" that, when sprayed on the dog's dung, causes the crab to disappear into the air. <br /> <br /> For a moment, I hope Vapoorize is a real product so I can spray on the movie "Stinker" and make it disappear in the air. <br /> <br /> Although Envy It's not the worst movie I've ever seen in the past 12 months. The Source (That honor goes to The Cat in the Hat) but it was honored at the last moment. <br /> <br /> Not funny. No sadness. Nothing. "Stinkeroo" Real !!!!! <br /> <br /> 0.2 from 10 !!
