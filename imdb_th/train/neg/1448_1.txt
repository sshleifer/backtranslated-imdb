As he grew up in Texas and less than 15 miles from what had been Gillley's, I could tell you that this movie is disgusting. Most processors do not live as this movie states. The plot is weak and funny accent, and it reinforces the stereotypical image of all Texas drinkers. A terrible fake Texas accent is what killed it for me. True, there is a Texas accent that accentuates the majority of Texas people. But these people do too much You can't get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do a Texas accent. It doesn't work. John Travolta should stick with a disco dance or 50s. Debra Conservative has faith as a Wonder Girl. More than she had been a Texas citizen
