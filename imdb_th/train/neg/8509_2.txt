I saw this movie for a number of reasons that are the core of Mira Sorvino. When living with the actors, it's not bad. And it seems that it has some puzzles and Olivier Martinez is her boyfriend at that time, and he is quite good in `unfaithful '. Exotic, with one of my favorite actresses At the same terminology mind is /> <br /> pathetic story was fabricated by <br sub-plan has nothing to do with the narrative. They tried to create a slasher / thriller by watching fascism in Spain. But failed horribly Twisted, no credibility, and the investigation that leads to nowhere. <br /> <br /> The characters are like paper! I don't care about anyone. Moreover, they are annoying and hateful people. <br /> <br /> The performance is brutal. What happens to you? Why should Mira be you an Oscar winner! Maintain dignity! Her character is weak. But there is no excuse for a horrible performance It seems that she is sleepwalking in both movies. Think about it. I think I saw her eyes closed slowly in some scenes. I used to think that this woman is sexy. She's not here If you want to try the skin, try Romi and Michelle because there's nothing to see here. And that accent? My God ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is the worst. It was too painful to remember his performance to explain here. I'm sorry but I can't. I suffered enough for this garbage. <br /> <br /> This movie is depressing! It's terrible in every area. It's surprising how it was created. Flea team to create a flea script and make more money than the actor's name. Don't miss it. <br /> <br /> Avoid it. <br /> <br />
