I saw this movie in an international cinema class and made an income. This movie has nothing but the obvious shot after that. <br /> <br /> The fourth man is an alcohol writer named Reve who has a vision of the dangers that are waiting. He met a woman named Christine when he lectured at a local book club and decided to stay with her when he discovered how charming her boyfriend was. To put it clear, Reve likes Dutch sausage. Therefore, Reeve planned to persuade Christine's girlfriend so that he could eventually have sex with him. But later found that Christine had three husbands previously, all of whom she had been killed in. Now, Reve's and Christine's fans may be "THE 4TH MAN". Editing and everything that is technically about this movie is perfectly fine. This movie looks terrible and I feel that I have to vomit in some parts. Essentially, this is not my cup of tea. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with Reve getting out of bed in a T-shirt. Therefore, in the beginning, you will see Reve's cute pecker floating around as he walks around a cramped apartment in a hangover condition. After that he had a dream that his scissors would be cut with scissors and they showed it with the blood fountain that followed. Reve fondles the statue of Jesus and has sex with homosexuals in the grave. Including a lot of blood Blood together more than the movies of Freddy Krueger. <br /> <br /> Not that I have anything to do with "shocking" scenes, but this movie is very loud when it comes to shocking This film has a revolving vibration. <br /> <br /> So if this is your cup of tea Otherwise, stay far away from this one. My mind still has scars.
