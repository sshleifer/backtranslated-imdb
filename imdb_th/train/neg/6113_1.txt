I screamed out because watching this movie was my first movie to have experienced since the age of 13 months. I remember it was incredibly bloody and it made me angry. I watched TV again a few years ago. The big mistake - acting is a plot that does not exist and the movie lacks merit unless 23 years of T&A is what gets you ... 0 / ****
