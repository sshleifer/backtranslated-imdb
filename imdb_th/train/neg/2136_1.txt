It may be the worst movie I've ever seen. When did Hollywood create a successful movie that attacked the Republican Party? Why don't they learn? Dicks are not yet chicks. These leftists live in their own top bubbles that interact with each other. Forgetting the fact that most of America is far more than they have br /> I think Cussack might have better movies. <br /> <br /> It's not funny.
