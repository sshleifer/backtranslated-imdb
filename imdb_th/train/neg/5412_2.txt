Pyare Mohan can be included in the blacklist of one of the worst man-made movies. This film, which is one of the many disabled films that occurred after the miraculous success of Black, made the mockery of the disabled association Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan the only caricature of the disabled. While Black shows the pain and emotions of women with disabilities and allows us to see her world, Pyare Mohan shows two hopeless monkeys who are not confident in being disabled. Anu Malik's songs are fair. Enough Vivek Oberoi, who started the contract with Saathiya, sadly losing his child quickly in Hindi movies. Faradan Khan has never been a recognized actor and should be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just beautiful women who are suffering at night at Thialnd without anyone helping them - except those As mentioned above, Boman Irani as Don Toni, the wicked, is accepted. Avoid film if possible.
