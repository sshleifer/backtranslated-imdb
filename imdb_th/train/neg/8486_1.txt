I can't believe anyone would think there is anything new or interesting about this movie. I am a fan of science fiction as much as the next guy, and I can enjoy old movies with ridiculous places as long as they are written by people other than monkeys. (See examples of my passionate comments about Altered States [1980]) <br /> <br /> The monkeys can definitely explain better why I should spend two seconds thinking the basic idea behind this film. Seriously The problem is not that the manufacturer has a low budget - something that they don't care. <br /> <br /> Now, to make people scorn the worthless magazine that the public shines in the box: <br /> br> Chicago Tribune <br> <br> San Francisco Chronicle <br /> <br /> San Francisco Bay Guardian <br /> <br /> (Actually, I enjoy Read the latter two stories, still their movie. Checking reliability through the floor But I know that if I make a movie with a mobile camera, a magic plot and stupid effects, I'll show the reporter and remind them of what they say about Conceiving Ada.)
