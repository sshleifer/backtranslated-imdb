Why common names like this? Santa Claus ??? Gentle and unpredictable The previous movie tried to pay in the most striking holiday spirit. 'Santa Claus conquers the Martians', at least happy to watch because of its friendliness and all stock images used ... for some reason Seems to be happy with me But this movie just makes Christmas in the bottom and makes all the fun of Santa's children live in space? His enemies are demons named Pitch? Can Santa get help from the Merlin Mage? This is a random way! Since it was created in Mexico, so some of you may understand how to make movies. I have to admit that some effects were strange at that time. It's a group of madness! Although there are all problems with movies But still feels like a Christmas movie Good defeat and Christmas are still part of our hearts to every good girl or boy in the world or the universe that is possible. So I think you should try it, even though it's one of the worst holiday movies of all time ... even if it puts a smile on your face every day.
