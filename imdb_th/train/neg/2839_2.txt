This movie is one of my favorites. It's not good. But it's great to laugh Conversations may become incredibly ludicrous and pathetic (eg "Manji, can we ask a few questions to you?" Do not forget to keep an eye on Brock, the white person who attacked the main character. He has only two lines. But he is one of the best men in this movie!
