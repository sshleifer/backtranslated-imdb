Bad performances, no scripts, no plot, no reliable killers, no doubt, no original settings, it uses the same wardrobe / under the bed / the person behind you is in the mirror, the strategy over and over again makes it Redundant and Boring and not predicting in advance and the fact that no one "was" killed (at least not on the screen), which caused immediate suspicion and could cause everyone to feel more cheated Take money on their ticket ... It's a horror movie that doesn't have any horror stories. LMAO What you see most is what looks like someone taking a bottle of tomato sauce and spray all over the sheet. Plastic <br /> <br /> You must be a teenager who is sitting there, screaming in the theater and fearing that he will be happy. This thing or you are tall / drunk at that time <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have life and don't bother writing reviews that are often, unless I really hate something or are very happy. <br /> <br /> But this movie is scary and I feel that I have a strange duty to remind you not to give your money to Hollywood and encourage the creation of this type of movie again! <br /> <br /> It's one thing to rent a "bad" movie at a blockbuster from another Weinsteins when you have to sit and watch in the cinema. <br /> <br /> You want to. Missing some remake. Forget it! This is not a remake and not a fantasy. It is not scary and not engaging and is not satisfying enough to be "funny" like everyone else in the IMDb claiming ... It's just a damp and chaotic <br /> <br /> Here Is what you will get from This movie: Memorizing the scars on Brittany Snow's head is more striking than the plot. The fact that Jonathan Schch must have sex with JS Cardone of "The Forsaken" Who received the role as another killer (Because he's as scary as my poodle and too cute to kill anyone) and for some reason (duh) everyone who returns to the hotel back. What kind of person wouldn't worry about the job Prom, when they decided to announce the candidacy of the King and Queen and the fiercely competitive young women, did not appear. This is my warning to you. Don't waste you money as I do. "Original" is worse than this, but more happy for Jamie Lee Curtis fans, even if it's not close to such a bad thing (sorry for being rude or rude. But when you see this, you will understand why I say What I said)
