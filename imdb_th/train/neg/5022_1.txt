Oh dear, this movie is not good for many reasons. I expect to see very low scores for this film and feel a little surprised by the overall score. Sorry, but scoring this comment is very high, it's a joke. When you pass one shot / monochrome movie mechanism, which is a good idea, the movie will continue to run even at 66 minutes of running time. Flat and change the wow wheel needed in this story! How do they run slowly and manage Campbell's wounds? It seems that they are not interested in following him ... sigh .. I'm very glad that I received this award with the Edition of Evil Dead !!
