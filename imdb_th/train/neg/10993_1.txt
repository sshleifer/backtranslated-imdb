Of course, we all like bad movies at one time and in fact we enjoy them. However, this story is not miserable. But it's just shit Some men propose Vince, who considers himself to be the main character while probably drunk / high-may both - and thinks it's a good idea to create a movie Then he showed his script to the person who was high / drunk equally. Overall, this movie is terrible, predictable and unofficial. I can't pass it for 20 minutes before I close. Does it make you get a role like Citizen Kane Bat Man? WTF ... Some men who walk around with real bats are almost as good as calling him a fat man and a fat man walking in a superhero suit.
