This is the worst horror / horror movie I've ever seen in my 29 years. If someone offers you free, tell them not. This movie makes you a fool who knows you watch it. The story is not the worst part of this movie ..... In terms of acting, camera work, light and sound, there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie. Anyone who pays to create this movie now crashes. I hope the director will not get the green light for other movies. In defending the film, this was done quickly to try to take advantage of the actual capture of the BTK killer. But I saw the movie of the week that seemed like an Oscar winner when comparing
