5 minutes in this movie, I'm hypnotized, shaky and painful with pain. And not in a good way This story is about a group of stupid children who call prank, which is always a good idea. It turns out that the mind doesn't like the prank call because in 2 minutes, he is at their door, killing the poor mother and father Williams. Skip forward 15 years and guess what? Still prank phone calls to people Yes, you would think that the horrific murder would hinder them from doing so again, but no. So after about two hours later and how to scream too much, I know that this movie doesn't give anything but the taste Terrible in my mouth This shit is not worth it to laugh at low production. "Performances" or Rutger haurs diminish in career. I like crappy horror movies But this is the most satisfying work I have ever seen.
