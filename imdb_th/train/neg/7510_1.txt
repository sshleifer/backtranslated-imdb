This film is a collection of cliche about anything else there. It doesn't have any focus, no goals, no real messages. The symbols were pushed to the top and the schemes were numerous and outrageous. This movie cannot resist the temptation to create a drama that does not exist. The exchange of small words every time will change into a long and unjust conversation, which is typical of normal practice performances. In the absence of this exchange, the actors (Regardless of their normal goodness) cannot help But compensated by the exaggerated emotions known as Acting rather than making it easy The director has no help here. There is nothing that can help this matter. It was forced to pretend and boring tears. Inaccuracies in punk rock portaraying with The Who, piercing and the flashy 90 series of nomadic characters without roles, details and motivation. The arbitrary location here is Boogie Nights and The Good Fellas, combined with Saturday Night Fever with the meaning and art that is torn. <br /> <br /> Good DP. I'll give it that. <br /> <br /> Some movies have bugs This movie is Lee's flaw. He sold out like everyone else was not involved at all. He has nothing to say anymore. <br /> <br /> I have no desire to see anything else from this man.
