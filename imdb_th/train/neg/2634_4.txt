In order not to be confused with the supernatural supernatural thriller "The Sentinel", Sentinel is a very boring movie for me, not a consistent performance. Two critics promised on the back. For me, it seems that everyone is Halfassing and only has to make money quickly because it feels like making up for the TV movie. The Sentinel is a better form of film than many things like "In The Line Of Fire". There are any initiatives in it and see Michael Douglas running around. The main problem, apart from the history of the indigenous people, must be in a bad way. I tend to be distracted while trying to watch this movie while seeing how long it has left, not just the mockery of Eva Longoria, who can't convince him to lick. <br /> <br /> The Michael Douglas show is often a credible actor who clearly has to go through the movement. He didn't convince as a man who ran away or was a spy. His chemistry with Basinger was also closed. I am a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here he is just okay with nothing left. He tried to meet as a serious person. But it turns out that there is nothing more interesting anymore, and to speak directly, he seems to have no interest in Eva Longoria Parker. She is moderate. She doesn't believe in her role and is a pure eye food. Kim Bazinger is terrible as the 1st woman. She looks boring. Tears and her role are thrown away. Martin Donovan has an important part in the end. But not enough for me. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, the Sentinel is also a political shocker who is tired of tears. It's too old, too tired and the most important is the lack of effort. Sucking. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
