I don't really like it. Not because there is no FX or because we have a single cabin as a scene for the entire movie. Actually, that's what makes me watch. <br /> <br /> I don't like it because every show is shady. People are happy and then crazy. But you don't know why; Then they have a different role, one that is believing others as enemies, but they never succeed! The light is terrible and I just talk about technical issues. <br /> <br /> In a few words, the thing that this movie might have is just "Okay, I'm here!" From some characters Like a woman who does not want to hear his scripture. <br /> <br /> About that story, everyone is free to write about what they want and the story is evidence of writing and good imagination. I give credit to the author of that book. For this reason, my 4/10 <br /> <br /> So finally hear the story of that man. Believe it or not, don't spend all the time like you do. the He was shocked by what he said and at the same time walked and made a porch that you didn't believe him. <br /> <br /> Connection <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading; )
