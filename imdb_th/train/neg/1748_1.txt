Don't waste time on this movie. This is all the teeth in terms of acting, directing, sound editing, soundtrack ... Some excellent actors lose performance. This film does not create justice for Paresh Rawal, who may be one of the best actors in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar, a new star, can work quite poorly. John Abraham, what happened to him? Is that what you call acting? I mean he should thank God for his looks. Otherwise, he will be awarded Razzie in India. If there are such awards in Bollywood, Asrani is a great talent. <br /> <br /> The screenplay that didn't mention being cut from Boeing Boeing in 1965 was quite bad. Firstly, people in Bollywood can't do original things. Moreover, they don't know how to copy well. The joke in this movie is too much. It's painful to pass it. Priyadarshan may be a star in the south. But he is not suitable to create suitable Hindi movies Sound editing is an amazing story. I can go on this matter. But the most important thing is that Bollywood is ashamed to create this movie. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that some people seem to love this movie. What are you guys This is the reason why Bollywood is. Do you know that Bollywood has produced more movies than Hollywood every year? However, most movies have never heard from foreign countries because of this movie. I am an Indian and I am extremely disappointed for Bollywood to produce this type of music. Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan are great. They are a world-class movie that has no time ... In the best decade, however, Garam Masala may be one of the worst of this century. <br /> <br /> I give 1 in 10.
