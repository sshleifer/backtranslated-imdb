I entered this with hope, about twenty minutes in this movie. I will not give up again. Even though it was thought that this would be a horrible thing again But I still hope that ... maybe someone might be right at this time. Sadly, the Prom Prom is at the same quality level as April Fools Day remake, bad script, bad direction, performance. Exaggerated dress and bad horror <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, it's boring, repetitive and repetitive. Worthy of about a dozen eye rolls We've seen it before, and we've seen it do millions more times if you watch the Prom Night in the cinema. (I'll say wait for a DVD or PPV). Prepare the audience to laugh because they will laugh. Laughter is not in a funny point. But they respond to important moments "Exciting" in movies that make you feel as bad as if you are watching the new Scary Movie. Seriously, this should be a remake or a scam? The filmmakers missed the terrible mark here. Many viewers in the theater I joined went about halfway out of the movie. Which in retrospect I wish I had done, not me, but I had to torture myself and stick to it in the hope that it would be better Needless to say, the "horror" scene is a joke, not a lot of things because of the show. But because of the scripting direction "Special effects" and camera operation The movie manages to look as if they use luck to create it. But still coming out of it with a small budget movie I expect to see a dollar bill tag on some props and still think I'm going to see a porn star in the actor somewhere. <br /> <br /> This movie is scary. Is the future of horror with limited budget
