"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" contains most of the illustrated travels, illustrated illustrations for movies. The story has no reason and the characters fall into and out of the picture without explanation at all. When looking at this silly spoof, you will get more feelings than many other comments that can be accurately recorded: it is easy to create low-quality and cheap movies. One scene, the female swimmer is afraid of tomatoes floating near them. How far? "How to suspend unbelief" How far - even if mocked?) Although the title song is great (* 2/1)
