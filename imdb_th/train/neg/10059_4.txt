I expect to have a documentary that focuses on the tobacco industry in North Carolina, but I watched a man who knew that his great grandfather had lost his tobacco kingdom to the Duke family. Mr McElee has a victory over Duke. I suspect that Mr McElie will have problems with deaths from tobacco-related diseases I grew up near the area where my family began to do tobacco business. I expect more than McEwee's continued focus on his family. I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the North Carolina economy and how to make a difference to the state economy by tighter control of tobacco. The countless references to "Bright Leaves" aren't like that - and if Gary Cooper plays as a great grandfather of Mr. McElwee, viewers get an understanding of the role of tobacco in North's economy Carolina or not by showing old movie clips of the movie, assuming I can't.
