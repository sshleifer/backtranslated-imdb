The worst sequel, Part 1 has a very funny time - Part 2 is terrible (in a boring way) and obviously makes money from fans. <br /> <br /> Too bad Otto <br /> <br /> The only amusing moment in this movie is Helge Schneider that seems to be pis * ed about other characters. It's quite easy to identify with him ... <br /> <br /> The movie script is absurd / non-existent. The director should do everyone to help and leave immediately. The performance is worse than playing at grade 2. <br /> Technically, this movie is scary too. But who will blame the filmmaker / sounder who has to work with a director who is not responsible?
