The second movie in the boxset, formerly known as Bloodsuckers, is quite normal. It is quite boring in some parts. But there are good effects <br /> <br /> This film was born in the year 2210. Vampires have taken over the world. V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) Squad, which has its own spacecraft and led by Churchill Arrested by vampires, received messages from the world and teams founded by Quintana (played by Natassia Malthe), rookie officials, Damian and Rosa and Roman rebels. (Roman was played by Aaron Pearl on the wrong charge). After that, the V-SAN met with the leader of the Muco vampire, played by Michael. He doesn't have a plan to live with humans peacefully while he is bent on world domination. <br /> <br /> While this film is not a waste of time, I wonder if I will go back to play on a DVD Anytime soon
