Elizabeth Rohm is the weakest actor of ADA's laws and regulations and her performance is even worse here. Her efforts in the Texas accent were unskilled and unrealistic. She could not call the intense emotions necessary to play the mother of a child that was kidnapped enough. Sometimes, while her daughter is gone, she will send a nuisance, as if she can't remember where she left the key. <br /> <br /> This is really important. Actors' performances bring a lot of attention from the message. The remaining actors are capable enough. But they can't beat the trend of Rohm, just mimic the thick line underneath, especially when looking for real performances.
