This is not a bad movie at all. The plot (the new house built next door seems to haunt) is not bad. The mood is creepy enough and the performance is ok. The big problem I have is getting familiar with Lara Flynn. (From Twin Peaks and other items) I can't understand how she looks different from her new and big new lips. I'm still staring at them. They look out of place on her face! They made her look completely different. (And not better) <br /> <br /> Mark-Paul Gosselaar, the actor who played the architect Kim who designed and poured his heart and soul into the house and Lara (Loud Cole) was quite good (but these lips That!) As the next home owner Walker, her husband (Colin Ferguson) is made from wood properly. The characters that live in the house are also good. I especially like Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and Buddy (Stephen Amell), her husband, who was the first person to move in. Come home The attempt to engage with us in the surrounding atmosphere has failed. Unfortunately, other neighbors are not as fond. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the director cannot build a house. "Can be ugly, other movies (such as Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) manage to get a horrible feeling But it didn't happen here The closest is when Col draws a house. <br /> <br /> Another thing that doesn't work for me is the twisting plan that happened to Kim Architects. Initially, he seemed to be the victim of the house like everyone else (it sucked him dry, inspired) but later he seemed to join forces with evil. <br /> <br /> Overall, not bad. Horror movie fans if you can take your eyes off those big lips!
