Words cannot explain how scary this movie is. I hope it's "very bad" but not boring. It's lifeless and boring. It's terrible that I can't laugh. <br /> <br /> To respond to other posters, Ann-Marie Reef isn't the movie's highlight. The only one that is less charming is the director Brett Kelly, which is a true statement about the vanity. They both look like sisters, brothers and sisters. <br /> <br /> One girl, Sherry Terry, is a looker. In contrast to Anne-Marie, which is perfect - attracts this tall woman and willow and can act. Even if you can tell that she is carrying, <br /> <br /> All the actors seem to be arrested. I saw less wood in the rain forest. But he is still better than Kelly Why will Kelly forbid his actors from acting? Is he really a director? Others have concluded this perfectly - none. The kidnapped kid and Kelly stepped in to solve the crime. I know how he feels about stepping into the crab. It's what I feel after watching his movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I tried to get a refund from the rental shop. This is the best home movie that the director's friends see. (And if you search for them, you will see the same friend who is giving a positive rating to the movie)
