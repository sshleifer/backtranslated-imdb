At first I was not afraid of anything simple ... nothing except my few phobias. But this movie is really scary It's not suitable for children! I opened my mouth all the time. It shocked me. I didn't want to believe that it was full of blood for the children's movie. The rabbit was brutally murdered! It is not necessary to make horror and to be ranked. G. I recommend to be older than 8 to see this. But don't understand me wrong, it may be a good movie if I have no mental scars since I was a child. I do not want to believe that parents will allow children aged 4 years to see this story. It was intense and complicated, not forgetting the blood for young children. I watched more than 4, and I was shocked by the violence. I do not recommend.
