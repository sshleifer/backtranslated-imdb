I have read all Love Come Softly books and know that movies cannot use books in all aspects. But in general, they at least have the main points of this book. I'm very disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this film in this book is that Miss's father came to visit. (Although in both books, parents will come) that is all. The story is distorted and pulled away, and yes, sadly, from a book that I can't enjoy it. Although I didn't read the book, it was too sad. I know that Pioneer's life is rough. But all movies are worse Ranking for the same family orientation of movies that makes them great.
