I also saw this amazing "anime" at the London Sci-Fi Festival. If you have to watch this with a large audience, especially after a few beers, you may enjoy it <br /> <br /> I found a hilarious conversation stuck in my heart. Cremator's introduction to animation was terrible. It is poorly designed and poorly executed. It may be a good idea that the manufacturer will hire at least one person who is not a color blind person. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to say.
