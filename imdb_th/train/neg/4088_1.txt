This is an upstream event in my movie that looks at life. I went to see this in the cinema when it came out. I was very amazed at the badness of it. Such movies make you wonder who is the person who put money and owe anyone who likes - it is a very useful matter. The special technique is definitely the grade level, as in any first grader that can be done. he The bat rubber toy on the rope without trying to hide the bow lines that seem to be drawn on the film and appear to be an arrow that you find on the road sign and a laughing story. Ed Wood created a masterpiece compared to "Conquest" Every movie student should see this thing only so that they will know the definition of a bad movie.
