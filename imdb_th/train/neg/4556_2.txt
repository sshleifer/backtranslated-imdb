I don't know what other people think. The fact that this film was created independently makes it not scary. You can be as many believers as you want ... The majority of this movie is nonsense. I felt that I was insulted by having to watch the first 40 minutes of it. And that is not a small success, not only a terrible performance But the plot was never close to development There are many loopholes in the story to the point that you can hardly call it anymore. I have never read a book so I can't criticize it. But this is the first review I wrote here and is intended only to help all audiences that you spend an hour and a half in life I can't remember the last time I watched the movie. This really uses cake.
