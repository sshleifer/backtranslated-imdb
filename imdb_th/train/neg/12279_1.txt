Although this is a rather old show (2002), but I watched my first episode last night and I must say that it must be the worst item .. <br /> <br /> I'm not a person. Single comment But I was so shocked that the program was blatantly tried and I just thought that this was the target group. Children under 12 years of age, older people or people with IQ below average. <br /> <br /> When I was Was found last night, there are many discrete stories, trying to include every possible plot plot as imaginable. Family, religion and politics !!!. <br /> <br /> The basic story that they mentioned at this time: Frat House practiced wrongly with excessive alcoholic beverages - death became the son of a senator who wanted The FBI investigates. In fact, death is a murder by a peanut loser. Senators think that may be the enemy that swears and the best friend of his childhood that does this because the senator uses money. For voting on legislation. But in the end there was conscience Everyone is a suspect. But everyone has normal excuses (A former student who had married a married teacher had to lie to a dissatisfied student who reported that the victim had actually experienced a life-changing experience. Give money to many poor students) all the time that this stepson's heroine has her granddaughter, who is 'at that age' and is interested in a boy who eventually gets the courage to speak Talk with the help of her aunt But just to leave him because 'in' girls said that he was not good enough and in order for them to stay with her, she left him Don't worry, she comes back with the boys after she learns the truth about life and the girls 'drop'. Aunt then explains that God is the only one that she can really trust (now I'm almost sick). <Br /> <br /> This drama is much better when Sue and her FBI team discover who the murderer is. .. You will laugh at this thing. I'm sure .. <br /> <br /> It's one of the boys. Frat that was just discovered a year ago and His true identity is an international terrorist, and he tries to impress the real father by killing the boy and bombing the funeral...... <br /> <br /> The character is a cardboard show. That is cardboard. Continuity is cardboard. The story is cardboard. Anyone who says they love this show has cardboard for the brain. <br /> <br /> Why is the writer of this story? The show tried to pack every event in one show, meaning that they clearly didn't have the confidence to develop the character or the actor's ability to perform a simple line plot. Watching this show is like watching 'Last Action Hero' with Arnie, who killed 5,000,000 people, except Arnie is a better actor. (Wow, I never thought that one day I would say that!) <br /> In the words of Simpsons, the beloved character 'Cartoon Book' ... <br /> <br /> Worst TV Show .... EVER
