Need a good recipe for failure? Use the plot of **** to add some weak and undeveloped characters and leave in the worst special effects that horror movies know. To simmer for a week (The amount of time used to make this trash) The result is Corpse Grinders, a movie that brings bad movies to dangerous and very low places. <br /> <br /> The movie explodes fully. My words cannot convey pain. This is not one of the bad movies that you and your friends can sit and enjoy. This is not the 9th plan from space. Have seen I felt depressed when I realized that people spent real life to show in shit if you could call it a show. But again, when you have a bad direction, writing bad stories, everything is not good. Acting is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This movie is very nasty and disgusting. Afraid that a friend or loved one may see me and actually I can destroy every copy of this movie, so it won't make the filmmakers' minds want to thank Ted V. Mikels for respect. All movies I've seen You have shown me what is really scary and why I have to admire all those movies that are just crappy or boring.
