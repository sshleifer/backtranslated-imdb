I watched this movie with other adaptations that I can handle, including watching the drama in order to prepare for academic research. The movie is very moving, like music. Unfortunately, every life is taken away from the story. I have never seen the horrifying images of Rochester before. His most basic qualities have been gone. Where is his wisdom Where is his love Scott Rochester's resemblance to Rochester's foil, St. John's, rather than the characters from the novel In fact, the actors playing St.John in this adaptation played an enthusiastic St.John while Scott was pleased to smash things or stare at the ceiling. (Which he does all the time) I don't know what they are thinking I would like to rate this movie a little higher from the songs and the great movies. But I couldn't bear to watch this movie for too long because of George C. Scott's performance
