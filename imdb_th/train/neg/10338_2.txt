This movie is a simple matter. <br /> <br /> From the selection of Ralph Mucker as Mike Hammers to the pinnacle of this movie is an exercise that can Predictable, Mike's wood is one The real sociologist of the detective Which is different from Marlowe and the spades that combine parts to solve the mystery. Hammer breaks things out to get the truth. This movie transforms Hammer into a fool around him and the bad guys ... It's too stupid to go out with anything. One was pulled so badly that he had to suffer the popcorn attack. <br /> <br /> Other parts of this movie came from the play book of the Three Stooges. For example, the dance of Velda in Barrie. Or the bad guy who accidentally hurts his boss at the back And the continuous break was embarrassing: Frau Blucher was running along the center of the road when the camera was on her lower leg. But she returned to the side when the camera pulled back for a wider shot However, the worst destruction came before the popcorn attack. The bad guy stalks the hammer through the clock. After a second, our hero, except the watch, shows that he is seven minutes behind us. <br /> <br /> For justice, there are camera angles and interesting light and grand. Finale Terrible to see, which is the only reason that made it two points out of 10.
