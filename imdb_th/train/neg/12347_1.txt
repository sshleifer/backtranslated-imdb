This is the worst Ridley Scott movie. Ridley Scott is a great director. But this movie is a black mark in his career Demi Moore and Vigo Mortensen both were shocked in the movie beyond the expectation of a girl who would join the army. Very stupid. Anyhow, it's not difficult to create a movie like this. Everything the crew can do is anyone's idea. The author does not have much inspiration as well. Many silly conversations are not reasonable. And stupid actions I suggest to stay away from this garbage. I hope that many talented people involved in this project will know that these types of movies do not deserve attention, and in the future they will work in films that are more noble and intelligent than disorganized.
