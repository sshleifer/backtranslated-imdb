I don't know that Margaret Atwood is thinking of allowing this movie to have the same name as her book. I have always been a fan of The Robber Bride and are very excited to know that there are movies in the works. I know that translating books is not perfect. But this movie is the worst that has ever existed The name of the woman is correct and the latter is correct. But it's about it I felt like I wasted a lot of time trying to make it through this movie. This should be a mini-series that tells the story in a written way. <br /> <br /> Actors for Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia are well-selected - Louis Parker I just hope that they will have a better script to work with because this thing has nothing to do with the book.
