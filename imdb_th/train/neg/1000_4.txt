Plot for Descent. If you can actually call the plot, there are two important events. One near the beginning - one at the end These combined events may cause 5% of all movie time (and I mean _everything_) In the meantime, the director's effort to fill out the minutes I like movies that bother me like dark movies and I'm not suffering from scenes that are fierce - but if you expect me to sit and watch the scene with foggy / dark (literally) 60 minutes without a story Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses, completely lost here. And no, she didn't get naked even in the NC-17 version that I saw. <br /> <br /> If you have a few hours to throw away and want to see "Descent", take a nap - you might have More interesting dreams
