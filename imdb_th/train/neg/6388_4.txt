The Brothers Quay is a judge who judges the general idea to be stuck in creating a short film. I myself really like their first feature is Benjamin Eye Institute. But judging from their second year efforts, the piano tuner of the earthquake tuner Piano Tuner is a beautiful film that must be viewed and often listened to. Unfortunately, it's a painful thing to sit down to tell a complicated story and have a frozen rhythm. Read the summary. The synopsis seems to be very good. But the brothers failed miserably to bring it to life. One thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future: my divine conversation. It's scary here. Big breasts.
