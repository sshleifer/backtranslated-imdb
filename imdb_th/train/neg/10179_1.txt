This movie is embarrassing at major league franchises. I live in Minnesota and I don't want to believe that they left Cleveland. (Yes, I know that the true Indians are quite good and the twins have taken their positions at the bottom of the American League. However, I still love each other.) However, I love the first major league like second and always Looking forward to the third, when the Indians will eventually reach the series. You can't tell me that this is not a plan after the second film is complete. What happened? However, if you are a big fan of the major leagues that are your favorite and don't look at this junk
