I have not seen the original But just want to send a short message to everyone who moves down far: Wicker Man is the worst movie I have seen this year Maybe even in two years I wish I could request a refund from the theater or go back in time to remind myself that I would not see it. <br /> <br /> I'll give you two positive nods. From me and the view of the island is beautiful Sorry. That's it. Yelling here The story of this movie is driven forward because other characters do not give the answers that match Cage and he did this too !!! This will continue for an hour. (Less than a day in the movie) is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Don't say that the story is full of holes. You leave the theater with questions that do not have enough answers to fill the library. Anyone can read this script and think "Yes, people should pay $ 11 to see the shady outline of what the movie should look like" beyond me. <br /> <br /> Don't go see this flick. Or even rent on DVD
