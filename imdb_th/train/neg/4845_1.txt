There is no artistic value in this film that deserves any prize. It is not worthy of the audience as well. Ironically, one of the awards for filming But frankly, the movement of the camera is fumbling to say the least. Every frame you feel you get "full picture" like someone is "Crop your perspective" from the path of a pathetic story I will be honest. I can't see the whole movie. The most sucked part was when I saw the soldiers in the barracks and a soldier persuaded to drink. These scenes and other similar scenes remind me of Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> Follow my advice.
