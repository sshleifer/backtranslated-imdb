Alone In The Dark is one BAD movie and linked to Deuce Bigalow for the worst movie of the year. I hope that is all I have to say, but of course, IMDb determines the number of words and everything. <br /> <br /> I'm in my heart about what kind of bad movie is worse. Low budget wrecks like the Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos or the big budget disgrace such as Gigli, Superbabies or guff. You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos happen because the director doesn't have a clue. This kind of movie happened because the director was an idiot who caught an idiot that ignores his audience. <br /> <br /> It's more shocking when you think of Uwe Boll (the mastermind behind the scandal. This shocking thing, then there is a real garbage beneath his belt.) Create something that happens only once in the blue moon. The horror movie is really bad. Everything about it is a mess. Cheesy CGI, a bad story, crazy camera cuts and a terrifying soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Alone In The Dark is a scary movie that no one else looks at. Seek to boo! The review is more than asking me to roll my eyes in 2006 and I won't talk about it anymore. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie.
