I'm like other Bachchan fans who are eagerly waiting for the creation of Sholay. This movie is not. Thank God that they are not allowed to use the name "Sholay" in the movie name. The remake of Ram Gopal is not as good as the name. Camera work, location, costumes, outings, dance, all conversations combined to create the worst movie I have ever seen. You wonder if the actors agreed to create this movie because they wanted money and Ram Gopal paid a lot of money for the actors. The only ant that is not paid is the ant, which is similar to the first movie. Abishek's role is totally ridiculous. Does he need money to arrange a wedding for Ash? Save money, mind and time. Don't worry about this movie or DVD when it comes out.
