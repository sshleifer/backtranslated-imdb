I would say that this is the worst gay movie I've ever seen. But I can say that this is the worst movie if any type of movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> You know you have a problem when the movie starts with "Personal notes" from the director asking the "understanding" of the audience for "Many challenges" faced by the director for the first time The sound track is terrible in many scenes, almost impossible to track the dialogue and from the DVD. The version is not good, bad set, bad photography, bad script, generally acting at Not all good combined to make this "movie" impossible to see. I made it through to the end that was not good after trying many times and handed out the DVD that I bought stupidly immediately. I'm sure there are many challenges faced by the director for the first time. But do not try to break through this weak effort as a finished product. I see from IMDb details that this is not just Richard Natale's first directing effort, but also the only thing. That is one good thing that I can say about the alleged "movie".
