I do not know anything about you But what I like about Tom and Jerry's cartoons is the interaction between the two characters. The mouse in Manhattan saw that Jerry left Tom behind to go on an adventure in New York, and as far as I was concerned, this person suffers from a lack of cats. Jerry 'Big Apple' may be because of other T&J fans who have commented here on IMDb. I can't wait for this junk to end myself, so I can watch the next cartoon on my DVD. < br /> <br /> Actually Well, that's where I have truly enjoyed was when Jerry almost 'bought the farm' hanging on the end of a candle deteriorated horribly hundreds of feet above the busy street.
