This is a "cute" movie. At first, then there was the best and most boring song. <br /> <br /> There is too much English to say with King James. But annoying in today's world Easy to interpret Can you imagine a young person today trying to listen to this movie? Forget it. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has a fine line here and probably "Hank Martin". Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") is the same, besides looking good and beautiful. There is a long red hair. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie that has a good ending and I can't do that. It may be worth renting for historical purposes, or if you are a big Crosby fan but not a whole lot.
