Probably because I am still innocent and without a brain when I see it, this movie is the cause of many insomnia for me. I haven't seen it since I was in the seventh grade at the Presbyterian school, so I'm not sure if it will affect me at this time. However, I would say that it impressed me ... and most of my friends At least until we are old enough and have enough knowledge to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly shocked by the things that Christians who had received a new heart had to suffer when not receiving the mark of the beast. I do not want to make a movie for those who do not watch, so I will not talk about the details of the scene. But I can still imagine them in my head ... and it was 19 years
