Why does one person go back to find someone who kicks them in their teeth not only once, not the second time? But time after time, <br /> <br /> This film teaches us to search for the love we have to accept abuse (not just forgiveness. But fully accept) Gosh! No wonder that my first relationship lasted only ten years. Obviously, I didn't embrace my inner gangster. <br /> <br /> While Bucatinsky's writing debut, there are many wonderful aspects for this film. However, in order to justify the integration of Eli and Tom, character development will be more useful. We have never been familiar with Eli's masochism. In fact, we are led to believe that he is not a socialist, although Tom's emotional and psychological sadness is very clear.
