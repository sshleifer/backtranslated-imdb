What I hate about this show is bad writing. These women do not have self-respect or dignity. The whole plot is that they throw themselves at them. Amanda's ability to lose completely She is good at "All That" and her acting. Why did they write her with Jenny Garth that was ridiculous, air-headed, desperate, chasing after the "elder" young man outside me? <br /> <br /> Their plans Whenever the characters in his cartoon are not on the screen, Poochie "Everyone should ask all, talk about some men, then howl speaks to men. Sometimes they change it and the men groan instead. Then they came together or broke up. At the end, 2 women were either shallow or sexually attached. The only word I can think of is "bad".
