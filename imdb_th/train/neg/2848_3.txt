... so I thought I would say some words about William McNamara. It's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in a busy time - obviously he pumped to get this role There is a long continuous scene in the cave that he has to drag into his inner clothes. There is a little story that he must pursue after Miss Elena Mack in the movie with his hands. William McNamara is a small person. But by nature he is a skilled and good person There is also a time when he gets up from the bed. If you stop the action temporarily at the right time, you can see all the Enchilada. Sailor in "Road travel" is I just want to thank Dennis Hopper for his equal opportunity. William McNamara can show? Heck if I know
