Words cannot explain how stupid this story is. (And make this movie bad)! Basinger, Del Toro ... What do you think? So there are department stores and parking lots. Basinger's characters go to buy a cup of tea and packaging paper. <br /> <br /> When she comes out, all the places are so empty. Although she lived there when she drove away from the baddies, she went to the most remote places and possible godfather instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place? Come !!! I'm not going to go into the shameful red tool box because everyone else has done it before. Don't say that you kill one wise thug. <br /> <br /> This is very silly without logic At least I just remind you to see it. It's really a waste of time !!
