It's a mess! Why does this movie happen? This film and other films of "ability" should be a teaching tool about how to not make movies. Children may like it, but anyone who is older than 10 years may or disagree Making matters worse is the fact that great talents such as Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl are wasted in movies that are not worthy of notification.
