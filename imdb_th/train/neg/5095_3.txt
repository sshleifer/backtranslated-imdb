I watched this movie this evening, forcing myself to stick with it, even though I had never been interested in characters or things that happened to them because both of them were leaders. Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan were movie stars in Their era Want to see them in "Something different" is definitely this thing. They both performed well. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is about a small town in Mexico that is inhabited by almost all nasty characters. (Doctor, of course, is an important exception). What Michèle Morgan had seen in Philippe fell in love with him was never explained. <br /> <br /> This thing should have come from the work of Jean-Paul Sartre. I can imagine that if Sartre's work was like this movie, it would have to try to imitate Camus 'The Plague' expert novel, which dealt with the epidemic in North Africa. <br /> <br /> A movie That can be screened well But not interesting
