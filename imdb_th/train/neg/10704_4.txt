It's Die Hard. Meet Cliffhanger when the ski resort is terrorist, surrounded and Jack. (Nutcracker Jack) is up to the police to stop this thing. <br /> <br /> B-action movies borrowed from other movies and quite good. With a fairly good action, a ridiculous plot (As always in these movies) and three stars of good quality Thomas Ian Griffith is a police officer and Nastas Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you don't like stupid B-action movies, this isn't right for you.
