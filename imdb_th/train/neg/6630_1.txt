This remake is called terrible. I went to see tonight .. on the first day due to expectations and advertising than I could manage. But within the first half hour, we know that this is a disaster. It not only does not match the ads created. But still insulting the original blockbuster The script has a few loopholes. The mess is quite a few times. Mohanlal, who is a great actor, works well. Amitabh doesn't matter .. The director wants to show how evil his characters are. But he went down a little water, which resulted in a powerful Ajay smooth, especially in this type of role was disappointed as well Do not let even start with a new man Prashant .. That person is not proud to start a career with something like this. Rajpal Yadav, who was thrown in a few people, can't even get a smile from anyone because of humor His powerful and treble Nisha Kothari proves that she is one of the worst actresses we have today. Overall, the RGV that I think is one of the talented and talented directors. In India, the most talented ever faced .. failed miserably. He picked up a great challenge and responsibility to create what is known as the best Hindi movie ever.
