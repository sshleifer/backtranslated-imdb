One of Frances Farmer's first films; At the age of 22, she was absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby had a good voice, but the song wasn't his best song. Martha Ray and Bob Burns are interesting people. But their jokes might be great at that time. Roy Rogers also appeared - in the singing role. In my view, worth watching if you are a Frances Farmer fan and may be a Bing Crosby fan.
