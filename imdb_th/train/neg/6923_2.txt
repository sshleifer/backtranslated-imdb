A terrifying Mexican movie based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story about a journalist who wants to enter a hospital hidden in the woods to write stories about how to work, etc .. . When our hero Gaston From the great performances of Dr. Maillard, the head of the hospital, we saw all the horrible things, such as men hanging in dungeons for a long time and funny, like our heroes were teased by soldiers. He climbed down the stairs hanging on the side of the building. Then there is an image that seems to be both human and human, dressed like a chicken. This scene is a funny highlight of the movie. But at least for me it is the lowest point of the movie and the most disgusting when you think that men and women who grow up think this may be entertainment from a distance. Ah! That is the real horror movie that Dr. Tarr and Legion of Name Changes, and that has given me the obvious truth about this film, which is the most movies that undergo many changes, often with some serious problems. Yes, this is obvious. But some people have problems with product distribution and others, which are subject to this, have changed many titles so that some people may buy the same garbage more than once without doubt. This is absolutely garbage. It can go very little. The only actor who is worth watching is Claudio Brook as the head of the hospital. He is a large ham, as he laughs crazy about ordering a sash line with a sword in his hand and praising the chicken. I'm very tired to hear him talk about "Comfort system" is his method of treating mental illness. It's a laughing matter. (Hey, this movie that has this kind of script deserves this word). Soon you will figure out what happened in the hospital and will not be interesting anymore. Scratch the movie cock!
