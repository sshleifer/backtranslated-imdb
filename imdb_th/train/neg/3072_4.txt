Margaret Lawrence may not have intended to apply her novels to movies. Hagar as a character is a person who constantly challenges social norms (Gainsay, who dares anyone?) And ends up sacrificing her humanity in the process. The symbols in the book (Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc.) are reminders of old and new fights and killings (to speak) all the time. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is honest with the story Of books (But it's not the story that really tells the story?) I think it missed the point of capturing the spirit of this movie. Hagar's resistance (For the sake of resistance) Not there. Bram should have more rudeness than the picture, and Hagar's father played better. "According to tradition" to say, if the filmmakers insist that it will present a stronger image, this movie will bring issues to the house. <br /> <br /> In the same vein, why should we see mobile phones producing organic products? And other modernities. We're trying to do some points to do some points. (Like Muslim fans and indigenous people) Hagar and the company are everything but politically correct in the book, so why do we see it in the movie version? Modernity may be an excuse for low-budget operations. But using that as an excuse to send a subliminal political message that is not related to the entire novel (And movies) seems to be a lower-than-intelligence punch. <br /> There is also an audience. It seems that we are determined to see a bitter, cute and cute old man. Why should laugh every time Hagar is in her anger? I wonder if Magaret Laurence wants readers to laugh or with Hagar. These people are frustrated and full of suffering and what we do is laugh at them. I don't think Hagar and others in her situation will get justice.
