Maybe I'm not a complicated person. This story and intimacy is a movie about two brains that I have seen recently, and both of them suffer from the same problem severely to the point of excitement. The conversation is false, false, false. Nothing comes out of the mouth of anyone who believes in the distance. Perhaps the way to set this movie is the way it should be felt. But it is not acceptable and boring. I walked out after 20 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> I'll be with the Sleeper and Bananas for my Woody Allen correction. If I've ever seen this in TT I'll turn around and try to find Quincy instead.
