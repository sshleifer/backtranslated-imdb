This is the reason why many people still do not have a place to live .. because stupid manufacturers pay to create horrible movies like this instead of donating if they can disturb. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad. More than white chicks! The little man has a weak excuse for resting the dwarf larva like a baby. The story is terrible when considered written by six people. The idea is still not bad, even though it is real and not a cartoon episode. It has a funny time But some people do a lot and some people are stupid. The performance is very bad, so the supervision is Everyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves. It's a class and a disgusting dwarf. I mean instead of showing sympathy for them, filmmakers enjoy them! It makes me shun how they do. They saw that the dwarves were like babies. And for the dwarf character to pretend to be an abandoned baby just to receive diamonds from one family That is a weak excuse for performing something like that. It's not worth it Don't watch this movie. Is a waste of time and huge money
