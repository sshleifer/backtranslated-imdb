Seeing CBS "Dorothy's surrender", I always wondered why Diane Keaton wanted to be there. (Not because it was a television movie - with a fascinating role for younger actresses such as Keaton, turned to the TV - but because it had no chance for Keaton to shine), the only mother who regrets death The sudden death of twenty of her daughters was demanded - and gradually became friends with - a group of young people that her daughter was approaching when an accident occurred. Adapted from this novel, this teleplay gives us a group of characters that are preoccupied with themselves, one will cross the road to avoid In addition to the roughness and dimness, these scams are incredibly unbelievable, just like the orderly situation and the bungalows near the beach where the children live. (A young man wearing a tank top to tell us that he is gay Heard that Diane Keaton Surrender to Dorothy and really ask "come from" Wizard of Oz "right?" ... not genius. It's from "Citizen Kane"!) Keaton may want to do this based on the content of the confrontation. With death She tried to change this unique woman into the shadow of her character (many kooky outfits), but it wasn't as good as the audience because Keaton was a favorite and warm in an uneven style. Here she is a crazy harpist who has not learned many lessons in the journey of self-discovery. (This film forgot about a young woman who died quickly and became an Odyssey for the remains of the mother's nerves that seemed to be a hippie beyond age. Who has never lost anyone close to her?) This is the type of movie actor who promotes talk shows with caveat. "It should help the mother who is very sorrowful there." I couldn't imagine that it would help everyone because it was confusing and confused. It's crazy.
