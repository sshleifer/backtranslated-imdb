I apologize to the fans of this movie. But it's the worst thing I've ever seen Slowly throwing badly and acting badly, it's a movie that tries to escape the dangerous romcoms in the past few years and has failed! McDonald and Parker seem to be unable to convey true feelings and lifelessness. They seem to be in this for checking any pay they get it and not because they think it's a good idea. The story is DULL !! I love chick movies that are as big as the next woman and this is not one !! If you avoid one movie this year .... let it be
