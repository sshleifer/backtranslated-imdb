Wow. I went to the video store tonight because I was in a bad mood for the horror movie B and I found this gem. I look at the cover and I think it looks like just a movie for my emotions. I brought it home and put it on. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the B Horror movie that I have in my heart. This is much worse. I want a bad movie But what I received I didn't know that this kind of shit exists in humans. This movie seems to be writing and directing this movie for 5 years and it's a good story about it. <br /> <br /> I'm a director who is looking Direct movie He needs to work at the garbage pile, which is his home. <br /> <br /> If you think of renting or buying it I will tell you the same way that I will tell someone who is ready to commit suicide. "Don't do it. Not worth it!" I have nothing good to say about this movie. Don't do it!
