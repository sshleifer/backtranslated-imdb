It's terrible. Andie Macdowell is an awesome actor. Made of wood, she makes the rocking horse seem like it will work better But remember that in the West West Tree Another movie that shows that England is full of chocolate box huts and green leafy vegetables. I mean, how many schools are there other than Hogwarts? The twee police station looks like a set from the Heartbeat (a nasty British series in the 60s). This movie can't make it true. It's like - a funny movie or a serious examination of the stream of women's friendship. If it's stuck to the past, the sex scenes in the cemetery and the crazy attacks of the wedding may be effective (I just say), but those scenes do not work with the tragedy in the second half. I found that it was unlikely that Kate would speak to Molly again after her bad behavior. Last note - What is the best actress, Staunton, in this pile? No need to mention Anna Chancellor Macdowell should stick with anti-wrinkle creams.
