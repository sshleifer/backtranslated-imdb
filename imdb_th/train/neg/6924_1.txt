If this movie is worse than that, it will be directed by Uwell. This ridiculous mess makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. For a long time, I saw this steam. But I remember that I wanted to do serious harm to all those involved. Everyone can make this movie more than 1 star. I am amazed by the beauty of everyone who has watched this rag. I give one star because there is no lower score. All copies of this film should be burned with salt-filled soil and reserved as a landfill for the most toxic waste. One copy should not be kept in special high-level security and only shown to the film producer as an example of what to do.
