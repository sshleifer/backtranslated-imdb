The Wicker Man starring Nicolas Cage is not a good movie. But I can't say that it is something that I regret to see I can go ahead and in the negative aspects of the movie, such as horrifying performances and lengthy scenes where Cage is looking for a girl with hallucinations followed by hallucinations, followed by a hallucination of dreams But it is not worth it to stay when it comes to movies like this This is the five reasons you should watch The Wicker Man, even if it's not good: <br /> <br /> 5 It's hard to deny that it has truly creepy thoughts. The only problem is that Is an unintentional and funny action If nothing else, this is a movie that may inspire you to watch the first film of 1973, or even read a short story that is about the movie <br /> <br /> 4 for a horror / thriller. Really delightful Obviously it was filmed in place instead of using a green screen or a complex scene, so we saw a very beautiful view. In addition, there are a lot of images. It's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> 3 Nicolas Cage is not an actor because he is the power of nature. Whether you are his girlfriend or not, it seems impossible that Cage will play "ordinary people" with some unusual or unusual things that he brings to the characters he plays and personally I am intrigued. Always watching him in every movie he does, regardless of whether Nicolas Cage is great or bad. He often brings his unique energy to play and he never gets tired of watching. He is a scary person in The Wicker Man, but in the most magical way. <br /> <br /> 2 Students may write articles in this movie because it seems to be the strongest anti-feminist film ever. Come "look?" You can write that "This is what happens when women are allowed to conduct business in society!" In addition, similarities between societies "Summerside" and the bee colony are quite interesting and noticeable. <br /> <br /> 1 If you're reading this, it may be a good chance that you might see a very popular YouTube video: Collection of "highlights" from the film, including Cage, running around in a bear costume, and of course, infamous "AAGHH !! BEES !! MY MY !!! !!!" These hilarious scenes outside the context and They are still quite funny while watching them completely. <br /> <br /> I bought a good-looking DVD. None of approximately $ 5 spent at Blockbuster ... when you do that. It's about the dollar against reason. It is a good deal. <br /> <br /> Note: Movies that are not classified as the best version to watch, and it's better to watch the stage to add a little epilogue. Cameo from James France.
