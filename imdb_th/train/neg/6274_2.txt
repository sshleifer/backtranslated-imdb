I am generous to this movie about 2 stars. "You've seen the Wizard of Oz" is the best part for me! With poor writing and acting in this film, it is not surprising that there are many people entering the reality TV show worth Do yourself a favor and leave home and hit the dynasty baseball game. You'll be glad you did!
