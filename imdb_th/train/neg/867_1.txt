I have quite high hopes for this film, even though it has received bad checks on paper. I was very strong and I watched the whole movie. I feel sick at the end. <br /> <br /> Although I am not a sensitive person or sensitive to movies that are not tacky - I like both Woody Allen and everything you want to know about sex. . 'And Michael Hanneke's' Funny Games' - I find that the director is passionate with this ten years who want to drink the milk of women that are completely nasty. And when this film was climaxed in "Orgy" that the boy drank his mother's milk just like the woman he was lusting after the whole movie. I almost vomited with disgust for all the distortion and mood swings. <br /> <br /> Don't Understand me wrong. I like most European movies, including movies created by myself, so this flick should make me very happy. Avoid this movie at all costs, it should be relegated to record history as a lesson in a bad movie.
