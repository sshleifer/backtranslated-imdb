Fred Olen Ray is a lousy director, even though being a director of B movies, but 'Haunting Fear' may be one of his better films. Yes, it makes the story of the great 'Premature Burial', and yes, it's a bad rhythm and unevenness. But it was quite fun. Queen Brinke Stevens Scream is better than usual, like a fragile housekeeper with a worthless husband. (J. Richardson) is planning to go with her because he needs money to pay for the gangster Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many early softcore films in the 90s, to achieve that performance. The best in this movie You will enjoy a small chapter played by Karen Black as a psychologist, Robert Clark, as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a good movie in a better scene. The ending is not reasonable!
