This is the most depressing movie I've ever seen. The first time I saw it as a child and even thinking about it now makes me really angry. I know that it was created during times of difficult life and I know that these people are poor and the plants are important. Yes, I understand. The thing that I'm hard to do is I can't remember one moment at a time in all movies. Maybe it is true to life, I don't know. I'm pretty sure that the performance is great and the direction and quality of the filming, etc. is great and I know that every movie can't end happily That needs entertainment from movies I can't stress how this movie affects me as a child. I'm talking about it recently and all the sad memories come back. I think it should have all but access to the heartless Prozac.
