The only worst movie I have ever seen in a movie theater. I saw this film at the Austin Film Festival in 2004 and it made me think that this film was accepted at the festival. It is an interesting evidence and it looks like it goes somewhere. But they break down every time they try to do something First of all, if you are performing a musical, find someone who has musical talent. The song consists of playing a magical piano that sounds like it is playing in the stereo system in the room they're shooting. The lyrics were written horribly, and when they were not clear, they composed a lamenting poem which showed how much they were stretched to try to make the film work And you think you will find someone who can sing when doing a drama, right? Not in this case Fortunately, they are talking half / half singing in the most touching. But when they sing it makes me cringe Especially when they try to sing in harmony And that's just music Some performances are quite good. But many conversations are terrible, like most scenes Obviously they don't have enough news on the scene or they just have bad editors because they regularly jump over the line and use scary options while cutting the film. At least the director is willing to accept that no one wants the script until they add a hook to make it a musical. I hope investors have to make sure that someone can write songs before making mistakes again.
