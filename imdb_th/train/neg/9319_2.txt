I don't know what you said. The first time I watched this movie with my two friends, we couldn't stop crying. This is one of the most fun shits I've ever seen. The comments about pornography are correct, though. Hahaha. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is really bad, not to mention the expensive cameras they have ever shot! It seems that one of those movies that came out of my drivers, props, looks like they are coming out of the high school drama. The song sounds like it came from the original Nintendo game. The only thing that scared me about this movie is that it has a killer clown that doesn't creep out of fat. Hahaha. If people are constantly watching this thing, they have to be careful of the verbal errors of the actors, such as speaking words. Hahahaha. I die. <br /> <br /> Susan
