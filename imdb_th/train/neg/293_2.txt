This film is about some girls in a Catholic school who have problems because they put red dyes in their school friends shampoo and after being blamed for this action, they decided to travel to Florida to vacation On the way, they met some men in a local restaurant and decided that they would meet each other later. The girls ended up on the road near the forest and stopped for a while, while a girl decided to walk around. She saw the murder that the local sheriff was involved in. She was scared and ran to tell others what had happened. Other women decided to go and see her and the two of them were killed by the murderer. Then the two remaining girls were arrested by the murderer and locked in a local jail. While the deputy sheriff takes care of the children, and although they insist that the sheriff is a murderer, he ignores them both and acts as an ignorant person and others in this movie that cannot gather the detective detective there. The best part is the rape scene between the murderer and one of the girls he decides to rape her in her cell and looks like the girl wants to rape her. This guy and the bare chest scene that I admit well, but before their lips found that he had other things in his mind, this movie reminded me of the "Blood Song" low-price horror movie with Frankie Avalon, who was staring. It's the same motivation, just the parts of the characters. It's not a movie that is rented, not even with the low-cost movies of the 1980s and the ending is the worst ending I've ever seen in movies and movies. Makes me want a refund!
