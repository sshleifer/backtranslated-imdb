I received a DVD of "Bogeyman" and this stunker is a special feature. I think it is "Boogeyman II" because it is paired with the original. But you know what they say about those "fictitious": it makes "goodbye -" out of "you -" and "me". To the love of the actress while watching "Return of the Boogeyman" I decided to circle in the original video to see the death scene with the famous toothbrush. Before I knew that this film ended up racking up. I think I think this is BII because it has a name similar to one of the BII alternate names. br /> Let me stop talking about my mistakes and start talking about movie mistakes. Many mistakes. Who is Ulli? What is he thinking? He thinks that the same movie will be sold in different ways or not. Nothing is the first part of holding III. It is a retrospective of the original through the eyes of the psychic that allows us to play by the grueling play when everything happens. That is the movie Oh and one scene that must die with stereo But you can read other people's reviews My interest in "Boogeyman II" is gone forever. <br /> <br /> Final Note: This is not a movie that has to look back.
