A worthless movie created for a television movie that tracks the killer. The ants become a mysterious killer ant near the hotel. I think it comes from the food of the hotel because the sewage from the hotel kitchen will drain directly into the ant bed. There is a lack of doubt in this film and it is not scary as well. Seeing many ants sting their victims is not terrible. <br /> <br /> Spoiler He said that the health inspector said that ants could not be a hero. It must be a mysterious virus. After the inspectors say this, the hero will bring a bulldozer and destroy the large ant colony. This disturbs millions of people and traps people in the hotel. <br /> <br /> End the overall spoiler. I do not understand why it was released on DVD when a movie that deserves a lot. The only thing I guess for the DVD release is Suzanne Summers has a feature in the movie. This is a movie that should be avoided.
