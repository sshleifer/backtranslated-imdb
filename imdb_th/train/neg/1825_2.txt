I'm not sure. I can't laugh. I have an open mind I don't want to be a tight person - @ ss about this. But I'm serious to not laugh in this movie. It's not funny for me. Partly it seems that Ben Stiller and Jack Black tried too hard. Just because you have made two very funny men together doesn't mean this is a great joke. Some movies should not be done. This is one of them. Because it was a lot of old jokes and the acting was stupid I know I know it's a joke. Sort from at least But I'm not impressed. I'm sorry. But I can't give anything lower than these two things. And that's all I give <br /> <br /> 2/10
