With movies like this, you know that you will get the usual joke about ghosts. Eva as a funny ghost. And other actors do well as well It is the direction and story that is missing. That may be overlooked that the jokes work better. The only problem is that there are not many jokes. Of course, I laughed twice. In addition to talking parrots, there is still no creativity to be noticed in the movie. I blame the director for not using evidence for the full potential. Eva certainly has more acting skills. But didn't have the opportunity to do that Overall, this movie is suitable for Sunday afternoons. In addition, it can be completely cross
