"Scary Movie 2" is an awesome franchise release. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 are all good. But this one is boring and not very funny. Fortunately, they performed after the film and created two more horror films. <br /> <br /> This film is about a group of teenagers who have been tricked into their haunted mansion. At night, things started to go wrong. Then they realized that they had to escape. <br /> <br /> This film isn't scary. But they can improve something It's a little fun and if you like other movies in the Scary Movie franchise, you should give this watch - but I don't think you like it very much.
