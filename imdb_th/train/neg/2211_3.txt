Ha ha ha ha !!!!!! That's funny. It makes this movie one word. The shit is "things" because it might kill me to use movie words!?!?! I hope the director, writer and Producer doesn't mean that this thing will come out well because I'm not sure !!! Scientists transformed his son into a hammerhead shark and the shark killed a lot of people invited by scientists to the island !!! Oh, I'm Gooooooodddd !!!! I hate this movie so much that when I watched it, I laughed at the serious part because they looked repetitive and unprofessional .... and they couldn't make the sharks look even more unrealistic even though this was "Things" have a smaller budget than most low-cost movies, most of all I have to say is watch this movie, expecting to laugh at bad performances and silly conversations. If you expect a good movie. Will be very disappointed
