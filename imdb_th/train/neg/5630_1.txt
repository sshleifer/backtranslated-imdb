The only reason I watched movies until the end was "hope" to see interesting things. This movie is really bad and the girl's performance is really bad. Actually, I'm not a movie critic who is not an expert. But you just have to have common sense to observe that this job is terrible. <br /> <br> The first thing that came into my mind as soon as she started talking was: "She has a relationship with Willem Dapho. And he accepted to help her in the screenplay and appeared in her movie since she was a great director. ".. Surprised surprised the next day after I watched a movie I found on the internet that Giada Colagrande was his wife Ask he Great stories and terrible performances
