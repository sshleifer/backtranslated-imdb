I watched the lake side cabin yesterday afternoon in the United States. Considering that this film was created for TV, it is interesting enough to watch the sequel. So I listened to broadcast this evening and was very disappointed. I know I don't like movies. But I don't think it's confusing to use DV (digital video). This movie could be tolerated if not because of the same digital shock that seems to come from nowhere. I expect the plot to be associated with these images. But there seems to be no reasonable explanation. (Warning: The following followers may be spoilers !!!!) The ending that opens in the Cabin on the lake is acceptable. But the ending that was opened in the next sequel was ridiculous. I can see the return of the return to the cabin by the lake that can only be seen when the movie is shown against anything but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning
