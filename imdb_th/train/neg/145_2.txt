There are a lot of plays that are played on the impressive Valentine topic that I don't know where to start. I will say this though; This is a movie that made me suffer from the complexity of the Valentine cards that we had distributed in elementary schools. You know, the movie Batman exclaimed, "You are the ultimate crime fighter!" <br /> <br /> Valentine's Day is a movie that has a fast attack. Ignoring the influence of Scream, the villain is a well-rounded and invulnerable person. Heroes are easily scared when people run around the corner and grab them by shouting their shoulders. "HeyIjustleftmycoatbehind!" The score is higher than Norman Bates's mother. <br /> <br /> The subtle story of many childhood friends is now growing up and bent. Since the film does not give anything to them again, they wait and wait until the person who falsely wears a mask will kill them one by one. This stalker appears to be a former Jeremy Melton fool who was rejected by women and constantly defeated by men in high school. By approaching Valentine's Day, women began to receive scary cards for telling. Melton's punishment seemed to be a clear suspect. The only problem is that, as many characters warned in the past thirteen years, Melton may have changed his appearance to be a movie and so handsome (with a scary gape). Everyone is a suspect! <br /> <br /> This is one problem. In order to have doubts while watching Valentine, you have to accept the fact that high school can become David Borenaz. Nerds do not become an angel when they grow up. They become old people. He is not an awesome actor. But the script by not less than four writers makes him and the rest of the actors do nothing but sing and do it. Denise Richards (Hollywood's most active actor who has never performed in Baywatch) is extremely useful. The most embarrassing of the obvious excuses for her to wear a swimsuit before a major suspect. Note to yourself: Bring a swimsuit to a Valentine's Day party. Just because it is February, does not mean that you may not feel like you want to soak in water. <br /> <br /> Dress up in a Valentine dress in black from head to toe with the cherub mask. This is the second problem. The filmmakers think clearly that this will be a nuisance to someone's head that is hitting people in the face with hot irons. Plain and simple, it's not But it makes me wonder if a man with a mask covering his entire face, including his eyes and ears, can move secretly without hitting his shin on a chair or table Then again, when the thing that the Cupid killer made, he could sometimes pass the distance and his eyes were in his hand. <br /> <br /> Not only is it a bad movie? But still not sure who the murderer is "twisted". The last one is "Huh?" Than "Ha!" When you don't scratch your head, yawning and groaning Don't watch this movie. Even if you are alone on Valentine's Day, find something to do. You will be glad you did.
