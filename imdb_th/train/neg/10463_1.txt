This movie has many promises. I am very excited about this movie. In the end, it's ridiculous, the best, the most painful. The show style ran out of scope really flat. (Angels, wives and daughters) to animation (Casper's character) I feel that the dialogue is just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of the real person trying to talk. Pay special attention to the scene about "mistakes". It is an insult to the ability of the audience to find things. However, in the defense of that scene, it was the biggest laugh of all the movies. I read that they spent a lot of money on traveling abroad. Unfortunately they didn't take advantage I do not feel that I was sent to an exotic place. Everyone can insert a stock video of the Colosseum in Rome. However, in order to end with a positive recording, I think the scene is quite good. I like the graphics displayed on the decoded computer. It's my opinion (And that's all) that if the SCHMALTZ factor is much lower and the ACTION factor will increase dramatically, this movie will be good
