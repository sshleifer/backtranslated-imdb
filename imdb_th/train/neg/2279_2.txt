The boy is so busy. But it took only an hour and I paid only so I would live .... unlike all actors in the year In 1933, with all dust. <br /> <br /> The next small village started to have their bodies and their blood running out. The local yogurt began to talk about the vampires. Slightly after finding the bodies of each city, sheriff or police Or whatever he was shown by the great actor Melvin Douglas, trying to tell them otherwise when he mentioned the fact that the dead had one large hole on each side of the neck instead of two holes near The villagers said that Being a giant vampire vampire, the police insist that vampires do not exist and that they must be the perpetrators of murderous humans. <br /> <br /> But Melvyn doesn't seem to care too much either way. He spends most of his time trying. To get in his girlfriend's pantaloons played by Faye Wray. In addition, this mix is ​​a simple city played by Dwight Frye, who seems to have the same role in every film he made. With the townspeople by catching bats and drinking their own blood, Lila At will play Doctor Muang who seems to be trying to help the police solve the crime. He used to have a foul odor as an actor, being close to cardboard in this role as much as he could, and Lionel Barrymore was in this ... many big names that were piles. Bats <br /> <br >> In addition to the name of the terrible mistake that this movie has with other names, "The Blood Sucker" is much better. This movie is boring and funny and ridiculous. <br /> < br /> For me, the issue of the movie is watching. Strange Birds But apart from him, this movie doesn't offer much, and when you search for the cause of the strange death and see the special things that require all this blood, you I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi has taken many scary pictures. But at least he was fun and interesting to see Of this film is a terrible Lugosi gangster without Lugosi and you can feel how bad this mess is if you can't make horror movies in the 1930s, at least put Lugosi in it.
