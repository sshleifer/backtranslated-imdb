Legacy of blood begins with the arrival of lawyer Tom Drake (Norman Bartold) for the dean of the original land owned by Christopher Dean (John Carradine). Now, when he died he was greeted by the four children of Mr. Dean Gregory. (Jeff Morrow) His wife, Laura (Mersder), Victoria (Faith Domain, Guido), Johnny (Richard Davalos) and Leslie (Brooke Mills) & Carl Iain Burke Drake played a tape recording that they were late after his father's wishes after he died. A $ 136 million land will be divided equally between his four children if someone should die. Then the money will be divided. Evenly between the rest To die a dishonest servant Elga (Ivy Bethune), Igor (Buck Kartalian) and the more famous Frank (John Russell), the more pocket Not satisfied with the quarterly share of $ 136 million (which is still nearly $ 35 million in 1971, which doesn't sound too bad for me). Some people decide that they want everything on their own and not long before the head. Headed up to the fridge ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Roy Monson Blood Legacy made me disappointed in two accounts. For beginners, the alternate title of this movie is the Legacy of Blood, which is the title of a horror movie directed by Andy Milliagn back in the year '78, which I would like to see. Similar stories & when I checked the cable TV guide on the Legacy of Blood screen, I was excited because it said that it was Milligan's movie and also stated that he was a director so when I sat down to see & I heard John Carradine's voice & I then knew that it wasn't Milligan's movie that I wanted to see my heart sink. Of course, there is a simple truth. But it is undeniable that Blood Legacy is a piece of all that is really painful to watch all the time. The script by Monson & Eric Norden is slow, boring and difficult to guess. The character looks bizarre, annoying, the strange servant who asks his sister (?) To make his cane, a strange set of brothers, sisters & sisters who are serious and different from reality. Tense The story of a simple investigation may be successful, disappearing a lot and then ending horribly, which you can guess within the first 10 minutes. It's boring to watch it as a bad rhythm. Boring work, even thinking about it Please have someone help me because this is a really bad thing. I can really go all day about the fall of my inherited blood. <br /> <br /> Director Monson works with a budget that doesn't exist or is judged by this that he shouldn't direct traffic. The whole movie looks ugly. It is not good to shoot. There is no atmosphere or fear. The blood and the gore are quite tame, with an ax in the head that is executed. The scene when someone is punched to death by Wasp & is the best murderer when someone's face strikes. However, there is a question mark in this scene, so there is a victim, right? Is there a piranha tank? The victim's head will be in the Piranha tank, right? Pirahna eats the prey right? The water is still clear, even if the victim says that his face is eaten. Where is the blood? <br /> <br /> Legacy technique is terrible. It looks terrible. The sound is clearly shot & in the neck and difficult to hear. Scary conversations may be a blessing in disguise. That show will not win any awards, of course, at least say better. <br /> <br /> Blood Legacy is a really scary movie. There I can't think of. Do things that you like yourself and don't pay attention to this movie.
