Just saw this movie and I have to say that even though the show was initially trying to produce a good movie But it is extremely scary - but not in the sense that I'm sure. <br /> <br /> It's like a child who is insulting a wise person with the belief that every audience is a moral person. Or very difficult for entertainment or both .... Thank God for fast progress I can't imagine that the type of viewer that the manufacturer thinks about when creating this movie. I mean, you have a serious performer, even though it's hardly possible and the script is completely rewritten ... I just can't speak anymore if Harlequin Romance decides to make a horror movie. Good efforts. <br /> <br /> If you think that this movie is entertaining, I suggest you find advice about the purpose of the movie. There is a much better fare there. Join the club. Read reviews. But above all, avoid shit like this
