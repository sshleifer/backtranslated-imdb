The first cover of this picture looks like a good rock and roll movie. But don't let the cover fool you or the fact that Alice Cooper and the blonde are in there. The story is very scary and the performance is also the same. Plain and simple: BAD <br /> <br /> It's not a movie about roadie. It's a very light love story that is so scary that you look through it. The only good thing about this movie is that some good soundtrack songs and that is the reason I gave 2 out of 10. If not for music, it would be 0 out of 10 for Meat Loaf. It was in 1980) and the girl who played groupie didn't look good! This movie is very disappointing for me because it makes many good promises.
