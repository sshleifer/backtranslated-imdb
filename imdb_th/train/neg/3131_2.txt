Fallen Ones begins with archaeologist Matt Fletcher (Casper Van Dien) in the desert to search for the giant mummies of a giant 42-foot tall, which now has something you don't see every day. Matt works for Morton (Robert Wagner), developer. Real estate that wants to build a holiday resort on land & he calls a friend, archaeologist Angela (Kristen Miller). For reasons I'm not sure. However, both of them tried to think about what they had when their hands disappeared. Morton called Ammon (Navid Negahban) to keep them safe. At the same time, the ancient text translator Rabbi Eli Schmidtt (Tom Bosley) translated some ancient texts. (As he wanted) & was shocked when he learned the evil prophecies that these giants would rise and occupy the world for Fallen One or something like that. It is up to Matt to help all day & The whole world ... <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Kevin Van Hag, which has a small role in this film as an ancient warrior leader. At first I thought that The Fallen Ones was a movie. That is terrible and it's easy and To the same There are many things that are not good about The Fallen Ones, both at the technical level and the concept. The script doesn't have many reasons and it doesn't go until the last 20 minutes. I almost died. The character is terrible & is clich√©d as you want. The conversation is not as bad as all. & All the movies are predictable. I mean, it won't happen surprisingly that Casper Van Deine is saving the whole day? It is not surprising that the giant mummies are coming back to life again, so why wait until the hour in this movie when most viewers are in an uneasy state? It's terrible, terrible. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> Director VanHook is not impressed. The fight scene is terrible and why should you dress your bad guy in scary purple shades? They look good, giving a little credit to the special effects of the giant mummies is very good, even though there are not many because he has not appeared for more than an hour. But there are regular mummies that seem to come straight from the Mummy series (1999). Unfortunately, these things don't apply to any great effects, and in reality they are wasted like cartoons. Some story The mechanism of mummies is a good idea. But it looks stupid and there is no way in the world that everyone in it can work together to work. In fact, the more I think of the more absurd thoughts Forget the fear, tension or atmosphere and don't think about any violence because there is nothing. <br /> <br /> Technically, The Fallen Ones doesn't have anything special apart from the impressive giant mummies. The effect makes her slightly excited. CGI ghosts and terrible water effects are created for the TV and it shows. The performance wasn't good. Wagner looked embarrassing and probably the only thing that Dien & Bosley would like to receive today. <br /> <br /> The Fallen Ones is a bad movie. As i was worried Not recommended at all levels or one to avoid.
