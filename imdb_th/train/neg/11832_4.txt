From the creator of Shrek ???????? .. OK, that makes me interested. <br /> <br /> The creator of Shrek also created Madagascar. Half of Madagascar is as good as Shrek. <br /> <br /> And now Flushing Away is half better than Madagascar. <br /> <br /> That means bad. All animation and special effects are great. But this movie can't be <br /> <br /> The story of this movie is for children only. It is impossible for an adult to love this flick. <br /> <br /> But there are many jokes for adults. I bet that children will understand jokes. <br /> <br /> Even if I like this flick, <br /> <br /> I'm completely disappointed. 4/10
