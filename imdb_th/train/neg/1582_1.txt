Oh! This movie gave me a headache. And not in a good way. <br /> <br /> May be just my growing hatred for action. But even though I was a child when I swallowed ragged clothes like Navy Seals, I still saw that the film didn't like it. Now I am insulted. <br /> <br /> Take a quick story. Keep the name and throw the rest away. Instead of using a gladiators storyline in the future, half-future filled with holes filled with things that are in danger of collapsing. (Why is there a rebel base in the middle of the stadium? Why is there a camera?) At bakersfeild in a room without a guardian?) <br /> <br /> The whole film screams eighty points from the terrifying truley score to the shiny costume. Don't watch this movie. I know some people like it. But some people ended up in sloth and I didn't understand as well.
