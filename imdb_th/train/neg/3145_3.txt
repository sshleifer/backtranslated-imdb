I'm not sure how it relates. But I'm almost sure that Lost and Delirious is a newly created movie. (Or stories that follow) He is very similar, and even some scenes and scenes are very similar This moves very slowly. But is a French film in the late 1960s that is expected to be stylish Told in a flashback from the perspective of a girl traveling to school Editing the current scene is a bit confusing at first, especially since the sound of each overlap. (Such as listening back and forth while seeing the present and vice versa). In addition, "girls" are older than they think they are in a boarding school. Eventually, character development doesn't make you stick to movies.
