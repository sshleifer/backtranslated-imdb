I know I'm going to see a cheap movie. But I expect more from the movie Alex Cox. The performances of the two men are terrible, especially white men. Women should be awarded an Oscar compared to both. This movie is full of things that I think will be a joke for people in the film industry and a few other jokes that I understand and make me laugh out loud, which is rare. What happened to Alex Cox, who created the 80s classics? <br /> <br /> Spoiler: <br /> <br /> There are a few questions I have after the movie ends Why did the Mexicans go to the house of another man at first? What was his daughter saying that he had received 100 people fired from his latest job? Why did you destroy your belongings when she was angry with him? I guess I should get to the question and answer after the movie. But I don't want to wake up at ten
