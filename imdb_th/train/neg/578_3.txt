This is not a good movie. The show looked very strong and unbelievable. This film seemed to be unaware of what was going to happen for the real horror genre or to follow the path of the camp and the worthless art. I never saw the first movie. But this story does not depend on its own advantages, there are many unbelievable issues and the audience is not aware of the importance of female vampires. Not worth the effort to watch
