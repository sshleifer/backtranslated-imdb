I ordered this film that is extremely rare and overrated on eBay with very high expectations. I think I paid about $ 50 for this movie. As an eternal horror fan from the scary 80s American slashers to the zombies in Europe, I told myself that it would be great! I can't tell you that I'm wrong. First of all, I think it's more beautiful than it actually is. After all, I've heard about this film, I'm almost afraid to watch. Murder, boring, acting ... forget that there is no show! The story, even if we don't care But not incredibly good It seems that they tried to pay attention to strange sex scenes and naked girls. Unfortunately, in this case it doesn't help this movie. Why? There is no atmosphere and this is the worst thing about this flick. It's just creating bad movies from point A to B. Although it's funny and very amusing to watch with your friends and many beers. There are many movies in this world. Don't waste time watching Necro files!
