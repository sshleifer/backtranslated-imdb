I tried to imagine the darkness for Dark Angel. "I was thinking of the matrix. I was thinking of Bladerunner. I think the chick that played Faith in Angel wore a shiny black movie - or some chicks like you. Leave her with us. ! - We will do without planning, dialogue, character, action or budget, just loud and hot chick in the glittering black movie, big bike shake, Fanboys, loud noise and hot chicks, right? " > <br /> Flashy, shallow, boring, formulaic, unloved, boring, boring, boring, dumb, without humor, incompetent, incompetent Anime live action without any action or real life SF is the way Joe Fanboy likes in reality :(
