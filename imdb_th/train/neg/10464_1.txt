This film does not depend on the Bible. It made Christ free from the movie. They do not show joy or the Second Coming of Christ. Let alone talk about it Not referenced from the Bible The end time is called the great difficulty. The movie doesn't show bad times. Seven bowls, seven bad and seven trumpets of judgment were boiled down to throw the news for 15 seconds of the sea that changed its structure. Anti-Christ was killed in adversity 3 1/2 years and That's how the movie ends. The only part that they resolved was that there were two prophets. Did not use the exact name because that would be too close to the truth of the Bible The worst part of it is that I want it to be a good movie. I want to take someone who is not saved. I feel that this movie is evil. It's a fake, like everything that the devil did. I just hope that it will not go from a movie that is coming from a book that is left behind. <br /> <br /> The second problem of this movie is that it's terrible. Bad performances, bad special effects, bad plot and bad character development I have seen better episodes of Miami Vice
