This movie made me go. Perhaps the name may be the greatest thought I have heard. I think it is an independent film about the zombie outbreak and the quest to occupy the United States, and the only survivors gather together and plan to eliminate the deadly zombies! It's about a psychotic police with a weakness in killing his female arrest. What has happened to him when a number of zombie women get up from their graves in order to get revenge correctly. As you can see, there is nothing about the country or county involved. The beginning of the violence that occurred in the theater causes our nation. <br /> <br /> First, a zombie woman looks like a Victoria Secret model with a dark eyeliner. What is zombies? But was not cleverly interested in debating whether or not they were slaughtered by machines that were influenced by their most basic needs. These zombie women walked like streams and runway models. They spoke as if they were in poor movie noir and they didn't act like real zombies. Of course, eating and killing are there. But where is the unconsciousness and disfigurement Although it is an interesting concept and perhaps a big word about the type of zombies But it makes fun for that type of game and asks the question I would say that this movie is considered to be a very bad indie movie. I will not recommend this movie to anyone who loves zombies too much. Is it insulting and scary?
