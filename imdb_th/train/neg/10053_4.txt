Found the body of a small girl who had been removed from all possible identification When finding that one leg is longer than the other leg, it is considered the body of a daughter who disappears from the couple. After this injury, the couple separated and the mother was sedated and led to a miserable existence. All these changes, when one day later, she received a call from her daughter! With the help of former police and journalists, she set out to check if her daughter was alive or not. "Los Sin Nombre" is a busy plot moving in a slow and unnatural rhythm. The elegance of saving is Emma Vilarasau, which works superbly as a despondent mother. The best part of this movie is the ending. But I'm not sure it's worth it to endure the rest of the movie. Beware of English subtitles in the R1 release recently - it's not accurate.
