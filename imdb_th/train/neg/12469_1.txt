I rarely give up in a movie without watching the entire program. This is true, especially when I rent a DVD. Syriana is one that I quit. Halfway through, I closed it in disgust. <br /> <br /> This film is disjointed, boring, confused and lacking in stubbornness The show was dry and there was no reliable image. The general plot is good. But developed in a light and boring way that failed to attract my attention or interest Many sub-plot times often fail to connect with each other and seem like a random matter rather than a real connection plan. Terrible, such as serious matters and excellent actors can create failures. I can't imagine that this movie has received any nominations that are less than prizes.
