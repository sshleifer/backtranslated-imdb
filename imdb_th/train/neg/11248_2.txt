A Let it be "2" instead of "1" (Terrible) because there is no denying that many images are amazing. Many talents have entered special effects and art works. But that is not enough to save. <br /> <br /> "Sepia" toned the tone that had been washed earlier in other films many times. Nothing new there I can see that there is a hat trick for old classic movies. OK. No problem with that. <br /> <br /> But movies must be entertaining and interesting, not something that will make you sleep. > <br /> The story and script of this movie Is a scary two-dimensional character Slow moving Some scenes look cute But in the end, overall, it's quite boring. I can't recommend it.
