The Incredible Melting Man plays like the expansion of The Six Million Dollar Man, but with some violence and nudity. I know that this movie is quite bad. But I think it is impossible to dislike it. <br /> <br /> The performances and scripts are not the best. But the effect is good for movies aged 30 years with a budget of $ 50 - the title character takes a while. But when he did, it was quite impressive. We have only one scene of death that is related to electrical energy. What is notable is the music. It's crazy - it's a mix of cheesy. <br /> <br /> Famous highlights: <br /> <br /> * Surprised with slow moving nurses who jump over. Pane <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> * Beware of the human mind melting human beings, called Steve. <br /> <br /> * Be surprised when our hero breaks from hunting down the insane madman to eat a bowl of soup and complain about Insufficient crackers in the kitchen <br /> <br /> This movie is over 70 for me to hate it. It's tacky and worthless. But i think it's very fun You can do much worse.
