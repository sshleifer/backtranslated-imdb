666: The child begins when the plane crashes. The only survivor of flight 666 is Boo Boo Stewart, who was adopted by journalist Erika (Sarah Lieving) & her husband, cameraman Scott Lawson (Adam Vincent) after them Covering events for Channel 6 news. At first, Donald looked like an ordinary child, but death seemed to follow him around after warnings from nuns and wikipedia, Scott began to believe that Donald. Being a wicked person & the cause of all death ... <br /> <br /> Straight horror flick to DVD directed by Jake Perez under the pseudonym Jake Jackson and another person must say 666: Really poor child. Whenever I saw The Asylum responsible for the movie that I was worried, I was very worried because the record of their music was terrible. It seems that they have the expertise to create and / or distribute horror movies with low budget, which is usually cut from horror movies with a large budget that has been successful recently and in the case of 666: Children you don't need a degree in rocket science It was a complete fraud in recent payments. The Omen (2006), which launched the same year The screenplay of Benjamin Henry and Austin Laurel is terrible and cannot be compared to the equivalent Hollywood ambitions. I mean, Donald Antichrist is expecting. What from a middle-class family in a small town? It's a very good starting point that will bring the destruction of the world, right? All characters in 666: Children are a form of the main character from The Omen. Adoptive parents, priests who try to warn them and the terrible shepherds. There is a lack of real events, barely blood & bad plot. I mean Donald kills the dentist because they try to fix his teeth just as randomly and without necessities. All the disgusts that Donald draws about where they are raised from & nothing connects everything together. Separate clutter that just became very boring quickly. References to number 6 become annoying and unpredictable. <br /> <br /> Director Perez is okay. I think it's capable if nothing else. There is almost no blood or blood. There are a few sprays that are cut off & people see a circular saw stuck on their faces. But sounds much better than seen on the screen Of course, it is not terrible, there is no atmosphere with a gentle contemporary atmosphere in a suburban house and there is no tension because we never know what Donald is trying to do and there is no threat from him. <br /> <br /> In Technically, this movie is ok. It's done quite well. But due to the fact that the movie is terrible, it makes a little difference The performance is not good. But at the same time I saw that it was getting worse. <br /> <br /> 666: The boy was a poor man. The Omen cut me up. Repeat today throughout the week. Bad & absolutely not recommended. Followed by the sequel 666: The Beast (2007) which goes directly to the DVD
