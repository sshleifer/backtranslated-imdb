When I saw all the negative reviews of this movie, I thought it might be another comic masterpiece that was not intended to be. I watched the first two scenes of battle, listening to the general conversation sent by Lungren in the extreme, and the other eastern actors thrown away and I found that the movie was really scary. Then Brandon Lee came into the story and a fleet started to fly. The plot was separated. The writers started drinking and the film was welcome when it became a bad action movie. <br /> <br /> Lungren won his previous attempt on "The Punisher" and others, including Van Damme's movies, Seagal's movies and Stallone's non-rocky movies for the honor. this This movie is definitely the worst performance (see Tia Carrere's face when she is in any scene with Dolph. It's worth it to laugh) with the worst conversation ever. (Brandon Lee expressed Comment on the small Dolph and the worst series in the movie (Dolph in the full set in Japan). The picture "Tango and Cash" with worse performances, meets "Commando," Meet "Friday the 13" (because of nude pictures Unconscious and Lung's performance ren is very similar to Jason Voorhees) in an hour and fifteen minute movie joke <br /> <br /> good performance (not scary) to the bad guy (who still has constipation throughout the performance And Carrere (who says that her 5 lines without laughing) Brandon Lee is just a close friend of Lungren and has done a great job. <br /> <br /> The movie is terrible and terrible. Scared and avoided If you look at it, ask yourself why the underwater image is twice as clear as the image that is not underwater. Speaking of underwater images, see the water-lame fighting scene with the worst fighting scene ever. This movie has a bad fight scene for everyone who has a short attention span and complements between the flashes of nudity. <br /> <br /> BAD BAD MOVIE MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
