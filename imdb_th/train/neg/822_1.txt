There are two parts of this movie. Firstly, there is a laughing introduction for hysterical and cornball movies that almost feels that Troy McClure 'The Simpsons' should be described. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the movie begins. Up (starting with the title song that does not match the rest of the movie), which technically, while Okay was killed by an ambiguous, inconsistent and unbelievable storyline, and not just an interesting character <br /> Especially with Mickey Rooney's Spiventa, which is expected to be in the plot and is part of the 'organization' all the time. That will happen. Has Hackman decided arbitrarily? In this case, he will be an extremely unnecessary character, which he eventually remains. <br /> <br /> The overall problem of this movie is that it is not willing to put in the details of who or what. Behind this conspiracy As if the filmmakers didn't have the courage to say that any part of the society would be able to create such an organization and decide with the hope that the lack of explanation would be sufficient and the audience would have their own conclusions. br /> <br /> It's easy to say that movies fail at all levels.
