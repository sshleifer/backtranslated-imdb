In brief: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee has a lot of thoughts. He is thinking about racism, media and power, consumerism, capitalism, religion, sexism, 'opposite sex', politics of war, drugs, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> The level of That consciousness is Own is good I think it is a blessing that more and more people choose to examine the very basic aspects of our daily lives; Power, quiet and invisible that controls our society However, just because Lee is creating a controversial movie that doesn't make him a good filmmaker, <br /> <br /> What happens in "Jungle Fever" is the superficial understanding of these social-political forces. This is the result of two main failures: <br /> <br /> At first, Lee tried too hard. It seems that he is trying hard to make a political / social statement every time he can think of in 90 minutes. And like this, the results seem confusing and offensive as he allows himself to not have the time to develop the characters that Able to fully compile the ideas he hoped to present So he lost his attitude and we were left with a hasty testimony and a rich conversation. The results have been staged and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Secondly, by trying to create a statement about such diverse social functions, he seems to have no concrete or original interpretation of Social / political issues What happens is a non-renewable basin. You feel that he bought a primary school sociology textbook and threw out a total of 500 pages. <br /> <br /> These things are a very problematic feature because the art of the movie is sacrificed and the work turns into the speaker's voice The sound of the filmmaker He couldn't separate himself from the job and allowed him to speak for himself. <br /> <br /> It serves no matter whether it's a fine art or a political dispute. <br /> <br /> Even though I Will still thank Lee for presenting these important issues. I must say that <br /> <br /> two thumbs down
