I don't like western people And after never sitting from beginning to end, I decided to watch "My dear Clementine" and watch it all the way, no matter how painful it is for me. At first it was sad as expected. I found that the show was laughing. The scenery (Standard desserts, horses and cowboys) boring and the music and rhythm of it stagger on the edge of pain However, after the authoritarian mind talked to himself to fight with, after the first 20 minutes it began to be somewhat easier for me to endure. Focusing on filming and how John Ford managed to get a boring situation. (Boring as I was) looks quite amazing all the time. <br /> <br /> In summary, I can't say as much as I can enjoy this movie at the end. However, it makes it good enough for me to sit at the end of the way and that impressed me.
