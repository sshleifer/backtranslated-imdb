I received this movie in the $ 5 trash at walmart. I would not recommend watching this movement. I may give to one of my friends if I get angry with them and want them to suffer for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I looked at the cover and read through the summary and thought it was a movie. War I hope I know how boring this movie is before opening it. It was my mistake to think that something was going to happen in this movie. It's just a group of people traveling from one boot camp to another. Soldiers practicing bad soldiers and the main characters try to help people escape from fighting in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Okay, this is my word about this movie: For me, the movie This is slow and difficult to see. It's just one of the movies you put in and watching because you want to close it. But you still hung up on the line of hope that it might have picked up to the end. It wasn't after the movie ended. I passed it to my back because I was angry that I died almost 2 hours and watched 10 more Minutes to write this review to remind people about this
