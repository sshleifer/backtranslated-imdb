I love the original It's great and will be Although really strange, I hope to see a new creation. I tend to resist rebuilding because there are too many. But this makes me amazed I really enjoyed it, starting with Ken was excellent as usual and Jude Law was holding it next to him. It is quite clever that it is modernized and works. What makes this thing stop from being really good is the last seven minutes. It is completely away from the manuscript, until in reality it ends up being intelligent and annoying. The end of the original is great! Many tensions were created and it was incredibly clever! this? It doesn't add tension. But frustrated when they decided to make Ken's character become homosexual If they try hard to be different ... BANG! The law is dead, and collecting credits for this movie is worth only for watching the show. But in the last seven minutes, there has been a drag down really disappointing ....
