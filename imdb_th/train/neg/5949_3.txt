It is not uncommon to see US foreign film production falling on their faces. But this is the flip side !!! This is a new creation in the United States of America "Wide Awake". <br /> <br /> "Wide Awake" is strange but fun and funny! "Liam", the opposite is just strange. I have to give credit to "Liam" for one thing and that makes it clear that I choose the right thing to change my religion!
