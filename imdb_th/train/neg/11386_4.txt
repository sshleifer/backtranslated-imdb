One of the documentaries, thank you for not being there. This person tells of the two factions fighting in Colombia, guerrillas and paramilitaries and the people in Medellin who are around. <br /> <br /> Guns, drugs and death run amok. Those who are under the age of 22 are not in the middle of a fight in the prison. Girls ?? Not a girl, a girl? Always responding the same when one of them is killed by tears and screams. Are you scratching your head? What do they really expect? I do not know if there is anything more disturbing: gunfire at night and civil unrest or everyone seems to accept things patiently or see that boy drinking something that is not his first beer clearly. If you have to take these young men out of their situation and give them a place where they have more opportunities to do more, they choose not to rest. <br /> <br /> Based on this documentary, all I am afraid
