Statistics in this film have been well researched. No doubt about it! Of course, Al Gore presented his case very well, and it is not surprising that the film was praised as true. Al Gore is definitely an actor. He sounds very worried. But the action speaks louder than words! Throughout the film, there are political tips and references to his political career, sprinkled throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is an honest person not only talking but walking. Walking as well, when Carter thinks we need to conserve energy, he will reduce the temperature in the White House and warm up by wearing sweaters. <br /> <br /> Al Gore tells us that we must conserve results And that we are creating. Global warming while he travels around with a private plane How much does his jet use and create pollution? How much energy to make Gore's pool after his mansion? It would be good if we could save electricity by using small appliances and make it a point to close things that are not used, but if we do, the energy company will respond to 50% energy reduction by calling it "Losing 50% of income" and compensating for their losses by increasing the rate by 50%. So "just shutting down the machine" is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> This movie is an appeal that Ambiguous so that Big Goivernment can control everything in the name of the planet Earth
