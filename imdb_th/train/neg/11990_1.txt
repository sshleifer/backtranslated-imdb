I hope I will make this movie zero. Magic effects and performances The only reason to watch this movie is that you can see how bad it is. Starting from the child who played the role What is it! I don't want to believe the cylinder! Then there was a conversation with himself. I guess they can't keep the movie silent, but of course, they have to give him a dip as well, not what I want to see. But Jared gives excellent performance compared to the special technical department Everything from bears to collisions is something I can do myself and better. I seriously suspected that Gary Paulsen was unable to produce because the movie was not called Hatchet. Finally, I didn't think that the writer had read the book because nothing was the same I think this book is excellent. But this movie looks like a foul goat!
