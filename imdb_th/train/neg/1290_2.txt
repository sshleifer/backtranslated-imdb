This movie is two and a half hours exciting. Someone please tell me what the issue is. <br /> <br /> I mean I understand the historical environment. It should be about the ragtag group of bushwhackers Confederate (terrorists) on the Missouri-Kansas border. To take revenge on sympathizers and shelters in the northern United States But apart from the violence that is worthless, there is not much interest in this film. Maybe it is a political statement? The war is nothing more than a violent violence If that is a point that can be done quite well But I don't think that is the point I think manufacturers think they are creating a worthy movie here. But as long as I am concerned, still lacking any plot br /> <br /> This movie should be burned with some burning cities!
