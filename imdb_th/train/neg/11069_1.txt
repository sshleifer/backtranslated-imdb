I felt cheated after watching this picture. Feeling like I was watching this movie without doing anything. 101 minutes. I didn't understand what they thought when they did this. It barely went into the killing of Jeffrey Dahmer. But never ending It feels as though they are going to open this movie to continue. It's like watching the TV episode of the Sopranos. It ends immediately and you know that there will be another episode next week. It feels like I just watched episode 1 to two movies. There are many possibilities for what went wrong here; They are lazy. They don't have money. They don't know the rest of the story. They want to create a Dahmer 2. After watching this movie, they sound very precise. I'm watching Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the forest. Suddenly I heard this song playing, then wrote on the screen and said that Dahmer had served his two-year sentence and was attacked by a fellow prisoner in the prison. That he got there How about the trial show of Dahmer. How about showing some more details? I can't explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place. I found myself speaking unbelievably. "That's the end?" I want to summarize this review by saying that there is still a good Dahmer movie that still needs to be created. For filmmakers I want to say that if you do it correctly
