I think the pictures and lighting are not very good. When I watched it for the first time, I thought it was an old version (1956). When I discovered the true year of this film, I was shocked. I do not know that there may be a bad movie created recently. That's all I want to say. This movie has a good storyline. There's nothing you shouldn't miss if you read a novel that George Orwelll wrote all I wanted to say. Say it except this: I can't believe that this movie might have been Many awards and nominations, I gave this movie one (terrible) because I felt that it was terrible.
