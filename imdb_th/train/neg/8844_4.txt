I watched this movie after seeing other comments on IMDb, even making my wife believe it was "A horror movie like no other" I want to like this movie. But can't do it. <br /> <br /> "Love story" is good, but the horror aspect is quite bad. If the story about a young man who falls in love with a girl with parasitic diseases will be a better movie. <br /> <br /> The care center extends the confidence beyond the limit. Quite ridiculous Doctors don't care about the law, privacy and professionalism. Nurses enter the room to give normal food to dangerous patients. (Without security) and placed the tray and ran out of the room, screaming without clear reason Forensic patients (And the villain of the movie) is bound in a full-bodied posture - looks like for many years? There is nothing reasonable. <br /> <br /> This movie has some actors that I like in other things, like detectives, but I still can't recommend this movie.
