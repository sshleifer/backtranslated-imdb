Overall performance: - Finally, the long-awaited AAG will enter the screen. Unfortunately, it was not able to spread fire among the audience. The first thing that is best to talk about movies is the idea of ​​creating a great SHOLAY. And Varma is a good choice to change the whole background of the movie. If he repeated the background, Ramghad would say that there is nothing new in this story. Different backgrounds are grateful. But the way he presented it was not appropriate Since starting his career with SIVA in Telugu, he has used the same light and background. I watched this person seriously. Varma considered about the light, or it might be that he had no other lighting technique. In addition to GODON Willis DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH, why do some bodies use Dutch corners and Cole shots A lot of ups !!!!!!! The shooting was crippled. The characters cannot have emotions. The performances are not as mentioned. The story telling is worse. The history is really bad. Babban: - Amitabhz has been given priority to his work. VARMA created Great villains like Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai, but this time he failed to carve the best characters of all Hindi movies. There is no comparison of Gabbar and Babban. Babban is a psychopath rather than a villain. He also has a soft corner for his brother. (As a gift in this movie) The performance of Amitabhz is not his mark. His appearance was pathetic. The scar on his nose is a forgotten villain symbol in a black and white movie theater. What they work with Babban without success. Babban has no comparison with Gabbar. <br /> <br /> Narsimha: - The best first thing about this character is not to let the audience wonder in his hand. If Varma does that, it is like teaching an ABCD to a bachelor's degree. It's good that he opens the secret early. But backward is poor Varma could not use the great performers like Mohan and his mark. <br /> <br /> Durga: - Better single character. This character has been improved with a pleasant change and is used according to the story. <br /> <br /> Heroo, Raj, Ghunguroo: - No disturbances or at least consider these characters. this The greatest failure of the film began when the director couldn't work with the close friendship between our heroz. These characters have nothing in this movie. <br /> <br /> RAMGOPALVARMA: - His quality is diminishing. AAG can be regarded as a C grade movie. Sholay is a fire of revenge. The problem of the city means true friendship and annoyance and fun that Dharmendra admires. Theater tours The storytelling is too weak so that the audience cannot sympathize with the characters. Don't compare AAG and sholay, but you won't like it. <br /> <br /> If you dare to watch this movie You will be burned both in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG.
