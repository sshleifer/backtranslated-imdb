Let's see. At the end of "St. Elsewhere" we find that there are no hospitals and everything is in the minds of autistic children. "Newhart" ends by telling us that it's a dream and "Roseanne" ends. By telling us that it happened in her mind. "Creative" is much more annoying than that. Yes, it's just a TV program and it's not true. It's just that when you're stuck in a great movie or TV show, you at least want to believe that it's all "real", at least as much as it is on screen. The ending of this type of series has been done twice and is an old, frustrating and not fun hat to watch. Now "Newhart" is all a dream? At least do it in a creative way that exceeds the expectations of everyone who loves acting. My own thoughts are not too much involvement. But it was done wisely that the best content in the series was ever Rosan made me feel cheated after being a big fan.
