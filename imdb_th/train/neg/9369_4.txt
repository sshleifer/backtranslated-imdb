Although I have heard that this film is a bit dry But I saw that Scott Bakula was at the beginning of this movie. I had high hopes for classic movies. But ended up having fun for 20 minutes before it ended. It would be better. The storyline was twisted, crazy and unexpected and very smart. I keep my finger across. It will work. And it is a terrible misunderstanding until the accumulated credits and I know that there will be no happy and satisfying ending Unfortunately, I regret that I have watched it and rushed for a quantum leap to restore faith in Scott's great goodness!
