When you go to an outdoor cinema on a Greek summer night, you often don't care what this movie is! Edison really started with great effort from the singer who wanted to be Morgan and Morgan Freeman again, but ... (in the movie, there is always a good starting point to attract audiences. A little bored But the story in the middle of the movie that is about the character and the action story that is less done and the third part is really good so you remember this movie ...) when you see the police officer The top 30 people can destroy the building). Shoot at the person behind the car. Can not hit him even once, as he kills everyone (but 3). Then the man throws a shot. The Fire (To kill the remaining 3) You know the Greek summer. The starry sky is a great way to be disturbed by movies like this!
