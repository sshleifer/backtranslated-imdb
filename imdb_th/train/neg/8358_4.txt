This is not a better movie of Arbuckle or Keaton. Of course, Fatty's wife is tired of his heavy drinking, so she takes him to a hospital with a psychiatrist (Keaton) claiming to be treated! At that time, Arbuckle had accidentally ate the thermometer and was taken to surgery. He then escaped and was chased about the place where he met a cute girl who wanted to escape. Eventually, although the team would pursue them, they fled to the point where it was clear that the girl was mad and soon Arbuckle was recaptured. However, he wakes up and everything after surgery is a dream - no sexy crazy girls and Dr. Keaton is not as big as his ability as he saw in dreams. <br /> <br /> Lack of humor is the biggest problem of movies. Of course, creating fun for the mentally ill is quite low. But on that day it guarantees laughter I will laugh too if there is something funny that will respond! A lot of energy and that's all. <br /> <br /> FYI - During one chase, the surprising fat is a competition for men who are over 200 pounds (wow, what is its price?) And after this he soon returned to the post at number 5, just refurbished As a result, five are now on the back of a fat shirt and he looks like a regular participant. However, the numbers that should appear on Fatty's shirt, but come out in the front - are a mistake because they should realize that the mirror image must go back 5
