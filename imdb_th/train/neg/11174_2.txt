Al Pacino? Kim Basinger Chali? Ryan O'Neill? Richard Schiff? My mouth watering I do everything to watch this movie on the cable for 30 minutes. In I have problems awake 60 minutes and I press the record button and fall asleep. Watching it finished the next morning shouldn't be bothered, so boring and an idea that would be an interesting story of "Day in the Life ..." Cure your insomnia if you have it and watch This movie I guarantee you at least one and a half hours of continuous sleep. Scary conversation No continuity The camera works with hands that hold Super 8 and look better. <br /> <br /> This movie is totally disastrous.
