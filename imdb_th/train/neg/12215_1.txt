What I can say is stealing my time. I was taken to watch this movie and I must say that it was a horrible experience. Angel Ann Lee is a scary and unreliable actress in this movie. Larryjoe76 is clearly a shill critic. Some plot to say the least. Cantonese dialogue is not funny. See this movie in your peril. <br /> <br /> David Tang from Shanghai Tang should be behind the movie to earn little or no income. With other rom-coms there and just blend in with the scenery It's like watching dry colors. <br /> <br /> In the short term, this film loses time and space overall. I've watched better movies on youtube
