Young scientist Harry Harrison continued to perform scientific research in the late father of the restoration of the limbs with flying colors. But a mother who has influence over him and her medical lover wants to sell serum. When he discovered that there was an accident on Harry's broken arm. So he tried to use the serum and what happened to be a genetic frenzied arm with his own heart. <br /> <br /> Oh, we've seen this many times. Garbage waste that is soft with rubber is the work of the movie icon Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. In fact, it's not as bad for Fangoria movies; There are better people who are similar in veins. "Servered Ties" lacks a unique style. Strange nature and unpleasant water splashing, similar to "Re-animator" and even the touch of a slap that emerged like something from "Evil Dead 2" <br /> <br /> The comic story was hit with black humor, but it can cause Feeling emotional and a bit in fun. Surprise arises, especially the final result of the flick. Which is well accepted because I think it should have something more accessible For low-budget production, FX makeup is very stupid and stupid. But there are some strange moments that will make you smile more than cringe Even sexual tensions increase the agility of the story with Elke Sommer's terrifying performance as a mother. Oliver Reed is a joke in vile feelings and he pulls it out very well. They were both extremely excited when a couple who hate you, Billy Morrisette had the pleasure of showing abnormal Harry. The director, Demon Santos Stefano, quickly moved to create a movie and created a scene with a style of horror and stylish decoration. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a kid and generally ridiculous But you have to give it for entertainment
