I'm not a big fan of rom / coms at the best time. There is something quite good. (Examining dreams for Insomnia) But this is the same but less. <br /> <br /> With 100 minutes of work time, I expect more than 1 laugh every 30 minutes. When strangers and friends help Lee's character instinct, <br /> <br /> All I can say is avoid. I guarantee that there are at least 10 other movies on the shelves you deserve. $ <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (and because I'm only a big Lee fan)
