"20 years later" Mike (Gordon Currie from PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) Invited his seven friends to his quiet grandparents to return home "Manage your fears" at the Halloween night party. Morty, a real sized wooden doll that was stored in the attic by an Indian maintenance technician, became the spirit of a dead father and killed by using phobias. Being thrown out the window, sunk in the bathroom, eaten with rats, blown up, etc. Morphs die into the father and the tree walks around and makes a stupid moron. After meeting a girl, shuffling and stuffed in a cardboard box, the character is still in the house, acting cheerfully, funny and sexually 13) Surprisingly pleased as Grandma But this thing is even more exciting and confusing than the original and full of false fears, poor performances, repeated brain deaths, annoying past images Plus only two protagonists (India and half-black girls) Be the first to die BLAH!
