This is a bad movie. But not as bad as the reputation The production value is not bad and there are strange, powerful scenes, and it has 80 cheezoid plywood that means it's always fun. Be careful with the short appearance of Jimmy Nail - his efforts in the American accent are very surprising. The miracle too is Sybil Danning's chest - they create a short image in the movie, but the scene is repeated many times at the end of the credit for what can be described as 12 "Bob Danning's compilation of Sybil as a movie. The horror genre is not scary. The effect is stupid and Christopher Lee turns to sleepwalking through his performance. I guess he is buying a new home and needs a certain amount of cash for the lid. Two main characters - men and women - so little that I forgot almost everything about them and I just watched this movie last night. Wolf, werewolf is less impressive than in the original movie. Surprisingly, they look like a badly burned monkey in the east. The settings in Europe are quite good and the songs produced by the new wave band Babel, while very scary, at least make some movies add cheese. <br /> <br /> Overall, good for laughs. Can be of good quality And at the very least, you always have someone knocking on the door of Sybil
