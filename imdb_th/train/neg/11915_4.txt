A clear pilot for this unreleased TV series, with Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as a memory with some incredible power that must be used when a male demon turns to the world to be released on. This world CGI is a stock for TV work and Appleby is ok as a memory. But difficult to swallow as a superhero In front of a familiar TV, Richard Burgi is ready to travel as an Appleby consultant, but he can't do anything to raise this wreck above medium. We see the way of the demon flying too many cartoon characters from the beginning, which is a bad signal. In addition, the scene in which Burgi is practicing Appleby for the fight is really ridiculous. They are copies of similar scenes in many other movies, especially REMO WILLIAMS.
