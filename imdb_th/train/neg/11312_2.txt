This film deserves credit for traditional methods. It combines the elements of the theater, movies and great storytelling. It's a pity that it's all down. The greatest weakness of this film is to refuse to do anything. It has an element of morality and epic camps without ever doing any of them. For their own story, Chretien de Troyes is spinning in his grave in this terrifying adaptation that changed Percival. Cute and innocent, cute, until becoming a rude and rude person. This francophiles or Arthuriophiles When talking about the subject behind one story, I found that this movie was not accessible and was an incredibly shameful story, keeping a beautiful story.
