... Okay, I've read about this movie somewhere on the internet and many people criticize how bad and bad the movie is. And I do not agree with this After that, I saw this movie on a DVD. I was thinking about it twice. Luckily I used my money for this shit. I sacrificed my sleep for this movie, and soon it appeared that this movie couldn't satisfy me. So I can't decide how the movie was created. But anyway ... it's still bad. For those who like this movie, I apologize for burning this movie and saying how this movie sucks. I don't know what you think about this movie?
