I'll tell it again: this movie is very weak. Children will definitely like it, but adults ... It's all suspicious. The whole thing is traditional, which is expected to be received because they are quite exploring all the concepts in the first movie. Still, do they need to complete all the movies? I mean everything is reproduced from Little Mermaid. Its worst part is Morgana "Ursula's crazy sister" who appears out of nowhere and threatens Melody, which is ridiculous because Triton is there with Trident. spell Why does Triton do anything about this? Because the story requires him to do nothing I can go on But i won't do The whole thing was an unscrupulous attempt to raise money from Little Mermaid and was thrown together clearly without thinking anything because they knew it would be sold. Overall, it is a waste of time.
