I must be a man in America who doesn't like this movie. I guess this is not my style or something. I don't see anything that is fascinating about it. This is * entertainment. Hardly let one of the greatest achievements in movie history. <br /> <br / > It's about a man who comes from emptiness and becomes a medicine master. An easy way to describe all movies and that's my feeling about the whole movie. Contrary to what most people think just because movies about mafia / drug trafficking / criminal groups don't automatically make it a great movie, don't forget the good storytelling.
