There is only one scene that makes me laugh at the person with Christopher walking into it. (Mad movie director) The rest of this film is just boring in the first hour or so, nothing actually happens. The story should be funny, not Zeta jones douglas is overacting.julia roberts running the routine of a former ugly duck ( Yes!) Go to the girl's next door. (Did I see this before?) Where did you get this man? What will happen to the main character, if the real drop from the building in the suicide attempt, the movie may look more interesting than before.
