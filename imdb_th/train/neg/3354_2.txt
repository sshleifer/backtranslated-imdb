I think when you decide to create a better movie again, you should try to do better than the original movie. Or at least give a new perspective Right now, Robert Weiss, 1963, tells the amazing story of Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House" that is worth the entrance to this day. Now, fast forward to 1999 and create a new one. I was shaking my head and asked why? The show is a story that is unrecognizable and seems to replace the profound horror of the original with many special effects computers that can be created. I heard that this update is not good. But didn't want to believe that it was so bad when considering sources. I was wrong. After watching this story and speaking to my wife, how scary it was, she said; "They get your money!" She said right. Don't let them get yours. If there is no profit in making repetitive fleas, maybe they will stop building them or coming to a higher standard that doesn't insult their audience.
