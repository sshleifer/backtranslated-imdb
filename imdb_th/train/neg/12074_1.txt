Ridiculous horror movies about wealthy men (John Carradine) is dying and leaving everything for his four children and his servants will be divided equally. One condition - they will have to spend a week in the land. To get his money And if someone dies, others will get more Guess what will happen next .... <br /> <br /> I saw a new type of film in the cable. Bright and bright colors and the house looks beautiful That's a good thing I can say about it. <br /> <br /> Try the list of problems that this movie has: the killer apparently screamed. The servant called Igor and Elgar - come! Some audio recordings are terrible. I can't do conversations. (No big loss, I'm sure); The blood was scattered and made very bad; Other murders are boring, silly or impossible, and the film has a very nasty show - so bad that you stared at the screen with disbelief. Even professional Jeff Morrow is terrible! The only good performance came from Faith Domergue (who deserves better) and John Carradine (who looks old, painful and weak). I have to admit that - the closing line in this movie is a gem! <br /> <br /> Why is this name changed to "Legacy of Blood" above me - there is another horror movie in 1978? <br /> No matter what the name is, it's a movie. Bad To avoid all costs
