Okay, I passed through a terrifying performance. I got through the fact that Lil Kim exploded the cannon and her arms or hands were not moving. I had passed through my interwoven connections. <br /> <br /> This is what killed me: in the scene The four roses were sitting at the table, bothering each other. Lisa-Ray and Monica Calhoun stood up and Lil Kim got up to destroy the enemy by saying "Oh, oh, oh, wait, let's wait. We're here." I'm a fan of western movies and I've never heard anyone say such slang in Clint Eastwood's movies. <br /> <br /> If anyone thinks That this movie deserves to be ranked 1. Please tell me another movie. It's worse than Gang of Roses. <br /> <br /> I passed.
