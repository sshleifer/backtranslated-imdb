Where to start The film begins with what seems to be cut from "Darkness Falls". The disabled old woman who lives in the forest gives gifts to children. Does it sound familiar? Then it will change in "Darkness Falls". The tooth fairy will kill you if you see her. The tooth fairy in this movie kills you no matter what happens. Why do they want his rockers, hippie fans or Bubbas and their sisters? I think this movie would be good without them. It seems that the manufacturers will sit around and decide that they need to add a special person in the movie to the tooth fairy to have someone to kill. Although it's a good thing to see beautiful blonde girls that aren't being presented as bubble heads for change. Okay, for rent, but I wouldn't recommend buying.
