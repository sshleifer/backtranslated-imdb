I was amazed to see that the 2008 little film that won the Oscars was the best picture of 2009 and went to see The Hurt Locker. Everything I received on that two hour investment was confirmation. It is scary that this film has been rewarded purely for reasons outside the screen. <br /> <br /> The direction and visual style of this movie is the weakest thing you will see when you don't. Part of the performances of the Equity Bourne again with gruesome images annoying. "Shaking the Web" It shows all the outstanding features of the second day soap opera. <br /> <br /> The image is flaky, unique, developed as well as denying the idea of ​​cartoons. Bailey beetle and dialogue - in the case of the movie surrendering to being "minimalist" and for obvious reasons, one or two soldiers become the correct chatterboxes of the worst that have ever been recorded. In fairness, the actors do the best that they can do in a situation just not enough to obscure how bad the project is. <br /> <br /> The whole movie has the feeling that it has a purpose like "mockumentary" that they are overclocked, funny and edited as best they can in order to pass it into serious drama. <br /> <br /> If you spend time Two hours in this movie, they will take two hours. Come back and waste two hours that you will regret for life.
