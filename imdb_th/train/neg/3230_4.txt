I just watched the guinea pig-devils experiment. I have to say that this film, although it has a very good FX, is better than I expected. But it's not a good movie I can't tell if I enjoy this movie. Of course, it is effective in being a shocking and realistic method. 43 minutes of torture But I found it very boring (And not as scary as I hoped) and I found that the tormentor was very annoying when they talked and tried hard all the time causing them to deteriorate even more Now I have seen the guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and the best one in my opinion is the guinea pig 2 - the flower of flesh and blood. I will not say anything about the experiment of the Devils. In addition to the Great fx, the performances inherited from the girls who torture those who are annoying. Overall I gave 4 stars because of the excellent FX.
