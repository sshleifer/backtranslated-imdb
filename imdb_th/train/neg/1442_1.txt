This is the worst shit to imagine. H. Rider Haggard's novel is fun and amazing. This worthless filmmaker didn't follow closely. Old fiction is not sacred, and creating a free version is good for me if I have my own concept. If everyone can do it is to change things and replace them with clich√©s. Unattractive and watered down, one should stick to the original. If they do that, this movie should be twice as good as the actors, and if filmed in a studio with cardboard huts But without fatigue This should be bought or watched by a collection of Victorian novels only made into movies. <br /> <br /> Just a hint and not a spoiler that I think. And what do you expect if you decide to watch on TV? - God forbids you to spend money on this purchase. The evil witch Gagool in this book and the ancestors of Gollum become a good girl!
