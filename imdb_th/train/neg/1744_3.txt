I watch malayalam movies "Boeing Boeing", made in 1985 (which, in turn, may be inspired by the English movie of the same name). Long ago, the basic story of garam masala was the same - but it was pitifully told. Classic jokes that have been replaced with daily routines found in common Hindi movies. (The director may do this to suit the taste of the Hindi audience) ... <br /> <br /> I don't see the original English. But really happy with the Malayalam movie (created by Priyadarshan himself) which is a joke that breaks apart Of course, acting by Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (the cook) is natural and natural. <br /> <br /> It may be that I was a Malay movie that I couldn't tolerate. Got its Hindi remake But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have done too much. Paresh Rawal has done a good job but not anywhere near Sukumari. <br /> <br /> But all is ok if compared to comedy. Latest Hindi Other Stories
