I watched this movie for the first time, about twelve o'clock on Saturday evening. It is really time for this person. I have never seen a movie that is actually predictable and soaked with the pattern. If you want to watch exciting action movies, do not watch because you may lose the intention to live half way. However, if you want a good laugh, please see! I also bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection. Thanks to my fun Saturday night. What impressed me so much was that every scene that had to be expensive was a copy of the Discovery documentary or a special TV program in the US Army. Moreover, I was surprised by the fact that they didn't use a little effort to make production look realistic. Afghanistan is as far as I can remember, nowhere near the sea, and with a single click, Deke escapes from the terrorists' sand castle with his jets and is submarine out. Later in the movie, Deke threw Muslim terrorists to the wall. In the slow motion scene, you can see the long hair of a Korean stuntman in the air. When colliding with a wall, must love it. I suggest you watch with friends and beer in sufficient quantities. Then you will understand why I To be crazy enough to spend 6,99 euros in the box
