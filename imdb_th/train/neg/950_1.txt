I caught this movie on AZN on the cable. It sounded like it was a good movie "Green Card" of Japan. I can't say that I don't like Asian movies at all. The most amazing horror movie of all time is Japanese and Korean movies, and I'm a big fan of John Wu's Hong Kong movie. I don't like movies that have light minds like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favorites), so I think I will like this. I will scrape my wrist and drink my own blood rather than watch this movie acting badly. <br /> <br /> I think director Steven Okazaki must use water with Quaalude because No one in This movie has a personality. And when one of the DID characters tries to act as compared to a muttering line or two, their performance comes in an incredibly forced and fake manner. I don't think anyone will do anything before ... The only person who listens to the truth is Brenda Aoki .. I think it's amazing. This has been promoted to be funny because I didn't laugh. one time Surprisingly, more than that, was the morning news of CBS called "Comedy". It wasn't refreshing and not a joke. Previous auditors must be stupid people to think of things. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie unless you want to see the plot, boring and acting made of wood. Think "Spike of Bensonhurst" is a movie that serves better than this ... and I walk halfway through that movie!
