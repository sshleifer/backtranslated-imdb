I put this movie in the hotel room to entertain my children. In the morning we were going home because I kept all the toys. (Toddlers don't like to see "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "The View") My four year old finds a funny scene. But tell me that the rest of it is "too stupid". This is a four year old man. Anyone who is over nine years old will want to kill their television instead of allowing this to play. <br /> <br /> Saying that this movie is not as good as saying that genocide is a slight mistake. There is no saying that this movie is truly ridiculous and scary. The performance is not good, the plot is stupid and the script doesn't look disgusting at all. Since this is probably a joke, the fact that you can't laugh at the badness of the movie makes it worse than ever before. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is the worst with some fake accents (Irish - Pakistani - Bronx - Neck Kanyan-Cajan - as far as I can tell) but all the characters are scary I haven't watched real Laurel and Hardy movies for a long time. But I know they have a better way What is the purpose of destroying a classic cartoon? ... What is this? <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Garbage Avoid all costs unless you have a Bronson Pinchot amulet. 2/10
