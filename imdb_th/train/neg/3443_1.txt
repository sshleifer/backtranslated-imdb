I watched this movie last night and hope to get the best thing after watching the coolest examples, both the DVD cover looks good. As soon as I start watching it, I think like everyone else. "Oh, what is this?" A little creepy But then the mood was destroyed by stupid songs with rock and opera in the period that should be a suspicious scene. That's what destroyed me and I shook my head. I thought I wasted money again. Renting and being deceived by the cover, nothing with their own music, it's just in the wrong part of the movie. Anyone who edits this film has no clue what they are doing. Lightning covers mean they are right. Caught in This sea storm is more interesting. But it didn't happen The performances are not the worst I have ever seen because they do not know and this is their first movie. The other reason I am disappointed is that the plot is unreasonable. At first, 2 men saw every teenager. come in The ship then, at the end, should have only 1 woman and others as friends in her imagination or as a ghost. I am not sure because it is a terrible picture. Or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says that there are haunted ships in the area where this film was filmed. There is no mention in this story that it is true. I've never seen anything like this before. But I'm not saying it's impossible. I guess if anyone is interested in renting this movie, you have to take risks yourself if you like horror movies, amateur students.
