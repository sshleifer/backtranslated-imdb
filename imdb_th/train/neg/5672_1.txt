I feel ashamed of having this film in my collection. The most rewarding factor in owning a DVD is the short film in the bonus feature. My score for this movie is ZERO that is very fat. Don't misunderstand. I'm a horror woman. But I want some flesh behind the story, not to mention, I like the evil that has happened to humans so that they are not tricked into watching what seems to be forever. Brutal actions interrupt long silence and poor performances. If I was forced to compare it to another movie, the only thing I thought of was that Cannibal Holocaust wasn't good, boring, pointless and completely uncomfortable.
