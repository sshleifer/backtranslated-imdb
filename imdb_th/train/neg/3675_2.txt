Actually everyone in this movie looks like they want to be somewhere else! It is not surprising that casting is not done with the left hand. But not an actor I didn't see anything worse than Natascha McElhone, who disguised himself as a gun carrying agent. You do not take the role of someone who is insulting in the city. The only worse thing is to imagine that selling Doris Day is a prostitute. The rest of the actors are scary. It may be that Hurt is the only exception. Sometimes you may see him trying But must suffer Oh, I mentioned that it was completely insane? Harmful to many people who live because you are divorced and want to see your family? Must be because the man (Weller) is a German person. <br /> <br /> 2/10 because shooting may be worse
