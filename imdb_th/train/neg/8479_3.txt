Ok, when I entered the board for this movie, I expect people to enjoy it a lot. I was surprised to see that people over the age of 7 like me enjoy movies ... but only b / c me and my little sister. (Which is actually only 10 people) makes fun with everything <br /> <br /> I'm sorry Jordan But the performance is horrible. Did you know that the movie is heading to the bathroom when the leader cannot show it? And it doesn't even have a good script or plan to exchange I still think that the characters of Pamela are very weak ... Pathetic of the border. <br /> <br /> Even though people say that, I think there are only a few good actors. Spencer, beautiful, Hollywood and Ronnie, still not enough to exchange movies. <br /> <br /> Two things about this movie that I can't beat: <br /> <br /> 1.) Spanish men Sir will fall in love with her. Okay, eww. I searched for dates and in fact he is older. She was only four years old. The difference in the "picture goes" seems much bigger. Jordan is a very beautiful woman, but in GF she looks like 10 or 12 ... She looks like a little boy! Jake Abel (Spencer) looks like a student. <br /> <br /> 2.) How is Kristi Yamaguchi going to skate for a woman? I mean, I know that Kate Lin is good and everything. But it seems unlikely that Christie will go to a boarding school without a scholarship for skating or schools to hire a relationship skater coach. <br /> <br /> Everyone is said. That ... it is not the worst movie ever known But it wasn't good even according to the DCOM standard, which I considered quite low
