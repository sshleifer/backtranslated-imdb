Great performances, weak plot, stupid story and a great movie around. Combine this garbage. It's exciting to sit through. Just great Do not waste a single baht on this. The cinema should feel bad about bringing this movie to the audience. This "horror" movie isn't even scary, creepy or disturbing. There is no way to attract the eye. The performance is terrible by all the actors that any attempt to bring you into the movie through dialogue will be completely destroyed within the time that the actor / actor opens their mouth Including the whole story, I don't know why some people made this movie again Don't waste your time or money. Even if it's a free ticket, don't waste a moment to watch this movie. You will feel stupid when watching it.
