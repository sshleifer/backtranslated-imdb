Normally I don't feel motivated to comment on movies I don't like. But in such cases, I have to say something. This movie is terrible, irrational and ridiculous. There are many shortcomings in telling stories that I do not need to explain thoroughly, because it's time for me to move forward from this experience. However, the most annoying point is that no one in the movie will explain that the motivation for Bacon's character's madness is due to his travels or physiological reactions. <br /> <br /> Get things. extra Impressive effects, and in the past Paul Verhoeven has done good things (Robocop cut of the director on a great DVD). However, this film is stupid and generally does not come close to explaining the point or the way Techniques of the story and instead of dealing with predictable actions without having to be entertained. <br /> Short as well as other reviews here, say (hopefully I will read them first ... ) - Stay away from this movie!
