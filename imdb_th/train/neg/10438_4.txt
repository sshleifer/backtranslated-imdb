The movie sucks and it's not funny. It's not exciting. They tried to make it so bad that it was good but failed and thought it was cool to like this movie. Next to the hype is the only reason this movie was successful ... <br /> <br /> Truth. That at this time, 50% of the votes, 10 out of 10. For this movie, it looks cute about me, regardless of whether this movie is insane or this vote is unrealistic, which may have many reasons and should be handled. However, it is a movie that is less than average, which bloom through viral advertising. Its success can only be described as a marketing miracle.
