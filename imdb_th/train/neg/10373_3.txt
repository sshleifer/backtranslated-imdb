This is one of the movies that I can only pass once. Charlotte Henry is a good person. Actually, all the actors are ok. The problem is in the script, dialog, direction, editing, set and special effects. True, here is the year 1933, but it's really creaking. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W. Field and Cary Grant can't remember. (There is a face that is crying because of an unrecognizable memorization) This film has just been captured as a group without any contact. The humorous spirit and continuity of Lewis Carrols largely disappeared. Too bad! It was a great book. I would recommend Disney's 1951 version.
