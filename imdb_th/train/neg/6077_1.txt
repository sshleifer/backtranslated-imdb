Who will see this RUBBISH really if it doesn't have young children running around naked? From the theater perspective, it may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Some people woke up one day and thought that I would create a movie with a little girl and call it art. Stick them in the countryside and don't need to have a story or explanation of how they got there Why didn't they appear? Live anywhere or have a parent because the movie p * rn doesn't want anything like that. I will comment on the rest of the film. But I did not mark the spoiler, so I would say, just avoid, avoid and find yourself a suitable movie to watch.
