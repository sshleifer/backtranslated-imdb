This is an exciting short film that I saw during the recent Turner Classic Movies feature, while the film emerged due to the very intensive technology. The movie itself was not animated and sometimes the plot was Looks cute - this thing was created for use in the classroom and attracted the attention of a wider audience. Especially considered, I really hate many. Brace reiterated in the movie - like when the characters talk to her, they always say. "Clara Barton" instead of "Mam", "Miss Barton" or "Clara". In addition, one of the allied soldiers who were ill said he was "Johnny Reb, a rebel who helped, ..." - almost It seems like he is a cartoon character, Mojo Jojo from the Powerpuff Girls. This is just a sloppy writing. - During the time <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see John Hamilton (later) Perry White. In "The Superman TV Show" in Beard, as President Garfield, yes-under him. That beard
