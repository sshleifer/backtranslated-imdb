Oops, sex movies and gore It's too bad that they won't do these things again. (Unless you live in Japan) but if they all become like this, that's not a bad thing Take them home to their castle Having crazy sex with them and then eating them (Except for the first victims they gave around without a particular reason) things were complicated when women camping with her husband began to wonder about the mysterious woman she saw It's really ugly from here. At the end, the two vampires were in a blood thirst, where they ate everything in their eyes and managed to escape their captive victims. Oh, for the secret that exists. <br /> <br /> The fact that both vampires are not interested in removing clothes and fooling around each other is the only thing that this movie presents Otherwise, it will be a confusing blood. (Why are their graves far from their castle?) Which can be seen in just a few minutes of playing vampires The only thing I got from this movie is these two valuable suggestions: Lesbian shooting won't kill them. It will change them to become vampires only and do not go to get prostitutes in rural roads. They may be vampires. Besides that, it's not worth my time.
