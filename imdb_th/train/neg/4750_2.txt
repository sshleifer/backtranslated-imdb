I will give it 2/10 <br /> <br /> I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> The story has been poorly developed. For example, the event is too short and short. Therefore morality is not clearly brought out I think Brenda Envelope works well. But Shinko Yamada seemed to be difficult to handle his role. I can see the need to add Western elements to the show. However, there are some parts that need to use Chinese elements as well! Example of a villain His physical appearance is similar to a robot rather than something from Chinese culture. The last and worst flaw is the wrong thing and distorts the facts of the show. <br /> <br /> Others may point out that this is And therefore not necessarily high standard. However, there are other Disney shows, such as Mu Lan, which is much better in terms of development and presentation. <br /> <br /> In summary I feel that Disney movies should be researched and planned better. A good performance is not enough with just a set of martial arts that rely on.
