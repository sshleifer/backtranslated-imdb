This should receive an "O" score or even a negative value of ten. I have watched this program for a long time and the program has jumped around the Shark 7 series. However, it is now proof that the program has jumped the shark. It's a lazy, ridiculous work that is passionate about itself and is not worth the garbage like Beavis and Butthead. <br /> <br /> It's possible to be ridiculous and still fun. , Count of Monte Cristo - "Fun" movie, everything that should not be done seriously However, there is something as ridiculous as in "This is the worst thing I have ever seen" and this is the worst episode of Stargate I've ever seen. It was absolutely terrifying, and this came from someone who had an end in her basement. <br /> <br /> Make me want to sell all my props as seriously as possible.
