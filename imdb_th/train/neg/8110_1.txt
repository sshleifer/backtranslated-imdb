I think Phillip Kaufman read the novel about the cliff of Kundera, a novel and then began to create this movie. Okay, of course, there won't be a sting of the original. Kundera's novels are excellent because he uses the narrative concept of being able to step in and out of the stories he created. This film does not try! Tereza's only dream sequence, which is important to the atmosphere of the book, has been reworked and meaningless. In addition, this may be less of a point than Daniel Day-Lewis. It's not a legitimate complaint.) The perfect example of Hollywood izing other good literature.
