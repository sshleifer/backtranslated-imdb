I think I've seen this movie twice in reality. Then I read all other reviews and they didn't match. Three young men and students, two women and boys go to this city to study the sight of seeing Bigfoot. I still feel quite confident that this is the movie I saw, although there are differences in reviews. So I'll take the criticism back: If you like the movie 'B' from time to time, as I do back to Boggy Creek is the movie for you. Whether it's setting off the timer and nodding to blow a favorite movie, or just hang out with friends, Boggy Creek, mute button, and you'll have an enjoyable night of improv. The myth is true or not? I think we may know, along with the actors that are not loud. Are there any devices that malfunction during the important moments in the movie? Does our blonde girl have chest hair? Does the technology with ultra high technology exist throughout the story? You have to wait and see for yourself.
