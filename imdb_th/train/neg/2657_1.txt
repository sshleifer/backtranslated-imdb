I wait for this movie to play very well. Suppose it was presented more precisely, such as the movie "The Christmas Box", according to Richard Paul Evans' book. I sent emails to friends and family. Ask them to see this program in the hope that they will understand life. My new "little After watching this movie, I was very disappointed. As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and was aware of the pain, I hope this film will make parents who think "understand" the grief that parents have to suffer. This film is a very light movie and the vitality of Diane Keaton slaps in front of the parents who buried the child. It's unrealistic from beginning to end. I have a few lines behind each movie as well. "That is the mark and makes it seem that in the short time you come back on the road and listen to music on the radio and life comes back." It's a bunch of cows! It is clear that the director and Keaton never lost their children because no one ever created this movie to be known. I guess that's Hollywood.
