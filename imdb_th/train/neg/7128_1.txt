I am a fool who rented DVD REDLINE Chicago Pictures. The stupid filmmaker never paid Palisades Media Group to buy advertising on various automotive websites, including mines with 16K ALEXA scores. $ 16,000 and they waste my personal time (Palisades Media's friends). You know who you are. <br /> <br /> Please don't rent or buy movies !!! It's terrible and the person behind it is a tear artist. <br /> <br /> REDLINE has poor actors and actors! <br /> <br /> This movie is funny.
