I do not like this Bill Murray car when it was first released in the 80s, so I tried it again to see if my dissatisfaction for this film went down to my tastes in the 80s or "Stripes" movies. Is a bad movie The verdict is in and "Stripes" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Now "Stripes" may be a creative joke in the early 80s and may attract people through basic training. Or who is a Bill Murray fan But it's still a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Why isn't it good? Mainly because "Stripes" should be a joke. But not a joke Some people laugh But they are few and far away Most movies are used by the amazing plot, which is incredibly complex and not very interesting. If you are familiar with contemporary comedies, such as "Anchorman", who is committed to laughing in all parts of the film, <br /> <br /> "Stripes" still suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Ramis. show Bill Murray is a great comedian. But he is not a very interesting drama actor right now in his career, and Harold Rames plays the role of Harold Ramis. These two are not good enough to be actors that bring the incredible curves of the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, most comedy that exists in "Stripes" revolves around the center of Billmer. Ray So if you don't find that character funny (As I am not) You will not find most of the funny things that are in "Stripes". Funny as well. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" is a movie of its era. It's not yet. Good and not worth it If you want to watch a comedy "Buddy" in the early 80s, I recommend "Stir Crazy" as well as "Stripes". The humor in "Stir Crazy" is not as fast as in contemporary comedies, but unlike "Stripes" but it's older, better, and results
