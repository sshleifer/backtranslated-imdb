You should know that I am the type of person who looks at the worst of the movies, often from the real curiosity. I watched the Leprechaun before giving up on the temptation of my eyes tears. You should also know that this movie is on my VCR less than half an hour before I jumped heavily for the stop button and hurried back to the rental shop to keep the distance between me and it the most.
