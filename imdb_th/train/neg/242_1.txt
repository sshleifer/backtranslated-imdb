From poorly planned plot, almost no feeling in bad conversations and separate scenes to the worst final scene, bad performances (even Peter Falk couldn't find his way) Ms. Bertinelli's performances were not as profound or emotional as William Russ, as Hank's brother and David Cubitt, as Noah's love interest Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, daughter of Noah. Be a child The new one is almost unbearable to watch, listen to the same song. But who can blame them with material like this? Michael J. Murray's script is the best child and youth. <br /> <br /> Each year at this time, I search for a TV guide and wait anxiously for the best Christmas movie. And a holiday movie that inspires appearances on small screens, such as Ernst Lubitsch's "Miracle on the 34th Street", a delightful "shop around the corner" and of course the 1951 "Scrooge" model Have class Cascades of Frank Capra "It's a wonderful life" and "Meet John Doe" Hey, forget the classics. "Home Alone" or "Home for the Holidays" with Holly Hunter and the great performances of Robert Downey Jr.? br /> <br /> The gift I give you is advice. Your time should be spent searching for these movies better than finding "Find John Christmas" Merry Christmas!
