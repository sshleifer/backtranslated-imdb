People like me will tear this movie apart. It's not like real The plot is very predictable. You can certainly expect everything that happens. They find treasure and become dirty and deceive the bad guys. We've seen it a million times before. The writer of this film must think that most of the movies that are released to the public are stupid. They must be correct because most people really like this movie. I mean, unlocking the puzzle in a matter of seconds. The secret treasure room hidden under the Manhattan subway You think that all the work that takes place in the subway in New York, that room will be discovered first. And what was created during the Civil War? Please and love stories between Ben and Abigail ?? How cute and I think the love of Clive Cussler novels is weak. They fall in love like that in 2 seconds. What I'm worried about is helping Hell with a girl and stupid paper sheets 1/10
