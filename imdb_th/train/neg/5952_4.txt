Do you know that you have been watching EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years? I can understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers together on the island. But you think that after watching a hero that is stinking, a foul-smelling hero runs through the bush with eggs on a spoon for half a decade, it is enough to get You have to admit to something a little bit more original (and interesting). <br /> <br /> And I'm not talking about the authenticity of the items I think are suspicious. It is difficult to suppress unbelief about "Bushy Bill" eating mice when all the crews of the manufacturers and the people in the camera are in a bio-air conditioned room. Sip a mochcinno with frost and moxy. What's the appeal here? I don't care about these people or their devious lives. I just don't understand But if you feel yourself being fluffy, I suggest you turn off the TV and go to the bus station in the area where you see people like this in their homes. They call them homeless and free of charge. You can sit down and be amazed by their amazing ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from many trash until finally stand out. "Pay dirt" - sticks, while begging people to change food when the smell of "Aqua Velva" in their breath is enough to recommend otherwise. And the best part? Like the survivors, all members of the "leaf" tribe "island" every time they were accidentally sent to local institutions when they sent a terrifying signal full of fearful schizophrenia. Now that is entertainment!
