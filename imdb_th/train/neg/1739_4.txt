Watching that woman in Ermine. I wonder what Betty Grable is doing in a project that seems to be intended for Marlene Dietrich to do. Someone in the 20th century, Fox might decide that the sex symbol is good too. Darryl F. Sanuk should have known better. <br /> <br /> Betty plays with an Italian teacher in the 19th century. The domain has been invaded by the Hungarians. Kasar, who is Douglas's captain The palace hall, along with her outstanding family tree, did not see any similarities in Doug and the invaders 300 years earlier, which she managed when the army failed. <br /> <br /> In addition to Bet At present, he is just married to Cesar Romero and the attack has occurred at the most inappropriate time before things are complete. That is what will make everyone have a bad attitude. I can guarantee that <br /> <br /> fresh and useful to Americans. Betty is not a charming and mysterious actress. Marlene Dietrich may put this story But Betty will fall below the presidential candidate yesterday. She and Fairbanks have no chemical reaction at all, although Doug is as charming as ever, and someone I can see in all things. <br /> <br /> Frederick Holland and Lee Robin write the score. For this movie and this is the moment Oscar nominated for the best song One chance of Lady In Erin on the occasion of Oscar falling in love with buttons and bows. <br /> <br /> Ernest Blitch died halfway between this film. I can't believe that Lubitsch will have Grable in his heart to be the leader here. You won't, if you see that woman in Ermine
