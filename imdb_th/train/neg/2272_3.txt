I am not a regular audience of Springer, but I watched his program in a short while and I think this program is miserable and a good way to kill time. So naturally I will watch this movie hoping to see "Jerry Springer Uncensored". First of all, Jerry appears in about twenty minutes of this movie. Other hours and twenty minutes that take time to create, trick, deceive about trash trailers, jealousy, incest and deception. Jaime Pressley (who looks like HELLLL) is a trashy slut who sleeps with stepfather. yours Mother knows about them fighting. They want to bring it to show "Jerry" (yes, no springer). We have stories parallel to African-American couples. They bring it to show "Jerry". Blah, blah, freakin 'blah! Trash rarely gets this BORRRINGG !!!! I wonder why Hell Springer has millions of fans, but none of them watched his movie. Now it's obvious !! Whether you love him or hate him, you will hate this movie! How do I explain? It is a mess of movies. (If that's what you call), it doesn't fix well with scenes that aren't connected and after a period of time, the plot disappears and it's all over the map! Just thinking of the soap opera that is predictable has become a funny cartoon. With laughter, <br /> <br /> My only positive message is a hot girl scene. That was the poem that was received. Don't understand me. The scene is beautiful, but if you watch the movie as a whole, compare it to the content of Springer's show - this terrible story looks scary. <br /> <br /> My score: 3 out of 10)
