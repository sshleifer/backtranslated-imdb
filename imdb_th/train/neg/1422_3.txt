The original Lensman novel series is a classic of the genre. It is a pure adventure SF with some substances. (Here and there) and I have always wondered why Hollywood does not take verbatim words because it is what they love: big explosions, special weapons, uber-heroics, heroes get aliens girls (potential CGI Good) with evil in pure form, etc. and others instead (and remember that I am a Japanese-o-phile lover and anime) we got the horrible kiddies movie that ripped out Of mixed stories in Star Wars (Ironically, while the book tore occasionally) pastiches and made things down to the level 'Thundercats' If you want to see Kimball Kinnison, the best of the Galactic and Lensman patrol officers, the second stage that shows that a poor little boy (etc.) I don't understand why the creator Do this because it is obvious that they have the right to the subject and can make more money (FAR!) By telling them directly. It's unreasonable
