A movie that makes you want to kill yourself with a sword I've seen Sokol in my time But after watching the mess, I don't think I will see another movie again. May God have mercy on the spirit that made this thing. <br /> <br /> Location - quiet stud, former army, lingerie type character. Landed by the Clan Granola family. Her, who is the right wing logger The family spends time with him and spends 2 hours in which chicks will see that he is a person who can catch better than drinking French wine, driving Porsche, talking on a lazy mobile phone in the city> <br / > Bad-1d characters, 1d themes. Beat the head with the Pro-Military Ed Asner theme. <br /> <br /> The great commercial break is long. Peter Jason is over.
