One of Stinko's movies has a shopworn plot and is a genre that shows less Oscar talent. But for me, the only downside to all is the misrepresentation of all jet planes and, in particular, 747, some important errors: <br /> <br /> 1 No flight engineer. (Or even a flight engineer station 2. Identification of Interceptors F-16 is mis-F-15 (not resmblance in any way) 3. Loading passengers into the luggage compartment Placing a lot of weight until the stern of the boat causes the plane to not be able to fly. "Will not destroy the plane" 5. The entire landing process is so bad that I want to puke the SR-71 (every plane) with a pressure seal. 7. Open the cabin door to the air - in flight! <br /> <br /> Ah, bean, it is a really lousy movie, must make the top 10 list of the year.
