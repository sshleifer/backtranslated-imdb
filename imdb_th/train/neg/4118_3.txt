While surfing the channel, we found this movie with a promising summary. We were disappointed at the flat performances and the stories that were formulated. We found the car scene exploding, fun, unbelievable shooting and the set failed with the weight of foam and cardboard. What is even more fun is to see the entire recycling scene from "Dante's Peak", which in front of the church is on a school bus, a separate clothing shop from the main road, a floating bridge collapsing and a red truck accelerating along the way. When the bricks fell It is a good laugh, even if it is not intended and makes the audience suspect that it is not intended to be used in the film disaster.
