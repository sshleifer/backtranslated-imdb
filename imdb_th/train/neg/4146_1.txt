After watching this, read the summary on the back of the DVD, then think back to the actual movie .... I became a little dizzy. I think sometimes I might fall asleep and dream that I am a Down Syndrome child who perished through an endless forest where people drive 11 miles per hour and stop without any other purpose (zombies?). From where and (vampire?) Who (seduce?) People with a pure heart in a way to save the world Both zombies and vampires did not meet. The only fight I remember was removing Walrus Bonny Giroux's panties. Coo Coo ca FAT! all! Probably because we are looking at the widescreen stretching and are too lazy to change to the original resolution, but it actually makes it more entertaining ... In conclusion, my thesis follows the idea of ​​having a connection. More All the material and performances of this film make Bloodrayne look like Citizen F *** ING KANE.
