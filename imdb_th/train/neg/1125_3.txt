I went to school with Jeremy Earl. That's the way I heard about this movie. I don't really know whether it is in the cinema or not. I can't remember the name I saw it being like one of the special people after school. The performance is ok, not great. The plot is weak and the lines are quite fragile. The only comment I can give to this movie is "Eh". I borrowed a movie from Jeremy. If I was in a movie rental place, this is what I would walk past and after watching it, I would not recommend anyone through At the age of junior high, I also noticed that many times the children in the city were being depicted as slang or too old. Many times I think that is what makes the character unbelievable.
