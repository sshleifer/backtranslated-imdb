If you want to pay for a good movie Jason Scott Lee, I suggest the following: <br /> <br /> Dragon: Bruce Lee's story <br /> <br /> Rapa Nui <br /> < br /> "Timecop 2: The Berlin Decision" is a horror movie Great production value Horrible performance Great script I will not recommend this film that will be watched by anyone who seriously believes that such rags are entertainment, quality or advancement in the awareness of Asian Americans in Hollywood (This movie is not possible) saying that this movie is an entertainment that is acceptable on a rainy day if you have encountered it while surfing the channel. If you are curious, it may be a rent from Netflix, but this movie is not for storage. <br /> <br /> If you are one of the few people watching this movie, it's one way to create Get to know your Asian movies. And very disappointed, I recommend the following movies for your personal viewing These movies are written with high production values, with talented Asian actors: <br /> <br /> Better Luck Tomorrow <br /> <br /> Mulan
