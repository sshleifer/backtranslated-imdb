Just finished this movie ... saw it on the video shelf and was a Nick Stahl fan. I just had to rent it. In all honesty, it may have to be on the shelf. This concept is interesting and cleverly twisted many times and around, but I guess almost all of them before they come. And finally I watched this movie too far, if you suffer from watching it, you will see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In positive, Nick Stahl's performance is great. (Especially considering what he has to work with) Eddie Kaye Thomas is a good person, but he always plays the same type of character ... Paul Finch too much from the past "American Pie" for my liking < br /> <br /> And finally, it's the worst part of this movie. Must be an emotionless expression of January Jones ... I guess the really cute face is all that matters in Hollywood.
