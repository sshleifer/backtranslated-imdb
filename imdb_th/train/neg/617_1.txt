First of all, let me start with the words that my friend said while watching this movie: "This movie must be brave. Did you know that 'DUDE, I bet you didn't do anything worst?" This movie, they have tried their best to get that position. Of course, the effect is terrible. The story / dialogue is like a collage of bits stolen from every horror movie B that was created. The actor that I suppose should be in college But some of it (Especially at the beginning) makes them look like they should be in high school or high school It's unreasonable The scarecrows that go around killing people are not at least fun. (Spoiler: At the end when they sing the name Lester and he appears again, the black man and the scarecrow are laughing. They are in their final scene and in a wonderful conversation)
