I gave this marriage for 3 years and that was a stretch. Adrianne Curry is a contaminated mouth, loud noise control and her past sex makes me laugh. She tells Chris that he has a picture to protect and must avoid the strip club. He married her Chris has low self-esteem and is different from different times. I have nothing to do with Adrianne Curry, but this combination will not be happy after the end. Her mother said that he was a big chicken and thought that this was his last attempt to remember his son. There are 2 very good people who have ended up in a nasty divorce. His "Brady family" will fit into his new life. I saw them being closed. Chris said his friend is more important than his family. Who supported him and stayed there for him
