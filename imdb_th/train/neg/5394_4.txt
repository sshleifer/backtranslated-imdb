I was frustrated with Shakespeare's modern adaptations when the director couldn't decide whether to use the original or update. If it uses the original word in an updated setting, it is difficult, especially if it is set in the 20th century or 21st, although it can work well in modern forms such as Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night. Very effectively It can work with the environment in the 30s if there are fewer songs and dances and Shakespeare's content. Unfortunately it ended up with a little interesting show. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree that he is too old to play a student. But more importantly, he is a very experienced Shakespearean actor, despite all his efforts being a student. His strength in acting is constant. Of course, he should play as a king - there is no problem in having an adult adult king surrounded by younger students. But we have an attractive actor But don't change the heart for the king. <br /> <br /> The amount of music and dance that I find boring, despite good music and pleasant dancing. Unfortunately, the excellent Shakespeare dialogue must be greatly reduced. So all things became a little secret and sweet, and I was very bored, including the cartoons around me and were glad when it ended. Branagh did not do Shakespeare's justice on this matter. <br /> <br /> However, for Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, it was great as an older couple.
