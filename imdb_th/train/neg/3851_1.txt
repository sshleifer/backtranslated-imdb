I never thought I would watch a movie that was worse than "Lisa Picard Is Famous" but this story came very close. Often having repeated comments for five minutes in a movie that you know will be stuck at the change. This film is a painful reference / tearing everything from "Something about Mary" to "Revenge of the Pink Panther". The writer Greg Glienna (meets the parents) wants new content. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes a boyfriend. / Berserker police were tracked by internal affairs. But even if that opportunity is wasted Many image settings of the Seattle Space Needle need to clearly hide the Canadian shooting location. The worst driving in the car scene is hardly trying to hide the fact that the car is being dragged into the trailer. At least turning the steering wheel or stepping on the brake periodically. Selma Blair is inert and short haircut is a $ 3M crime to Jason Lee. For what? Guess it's skateboarding! <br /> <br /> So this is the one who should watch this movie: The Bee Gees fans who want to hear two actors sing 'Islands in the Stream' are not good. People who can't get Julia Stiles Enough 1/10
