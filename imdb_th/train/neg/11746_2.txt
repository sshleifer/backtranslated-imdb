This movie has a lot of advertisements. From the energetic at the Toronto Film Festival to commenting on CBC Radio, an incredibly bizarre, hilarious indie movie I've been waiting for months. <br /> <br /> How do I wear it? It sucks in a very big way. Exercise in the weakness of the cinema that makes Adam Sandler look like a cartoon genius. <br /> <br /> The best, gentle, amusing and the worst coma. The distorted script is badly used and tangled in a mess. <br /> <br /> And what is the song that is 500db more loud than the rest? That is a truly strange thing about this. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch strange comedy related to aliens then try Repoman without comparison!
