2 stars and I'm generous (A little spoiler) Look, this is a low-cost zombie movie set in the Oakland Gang. Scientists want to bring the dead brother back to life again after being killed in driving. <br /> <br /> The main problem of this movie: What zombies are! All "Zombies" do are roaring (which doesn't even listen to scary from afar) and drops a fake red blood from their mouths! No horrible eyes, no flesh, decaying, a group of people growing poorly and running around like an idiot. <br /> <br /> The cover is misleading. There are about 6 zombies in all the movies, so unlike all "hoods" that are filled with zombies or whatever, there are only a few and no time. <br /> <br /> The performance is really bad It's hilarious No one can do it in this movie. (Except for being one of the gang members) and it seems that many friends gather to decide to leave their families.> Last note: Since when did the doctor wear sports clothes? Please skip this!
