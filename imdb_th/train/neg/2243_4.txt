It has not been reviewed unless it is a warning to potential viewers. It is a rather common ghost story about an actor who haunts a studio during the filming of the Second World War drama No involvement in fear, no doubt, whatever. One shocking moment that seems too stupid to be shocked. The style of the show is quite flat and boring, although there are occasional corrections. The story never happened at the same time and the movie was just a complete chest. 4/10
