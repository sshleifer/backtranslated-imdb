Beaudray Demerille (the weak, Peter Fonda, director), a very old gambler, received the Wanda "Nevada" award for a young teenager. Together, an unlikely match in the search for Indian gold in Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> That's a story and there's no need to find a deeper meaning in it. It just doesn't have The performance is also very weak, which is surprisingly due to the fact that Peter Fonda is the leader. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something interesting in this movie And the good looks of the young Brooke Shield However, her character looks annoying. (Especially at first) and dumb. She's never sexy or attractive. Terrible. But from this story, I wonder if there is anything else that will make this story better. I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and starred in this movie. He must speak to his father. (Henry Fonda) as a pendant (useless) in this nonsense Unfortunately, this film is their only story. Can Henry not be in EASY RIDER? 3/10
