I slept on the sofa at 19.55 pm last night. See Larry Sanders (I usually DirecTivo but not last night). (Bank of West Investment) and was amazed to see this in HBO2. I was shocked by the badness of this film. Seriously. I was shocked that I had to write an explanation in the iMDB. This is really bad. Writing is a boring matter. But the directing and editing are at the bottom of the new boys at the movie school. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a video taken. Think you are shot in a video, not a digital video. It looks like an opera The clips from the skateboarding video have more feelings than 'movies' for them. This horror movie <br /> <br /> I want to explain the poor director. The stunts and blocks are stupid. Yes, I chose the word 'stupid', not unconventional, not brave, not brave, not boring, just stupid. I know that people who criticize this review say "Give me an example," I can't. It's a 3 hit. But believe me, I know that you will continue to watch. You will be attracted by scary criticism.
