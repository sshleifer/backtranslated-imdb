Another colorful excuse for men in rubber suits to fight among themselves. This time, the time traveler from the future arrived in 1992 and recruited a few people to return with them in 1944 and prevent the creation of Godzilla, which saved Japan from future destruction. But when accomplishing this mission, the time traveler is revealed to be a cross-group of people that his own monster is rampant and there is no Godzilla to stop? Garde! It sounds very stupid and may be possible. But the plot is surprisingly good and the final battle looks good too. Unfortunately, the remaining visual effects are just garbage instead of fun garbage and movies become boring as before. Look for Spielberg that is shaky.
