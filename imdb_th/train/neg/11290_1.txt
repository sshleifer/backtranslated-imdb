It's the worst movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto can't help this turkey. I have heard that the movie should be called "The Treasure" but changed to "Sharks' Treasure" to take advantage of the excitement created by "Jaws". The fact that they are included in this "thriller" should sell tickets that are not available whenever there is a "good" thing in the movie. While creating a movie Yes, do you think beer may be a sponsor? Do they make it clearer? The only time everyone should drink beer is if they do it through this thing. That's enough to celebrate.
