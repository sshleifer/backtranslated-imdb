I have another chance and rent this garbage bag. Billing is a horror flick. There is no single scene, not a scary scene from a distance. Of course there are nudity. But all the lesbian action has been slightly I guess that would be the grace of this movie? And Danny is an annoying ass bag !! From the beginning I knew that I was there when Ole Dan first spoke. And should he be intimidated? It's a laughing story !! In summary, this movie is terrible! How can this movie happen in hell? If you want a movie that has excitement in it, don't rent this movie. This movie is a thrilling story like Teletubbies.
