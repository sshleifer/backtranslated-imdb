First of all, what is good in the movie? Beautiful actress? Exotic background? The fact that the actor didn't laugh at the show (I'll be there if I'm in their situation)? I do not know the simple story: Catholic priests who draw abstract paintings try to find out who (Another abstract painter) killed his little brother, a male prostitute (Rape another priest when he was a child ...) I was afraid that there would be nothing to learn or think about a serial killer, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode of the worst season of "Profile Creator" (Serie) with actors and unbelievable coincidences (Uncle is a police officer that women living in the homes of other victims may have children and monks, etc.) etc.)
