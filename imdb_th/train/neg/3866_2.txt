I think that this movie is definitely not moral. I mean, how would you feel if your fiance left you on the wedding day with your cousin ??? I will be heartbroken !! It is funny But I don't think it's funny. I think most of them find cheap laughter and take it. I normally like the movie Julie Stiles, but this is an exception. Jason Lee is shown in an embarrassing performance again, proving once again that the class and good morals are not related to today's society. It lacks flavor and I watch movies like this. I understand that people will protect this film and it is morally because it is 'just a movie' but I still stand by my mark that this bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I'm not trying to say that if you like this movie, you are a bad person because everyone has the right to express their opinions and some parts of this movie is fun. I just say that in real life people act like The characters in this movie are shameful.
