The best thing you can say about this movie is if you are a fan of Sonny Chiba. This movie is for you a lot. Chiba gave a speech at Chiba poses; Chiba laughed at Chiba stared at the camera Chiba punches and kicks the living sushi out of the whole group of bad guys. Chiba sat on the couch and chair and looked carefully / thoughtfully. Chiba drove his car ... <br /> <br /> I enjoy Chiba as an actor and martial arts artist ... but even though Will be a fan of Chiba. This movie may have Sunny Chiba too. Apparently it was a vanity vehicle for him. And no i won't put "Street Fighter" in the same category because in "SF", he plays a brutal anti-moral hero and he shares this camera with friends and interesting enemies. Here he is in the middle and almost all the time and he tries to be Batman, Captain America and Bruce Lee in one roll. Toshiro Mifune and Chow Yun Fat can't pull this out all the length of the movie. All documentaries and Sunny are not welcome. At least he was able to change his suit for a while. <br /> <br /> The film was more messy, in the order of introduction, which was done without charge and did not work well. US version) and stupid cheers "(" Viva !! Chiba !! Viva !! Chiba !!) that started things with a wrong walk There are surprising and unsuitable scrubs - Sonny (or his normal English) doesn't seem to care to make a cry for the US version, so they get a bad drug. Quite shaking from the face that we all know and love from "Street Fighter" <br /> <br /> Despite the flaws and excessive exposure But it is still a little classic But the work of the camera and the fighting scene is so wonderful. I am happy to believe that Karate actually works if there are amazing people like Chiba's characters should do that. But the director and the photographer prevent their bets by hacking and fixing the fight scenes with the Wawee Weeds. Happens almost always Not bad: there are images and elements that are appropriate and have at least one memorable and miserable moment when the villain appears in the client's bedroom in a truly creative way. <br /> <br /> And for Real plot ... forget it for "bodyguard". Chiba's character is something stupid. The screenplay depends on making mistakes and oversight that makes him (and his "client") repeatedly in a dangerous situation so that he can fight with him and after 30 minutes it is even stressful to judge. The most thought Should be a good thing (For example, if his character came out to destroy the Japanese drug trade, he would actually take his client to her neck 10 minutes in the screenplay and shake her until her teeth were shaken like a castle until She spilled a little secret ... and many deaths and pointless conflicts could be avoided. <br /> <br /> But in this whole film, it's a long way from the bottom of the tank. It's still Sonny Chiba. And he Enjoy the view I paid the buck to unlock the DVD rack at this bargain at a large local market and I felt it was worth watching again.
