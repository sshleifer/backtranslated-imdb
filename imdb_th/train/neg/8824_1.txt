Things that can be said about this film, besides "Watch the audience" Christmas Eve should come with a warning label like cigarettes because this is harmful to my eyes and ears. I am not happy with the horror flick "b", but this movie can't be a little shocking to the age of five. The issue of bloodthirsty uncontrollable people in the movie is that he / she seems to be almost like God, nothing can stop their anger. But in this movie, psychologists living in the chimney The strangeness that tried to surprise his next victim and was followed by all the popular Santa Claus legends. It was a reminder to the audience that this man was not dangerous because he was too stupid to be dangerous. Overall, it's all garbage.
