There is something here with the actress who has the perfect life she always wanted after the worst life possible, starting with a tricky and crooked kid with Eric Roberts, but her background makes It is impossible for her to trust Dean Cain and this will eventually destroy it. Sounds weird, but I like the position Dean Cain came in at the end and was the choice he chose He couldn't hurt her because he loved her and she was the mother of his child. (I think the time frame makes it clear that he is his son and not his brother) but at the same time he cannot forgive her all. Sleeping with his brother (Which shows the love and obligation that he felt was one of the most beautiful ways) and was part of his death In a better hand, this should be a better movie. But for some things I caught in the late night was not bad
