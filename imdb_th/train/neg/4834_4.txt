I waited for Kathryn Bigelow's movie with great expectations after an endless advertisement and 6 Academy Award winners. Unfortunately it's not a good movie. The depiction of the situation seems to be accurate and reliable in every area, but other than that, the story is incomplete and the direction of the movie seems uncertain and haphazard. The actor tried very well. But for me, I don't understand what this movie is trying to do. It's not the atmosphere and the Full Metal jacket is not as epic as the Band of Brothers. It's not like the action packed like ... everything. I can't clearly see why. Many nominations and why people do not give up on these great proportions Disgust you with the ability of the movie in the last few years. I think there is nothing to choose from.
