The motivation of the film makers never before became more transparent. Let's see first: They were welcomed by all missionaries to make this movie the most wonderful story since slicing white bread. Next, they encouraged as many fundamentalist Christians as possible to buy a copy of the movie to compensate for a small production cost and increase the advertising budget. And finally when the film was screened in a movie theater, many Christians said that they would see it again, bringing them into multiplex if necessary, not in the movie. But since the opening of the # 1 box office was seen as a profound spiritual victory, <br /> <br /> But of course it wasn't enough. I think every film critic who has the courage to give "Left behind", whatever short criticism is considered <br /> <br /> Of course, this distorted marketing campaign should not surprise anyone. It's an old-fashioned capitalism at work. What surprised me was the number of people who were sucked into the idea. All "left behind" as a person who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs for some reason and reason makes me scratch my head. It seems that many people believe that in the near future there will be a "Rapture" happening and millions of people around the world will disappear at the same time in the air. I wonder what kind of truth these people are. live at? Is this "rapture" something that they really believe or is it something they really want to believe? And when they reached the end of life and realized that this "joy" did not happen, would they be disappointed and indifferent? There will be more than 100 years from now which confirms that "Pride" is approaching. <br /> <br /> In any way, I almost want this event to happen! It's a very interesting day! What is more interesting is that if the motto occurs in a more impressive way, not in the sense of anthropology, the writer of the series "Left behind" is an image, but more than the production of Stephen Spielberg. The angel came down from the sky, the moon changed into nine yards of blood. Imagine being aware of the fact that everything is true, just as the missionaries have been warned for many years and there is something more terrifying than the cold, hard and hard truth. <br /> <br /> But in the final analysis, it is really cool, solid and real that I will be satisfied with myself. My life does not mean that I need the fear of "joy" and "last time" to understand it all ... and I do not want heaven or hell to bribe or fear me to behave like Appropriate. Thank you very much.
