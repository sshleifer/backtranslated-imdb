I've seen some bad movies, and this is there. There is no plot to say about it, like one of the bad coma on the TV series. I just wanted to slap that little girl, so I said she was really suspicious all the way through the movie. The monster that ran around wearing diamonds was a joke. I saw "Silent Hill" in it too. And I read that this was done by and stared in the Finnish heavy metal Lordi So it's not surprising that it is not reasonable. It looks like a vehicle for promotion there and nothing more. The FX is very good. The look of the movie, the monster and even the performance are good. But the story and its telling are not there
