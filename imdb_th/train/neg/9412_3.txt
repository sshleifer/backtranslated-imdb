This movie is a movie as part of the Sydney Marse Gras Film Festival 2007. I don't expect that this movie will be what others choose for me. <br /> <br /> Actually I like movies that need time to develop. Peace is good But this movie is a bit slow. <br /> <br /> Credit must go to two main actors. There was a feeling of tension between them as two completely different people. The real mistake came together awkwardly. There are soft and sad moments when we learn more about them. <br /> <br /> I like this scene and how to shoot. It is uncomfortable and black and white, and it increases the intimacy of the movie and reinforces the strangeness of the characters. <br /> <br /> I just don't understand the ending What is the point of it all?
