Somewhere in his DANSE MACABRE nonfiction book, Stephen King suggests that one trick in writing a scary story is to avoid showing the reader that the horrible things are waiting behind the door. If the door finally explodes and has a ten-foot error, the reader may be a little scared. But he would think "Okay, I can handle this matter, at least not so high." There is nothing more terrifying than the thing that lurks in the invisible and unknown side of the tightly closed door that awaits you. br /> <br /> The haunting people are completely misunderstood as the director Jan Debor. Started his movie by comparing, opening his own door and shouting: "Look, everyone looks! It's a ten-foot-tall insect! That's scary, right? "The rules of diminishing return immediately. At the end of the movie, the director is talking, jumping up and down, fighting CGI and his pan like crazy and screaming gently:" Look. Everyone looks! Ten-foot-ten shortcomings! ... and now here comes one hundred thousand high ankle! <br /> <br /> The filmmakers believe that only special techniques can compensate for all other defects in this effort. (And there are lots) they can't do and can't In fact, as impressive as it had been, the special effects were stifling and frightening until the audience distracted, whether admired or frustrated rather than looking at the story. <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> For me, the worst of the stupidity of this film occurred when a statue with "blood" bursting out of its mouth, trying to drown Liam Neeson (like Dr. Marrow) in Fountain The film does not know what to do with this alleged idea when they are there. So they have a Neeson that is poking in the water and hurling his arms. In the next scene, the good doctor apparently made himself dry and forgot everything about the annoying events. <br /> <br /> Shirley Jackson's novel seems to be foolish in the script. This nonsense movie by the board Of the stoner teenager with a low IQ, which thinks that the way to make people scared is to make every effect bigger and louder: "OK, anyway, come on, uh, make the ceiling , Do you know that the creepy looks that she ... and these horrible things, such as laying a trap on her bed? "<br /> <br /> the elegance of saving the chase The only thing that is ultimately scary is really funny. When it's time for Owen Wilson (While Luke Sanderson) fell on the floor, then went to the secret of the carpet - riding. O 'Death, I just fell on the floor, myself laughing, laughing. <br /> <br /> Create Not good With an incredibly heavy hand and full of unbelievable conversations and pointless scenes, this empty hunting is an example in the textbook of how to not make horror movies.
