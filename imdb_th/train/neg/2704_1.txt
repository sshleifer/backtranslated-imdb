I do not understand why people praise this garbage. It's wrong, stupid, unrealistic, scary and about everything else. This film is a perspective on life, racial issues, bias and everything that happens in college. This is where it fails. There is no truth. From scenes that do not have many suspicious feelings in the movie, for example, <br /> <br /> A black man chased a white man with a gun, a black man and stopped by a security guard, handcuffed and executed while the gunman <br /> <br /> The only white man sneaking down from the people on the roof that was stopped and beaten by the same black man was stopped and gave Rod's style. Kearney King while the gun man ran Free while later being chased by one of the four guards. <br /> <br /> As a previous reviewer pointed out that 230 pounds of white men, many of whom were beaten by many black men who weighed About 160 pounds, including 105 pounds of breasts From white people who are afraid and confusing and heartless and righteous (?) Black people. It is almost an insult to black and white I am a white man and I know that many blacks and Hispanic people accept that this film is not correct to portray characters and make them unique because of their competition. < br /> <br /> The story that I will explain About three characters One of the other black athletes is a white woman who is afraid of confusion that questions her sexuality and the third person is a confused and frightened white man, then blames his problem with the black person he Became a Nazi later They all have problems and adventures, including sex, rape, fighting, love, hate, bias, racial warfare and oh yes, don't forget education. Which all comes down to the end for a serious shot After they returned to living boring life and thought "Being a white person is bad." Is this sound like your college year? Don't think so I do not think that the director attended college, especially if he made this mess. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a terrible, terrible and ugly movie. If you want to see precise views or racial issues, go to the American History X if you want to see a more accurate view of Porkys College rental. Just avoid this clutter.
