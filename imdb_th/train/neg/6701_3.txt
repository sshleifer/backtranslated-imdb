I have been an environmentalist for many years and look forward to this show. I set to record every episode because I think I can learn something new that is great. I may do it if I can pass Rachelle. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that many things are staged to make it look like a reality show and attract that audience. It doesn't work for people interested in world development. <br /> <br /> This performance should be called Nagging and Rachelle. <br /> <br /> Because Ed is a great character of information. Perhaps the second item that is serious about the environment seems to be a good idea. Making things worse is not necessary for some of us. <br /> <br /> I don't record episodes or watch the show anymore. But let us know if the real green item may be in the works
