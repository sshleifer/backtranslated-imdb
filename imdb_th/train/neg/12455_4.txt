I remember watching the important moments when I was about 7 years old. I was a big comic book reader at that time, and things related to the hero were heavily anticipated. However, the results are not as good as they should be. <br /> <br /> I know "Emma Peel" Diana Prince because they have just ended recently and Diana returned to the body. Amazon However, there are little actions that I feel bored throughout most movies. The last set is an interesting idea. But looks more like a cheerleader than a superhero. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie again during my late teens. It doesn't improve much. Cathy Lee Crosby is more familiar. Thank you. Incredible. But her performance didn't improve The script has a few good ideas, such as Amazon's rogue and good villains in Ricardo Montalban, but it doesn't come together and is boring. <br /> <br /> I think they should create after The story is better and the show becomes more important. It's like an ordinary spy movie too, with the heart story written by people who have never seen a comic book before. Amazon's composition is interesting. But need to expand. <br /> <br /> The film succeeded in forcing manufacturers to return to the drawing board and create something honest if the camp is too low and low budget. Low here and not cheap heroes. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if there are movies available on DVD. If it's a comparison and only historical documents, even Superman 4 is available and it's not. There is nothing beyond this movie (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It should be worth seeing the curiosity and inspiration and precautions for future generations.
