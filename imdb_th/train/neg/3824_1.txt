I feel that this film does not describe Smith's history. The goal of this film is to tell Smith's life in a "comfortable" way to the LDS Church leaders. Historical accuracy seems to be a trivial matter. This film is designed to be an experience. "Faith promotion" is not a balanced view of Smith. "As a man" I spend my time studying Smith's life and reading both LDS and LDS. The movie, like most LDS projects, is beautifully filmed and works well. However, this is not a true image, whether it is the beginning of Mormonism or Smith's relatively short life. <br /> <br /> The important period has been proven, the events Smith had when he was old Seven years While this event is undoubtedly important in creating his mental perspective, it appears that the main reason for inclusion in the film is to help create a sympathetic view of Joseph Smith. Showed that the teenage years of Smith, this film was silent about the involvement of the Smith family in the practice of magic in the year 1820. Another problem was that while the movie was This shows that Joseph Smith joined a wrestling match as well. But could not show that he was sometimes upset and became violent. <br /> <br /> This film has no history. In any way and should be considered as a fictional film about a man I would not recommend watching this movie for other purposes than entertainment.
