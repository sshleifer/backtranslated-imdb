Now I have not read the original short story to know all the wrong literary points here, so I will not follow that path here. <br /> <br /> But I have time to learn. Stephen King's movies are simple, not horror stories, which may have some exceptions. This is not one of them. It started well enough and when I would not complain about the performance, though Fred Gwynne would be great as usual .. Also, I would forgive the lack of overall parenting skills because they needed to build a story here. Go ... <br /> <br /> But there is one consistent issue that I can't help but get annoyed. And that is close to the ending of the movie and at least 2 characters participate in activities of folly The time I talked about was: There were small zombies running around the house. You wondered if it was under your bed. <br /> <br /> (a) Get as close to the bed as you can before lifting. The bedspread is revealed throughout your body, regardless of any damage, such as an unhealthy human being that may damage you or <br /> <br /> (b) move away from The bed is a little bit so you can look through the end points. Which is completely open from a slightly more secure position, or at least seeing the fear of coming to you when responding <br /> <br /> I know together (a) I feel like offering Yourself to kill today. Bleh <br /> <br /> Enjoy this movie, but ... not scary.
