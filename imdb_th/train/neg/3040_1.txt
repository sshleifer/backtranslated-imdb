With this title, you know that you get a lot of junk, bad behavior, bad scripts, bad directors. The grammar is not good. <br /> <br /> The movie creates a very loud sound that is not music and many people shout. The movie creates a racial bad attitude. Why every movie has a black hero hooked? Why do heroes always have to dance successfully? Why does the famous rapper always be in the dance movie? Why can't the letter "s" be in the name? <br /> <br /> Hollywood needs to stop stupid audiences and make movies that have people with brains that know how to speak English correctly. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and don't go to see
