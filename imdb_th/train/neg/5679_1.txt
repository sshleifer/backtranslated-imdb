I was frustrated with the real picture at the beginning of the movie that I felt sick on my stomach and ended up closing the movie. Who can give this movie more than 1 rating, messy about me? I know that the intent of this film is to scare. But showing the true picture of a dog that has been living (Hold up vomiting while I type) - Please! I closed it after the scene with the rotting baby. I have my eyes covered at that point. It is not surprising that this movie was found at the trash bargain in HMV. I have no desire to watch other movies by this Uwe person. Anyone who likes this needs to be treated for a period of time.
