Last night I saw this on TV. Or rather, I flick to another channel every time to see infomercials. When I can't stand it anymore, it's terrible, really bad. Not "very bad. It's good." Just flat out badly. How has it been funded? Who thinks this is a good idea? One of my fellow actors screened and was told that he wasn't good enough to play as a bad guy. But I think what they mean is "Save yourself and escape from this steaming pile of @ # $%" I bet the rest of the actors get the option. For fairness, acting is difficult to judge because of the horrific rise of Americans. The shooting was stupid. Awkward and arrogant acts Lack of dialog Where the most sad thing is the boat In real life ferry Interislander It's a shabby boat and in this movie it's not so good. Instead of trying unsuccessfully to make it seem that the new crew wrapped up with a little tinsel wrapped around the election that rusty me, not you, they can change the script to explain or celebrate the shame. Joke
