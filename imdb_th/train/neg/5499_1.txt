I saw this explosion when it attacked the cinema. Why do I laugh all the time? Because of its stupidity caused me to lose consciousness I look back and realize that there is no joke in the whole movie. That has no intention of intention It was deeply funny that Lizzie cn chewed a piece of Nurplex and became a carnivorous giant devil ... but her small dress was still perfect even though she was bigger than when she was a hundred. Or the type of movie that men can be shocked by the pacemaker and fall in love only and return to consciousness without having to see a doctor And don't let me start with the ridiculous fate of the "villain" that they decide they want to create "Conflict" Ah, <br /> <br /> For those who complain about Disney who set goals for children - the pornographic part of the film seems to prove disproportionate. We want Daryl Hannah to accuse Jeff Bridges of having a strange video tape? What do you do if you are a Disney and you don't have the idea of ​​attracting viewers who are above 8 people without having to write scripts that are smarter! I thoroughly believed that Disney paid the commission for ratings so that the film could escape from the murder and still receive a family friendly level. <br /> <br /> DVD format is wasted.
