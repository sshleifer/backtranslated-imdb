I almost always continue to include music in movies. My belief is that the quality of the movie will be automatically updated if only the most annoying songs will be hit by an ax. However, things changed quickly after watching the scary Black (without music) and the film. Page 3 (many songs) While the blacks were weak to the extreme, Page 3 presented an impressive story with performances and Good direction The music is almost coincidental & blends seamlessly with the movie. Of course, there are no women who are sprayed with water without a clear reason from the mysterious water source while swirling violently on the road at night. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by how brave. There is no light at all and almost every scene is completely believable. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie for those who speak Hindi, at least have a little understanding of Mumbai life. Previously, because English subtitles were below standard and there were many errors which sometimes reversed the meaning of the actual text. The latter because you have to appreciate the authenticity of the picture when you live on your own. <br /> <br /> I will rank this as a worthy job of international recognition. The scene with a gossip driver is impressive and serves as a source of true humor and other perspectives about all the provocations. Although sometimes the characters talk about the most inexplicable things that deviate from the overall direction of the movie. <br /> <br /> I think the two scenes are not the same. It's fun to watch, rather than stir up sad feelings. All the scenes tend to look a bit stupid. These things are a little problem because the overall movie is really rare Actors are not 'heroes' - that is the key. The opportunity to see people who are convincing in a special environment - daily life The background looks at the extent of the scarcity and the rays of rare hope for Indian movies. <br /> <br /> 8/10
