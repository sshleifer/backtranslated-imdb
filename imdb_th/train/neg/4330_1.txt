Last night I decided to look at the prequel or I would say something called prequel to Carlito - "The way Carlito: Rise of Power (2005)" which goes directly to DVD ... not surprised ..... And I mean S% & KS completely !!! Waist of time, watch it and I think it will be a pure waist of time. Write about it .... I don't understand that De Palma agrees with the production of the sh # t-fest of this movie .... except for just the facts. One of the things that I introduced my hat to ... J Hernandez, a young Brigante player .... reminds me that De Niro came into Brando's shoes to portray Don Don Cor. Leonardo in the Godfather II ... excellent and still Oscar !!! J. Hernandez is very good. He has the courage to be a Pacino girl .... Terrible for him. I don't think he will play in the movie anymore and after I watched this movie and Look at the original Carlitos method to get rid of the bad taste from my mouth.
