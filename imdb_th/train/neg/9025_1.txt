Sorry - this movie is just a cheap TV program. I saw a lot of promotions and expected professional movies like "Stormer" - What I offer is an economical movie like "XENA" or "Hercules" on TV. There is no more boring atmosphere than the fight scene. Good idea - Not much. I hope I get the opportunity to create a movie like this. Then I will show you how to make a movie like this !!! <br /> <br /> My ASIAN-Tips: "MUSA - THE WARRIOR", "STORMRIDERS" "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my bad English!
