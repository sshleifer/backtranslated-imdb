Tashan - The title describes the nature of the movie. <br /> <br /> This type of movie was created for failure. The shameful thing that Yash Raj Films produces is that those movies are worthless than the C-grade movies or even C-grade movies. At the box office that definitely deserves. <br /> <br /> In my view, this is the worst movie ever made from Yash Raj Films' banner. Why are they managing the project? This terrible thick with Vijay Krishna Acharya that there is a real sense of the action flick? He tried to mimic Sanjay Gadhvi's methods like Dhoom, but eventually he was tortured. The action scene is more than a cartoon or animated movie created to make the audience feel tired. <br /> <br /> The story loses meaning and content to gently win the audience. In most scenes, Anil Kapoor reminds me of Tamil's southern Rajnikant in his body language and expression by words. I'm not a fan of both Saif and Akshay, but Kareena's reward should eventually go into Saif's hand instead of Akshay, just from the beginning I expected. But in the end, it made me dissatisfied with the truth. Saif was the master behind all the adventures, while Akshay joined in the midst. In every movie, the finals should be judged by all the characters of the whole story and the prize or word that should be given to those who deserve credit and Tashan loses this and is not expected to be popular <br /> <br /> Akshay has nothing new to show the talent of comedians here. But still reminds him of his previous movie He wants to create a new image for his fans seriously, which will impress them again and again, while Saif has done a great job in the competition and now he comes back again in a hilarious manner. He passed this movie. But he fully developed himself in the performance and last but not least about Kareena. She looked hot with a bikini, which some people complained when she was too thin. But I don't think so instead of being skinny, skinny !!! It is a good factor for women to attract important people (or say men) beside them. It is good that Saif's son Ibrahim appeared in the first and last episode as a young Saif. I hope he now. Will lean forward in the goal of acting as his career. <br /> <br /> People who like Tazan, they are mentally ill or want to go back to childhood or say they want to accept. In the hospital For the director to launch Vijay Krishna Acharya, who made the project offense proposed by Yash Raj Films in the future. He should experiment and study the script for at least 5 years before going into action. <br /> <br /> Sorry. I don't like scoring good stars for this type of junk movie.
