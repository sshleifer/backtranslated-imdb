I will try to use the words to explain this in ... <br /> <br /> I see the manuscript which is good in my own way. But back then I should be afraid of the sequel. <br /> <br /> And I was scared when I picked it up. But now I have seen that I have to say that it's even worse. I think Why are these movies still receiving money, still making my mind spin? <br /> <br /> Let's start with the actors. They're not good people. But must say that some people have to turn their backs by being scary ordinary people But what can actors do with this script? It is trying to imitate the original. At this time, the place that has changed the style of any story has disappeared and any attempt that has happened to something that has never been done before has failed miserably. In a futile attempt to make it the latest, they tried to make it exciting by using all 'Big Brother' themes, but it has been exhausted for a long time and the end has been trying to save the movie as well. The reference to the original '83, but it ended up being a normal joke and sometimes a little sad. In conclusion, if you have nothing and I don't mean to do ... go watch it or play Frisbee ... with a DVD .... by yourself, it will give you the same fun .. I promise
