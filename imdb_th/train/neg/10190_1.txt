After watching this episode in MST3K, I have to wonder how many films this story has borrowed. It seems to include elements of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and at least many things. At one point I expected Chris Makaste to call Limerick ROWSDOWER. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the director has a clue about how many holes in the storyline? As well as the fact that although the gas is unusable, there are many in the abandoned gas station.
