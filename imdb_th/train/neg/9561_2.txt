Like everyone else who commented on me here, I must say that this movie is not good. But not the worst thing I have ever seen There will be no direct reference to the story or movie sequence in this comment because I hate spoilers. <br /> <br /> I feel like I'm watching the episodes of the TV show or something they get $. Some special $$ for use with CGI (I've seen worse) ... In conclusion, it is quite an insult to the audience at least if you have knowledge about computers and / or technology at all. The insults were too much to make me feel comfortable, and I found myself pleading with everything ends - soon - halfway through. There are also situations. Countless "simple solutions" that are also insulting your intelligence as human beings ... <br /> <br /> This film fades completely compared to the old "Wargames" and I think. It is a shame that they have to call it sequel. <br /> <br /> Two stars from me because of one thing and one more thing: The actors of the actors are not bad. That shit is a gag of the script that they have to work with. Still, they should not sign a contract with this movie. Not a really professional move But I think we all have the cost to pay <br /> <br /> For those who give the highest score in this movie ... you have to be in the studio's payroll. My only explanation. <br /> <br /> For everyone who doesn't see this thing: by all means watch it and decide for yourself. But reduce your expectations to the floor (Already part)
