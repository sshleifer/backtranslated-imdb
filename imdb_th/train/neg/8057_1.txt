What happened to this movie? many things Corrections try too hard to look good and do nothing but confuse the audience while at the same time giving him a powerful headache. The story is messy and is clearly protracted from what began as a short story. (Story or movie) The plot is made from a good story less than ten minutes, and it stretched so hard that it reached the minimum length for a feature film. We all know what happens to things when we stretch them, right? They're thinner. Finally, the plot is just a thin paper that you might miss if you don't care, which is hard to do. When watching this movie The performances are not impressive even at least. The characters are poorly written and not interesting, not interesting. One of the worst things that is wrong with this movie is clearly whoever is responsible for the score / soundtrack. Don't know what this movie is or what it should be about. (Not that I blame him. I can't. Don't understand at all.) As a result, half of the songs in the movie are not suitable for all scenes. In addition, what happens to sexual intelligence between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Naturally, this is to attract young men. But it is very cheap And what is the first scene related to the rest of the movie? At any possible level at all? Both creepy men do not seem to be involved in the movie at all. They are there to have a chase scene. I wonder if everyone will really enjoy the movie, so the combination of bad and shameless and scary efforts like Hollywood in an interesting idea. But I digress I recommend this to a teenager who has a low interest rate that doesn't care about the horrible horror movie as long as having sex and blood in it. (Although it's true for the Killer Cut that I see) 1/10
