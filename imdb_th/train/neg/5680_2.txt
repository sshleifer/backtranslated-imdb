If at least the cruelty and death that is drawn is intended to make their story together But the script doesn't understand and is stupid. <br /> <br /> It's nowhere. It's just a ridiculous scene and the stupid final scene is pinned as if to say .. "The end * Beep * You hate me and a few defenders for my garbage." <br /> <br /> I don't understand. The masked murderer who has never removed the mask from the prison is a rape scene that should be raped by an ugly serial killer and killed by him and nothing else? There is no explanation. There is no punishment for the very weak main character, an actor like Pare, who doesn't try to get rid of the man who killed his police, torturing babies, women and dogs and sending them to you To watch the video <br /> <br /> All unknown police go to travel in the dark by themselves (individually) in his farm house at night, like a group of poorly written teen characters that will be killed. Die at Time like a silly bunch, and no other police heard them die in one darkness after another and just walk around without reason until each person is killed. On the other hand <br /> <br /> Scary scenes of real-life animals at first, without reason or explanation, are they thinking about whether or not they are watching it to help themselves? It's a joke for him ... what is it? Nope Boll just thought to throw it down to make animal lovers .. <br /> <br /> Pare believes the words of the psychotic way to let his family if he killed himself .. The police that are smarter and saddened that you never saw in the movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know why I don't like his work. I tried to find some reasons to explain the horror writer art, but this ... pure crap. <br /> <br /> What are you doing anymore? I hope you will figure it out because I know that people deserve more than you can't dream of getting the budget you have repeatedly given to create their movies. <br /> <br /> If you Want to see Boll, really his best. Check "Postal". It's ok.
