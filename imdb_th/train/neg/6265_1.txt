I am the nephew of the director. I spent many years getting a copy of this movie and I can confirm that it is one of the worst movies of all time. My uncle no longer has a copy (I asked). I am looking forward to bringing a copy to him. <br /> <br /> The average rating of the movie is 1.9 / 10 as far as I can tell if it should be placed. Somewhere in the mid-30s in the IMDb "below 100". However, there are only 206 votes that have not yet been placed. <br /> <br /> It's sad that this film is not respected by the name 100 Lowest rating <br /> <br /> However, I gave a copy. The films to family members as holiday gifts this year. The best / worst gift ever?
