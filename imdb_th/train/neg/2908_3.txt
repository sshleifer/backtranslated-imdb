According to a book by Gabriel Marquez and it may be a great literature, this film adaptation is really interesting because it is like fighting with sleep rather than enjoying the movie. A story about an old couple whose son died and lived a life dominated by poverty and the main character is a chicken that hopes to someday bring money to the upcoming battle. I have no emotion to say anything more about useless cocky stories. Maybe you see Salma Hayek here, but sit for 90 minutes on your screen, right? No Gracia
