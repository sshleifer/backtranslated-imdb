Although I use this website frequently to see what other people rate, what I think is a challenge or just a simple fun movie. After watching this movie in the fourth movie last night, I felt compelled. To write something down again. <br /> <br /> This movie may be the most shallow experience I've ever had - the main character played by Danny Dyer (23 Are you sure? And not Gillian Anderson (who was Scully as Leonard Nimoy would be Spock) had no real content about them - I'm not sure that the first half hour of the film was not cut Finally But of course in revenge movies you want sympathy with the victims ... here I don't care at all. In fact, the only character I was interested in was a dog and a deer that approached. And both animals act as direct (sic) and scully, which is very scary I think you do as good as the script you received and I would like to thank all the writers, producers and actors for taking 90 minutes of my life.
