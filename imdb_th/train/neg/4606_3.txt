This film is an attempt to enter a place that most people can't and perhaps shouldn't get involved. It is a similar experiment in which the strange view given to us in The Cell, although not close in depth and is a good image The plot is created simply by giving the feeling of starting the camp. Then, while the film was changed to "drama", it should be plotted in what few legs had to stand in the first place. <br /> <br /> In general, the idea is a child ( Chris McKenna) who wants money He plays as an assassin killing a city accountant. Then he did not receive money for his work. But was tortured for many days because he dreamed of a "smart" idea of ​​trying to use the backup files he used to be useful for payment A stupid attitude that tried to force them to pay compensation to him because he was horribly hurt and endlessly attacked. He started to go crazy. (Some very annoying scenes) then thought that he paid for his sin and started a new one. He visited his wife (Kari Wuhrer) of the man he killed and won her love. Shortly after she discovered who he was, the tragedy, strike and revenge swept across the air while the boy went after his torment. (Daniel Baldwin, George Wendt, Vernon Wells) For "kindness" before having to ask what it is with Kari Wuhrer and horror / gore. <br /> <br /> Looks like Everything she has recently laid out will be in this category. Get me like you in "Eight-Legged Freaks" and she is okay in "Anaconda", but even though all her cuteness and charm are obvious (Wow, you're hot!) You can do better and choose a better role. Or maybe I'm wrong and that's just a misunderstanding For everyone you are there, you will see her "full" in this film, although it is quite strange and short-lived. I almost felt that she made a soft porn movie after watching this movie. (There are some things that are not different from Kari's career.) Sex simulation is something that makes you wonder what is happening during the shooting. <br /> <br /> Next, I will say that there is a show. Some good Don't expect much from Daniel Balwin, whose career seems to have been destined to be his second brother Alex. This film presents a few of the old ones, like George Wendt (Norm from Bravo) and Vernon Wells (Commando, strange science). Above all, Chris McKenna works best in playing the main character. Valley His little acting experience and also his convincing nature as an innocent child brought some elements of the film to the movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't go out to find this person. If you are bored and bored with the old episodes of "The Hitchhiker", I might suggest watching this thing. <br /> <br /> And Kari, please start acting in a better movie!
