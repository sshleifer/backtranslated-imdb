This mess is terrible. It doesn't have the same qualities as horror. <br /> <br /> Debbie Rochon's talent is completely lost in this movie. She is not a bad person. The remaining actors seem to be porno wannabes and the plot is crippled. I'm not going to talk about it. <br /> <br /> Make yourself good and jump to the end credits to listen to the upcoming band. TwoMarlowe shows that sex "It is all 80s disco candy music. Nice up tempo song about Gambleing & Sex. More fun than" Bleed ". Use this method when there is a device to copy videos. But decided to record the song at the end of the movie. You really have a movie "BAD"
