I like the actors quite a lot. But the story unfolds slowly. Danny Glover works well, making you wonder if he is a bad person or not. At the same time, other characters are only part of the story. Dennis Quaid does not have enough space in the story he can do. I think the first scene is more frightening compared to the story that happened. I'll watch again I rate it here 5 (hopefully I can rate 5.5)
