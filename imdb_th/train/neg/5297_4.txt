It really disturbed my mind when someone found a movie like this and claimed to be one of the worst slasher movies there. This is not the worst thing. But it's not a good movie But not the worst Go see something like Death Nurse or Blood Lake and come back to me and tell me that you think Night Brings Charlie is the worst or not. The film has a lot of camera work and good editing, which is more than I can say for a very vague slasher movie. <br /> <br /> This film doesn't deliver death on screen. You see his pruning saw tearing his neck. But other deaths are not interesting But the lack of graphic violence on the screen does not mean that this is not a slasher movie, but a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The film is clearly intended to not be taken seriously The movie came at the end of the second slasher round, so of course it was a reflection of the traditional slasher element made on the tongue in the cheek style. For example, after killing Charlie, go to the 'welcome' symbol of the city and mark the population less. This is something that can only laugh. <br /> <br /> If you are a slasher movie, definitely watch this movie. It's different from the slightly general slasher movie that has the possibility of two killers, but not so much. The comedy movie of this movie is quite telling the audience to relax and not bring this movie You may forget the movie, you may remember. I will remember because I love the name
