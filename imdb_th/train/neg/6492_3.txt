I'm not sure what to expect from comedy, sci-fi, fantasy movies, but from the actors involved, I think I'll spin it. The tone of the movie feels awkward through each type. But never felt balanced, so I finally quit trying and focused on movies and solo performances, which I think is good overall, considering each character With a little depth due to the nature of the story (I won't give anything here.) I have to say that it feels a lot longer than the 96-minute runtime and not in a good way. At the end, I was looking for a shutdown, some satisfaction. But it didn't become a clever or clever piece that I hoped would be I think Tony thinks wrong that what he did at the end of the movie makes us know ... but it's a sad mistake to try and check the accuracy before 95 minutes with no conclusion understand I finally felt cheated. IMO would be better if letting it stand without "ending" as an art ... just or ... I might miss the issue entirely :)
