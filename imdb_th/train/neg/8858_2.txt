Ben, a police officer outside the city, convinces his sister to be brutally murdered and wants to take her murderer to justice. But he was contacted by Stefan, who believed that his sister was a victim of werewolves. So Ben, his sister's best friend and Stefan, traveled to Transylvania to get rid of this evil. <br /> <br /> This is a terrifying thing at level B and I wonder how it will be released. It makes the original 'Howling' seem like a masterpiece. What is Christopher Lee thinking? This is his worst performance I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There was a huge mistake with this cheap movie from the show. Hammam and wooden performances from Annie McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not to forget Lee), wonderful fashion (those sunnies), special techniques, cheap and weak, light use at Bad, humorous ... If there are worthless 80s songs ( Some movies that focus on playing as a band unknown) Werewolves have a penis which is unsightly and boring story with flat dialogue and annoying. I think if it's so bad, it would be very funny, but I think wrong. <br /> <br /> The advantage is that the position and setting of the movie look good, but actually ... I will add Sybil Danning in the short scene <br /> <br /> During the credits, the band plays their shit songs during the editing of the strange scenes from the movie, which I ask why <br /> <br /> chaos Terrifying But at least it's not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
