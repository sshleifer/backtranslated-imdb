It's very bad. The actor is not good. You can tell that they are trying hard to resist. But we all know that you can't Writing clearly and easy to watch. They try to sell it. Humor and pacing are very hard work. It is hard to believe that these great actors signed with this story. <br /> <br /> That said it was terrible that we were struggling away from the screen. We just have to know where the wreck of this train goes. But that's just because we caught it on TV. If we actually pay for this, we will be bored. <br /> <br /> It gets 2 stars because at least it's good / bad and the music (Compared to an indie soundtrack that is trying too much) is reminiscent of the episode of Scooby-Doo ... but not as good.
