The worst and underpinning is full of people who should know better. (The actors have six Oscars between them) It is located in Africa, 'contemporary' (created in 1979) and related to the slave trade. It writes scripts and performs horribly. (Michael Ken, Peter Ustinoff and William Holden achieved this low career level) and lacked complete excitement. There is also a laughing plan. You don't believe for a moment what character will behave the way they do under these circumstances. Richard Fleischer leads, but you get the impression that it's on the phone. This thing is as bad as it should be.
