Watch DVD Treasure Island in every movie production course! It is an example of a book that tells how to not make a movie. Watching a movie and listening to the author / director's opinion shows the vast gap between what he knows about the character and what he communicates with the audience about them. Call me old But I think the movie is a way of communication and communication is not perfect if the audience doesn't know what the director is talking about. The director's purpose is to make the movie void of "Hollywood Convention" among those conventions, alas, is the consistency of the character and the clarity of the concept. The director himself realizes that viewers often do not understand the issues that he deliberately avoided "Hollywood clich√©". However, it seems that he does not understand the idea that there is a rational thinking. They shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly. It's normal to avoid them. But they need to be replaced by other means of communicating the same idea, not just eliminating This film is built on an interesting place full of potential. Two puppets were assigned to create a personality and background for an unidentified corpse, which will be used in a distortion mission on the last day of World War II. Soon, each person began to fill their personal imagination with their characters and inventions to become more realistic for them. The less insulting person for "Hollywood Conference" of traditional storytelling can create great movies with this idea. This movie is not for sure! Puppets do everything they can to create stability for these characters. But they are often defeated by scripts that are confused and confused In particular, I became more and more impressed by Gonzo, who played a lively corpse in many muppet movies. He is often characterized as a very charming puppet.
