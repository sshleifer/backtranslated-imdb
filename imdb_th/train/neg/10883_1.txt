This film is not programmed in Italian theaters. I have seen it in a show called "fantafestival" I find it terrible because some scenes look like chaotic and dark music videos. The use of glowing colors is ridiculous and there is no doubt in the film, the song comes out of the story completely and I have no explanation about F. Picture effects If you watch the first scene, the movie seems to be interesting. But a few minutes later it will be busy, interesting stories, but the development requires a complete examination
