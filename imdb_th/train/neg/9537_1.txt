** Spoiler ** I rent "Tesis" (or "Thesis" in English) with the strength of the efforts of director Alejandro Amenabar. Later "The Other" due to the film being measured and It was horribly horrible. I think his previous efforts would be of similar quality and I felt that it was a good horror story. But I turned out to be the most boring and miserable excuse for a silly slasher movie that I've seen since the German movie "Anatomie" (which reminds me of this). <br /> <br /> The story has potential, but It was thrown away in the first 20 minutes. It revolves around the beautiful innocent student psychologist Angela (Ana Torrent - killer Jessica Harper) in the story of violence in the movie. In a situation that is too far away to allow her to come here, she has a 'smell' tape in which two men suffer, torture, tear and kill a girl on camera. Angela and Chema, her scary friend (Fele Martinez) Was shocked by the tape and decided to reach the lowest point of those responsible. <br /> <br /> This leads to ... nothing. <br /> <br /> They don't. Used to give the real reason why they wanted to find a female killer girl (Because they refused to contact the police continuously throughout the events that unfolded, even if they were at risk) and their own mysteries were as soft as Graham Norton in a room full of girls. The rabbit has only the proper 'clue' (the form of the camera used to discover the killer) and that is) the weak image and b) the wheel in the first 20 minutes. The rest of what is called 'unraveling' is born. Because of the blind luck, more ridiculous twists, and the horrible, transparent and pointless SLEW that was thrown in to take time out. <br /> <br /> Seriously - Amana Bar may know His story about ghosts But he clearly saw that he had never read a detective book in his life The key to a good investigation is to have a large number of potential suspects and get rid of them one by one with clever deductions and finding more and more evidence before they enter the cycle. Finally, in "Tesis", * the front spoiler * The killer's identity is correctly guessed by the amateur 'detective' almost immediately, and then we get the 100 minutes of the writer trying very hard. To eliminate poverty, we run out of ideas. Raised his hand and said "Okay, yes, I am his." For any logic or reason behind the crime - there is no such luck. You are watching the movie wrong if that is what you are. <br /> <br /> The only thing that dragged "Tesis" down from being a stupid thriller and bad writing is the way it tries. Some issues that are ridiculous and confusing about the violence in the movie. I don't know that the gesture is trying to do this. But seems to try to cram the thoughts that confuse psychobabble confusion during the rest of the gibberish and say "Look at me! I'm the political person! "The final scene," The Point "of this movie, is used in the house is ridiculous and ridiculous. We can't help but wonder if Amenabar is embarrassed now. If he can't do it, he should definitely do it. This is the 'all amateur night at the slaughterhouse'. Overall, <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't believe that I lost two hours. (Feel like at least six) in this urban legend of 'Snuff movie' (and that is all they have, although the way this film tries to introduce them to certain criminal phenomena that swept the world!) Is an area that can take advantage of the tantalizing in the horror movie. Good movie ("Videodrome" everyone?) But it's very easy to cross the line to innocence. The land that has it (eg: "My Little Eye") ... "Tesis" tends to be the lowest at all times for the 'snuff movie' category. At all levels, this is better than leaving and embedding. I will award 1 in 10 of some light. But that's all that has been
