This is a movie about infidelity and revenge. The pair with the connection "Twin" felt that something was wrong with her sister. This film takes forever to create a storyline. The story has been done many times. That show is mostly offensive. When the plot comes together, the movie will end. Laura and Ashley are twins who live with their insulting father. Father seems to like Ashley, so Laura is blamed for everything. There is a promise that will make children never break. But when they grow up, their lives go in different directions. Ashley gets a job in a restaurant where she meets Barry, a married man. Of course, there is nothing good that can happen. The fact that Barry has tinnitus is a bad excuse for how to follow him. I waited for this film to be better and to get some resolution. But never happened
