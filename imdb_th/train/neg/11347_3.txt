Now Cult of the Cobra is available on DVD in a traditional format that has justice in all matters. Unfortunately, it doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> There are two top performers who accept themselves and can be expected under circumstances. It is effectively controlled all in the sound stage and the studio backdrop. It looks ok but too planned and in 80 minutes it still has a heavy seat. <br /> <br /> For example The first attack of Cobra in the first episode of the GIs is certainly a single attack too. <br /> <br /> Julia's business chose to marry Pete more than Tom had never done anything. Tom immediately fell in love with Lisa and she never had any reason to envy Julia (or her) <br /> <br /> 'Julia's feminine instinct' was presented as if it had been taken. To planning important developments but it is not In the same way, Pete's investigation of the Cobra cult and the suspicions that fell with Tom didn't have any purpose other than filling the screen. <br /> <br /> These are just the symptoms of basic problems. The movie has a mysterious structure, but not as soon as the curse is pronounced. We will know where the story is heading, so the character is carefully revealed by revealing what we already know. <br /> <br /> The ending is particularly weak. Julia was threatened purely by accident. Lisa has no reason to want to kill her - she just happens wrong at the wrong time. When Tom appeared at a certain time to save her life, it is unclear whether she was threatened or not. Then he made the removal of the cobra in the way that the previous victim had done. <br /> <br /> It was an extraordinary little story of a story that I found myself wondering on the earth. How did the head studio, then it happened to me? Some people said: "Those Val Lewton movies were very successful at RKO. So why don't we do that?" <br /> <br /> Cobra cult. Is a clear example for Cat People: Annoying Mysteries The girl with the shape changed, falling in love with the hero, looks cool, killing people, dazzled by the suspicions of the female friend of the hero, and dies at the end. Wide, it copied, but did not understand what was being copied. <br /> <br /> It was clear that it was trying to have a low and significant Lewton style. But this method is not followed into the story Lisa is not Irene She intended to be strange and mysterious. But there is no mystery about her We saw her glitter after the first attack in Asia, so remember her immediately when she appeared in New York. Never had any doubts about her purpose There is no ambiguity about whether she has become a real snake. <br /> <br /> Then again, during her night time we received us, not one. But twice on the 'bus' because the director doesn't understand what makes the 'bus' work, and in any case they will happen to the stalkers, not those who are stalked. <br /> < br /> The cat's echoes of the cat give Cobra's cult, no matter how small the differences, but they attract attention to the bay that yawned between the original and the imitation. <br /> < br /> Plagiarism may be a sincere statement But I suspect that Luton or Tourneur was particularly grateful when this passerby came out of time.
