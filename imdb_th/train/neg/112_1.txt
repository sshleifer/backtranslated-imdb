This movie is really scary. John Ritter is dropping Pratt. 75% of the leading actors deliver the script as if they were reading them from a bad editing queue card. The horrific sound mix went nowhere. Thought I would say this But Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actor in this movie, with at least 3 people sucking more. Patti Hansen delivered her role with Ben Stein's passion. I began to wonder if she didn't die inside or even Bogdanovich's children were still scary (the oldest person read her script from the Q card). This movie is really scary. There is a reason why Bogdanovich cannot get a new project until 4 years later. Please do not watch if you see it on your television program. Cancel your cable. If a friend recommends you consider your friendship If your spouse wants to see you better to find another soulmate I would like to dig the lawn darts rather than sitting in this garbage again. If I can summarize this movie in one word, it is: Suckotrocity
