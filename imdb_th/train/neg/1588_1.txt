This is the worst movie I have ever seen Billy Zane. I understand that this movie is mainly used to show newcomers, which works well for newbies. But the most important thing is that this movie is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> With all the gun sounds, you will think that the police will intervene. Even Shaun's buck coin is stupid. The way in which Sean realizes that the coin is a mistake is not true. <br /> <br /> It seems that this movie will hit together quickly, not a good job. /> Count down to the end, not syncing with anything Spend more time fighting And it is a coincidence that every time Billy explodes, Sean will leave the bullet. Once i can believe But not twice. <br /> <br /> Actually, Billy's character is stupid. It's so stupid when Sean punches him to the end. It's like a bad comedy! not good! not good!
