This movie is one of a long time. First of all, even if they share But there are scenes that are not guaranteed that John inhaled the weed like an idiot The wig and accent are terrible. They sounded worse. The old Beatle cartoon, John, is a jealous person who wears Yoko's homosexual clothes. He shows that he is in the discredited Albert Goldman book. They still spell the song name in normal conversation. "It's just the two of us"! John wouldn't mean his fans like this. Like his death showed us that he was too good if there was anything One funny scene is where the stupid Beatle fans remember John and asked him to sing Paul yesterday. John insulted saying something along the lines of "Of course, and while I lament why you don't kneel in your wife's wig That makes me laugh for many days. Really, this movie is a joke in a serious effort while coming out nonsense. John and Paul did not sit and ridicule throughout the day. They were people with a light and funny mind that even during The Beatles broke up. Forget it.
