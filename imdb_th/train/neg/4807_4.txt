"Ambush" is not a general action. It's terrible to be a normal person. A man went to find another person with a noticeable machine gun. Another man shot one round and made the man have a greater fire power without the nickname from the hail brought on him. Guess which one is a good person, like "ambush". Over and over is not a good action movie, not a good drama, not a good movie. "Ambush" failed at all levels by using B-movie veterans through movement mechanisms, almost as if they knew they were real losers. Not recommended for everyone. <br /> <br />
