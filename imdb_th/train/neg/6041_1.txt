The story about these three women is a very delicate study. About: Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) The youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans), who is about 37 years old and Martha (Frieda Pittors), the oldest mother. Muriël They are together in the same building. They have different expectations of life. Laura important, need children Muriël comes from the village and wants to change her life in Brussels. Martha dreams of her child when she is young. In fact, nothing happens in this movie, so you wait for something - for an accident - which may make this drama a reality. Over time, you will discover that director Dorothy Van Denberge wants to improve the psychological image of three women and nothing more. This film is frustrating because you expect women to learn from their experiences, which is not the case, so this movie has an empty feeling.
