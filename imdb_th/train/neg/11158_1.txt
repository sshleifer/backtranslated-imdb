Is a scary and scary movie The worst collection of ancient ideas that I have seen in a long time. Not that I see a lot. I left the theater screaming after about 40 minutes to find a hard drink. Meryl Streep is very bad. Normally 1 person can show much pain and suffering. Idhan Quinn's talents have been lost. And who told Gloria Estefan that she could? Trying to correct politically, this film still forces racial stereotypes. (Lonely music teacher who has no experience, dare to teach underprivileged children, violin in a nearby school, not cute kids! Just wrote to suit the awesome script Aaargh! Wes Craven makes me really cringe once The real horror like this!
