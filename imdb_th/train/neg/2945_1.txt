I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision in TNT, although he couldn't make this movie fun. The only reason I watched it until the end was because I taught video production and I wanted to make sure that my students had never done this bad thing ... but it took all my intestines to sit through it. It's like watching your grandmother grandmother flirt with a 15-year-old boy ... horribly painful. <br /> <br /> If you shoot a real movie, dipped in a thinner color seriously > <br /> If you see this movie in the trash at S-Mart, retreat from it as if it were a rattlesnake.
