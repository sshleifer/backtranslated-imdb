The real explosion of the movie truly This British film was created boringly. <br /> <br /> Exciting stuff! Terrorists put a bomb on the train. How can this writer and producer of the scent make this story boring? <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, as an expert who claims to defuse the bomb Naturally, when he was summoned to his wife, Anne Vernon was about to leave him. No wonder we have never heard of Miss Vernon. After the movie, it will be enough to end her career. <br /> <br /> An old man who loves to train and disturbs our generation in 1953. Dementia I think it is a great insult to show this man, even at the end.
