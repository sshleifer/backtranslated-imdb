After finding IMDb's high ratings, I decided to watch this movie. In addition to giving a high rating, I intend to avoid reading any reviews. I want to go to the theater with a clean slate without knowing any plans or expectations. <br /> <br /> From My rating, you will see that I'm disappointed. I enjoy the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I'm happy with the way the hotel manager tried to talk to him from the room. When the time that Enslin entered the room, I was ready for something terrible. <br /> <br /> The first chocolate appeared on the pillow and folded the toilet paper. Enslin responded reliably. He freaks out I received support and thought that this would be a good thing. People who make this movie understand that much less. <br /> <br /> But what happens next is a big deal. The softness was quickly replaced with a predictable shotgun method ... just blasting the audience with horrible tricks in every Hollywood book. Try to watch the radio on your own. Well, it's always scary. Moving objects in the room? Well, you can't complain. The blood drops from the wall and sinks? The great ghost that killed himself? Good. Is there anything else, how about loud noise, shake, fire, shake more, messing up, more bloody rooms, etc. etc. It's a good story. And it was done before Shows that our interest deficit is too high, causing the audience to constantly confuse everything and they will not be able to look out. <br /> <br /> It doesn't work for me. And you know what? When I went to watch a horror movie in a movie theater, it was normal to hear many women in the audience shouting in fear at a terrible time. But this movie doesn't have a horrible moment The audience is quiet and not interested. I feel that there is no cold spine. Nothing. The Shining is 100x. How is this movie? <br /> <br /> So who are these people who are saying that it is one of the best horror movies? Director's friend? Sorry I didn't get it.
