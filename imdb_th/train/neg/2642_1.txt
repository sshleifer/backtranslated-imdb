Slow, slow, slow ... There is no mystery or excitement in this movie. If you do not know who is "mole" in the first ten minutes, you must die. The intelligence must be the same as it brings them together. There are no interesting characters in the movie. (Not a movie) The pace of the movie is slow without tension. The hired killer is a great shock, unless he is aimed at Michael Douglas more than what he seems to be able to hit is a large mirror. The most funny scene in the movie is when the president's wife says the code at the end of cancer. It laughed out loud, ridiculous. At least six people got up and left the theater first. I will join them if I do not sit in the middle. I will not recommend this movie to anyone.
