Sorry, Fulse fans, but I can't go through it. The soundtrack is very annoying when they come. The performance is ridiculous. The story has already been done and the direction doesn't exist. <br /> <br /> The massacre seems to be a children's film project But I've seen some people and they look better! It seems that they are getting a low budget so they can't afford ... anything! Not a DoP, not a director. No one knows what the show is from a distance. It's a terrible movie experience. One of my worst things <br /> <br /> This is about the worst sucker I've ever seen next to Terror Toons, which is second to Killer Klowns from outside the world. I have nothing to say About this story <br /> <br /> It gives a score of 0.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend:
