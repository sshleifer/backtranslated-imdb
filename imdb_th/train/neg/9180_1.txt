Okay, I would like to start by saying that nothing in this story will surprise everyone who reads other comments that have been said to me, G-D, this movie begs! I mean, wow, I don't know if it's possible to throw as much money as they can clearly see and do something worse than any Roger Corman movie! Corman may throw this movie at some point. But rejected because of low quality scripts! The only reason this movie was originally created is that people say 'Hey, zombies are popular. Video games are popular. What games can we hold that zombies are in? Resident Evil? No one else arrived first. Silent Hill? Not too quiet People will not sit in a dark room for fear of foolishness. Hey Sega, there are no games that people run to shoot zombies. They leave the business platform, we can get money for money! '<br /> <br /> In general, they try their best to create a movie that feels like a video game, even down to shoot as if The characters are actually playing the game. <br /> <br /> The first and important problem is that the original game is awesome. I mean, <br /> <br /> The movie selling products is not good, causing the game to become worse in two weeks and then sent out to buy by a moron. And their parents for a scary Christmas Boring graphics Boring monster That level is boring Boring interface This case is boring. This is a boring game. And that is the ARCADE version. The house version is worse than before! In the home version, you don't get a shotgun in your hand while you are bored with this pointless game! But I'm talking about <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they go so far as to cut scenes from real game play during the fight scenes ??? The editors are not confident in the impact that the actual fight has occurred. Not to mention that every fight is shot from the perspective of a video game, which may explain the use of boring matrix style effects. The problem with this is that this game is the first person shooting game. (The player gets out of the character's POV.) Maybe that's why they put the game graphics so you know that they make the game ... correct. Whatever ... <br /> <br /> However, the only thing that makes this whole experience fun from a distance Is the fact that everyone in the theater enjoys this movie, so my laughter and general unbelief are used as normal and didn't cause me to be fired. <br /> <br / > Up. Don't watch this movie! Don't let the rental when it comes out in the video in two weeks. Run. Just run.
