I know I am a minority, but ... <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll is a talented person as well as a frog, not a toad, just a frog. About a hundred other people who are upset, then useless after one more time. <br /> <br /> Is this movie? As a shit-fest, Slater's talents were used only slightly by believing that he had other things (such as his failed relationship) in his heart. Being hit hard and doing to forget her acting lessons or having one of the worst directors in film history I voted in the third option myself, even though the other two were always possible. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll never did anything that I received, even the smallest happiness. Frankly, I am satisfied that he has a foul odor. I am concerned with Bloodrayne that competes with "Underworld: Evolution" to sell tickets. Now I'm sure Len Wiseman has nothing and I mean nothing to worry. <br /> <br /> This score is 1.0 / 10 points for this boring mess from ... <br /> <br /> demon:
