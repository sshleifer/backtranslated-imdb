Brad Sicks is responsible for at least two of the most boring and boring stories I've ever seen. This movie is one of those, and the blood camp is another story. <br /> <br /> Acting That is terrible, the print job is not good and everything about this movie screams that "Seriously, you can make yourself better." Perhaps this will be a challenge for everyone to make youtube moisturize with shit associated with our zombies. <br /> <br /> I bought it for 1 pound but Remember that you can't put the price in 71 minutes. You should avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement.
