This movie is terrible, you almost feel contaminated. In fact, there was relief when it passed. You can now put the tape back into the rewinder and RUSH. Go back to the video rental shop before it contaminates the rest of the video collection I suggest a joke when we rent it. It looks like the movie that William Hurt will "phone in" his performance. I mean he won't try hard. But actually in many scenes in this movie, Bill Hurt is really on the phone! Recognizing our irony is the only thing that makes us confused. The movie and the editing are dark and confusing. This is chaotic and the sound is barely heard. There are a few similarities to "Falling Down", but the film has a story that disturbs writing and great performances and an interesting soundtrack. "Contaminated people" are just some of the old European tourist traps that have deteriorated and watching it is like driving along unfamiliar streets in an unknown country where you don't speak this language. Fogging up Did you get the picture? Don't accept this one.
