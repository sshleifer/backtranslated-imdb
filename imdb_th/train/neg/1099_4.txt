I was shocked by the unbelievable Tigerland. It's a liberal fantasy that the army should be. The conversation was difficult to swallow with the stupidity of Colin Farrell's character that allowed him to escape from his high-ranking officials. <br /> <br /> I always thought that Should set conditions for the soldiers to fight and turn them into a single unit that has no space for an insolent attitude and a man who does not follow orders his friend I do not want to fight alongside someone like him in the war because he is more concerned with people's feelings than doing what is necessary to protect his unit. <br /> <br /> - <br /> <br / >
