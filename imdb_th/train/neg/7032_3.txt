When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) began looking for the death of his brother, she began to wonder if there was anything more scary. "Natural causes" The more you approach the truth, the more threatening your brother-in-law, Fiona (Helga Line) and the remaining local Satan. They will do everything necessary to stop her. <br /> <br /> If you are lazy, the movie in Satan's Black Candles theme has many things to choose from. This film is full of nudity with a lot of content and softcore in rituals. Especially one scene involving young women and goats must believe Unfortunately, every heartless person in the world cannot help the Black Candle. Most movies are all boring. Aside from the only scene I have mentioned, various sex scenes are not shocking and not sexy. The show was utterly lacking. Even HelgaLine's favorite genre also gave disappointing performance. The story is not important. Its main function seems to keep the line of boring sex scenes together. I am familiar with other films directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared to his Daughters of Darkness, which combines intelligence and horror intelligently, Black Candles comes out fluently. can be done
