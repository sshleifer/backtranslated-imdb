Considering that the film has a very successful and successful launch, I expect to have something worth the ambiguity ... from the opening scene. (Which two siblings "sensual" embracing each other, lying naked in the bed). Some minor exceptions But the invention is the best.) The incest between brothers and lesbians is an interesting topic. But the analysis does not have both in depth (Think of the possible excuse of the creator by saying that they aim at a delicate movie that is a joke) too many curious viewers will not receive any interesting scenes At this point, which may save some movies ... so you can imagine how bad it is. Many things can be said ... but please watch the movie yourself ... I am a selfish person and I want the most people to waste about 1 1/2 hours of life ... as if I do :(
