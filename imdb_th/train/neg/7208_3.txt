I grew up watching cartoons. Inspector Gadget as a child. It's like Get Smart. For kids, ignorant people can't solve any problems and all work done by dogs that are talking about Brain and Penny. His granddaughter. I heard that live action movies are fairly good, so I went to see the library. I rented this movie for free and felt that I should be paid to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Broadric came close to being able to perform Don Adams as The sound of the device His voice was completely wrong. The girl playing Penny looks nothing like a penny cartoon. She is a dark brown hair in the cartoon version of blond hair and pigtails. But she worked well on what she had to work with. Dabney Coleman gave a good performance as Cheif Quimby Saldy. He never hid in a strange place or had to blast a message that he had accidentally thrown by the gadget. > <br /> Wrong mobile device It was never mentioned in the series and it worked well. Why do they do this? <br /> <br /> Gadgets are too smart in this movie. In the show, he is a complete idiot. Here he has half the good intelligence. It will work better if he is a mentally retarded person. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are also poems that have been slain completely. Borderick says "Wowser" is and should always be "Wowsers". I was upset when they previewed and they didn't have the correct phrase. <br /> <br /> The only good joke is in the credit. The shortage of Claw is in front of a support group for resurrection. The seats in the audience are Mr. T Richard Kale, the fame of the movie Jaws of Bond, Herve Villacheze looks like Oddjob, Kato and others. This is the only part that I laugh. <br /> <br / > The other part is the end where Penny is checking here. The gadget watch and tells the brain to say something. Don Adams voiced the dog saying "The brain is not at this time. Please leave your name in the voice of Woof Woof." Of course, this is not a funny laugh but a nostalgia to hear Adams in the movie. He should utter a stupid car at least. <br /> <br /> Children will like this. Anyone who is 13 will not like it. <br /> <br />
