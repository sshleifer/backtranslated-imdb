Usually I like to like gonzo movies that have a low budget, but Darkman III is so disgusting that I don't feel anything besides this insult. <br /> <br /> It looks and feels like a TV show in the scene. That is scattered, smooth lights, scores and separate effects, and the photographer is the movie school 101. There is no plot to talk about, the characters are one dimension and the actors are walking Most actors seem to be supposed to be making softcore porn movies ..... In fact, the only reward I received from this mess is the shocking sight of Roxanne. Without having to makeup her head Klingon Her skin tone is twice as light in the world. Whether she was fired from this role or darkened for the Voyager, weird both ways.
