I think this is almost all I have to say. I feel the need to explain my actions. I have never seen the production of weapons like that before, and I mean that in every aspect of the word Although the work of the camera, the work of the MIC boom and other technical aspects of this movie is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Unlike some independent films that have been recorded by scripts Unfortunately, there are horrible scripts, terrifying performances and the worst of horrible annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It's a crime for all independent films that have been distributed, such as Haiku tunnel Who died silent I don't know who the Kornbluth brothers are known to Sony, but that may be my only explanation of how this amateur family production is distributed. I am quite confused as to why they chose it. <br /> <br /> Part of this movie that is interesting is its name. However, the reason is even lower. I hope this review will help a few people who might get the attention of this movie. I've seen many movies in my time and I forgive when in the cinema. But it's too much I will never forget the 'tunnel' for marking an important point in my cinema's life experience. Shame it for a low point. <br /> <br />
