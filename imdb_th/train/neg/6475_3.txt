Although I haven't checked this movie about two years ago After loving the original Little Mermaid and falling in love with a mermaid like a child, I decided to take a look at the sequel. <br /> <br /> Disney, I have a little message for you. If you have no original director and performer that is useful ... you just look to make you hurt. <br /> <br /> In the sequel, our story begins with Ariel and her daughter. My first big was Eric and the rest of the crew sang. Yes, I understand that Disney has a lot of singing and dancing. But actually that's what made Eric my favorite prince He is a calm person and is a true gentleman who knows how to be fun. And he couldn't. Singing <br /> <br /> and having a villain. Oh, how can we forget the shivers that destroyed our spine? When Ursula collapsed on the screen, both Ariel and the audience How terrifying the world? Unfortunately, the gene was not sent to Morgana, her useless sister. No one ever spoke about Morgana in the first film. She emerged from nowhere, trying to steal her children. Oh, really cute. The sister was ticked out and instead of following the trident, decided to kidnap a one-month-old boy, gag me. <br /> <br /> In addition to being a flat character with no initiative in her, Morgana still looks unconventional. Much The same plan as her sister, the same minion (who, according to the way, didn't make anyone scared, I had three years on my lap when I watched this movie and she laughed like crazy). She had no purpose there; I want to see my mother as a bad person. I'm sure she will work better than Little Miss Tish. <br /> <br /> King Triton doesn't respect what he received from me in the first movie and didn't get me. Started at Scuttle, Sebastian and the Flounder. Triton is a brutal father. But love in the first film and in the second, it almost seems like he has lost his intention to put fear into the heart of his volunteers. Scuttle, when the comic relief makes everyone laugh too His 'dingle-hopper' (yes, I will accept it; I called my fork to jump and jump again and again) In this movie, Scuttle forgot all the supporting characters, even at first, at least adding something to the movie. He is rich with flavors that others do not have, and in all sequels But completely removing it from him Sebastian remained the same. But more than twice as worried Disney doesn't do that. Don't even mess with our favorite crabs. Or our favorite fish, which became a father and had a lot of annoying children He is fat and supple and looks like he is walking a few seconds. <br /> <br /> The walrus and the penguins are not necessary and after a while, you start to resent everyone. <br /> <br /> And one day, Disney, I'm leaving my life. <br /> <br /> If I don't love your manuscript
