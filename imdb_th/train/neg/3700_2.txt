Because that's the only way you won't think that this movie is a waste of time and money. The remake of "Heaven Can Wait" (which at least looks good) is a good excuse for romantic comedy. It is a vehicle rather than a rock, sometimes on film for a weak comedy that plays poorly on a large screen. Especially because his jokes in general should come from the body of an old, fat person who dies But showed that from the rock While he insulted black people and white skin, chemistry was wrong. This movie is not a joke. But the shooting is not good enough to rent "Heaven Can Wait" and live rock videos and you will bring the game page.
