Yes, the characters of Madsen - while talking to women from television stations - correct: LAPD IS policemen who are violent and racist And this movie has nothing to change at all Okay, this is a good police, a polite policeman, even a black person who is a Christian martyr. But this is a fairy tale, accept it The truth is not like that. And most important for fans. Action: Shooting is boring. It's just shooting and shooting and shooting. Nothing more. Play Counter Strike. Then, at least you will have something to do. The only virtue of this movie is: LAPD. Right now, no police anymore. If you like ads that are not polite and sensitive for police and military service, watch this movie. It's the longest ad I've ever seen (2 points for cameras and editing).
