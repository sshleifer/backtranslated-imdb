Isn't it right now? Considering all the good works done by danzel, Clive and Jodie, the movie never grew into anything more than just mimicking a dead movie / stealing. Yes, a few jokes, no things that could not be predicted There are only unpredictable moments because both directors and editors make stupid mistakes. It's a shame for them. If someone can tell me why they dig a hole in a safe place in Hell, Rebi and how do they know that the diamond is in one cell, it can make my day But it seems Spike asks us to do too many things on this subject and don't raise our eyebrows when something is stupid ... just another movie studio contract. Relax and enjoy ...
