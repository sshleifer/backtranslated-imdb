An interesting concept about alternative dimensions within the hospital. It recounts - Stephen King "Langoliers", "King Hospital" and Arya dusk. Strong atmosphere. The setting is excellent. There is also a very intelligent 'cycle time' that is always attractive. This story has a lot of vague references that convinced me that the oddities of the time - the time slip / ghost / strange bat with demon wings and the rather stupid heavy metal that will be ghouled - will explain and that Dark Floors severely disappointed me. From the fact that I watched this film, it didn't give any explanation about what was behind the event. While some ambiguity is often expected / welcomed in this type of movie Dark ground leads to new heights of ambiguity. I didn't expect things to be wrapped in a beautiful ribbon. But I shouldn't let the feeling "Hmm .. or not? ... Did I go out? Maybe I accidentally hit the cross chapter? "Dark Floors made me wonder, very dissatisfied that "It's all a dream," which is a shame, because until the last reel I boarded the ship was very much and enjoyed the movie.
