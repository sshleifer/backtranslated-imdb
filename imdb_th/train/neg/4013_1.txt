After watching some great things of HBO - Band of Brothers, Rome and others - I must say that I have very high expectations before watching the first episode of "True Blood" Jeez. Often the script seems to be written. Up by the age of 8, some parts were horribly filmed (the scene where she "recorded" Bill, I meant to come. She threw chains at men and oh! Around his neck and it made him wonderfully choked! That is embarrassing if you want my opinion, or a moment before the incident, when she finds that the couple is gone with a ridiculous bill. She hears them planning things and likes 5 seconds later. The three disappeared and without any fight or noise or anything. <br /> <br /> I mean, the idea of ​​the show seems to be interesting, mysterious, interesting. Vampires are living with humans. In our modern society ... but actually, I don't think they want to do this more than performing a little soap that young teenagers generally see all the time. But nobody cares ... badly written, moderately good, it's super shallow and hard to guess. Often I think this is a joke or Some things <br /> <br /> Actors give a really unbelievable performance if you want my opinion. It seems that they are performing very gently as if they were some low-cost family television programs. (Perhaps it is what if you bring your family) The only actor who seems to be quite good for me is Stephen Boyer in the role of Bill, based on bad writing. The short answer is very short. He must say, "What are you ..." "I'll call you once ..." I think he's doing well in the mysterious part of the vampire, which everyone who has a vampire role must have. In fact, Anna Paquin is As well, but not too much, but the person who plays with her brother jeez. He's scary. The scene he was captured is just a shame on modern television. The show is not good, the construction site looks like a fake with bones and two others. "Why was he arrested? Uh .. I don't know ... "That was really embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The other thing that I think is totally missed is the way they present Sookie's psychic powers. People think and speak both at the same time and that is wrong. Often it seems to be unnecessarily disoriented as if people thought that it was an annoying radio station and when she came close, she found the right frequency and had to hear everything they thought. <br /> <br /> And finally, the sex scene is not necessarily clear, and the vampire sex tape is completely disgusting. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me wrong - I write all these comments, not because of me. Remove the list that was terrible. But because I'm very disappointed I expect quality I don't think it's like that. It is definitely not a good performance. Best medium
