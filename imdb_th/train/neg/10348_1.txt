I am very excited to see them make movies from my favorite books forever. I don't know it's Disney until it's too late. I was shocked by ignoring the important parts of the story. As if the filmmakers from the 4th book report about this novel Meg did well in school and both she and her father didn't wear glasses. Murray (Meg's mother) didn't show much to scientists. They left the laboratory in her kitchen and replaced with the internet. And that is just the beginning In the half way of the movie, I found myself shouting at the screen, causing other people who watched movies that didn't read the book. I hope I will have more thumbs so I can lift my finger for four inches for this one. The only thing I can say is that for people who haven't read this movie, it's ok.
