I just made it through one episode ("Crouch End"). The dialog is boasting and flattering. Right - worthy. The performance is tragic. Eion Bailey, even trying his best to perform the drama His eyebrows indicate the treatment of Botox. Recently, Claire Forla Nina will be able to play as a young woman easily with distress in silent movies. Each character is a cartoon, playing their cogs in a random plot, mostly crooked plot. Magic effects can be excluded from the TV drama budget. But attempts to create suspicion and surprise through distracting movies I get the feeling that the ending should be witty and surprising. But it is lame and not related to the rest of the story If I had to compare the overall quality with other things, I would put this episode of "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" with NBC's Hercules.
