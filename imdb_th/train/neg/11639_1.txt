Spoiler: I am always amazed by the number of people who give good reviews. In this game, it's scary. Scripts and sounds that break down Gabriel and Grace are the most prominent characters in the game You almost pray for death. And the worst is that there are fewer vampires in this game with werewolves in The Beast Inside. <br /> <br /> The lack of true vampires is incredibly disappointing. If you expect the vampire-style story, Anne Rice will forget it. The story of this game is very little related to vampires. You will not see until the end, and then you will not fight with it. <br /> <br /> The story has a foundation and an insulting view of Christianity. I was amazed at it from the drawing board. I am not a Christian and I think it's disgusting. Most of the stories focus on finding the Holy Grail and buried treasure. The kidnapping of the royal family, which should be the focus, was pushed out. There is no sense of urgency that Gabriel will find children. In fact, he almost never asked anyone about the ball after the first few moments. <br /> <br /> The graphics are terrible. The characters move slowly, even in the best system. They are obese and outdated. And it is difficult to get from the Beast FMV in the awesome game engine for Blood of the Sacred. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Gabriel and Grace has changed dramatically. Also afraid I don't really know why it's so horrible. But they sleep together And it's not fun Gabriel spent most of the game telling his best friend Mosely that he thought Grace was more than a sister and he didn't think she was good for him. And it seems that he really earns money that they sleep together But he's not like anyone else throughout the game, which you almost don't care at that time. His conversation was the worst in the game. And he always makes stupid sexual nonsense At the end of the game, Grace leaves him with what appears to be a love letter to John. I guess she is bored with him, like most players. <br /> <br /> I found the story to be annoying and boring. I expect to play the story of a kid who was kidnapped by a vampire. And I expect to see and fight with the vampires, perhaps even Gabriel or Grace will become one, but none. But the story focuses on the vision of the author of the distortion of Christianity. It's a shame. Here they have elements for great adventures and we have this instead. <br /> <br /> For me, the only interesting part of the game is in the end. At the end, we will receive an action style puzzle. But it is not worth it to suffer throughout the game. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this game. I got it back when it came out many years ago and I hate the game engine so much that I kept it for many years. I just brushed it out to see where I was missing. And now I'm very sorry that I do The character that I like is destroyed. I hope there will be a fourth game in exchange for the series. And I hope they will do it right next time It would be a shame to end the series with this sector.
