This film has many stories that follow different characters. Different stories do not feel like one complete piece that makes this movie an inconsistent and sometimes annoying story. <br /> < br /> It may sound weak and clich√©. But it's true You are a better way to watch the Crocodile Hunter series on Discovery and Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and hilarious than this movie. I'm sure both actors and teams enjoy making this movie. But this movie does not give much enjoyment to the audience For comedians, it's not funny enough, and Steve and Terry Irwin aren't good actors, even when they play themselves! Their comedy is not good enough to create both movies and their scenes, sometimes giving a long, disturbing and unnecessary and annoying feeling. <br /> <br /> This film has quite a potential. Means that Steve Irwin is a character That's a strange and interesting way to watch. So when I first heard that they were making movies about 'Crocodile Hunter', my first reaction was; Great! However, this film has suffered greatly from weak stories and discrete stories linked to characters that are not interesting and unsightly. This movie has some entertainment value, at least enough to make this movie to be viewed at least once. But still, I must definitely not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie feels like a waste of time. This movie may be viewed only once when it is received on TV in Rainy afternoon It has a good time But the story really destroyed the movie and its potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
