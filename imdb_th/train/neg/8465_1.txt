I can't believe how bad this movie is. I feel generous even claiming to be a "movie". The show is flat. The editing is terrible and the storyline leaves many important questions. The location is ok if not original: small alien groups live in the United States Trying to take possession of humanity slowly But it went down from there quickly How can they convince "man" to accept an alien as his wife? They show aliens. But never show what it is doing They have plastic surgeons that can make the skin look perfect at the industrial level. They threw teeth, monster, big aliens with false teeth. The ending is almost too painful to watch. I think I am mostly disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner will be involved in this matter. How can he speak to a big alien monster with teeth? "Run away from him, the son of b * tch." With a straight face, it fell for a long time from his Babylon 5 days. Avoid this at all costs.
