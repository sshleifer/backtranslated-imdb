Throw this crippled dog into a terrible bone ... You may look further. Kol (Ross Hagen) is a bad guy in space who escaped from being vaporized by an enthusiastic spacecraft commander (Jan-no. Vincent) Kol manages to steal a shuttle that falls on the earth. The undead robot killer is sent to bring the villain back to death or live. John Phillip Law plays a wild ranger / park that is urgent to deal with both visitors from far away. Outrageous costumes and scripts lack intelligence. Vincent took the money and ran for sure. The law shows only signs of effort, so it is almost funny. Including in the actors: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith
