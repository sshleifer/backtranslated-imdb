Witchy Hildegard Knef trapped a group of people in a lone hotel and picked them one by one in a distorted and disgusting way. I think I saw it all until one of the hapless men was crucified and then put on the head of the fire. Into the chimney at the time of the blaze! "Witch" makes me sick. It hurts my eyes. I am ready to write it as the worst movie ever made by a talented person ... until the end, I have to admit that I love the ending. It involves a boy and a toy. His tape recording is angled by Linda Blair. Looks amazing. The scene took about one minute and the movie ended. But you know that the old saying: "If you have a great ending, people will forgive you all!"
