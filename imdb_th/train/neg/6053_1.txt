Absolutely garbage I like Halloween and then Johnny falls down. This is a matter of holes. We understand it. John Pro - awesome lifers! You don't have to create a boring movie that makes hell out of my heart to 'tell' me. <br /> <br /> Spacing Feels like John doesn't work very much here. His credit looks like he's not writing this garbage. There are times when the camera will sit and wait for the actors to look dumb or say something that is dumb. I love long cuts Carpenter is too bad to know how to use He wants to sleep with Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago. Please John. Stop fooling yourself and make me bored!
