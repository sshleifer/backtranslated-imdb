Sit down to see the 14th season of the bachelor's degree ("On the Wings of Love"). I know I will be in "interesting" moments. I have watched the past seasons of the bachelor's degree earlier. Watch the episode or two and disappear three or so. I found that the bachelor's degree is always attractive and interesting, although its quality and morality are often absent. <br /> <br /> "The Wings of Love" The travel details of the 31-year-old commercial traveler from the Dallas, Texas, to find true love. True love can be found in the long-acting reality dating show. Jake meets 25 beautiful women from all over the country. He began to know them a little. But most are superficial How well do you know someone in the 5 minute conversation? Jake tries to make his true intentions known from the beginning, at least with the audience. He noted that he not only But want love or a good time But he wants a fianc√© or wife We can assume that he has made this story clear to women in the competition as well. If this is the case, it may explain the actions of women at a certain level. Women are very competitive. While they still do not know Jake, they are still there to win, no matter how much it costs. <br /> <br /> Not only will women compete The threat of back stabbing and the warning of "Beware!" Everyone shows that these women are not there as well. Jake observes that he not only looks for sexual charms but looks for "connections". However, the girls pull out all the stops to try to impress Jake with sex appeal. Did they come to the mansion in a miser suit? Whether short or short <br /> <br /> While some women seem to still maintain their manners A girl, Channy, noted that Jake was "a good person", which she might be. She continues to say that Jake can land on "The runway can be at any time." She was disappointed by other women in order to provoke her anger which shows their situation. <br /> <br /> So dating a reality show is not that bad. or In addition to the obvious problems of sexual attraction, there are many issues that make this performance harmless. Is this the correct way to find a partner in the future vying for someone's attention by showing yourself the greatest proportion? Unfortunately, that is what America has to reduce dating today: happiness and sex without obligation and a little happiness on the side. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the attachment. Pre-determined emotions with Jake, especially a few women who seem to be too tight One woman said "If I didn't get the first impression that increased it would kill me!" As mentioned earlier, they still don't know him at all, and she is talking about a specific rose, not a single rose. <br /> <br /> Michelle seems to have Some problems with the attachment to Jake Other women also noticed After Michelle's explosion at one time, Vienna confirmed that Michelle had "Mental symptoms and we are here for just one hour" Michel has the last rose of the evening on the first show? Narrowly lost? And have a lot of emotions about it Other women think it's ridiculous. Other women also cried. But because she was eliminated <br /> <br /> It started with Survivor and then it started to take off ?? Reality tv It shows our entertainment interests as a country; If we do not see the list and give a good rating, the network will not proceed. The only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of America is stuck. One thing is clear: America (in general) likes reality television and the things that follow. <br /> <br /> This makes me wonder why we like reality TV as well? It's about what attracts us. Is it because we see similarities with our lives or because we want to make sure that we are less stable and pathetic than others? No matter what it is that draws us in, we should be careful of the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our hearts. I'm not saying that every reality TV show is not good. But I'm saying we have to evaluate each one. <br /> <br /> Episode used for criticism: Season Premier and Episode 2
