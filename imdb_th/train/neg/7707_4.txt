With the name "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!" Everyone who participates in this will expect to be a) bad science fiction movies or b) funny movies that make fun of bad science fiction movies It should be both mixed together with a parody. But unfortunately it will soon fall. <br /> <br /> You shouldn't be doing this movie seriously. I know this, but you should think it's funny, right? I found a few jokes or funny situations. (Eg side-by-side phone conversations, Russian Olympic spies that eat cereal, steroids, spurs, follow Lois, etc.) "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" is determined to be a classic cult. But didn't make it Classic cult is a very different movie that only a select group of people understand. (Or a similar explanation) "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" can be enjoyed by 8-year-old children with bad humor, so there is no qualification to be a cult movie. <br /> <br /> There is an actress One good thing in all: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild She is a slim journalist. But has a cute personality, too much expression, and is a natural comedian Unfortunately she was used improperly here. <br /> <br /> "The attack of the killer tomatoes" isn't funny like saying "Amazon Women on the Moon" or "Kentucky Fried Movie" but it's not good. There are a few hilarious moments, so I suggest trying it again. Avoid being cut from the director. But it was interrupted by the filmmakers and some videos that "lost" were dubbed in the African language that was false
