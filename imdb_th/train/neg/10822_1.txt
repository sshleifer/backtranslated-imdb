Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in English and the author of this script should read I hate when the author uses Spark notes for what the novel is about. This movie can't stand to see that you have read the book. <br /> <br /> 'The Red Room', the whole book can't be played. I wonder why they want to put it in the book. ' The red room 'is a forward-looking forecast for the whole story and the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns is treated badly in this film, I'm sure she is happy to die and go out first. In this book, she is one of the most interesting characters and she is not a red head. All Christian themes are missing from her life and the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and think about this movie and read the stories that Charlotte Bronte specializes in. Tell it.
