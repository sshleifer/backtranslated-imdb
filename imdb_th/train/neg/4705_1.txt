My favorite memories of this performance and the band are when I join my friends who hate the NBB and have a huge fire and we take their music CDs and DVDs of movies and pictures The band members threw them into the fire and danced happily around the burning things while singing "Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead." With the divine government agency, this list sucked I hate it so much Get rid of crappy cars You guys really suck! You really destroyed the whole box! There is no fault or anything except you have to live. I mean, really. Who is the stupid listener with stupid lead singers who can't sing! You sound really scary and need to live like a tramp or something except Roselina. She's really cute. But still you still eat!
