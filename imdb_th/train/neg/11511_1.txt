I was lucky to see this movie in the US show. After sitting reluctantly to go through the deepest things, I was shocked to see many good reviews on IMDB. <br /> <br /> The first movie is Turkey. But it is interesting It was suitable for the seventies. What was posted in the 1969 Revolution; This film has a bad smell ....... Well, nothing really. It was so bad. <br /> <br /> Imagine a poor commercial advertisement - see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Madonna can't do it. She seems to be getting worse every year. It looks like a more complex skin. Guy Ritchie, the creator of his "reputation" in Lock Stock, cannot be directed at him. The fashion show is superficial. He doesn't disappoint. He cast his wife wisely as the star of this chaos. <br /> <br /> Please let people appreciate the good comments that this movie received from other posters below. <br /> <br /> Don't support Ritchie to sell himself by giving him money. <br /> <br />
