This was not a good start to the three women who acted like wussies. The middle school that was sitting around giggling with a never ending cigarette gin and chocolate caramel treatment for people who told the story of a man. The best - spoiler alert = - = what the Andie character fell for a young organ player who had been her student when he was 14 (she is the principal of the English language school Believe it or not) just let him destroy because of her bitch - from the 'girlfriend' hell .. and then a claptrap that cannot be detected: she forgives her 'friend' and has a child of the organ player and Three women ended when they started drinking more and smoking more. Andie's character, blah blah blah, threw chocolate caramel out of the streets in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Wa Mercy.
