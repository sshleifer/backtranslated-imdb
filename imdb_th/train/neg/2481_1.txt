I have never heard of Larry Fessenden before, but judging by his efforts in writing and directing, he should do his daily work as a professional actor. Like other people here, I don't know how to categorize this movie. It's not scary or scary, so it can't be called a horror movie. The plot is that some wafers can't be dramatized. Suspense, so it's not a thriller. But it's a bad movie that you should see if you are a fan of the Blair Witch project or not. People who like this movie use words like "ambiguity" and complex and delicate. But they are reading what is not there Like Blair's witch, people are scared because people think that they should be scared and buy into the guff. It's scary. Actually, this movie started well with the "meet" family. Seems to be liberating the modern day But after 45 minutes later (half of the movie) nothing happened, the family made a story about their holiday home, all of which were very good and beautiful. But not a little entertainment Clearly, local people will be involved at certain times, but Essendon has no clear idea of ​​how to create suspicion in the movie. Eventually, when something happened, it was not clear how he was shot. (The nurse said that his liver was just a grazing) and throughout this time, the Wendexo spirit was clearly tracking the athlete clearly. With a special grade 3 technique, this movie is called Wendigo, but without any effort to explain in a clear way. The film ends in a daze and makes you very dissatisfied. I will be bailed out for 15 minutes. On the journey. It is not.
