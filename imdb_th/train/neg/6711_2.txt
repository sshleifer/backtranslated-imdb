1993 is the year that Phillip Seymour Thomas recently won an Academy Award. Who knows that I will be a special person in the movie with him? Actually, I paid a special "My Boyfriend's Back" which was filmed in the suburb of Austin named Georgetown, TX. The original name was "Johnny Zombie" (Thank God that the producer changed his mind!) I am in the industry. Drama I hurried to watch the movie on the day it was screened in the cinema. It's a funny movie rather than a horror movie, but ... for a good laugh, you might want to try it. There is nothing similar to "Dawn of the Dead" or even "Shaun of the Dead" but the cheese is good enough. Ciao
