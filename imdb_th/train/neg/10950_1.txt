If I knew that this film was filmed in the style of Dogme 95 that was angry and stopped, I would never rent it. However, I took dramamine for seasickness and gave it a shot. I spent a lot of time forty minutes before giving up. It's boring and pretending to lure. <br /> <br /> The latest French movie I saw was "Romance" and it was quite depressing. But at least the camera was still and didn't breathe the neck of the characters all the time. I was baffled by Dogme 95's ongoing popularity abroad - it would come to America at the same time as the next major outbreak of leprosy. (Called Dogme 95 because that's the average number of actors teasing the eye with the camera) <br /> <br />
