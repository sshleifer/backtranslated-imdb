It was created in 2007 and CG is not good for movies created in 1998. In this part of the film, there are shock shots of dinosaurs that look really good, but this makes the application work. Much worse. <br /> <br /> Writing, acting, directing and everything else in this movie is terrible. This is also bad if not worse than the Raptors Island and 100 million BC ... Pure shit! Again, as with other movies, the only scary thing about this movie is that it's actually created and now broadcast on sci-fi. <br /> <br /> I still don't understand that How are they Causing people to have the acting skills that will be shown in these movies and make them behave very badly like everyone else in the movie His review ... or he is one of the people working in this movie.
