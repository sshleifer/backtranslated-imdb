If this is the intended nature of the film, it will be a work of postmodern meaning - but of course it is not <br /> <br /> without having to conclude too many plans.

But they were followed by the monster that I wanted to call "the the muddy ninja." This monster led to kill the participants one by one, except the virgin virgins. (If you do not count oral sex) that has received his lineage and therefore becomes very fascinated by the desire that she masturbates with someone's hands. <br /> <br /> Finally she pulls out courage. Then there was a scene that seemed to indicate that she was pregnant with a muddy baby ninja. Is there all that? If you are going to rent this movie, it's best if you don't speak Japanese and don't have any subtitles in the season with boring Hollywood flicks. Putting this into your VCR may be equivalent. With shock therapy It will definitely be something different.
