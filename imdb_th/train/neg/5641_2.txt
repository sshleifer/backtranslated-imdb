Predicting a thousand stories with the usual drama in between two obscene sex scenes, beautiful, mixed with some characters, paranoia, horror music, violin style, the 70s funny when I can't help laughing with myself. I tend to like Defoe and have to say that acting is not bad at all. "The plot" develops according to a reasonable rhythm and makes you guess at any time. It's all predictable. I feel like watching a drama created from a television drama instead of a new movie. Maybe that's the style that the director wants. But have to say that the review I read here before I saw this movie was only written by someone related to production. <br /> <br /> Don't expect too much, and if I can turn the clock back I will Didn't go to see it at the cinema I'll wait for the trash to bargain at your video store. I'm sure it doesn't take long.
