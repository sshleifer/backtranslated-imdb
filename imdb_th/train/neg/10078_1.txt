The love story of a boy and a woman due to the song, only this time she is a punk and he is a straight arrow. Movie lovers really like this movie or have a girlfriend? I must say that the mind wheel ... "Grease 2" is a truly weak organization that doesn't even have the courageous moxy or gall galler to use the memories of the ancestors in the flames (such as "Jaws 2" or " Exorcise II ") No, it emits a slow motion and often plays dead. It looks and feels right with the big characters disappearing in the chaotic direction and the manipulation that doesn't focus. This is the first time a lot of viewers have seen Michelle Pfeiffer's glitter and even if she doesn't make herself embarrassed. But it is a forgotten role The lowest level of misunderstanding, no stars from ****
