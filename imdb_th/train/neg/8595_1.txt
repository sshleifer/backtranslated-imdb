Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are both great actors who can challenge the show. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' offers only one for both actors. And the audience: in order not to fall asleep during boring, unpredictable and unimaginable tales, <br /> <br /> 'Watching a detective (2007)' trying hard to be funny But is a joke that is forced Embarrassing for complete ridicule <br /> <br /> After one third of this film, there is nothing that will appeal to even the most willing audience, such as director, friend and relative, even talking about it. Actually, <br /> I'm pretty sure everyone who likes it, pretends to be pretending to be like Neil's ex-girlfriend, when he shows off old B&W movies that she doesn't care about less. For B. (2007) 'No category B where the Q & As and -Questions - Answer the question! The director knows what he is doing! If his goal is to bore the audience to death, he can do a lot of work. <br /> <br /> 'Watching the detective (2007)' is a complete waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Murphy Cillian, please don't let your time be wasted. <br /> <br /> Score: 0 out of 100
