Not very impressed It's hard to offer any spoilers for this movie because there is almost no development in the story. Everything is clear in the first ten minutes and from there it is like watching dry colors. The show also looks terrible, and reminds me of the old-fashioned Mao Mau film, white and white, which is occasionally shown on Chinese television during the daytime. Although this story is difficult to tell about Yuwen's female role, since her story seems to have to walk around like a wooden model. It reminds me of Zhang Dao Kongli, who has earned a reputation as a good actress in the Western world because of her face on her face all the time. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuangzhuang's movie 'Blue Kite' Is a much better movie But do not be fascinated by the fact that the spring in a small town was set up in the late 40s, unlike the Blue Kite. The fact that this movie is set in a time of chaos is not related to the plot. The ruins of the city seem to be nothing more than a beautiful backdrop. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Tian Zhuangzhuang is trying to create popularity for western Chinese movies and attracts. Watch foreign clients who can not tell the difference between movies that are beautiful or profound hypnosis and the movie is boring and ridiculous /> <br /> If any film <br matching the description. I do not see the reason here to stop worrying about the status of the Chinese film industry.
