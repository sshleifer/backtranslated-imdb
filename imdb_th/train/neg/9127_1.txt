OK, so this is the basic plot of 1933. Peter Zeller is Dr. Fu Manchu, a 168 year old Chinese man who has lived for a long time This film opens with his birthday, which he celebrated with a special amrit drink that (Even the film never mentioned) prolongs his life On this occasion, Amarit water was abandoned by the assistant. (Like Kage, if you remember the movie Pink Panther) and he ordered his minions to find 6 things to create an elixir This created a world-class hunt, in which his followers ended up plundering the diamond museum and adventurous in London to meet Dr. Foo Detective Scott Yardland, a Scottish actor who tried to stop. he To be a comical adventure, <br /> <br /> This is a long story documentary about the seller that he did before he died. The terrible tragedy is that he is there. The seller who is a talented comedian and has a memorable 'comedy' role in the Panther movie and especially in the movie 'The Party' is nothing but in this movie. This movie is a torture story that needs to be watched and I can't do it. He died completely and I continued to cringe while watching the seller's work. After the great work of 'Being There' in previous years, I mean how he can do this. Just like one person mentioned 10..15 The first minute is ok. But it all fell ... <br /> <br /> Avoid like a plague. <br /> <br /> Score 1 out of 10.
