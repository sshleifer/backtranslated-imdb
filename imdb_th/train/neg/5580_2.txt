I like many actors / actors involved in this project, so insulting by movies makes it worse. If they use foreign matter, the main problem is that this movie is clearly just a concept created to attract baby boomers. In the 20 or 30 years, Nbc may be doing this kind of movie in the early 90s. I can see now that the black family that children are involved with, La riot and family There are white rebellious children and listen to rock music. The soundtrack grunge will have bands such as Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden etc. As this will be wonderful like The 60's and I guarantee you NBC will do it. Look at the problem. The biggest part with the time when buying a network is when you are in a period of time. You don't think that I live in the 60s or whatever. Retro, trendy, next time, people do things like This they Will put more weight on the project.
