I saw this movie when it was first released. His memories were terrible that he had been with me for almost forty years. I do not want to believe in my own feelings about the movie when I see it, so I consulted with the movie reviews published in the major metropolitan newspapers the following day - confidence has been confirmed. A little research reveals that the producer is the star of Leslie Karon's husband. Therefore, the nepotism of favoritism suggests starting The movie is awesome The list of movies of many talented actors such as Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grahame and James Sikking among others shows that it has some promises. But the death of this movie is the result of a horrifying "mystery" film that is vague and revealing very little in the movie that the audience wandered from one scene to another. It seems that this movie will be torn between being a mysterious detective and a spy. But never judged anyone The feeling of suspense is completely absent. The main character is based on a dry and emotionless play that is not of interest. The movie is a pedestrian. The result is an unfortunate audience losing interest in the characters, plot, and ultimately the movie itself. I was a little surprised that there is no pathetic film to buy. I hope that if TCM finds the print of this film and feels that it is forced to broadcast, it will be safely down at 4:00 am.
