Let me first say that I enjoy watching movies "not good". It's funny that some of these movies will make a lasting impression than truly great movies. This film is not good in a way that is dangerous. This vehicle for Sam Mraovich's ego is not only without a borderless ability. But still defines the meaning of a new word This should be a barometer for bad movies forever. Arranged from the Mendoza line for the movie, Mr. Mraovich writes, directs and stars as a blunt object. Arthur Sailes fights with a blasphemy wife and Christian forces of evil as he and Ben, his partner. "Die behind the eyes". Bed sheets fight for equality in marriage. As a liberal, I believe gays should be married. Ben & Arthur can do more harm than the cause of a homosexual army. The depiction of everything Christian is ugly and has a trademark Mraovich finisher that you can't take seriously. Victor's brother, Arthur, who is a fanatic of the Bible, is an evil gay man and is so gay that you have to wonder how he got this role. That's because Sam "Multitasking" Morovich is the director of the show. The worst of them is Sam Mraovich. Whenever you think that the person who brought the word faded, bald and fat, came to mind? Sam also sent a line such as Domino's Pizza to be cold and often wrong. Tally Finally: Khun Suck, who wrote, directed and screened the cast, is the Crown Ed Quadruple.
