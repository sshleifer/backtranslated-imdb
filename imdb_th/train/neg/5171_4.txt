Just a horror movie, okay about a good suburban family related to the death of parents and "things" in the basement, where they wait to feed the people they choose from the street. Of course there are more. But I must say that I will tell you more. <br /> <br /> For me, this just doesn't come together because it tries to make it in two ways, both as a family, drama and horror. To walk through the intersection between the two lines But seems to stumble across the place because it is very shocking, something that it has never been true It doesn't help that the final revelation is less scary than "Oh" like "Oh, right?" Maybe if I haven't watched many horror movies recently, it might be better than this or maybe It looks like I won't compare it. <br /> <br /> I'll take it.
