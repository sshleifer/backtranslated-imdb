This movie is very disappointing. <br /> <br /> I overlooked the critic's point of view. This is not the case of content that does not depend on the level of the actor. The actors here (Bette Davis and James Cagney) do not depend on the level of content. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are as large as Davis and Cagney and see what happens. One Night becomes a classic forever. With a very similar story, Davis proves that she doesn't have the ability to perform comedy. (The good thing for her is that this is the only joke she has ever tried!) Davis is known for acting. It happened one night. Cagney, who is a great comedian, seems to be inconsistent with his costs. The script has good connections and jokes. But the performance is more suitable for the drama than the joke. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the soundtrack, which, like Davis's submission and Cagney, seems to be more appropriate. The drama is lighter than a joke. <br /> <br /> Jack Carson, who has a similar role throughout his career, has managed more similar content. In the supporting role, in general, Eugene Palette provides a respectable performance. In a slightly different role as the old west memorial, Harry Davenport is very good, but in one of his worst performances, William Froley is quite annoying. The constant reference of his character about the police wearing a ridiculous effort. <br /> <br /> I really love all the actors and it's a shame that, as a musician, they don't suffer. Chemical success anymore and no better results than The Bride Came COD
