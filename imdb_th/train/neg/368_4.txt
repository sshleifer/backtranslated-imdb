This movie is really ridiculous! I saw it from the age of 11 and even then I thought it was ridiculous! I will recommend this movie to children under 12 years old. I don't care about it. But I think it answers very good questions that children need to be aware of, such as 1) money, buy happiness? 2) Should I lie (with parents) about what I think they will disagree with? 3) Does the money buy friendship? 4) Is money everything? 5) I shouldn't tell my parents when someone tries to hurt me. True, this is an unrealistic situation. But I think if parents talk about these problems with their children, maybe they should watch this video as well to show / scare children
