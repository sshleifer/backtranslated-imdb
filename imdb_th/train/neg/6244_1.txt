Mario Lewis of the Competition Institute has written 120 credible proofs on the point-to-line intersection of the film, which should be named A CONVENIENT LIE. The website address of his debunking report, named "The deceptive approach to truth that is not consistent" can be found at: www.cei.org. A short version of more than 10 pages can be found at: www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf. When you read those demolitions, you will know that The alleged "global warming" is not terrifying or dangerous than Y2K in 1999, which Gore also endorsed as he made a pseudo-scientific film THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, based on a book written by UA. Whitley Strieber, while James "The Amazing" Randi was made for psychic power and Philip Klass made for UFOs and Gerald Posner did with JFK's JFK conspiracy theory. Same as Mario bad Made a film of Al Gore.
