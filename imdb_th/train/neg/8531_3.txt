In this unforgettable forgotten story, Norma Shearer 40-ish plays as a social teenager in Monte Carlo. Stuck in a scramble between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It will be a temptation to blame for the failure of the film. This is about a boring chapter, talk, or director George Kucor, who seems never interested in making the film more lively. Although most of Shearer's own fault is that he wants to continue to play the "boy" role as long as she can escape. Without intention to make "Her cardboard lover" is a strange monument to the absurdity of the old woman.
