Usually I am a big fan of eighty and early bad movies, which now has a story ... but this movie is incredibly terrible that it is really a test of patience. Men dress up as girls until death - But never poor Corey Haim's performance was very bad as usual. Nicole Eggert was not that good. This has no qualification for redeeming awards, even if you are the # 1 fan of actors / actors in this trash bin - stay far!
