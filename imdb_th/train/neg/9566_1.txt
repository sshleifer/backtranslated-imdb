I watched a lot of movies, saw the original wargames game many years ago and liked it a lot. The computer is still "Great puzzle" for most of us and the movie is reliable in its own way. <br /> <br /> However, this computer seems to be a special low budget on Wednesday night Combining crap from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The plot is very weak. You won't believe until you see the movie. (Which I didn't recommend at first) I can't point out an actor who works really well in this movie. But hey, with that chapter, I would be surprised if anyone can do a good job. Many ancient scenes, CGI seems to be taken from the '86 version. <br /> <br /> Ah, I'm not upset. Just write this story. Don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Life is so short that it's time to see a crappy movie.
