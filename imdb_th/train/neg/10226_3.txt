"Don't watch this movie" will be a better suggestion if you like Marilyn Monroe in other roles. She is very disappointed when considering the great actor, not just Marilyn. <Br /> <br /> The story is absolutely nothing. There is nothing like that described in the VHS box. Of course, there is no doubt, a little precious excitement and too many boring points. Show why "Nellie" (Monroe) is confused, this is not a good role for Monroe, although I do not want to see this character, so that she can show. "Some people like it hot" alone is good evidence for me. But this role is not suitable for her and it is not surprising that it is not one of her most popular movies. <br /> <br /> It's terrible that this movie lost the talent of actors Richard Widmark Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others <br /> <br /> Summary: It's not fun and entertainment is the name of the game.
