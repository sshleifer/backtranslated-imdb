This is a movie that is not really interesting. The show is the third rate and the dialogue penetrates and sometimes seems to just roll and die. My reason for renting is very simple: find a movie by writing a screenplay. I need visual assistance for the presentation, so I think why not using the clip I was wrong after searching for a video store in my area, I found this, which is named "Starstruck". What? "And decided to try I am not satisfied with my results. There may be a scene that I can use and at the same time I fall asleep because of the stubbornness of the flicks. So ..... I brought this thing back and picked Ed Wood. Example Then again, what can be compared to the drift that is "Starfucker"
