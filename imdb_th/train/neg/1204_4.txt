I remember Devil Dog playing with TBS almost 20 years ago, and her sisters and friends watched it and laughed the next day. It's not that bad for a horror movie created for TV. But it is a derivative (most of the Exorcist) and active because of lack of a better word It will not shock you with filming or a great performance. But don't waste time It's a type of movie that you watch to kill a couple of hours when you're not in the mood to think too hard. <br /> <br /> However, if you go to see a movie looking for a laugh, you will get 'not disappointed. The first scene with the Lucky the Devil dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the cursed eyes laughing diligently and the brilliant blue screen effect of a giant black dog. And keep an eye on the Satanist who wears a shirt in Maverick shades to the beginning. <br /> <br /> Not a terrifying horror movie from a wide imagination But I hope they will continue to do this for TV.
