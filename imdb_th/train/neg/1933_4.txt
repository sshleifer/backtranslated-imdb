Final score (average of various classic movie features - visualization, creativity, rewards, fun humor, etc.): <br /> <br /> 4.3 (Full 10) <br /> <br /> Yes Atlantis: The Lost Empire "A few years ago, it looked like a brave and serious new direction in Disney animation. However, just a year after the innovation and almost the genius "The Emperor's New Groove" and marked one step back in the release of Disney from the "Disney Formula" repetition, I was a big fan of the long animated film of Disney Must see them all love it or hate it The problem is that this model hardly has one original idea. It feels like being a remake of something more than a newly created Disney (Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame). The character is more than the idea of ​​walking the suspect who often replaces this type of movie. (Strange, gung ho general, brave woman) Apart from Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner), the supporting actors are disgusting. The film also suffered from a succinct rhythm. Instead of allowing it to become an epic story of many Disney jams in a short period of time that often flick the opportunity to develop ... every character's suspicion really is. They made us enter a new world and surprisingly and barely let us get our exclusion. Sometimes slow progress causes confusion about what the story is quite easy. The animation is dark and boring and cheap. This seems to be a Saturday morning cartoon. Hopefully they will not forget that the original 2D animation is still a miracle. "The Iron Giant" among others proved that <br /> <br /> negative: pictures, rhythm and lack. Creativity <br /> <br /> Positive effect: quite the coolest death scene for Disney. Villain for a long time It is a creative highlight of the movie.
