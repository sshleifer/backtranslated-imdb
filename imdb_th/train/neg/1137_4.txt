I tried twice to pass the film successfully for the first time - and it's like tooth extraction - and doing the second failed even with a wonderful DVD transfer problem? It's too boring. <br /> <br /> If you can go to the scene in the amazing courtroom that spends most of the second half of the movie, you've already created it. There was an interesting discussion by "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) during the trial. The ending is touching as Lincoln walks away and they put his Memoral statue on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a good story, good behavior, and so ... but It didn't spark in the first half. The audience from hanging there, I wonder if the real Abe Lincoln is more interesting than this movie.
