I will not consider myself one of the big fans of Leonard Cohen. However, he acts as an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. The most valuable element in this documentary is the hearing of Leonona's echo About his life and career The warmth and humility <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most musicians in the concert do not talk about Leonard's differences in music / literature. Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker & Beth Orton As an exception, though, Leonard focused on the interpretation of Rufus Wainrights in his songs. <br /> <br /> The special failure in this film is the ability of filmmakers to let viewers see. Who is Leonard Cohen and how these musicians connect with him? There are many talks in this respect. But the audience was not attracted to the person Leonard Cohen. This failure was especially evident with the interview with Bono and Edge. They viewed Leonard as a special icon. But could not translate the true value of Leonard Cohen. Cooperation with U2 is a joke All live registration seems to be a hurry. And in the entire film, only Leonard Cohen remains his part and can tell about his own part. <br /> <br /> All the montage and screenplay are like projects outside of high school. The use of effects such as echo, slow motion or flash images cannot be done. Some of the dismal camera work Part of the score is hardly able to restore any relationships I expected. Sometimes it seems that filmmakers have added psychotic elements to movies. May refer to his use of LSD once. <br /> <br /> Some humor that is not intended ... At one point, Leonard said that he had an influence on the music. Initially, he couldn't remember the name of the genre until he finally said that it was a punk. The next scene in this film is the live cover of 'I can't forget' ... <br /> <br /> "And I can't forget. I can't forget. I can't forget, but I can't remember who I am.
