Interesting changes from the first There is more mystery in this film at first. Although it ended by asking yourself what happened to the murderer. There are some good parts in the first half of the movie, which is slow and in the second half of the year the rhythm will improve. All movies are fun. The story is 22 years after the incident in the first film. Norman Bates left the hospital and returned to Bates Hotel. But when a woman shows up claiming to be his true mother, things start to go wrong. Perkins plays the old age Norman again and the final scene is excellent.
