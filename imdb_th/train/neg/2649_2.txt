My wife and I started to watch this movie with anticipation. It looks warm and impressive. It started well. But soon became boring and straightforward idiot after a while It was terrible that we closed it. The movie did not perform well and was honest. We couldn't understand or wanted to understand why they were fighting this woman! You lose her sympathy after she is rude and shows singing and cleaning wackos. I will let you do it. And of course, like most movies and T.V series produced in Hollywood, we have to throw it as a "gay" character! This movie is boring. I expect more from Diane Keaton!
