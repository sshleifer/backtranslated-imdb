If there is a hell, there will be a film screening room in Grand Canyon, played over and over again in the eternal circle. Everyone hopes that the presence of many great actors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - will help offset the presence of Mary McDonnell. But none. Obviously they injected other actors with a serum made from McDonnell. (If you are deaf or know who it is, prepare your blood to boil in the ridiculous TDD scene.) The Grand Canyon is full of nasty people and involves himself. But never give the reason we like / understand / sympathize or even tolerate them With rare exceptions, they are losers that cannot be separated. No plot to talk about, no character development. (These people will not develop at all.) There is no effective resting and the most curved drawing you have ever encountered in a movie. The best thing about the Grand Canyon? Its name is the big hole of the movie.
