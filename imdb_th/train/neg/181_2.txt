Ah, Mexican Channel 5 every day at 2:00 am. They broadcast horror movies from 70 to early 2000. It is "Return To The Cabin By The Lake". I am sorry to see it. <br /> <br /> The original "Cabin By The Lake" is a popular low budget and is well accepted. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not funny, unintentionally and trying to imitate the original. Ugh. The story is really stupid in every aspect. <br /> <br /> Movies at some point seem like drama-drama because it's a story. Movies and Directions <br /> <br /> My advice is: Avoid this problem at all costs. It is a movie that should not be seen. Not even for ordinary movie filmmakers. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
