This movie gives something new or worthwhile. After seeing it, my wife and I both agreed that the studio would be upset about this and may receive less care if it's fun. This is a good example of the movie. "Concepts Only" - They have ideas about movies and other details that are not important because executives know that it will generate revenue for just $ $ according to the initial concept. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Cruella left prison and carried out parole. She doesn't like puppies anymore. But being programmed to love them - she can't hurt fleas Not too long after her release, and she returned to her old ways. <br /> <br /> The most annoying aspect of the movie is the character that supported Eric Idle while Waddlesworth's voice made me hate. He - and that is to consider that I am a die-hard python fan. Obviously he did this because they gave him a lot of money. (There is no other reason) Tim McInnerny, Cruella's low self-esteemed servant, was a joke in Black Adder's performance. And it must cost a few dollars to receive GÃ©rard Depardieu, but he also wasted There are other supporting actors too, but due to the way the characters write, I try to block them from my heart. <br /> <br /> Overall, you are better to give your children. Watch your television Than letting them see this miracle
