I rarely express these opinions. But I felt that I was forced to hurt others when I watched this movie. It's stupid and unbelievable in both the overall story and in the details that you can't suppress unbelief. The problem starts faster when you see government researchers drive a new Porsche and dine with his team in a restaurant that looks like a castle. See the Capitol building in Washington, DC. Live like this with state salaries or Not? Ha! It's only worse At the end, when the villain starts killing the good people, the latter makes it stupid until you want them to die to clear the jeans. The special technique is quite good - the manufacturer's money can be bought - and the leading actors in other films, but the screenplay and the direction here are beautiful. Many people wonder if there is any intelligence behind Paul Verhoeven's previous stupid movies (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but this movie should stop suspicion. He is a normal bad guy.
