I know that this movie is not amazing. But i think i will give a chance to it I'm a fan of Luke Wilson, so I think it has potential. Unfortunately, many movie dialogue boxes are fake and wonderful. I think Aquafresh gave money to film production because they left some suggestions throughout. There is a shot with the Aquafresh symbol extending from you, which you can't help but notice. Sometimes they should focus on writing and acting more than we can put Aquafresh products in movies many times without people bothering. Movies have moments But I'm glad I didn't spend $ 9.50 to see in the cinema.
