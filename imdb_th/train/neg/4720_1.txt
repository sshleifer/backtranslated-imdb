When I saw this "documentary" I was disappointed to see Serbian propaganda again. Although Serbia and nationalist politics were the main reason for the collapse of Yugoslavia But not mentioned in this "documentary", which was produced by Bogdanovich whose name tells us that he is Serbian and his film It was one of the sets of lies that were driven by Milosevic's regime. Others are wrong. Serbian is right and victimized, although most war criminals in the Hague are Serbs. Although Serbs are one of the genocide against the Bosnians and attack Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, every independent country has Accepting the UN.Breakup of Yugoslavia cannot be avoided because Serbian does not want to release their nationalist handful, putting the Federal Government of Yugoslavia. Therefore, SLovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia were forced to become independent countries to protect their interests. There is no interest in the documentary about the fall of Yugoslavia and the facts that brought this documentary. You should see "Yugoslavia: Death of the Nation", made by Discovery Channel and the BBC.
