The expectation is quite high for me when I go to watch this movie. After all, I think Steve Carell can't do anything wrong with the great movie Anchorman, The Virgin, 40 years old and Little Miss Sunshine. I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the right thing with this movie: At some point, Steve Karel is allowed to be Steve Karel. There were a few moments in the movie that made me laugh, and it was almost because he had received a wiggle room doing what he did. He is undoubtedly a talented person and is a shame that he signed with what appeared to be in my mind the whole train wreck. <br /> In this way I will talk about <br /> <br /> The film begins with Dan Burns, a widow who has three girls who are considered for the national advice column. He prepares his girls for him. Consolidate into a family where his extended cousins ​​once gathered The family does not have this behavior. As if they were transported from Pleasantville or leave Beaver. They are a caricature of what we think the family is when we 7. It's at the point where they become disgusting and just disappointing. Touch football, crossword puzzle, bowling, family and special talent show. It is almost disgusting. <br /> <br /> Another important flaw is that Carell should fall. Her observation of her first scene with Steve Carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to recuperate. What I think should be unique and original in this woman is a moron I left the theater, wondering what I saw. After thinking more, I don't think it will be much.
