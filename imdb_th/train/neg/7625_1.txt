This is your only spoiler warning. It's a sad story for our cinema when this professional garbage is considered as "A rewarding Oscar" <br /> <br /> I divided the content into three levels. The first is the stage theater. Here, the audience is still and powerful in the presentation of the actors and, most importantly, the power of the writer. A good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows different ways of vocabulary. The best dramatists know how to create images that are arid, unable to show. <br /> <br /> The second level is a movie. In this medium, weak writers can use it. But viewers do not sit in one place at all times With context films can use the features of poetry, images and meanings in addition to strong writing. In addition, movies can handle everyday elements such as sounds and colors in a way that is almost surreal. <br /> <br /> The last level is literature. In this context, everything was envisioned by the author to translate on paper and then the reader re-imagined. More details can be entered into the novel than it is possible for a movie studio. <br /> <br /> This is the reason that adaptation can go up. Rebuilding will not be better than the base film. (See ten cents per dozen at your local bookstore) While movies can't convey the same power as original books (Catch-22 and LotR), movies can be made into difficult plays and can be made into movies. /> <br /> For 'The Last Picture Show' will fail. It is a movie that should be stuck on the stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right. The characters say the same and behave the same. It's truly useless. Add to the nasty soundtrack and you have a movie that is not accessible at all. <br /> <br /> I saw this in my high school drama class with about 20 wannabe reckless teachers. The teacher appreciated how sad this movie was. The sad thing is that this stagnant way of working is depressed when the content is hilarious. If this is a scene of weakness, the pool party and the old sluggish are considered funny. See what Lucas did with 'American Graffiti'. A few years later, <br /> <br /> America's secondary education system needs to start teaching about movies rather than trying to teach with a powerful Downbeat movie. Two stories: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon rely on them, not this thing. It's the 'last' that I want to see. 1 out of 5
