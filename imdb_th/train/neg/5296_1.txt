I'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a type. But even according to the standards of low budget exploitation Even at the nude level and the wound is incredibly boring. (There are both, but all ... meh) Before the home video revolution, it might not have been officially released. (Although it might be; After all * Plan 9 from space * Play in the cinema) There is one good line. (And deliver efficiently) in all movies; I think they steal from somewhere. <br /> <br /> The performance is one of the worst things I've ever seen. I mean, even Edwood has a few talented actors and others are often laughing humming, which can be enjoyed However, most of his actors can pass literacy. Here, those who do not read their conversations like the Indians in the cigar shop listen to it. They seem to learn to pronounce. And this film has a difference: it handled underplotted badly for most movies, then ludicrously overplotted for the end The actress plays as a receptionist. Except she didn't do it with wood, not that she was good But she didn't do it with wood) <br /> <br /> Even the worst temples are always good for meticulous meditation. With this, there seems to be nothing that can cause evil about morality. <br /> <br /> And you know the most fun thing? They clearly expect to create a sequel! <br /> <br /> It's really terrible and boring. In fact, it turned out to be a strange charm. I watched many videos and wondered why anyone wouldn't want to do it.
