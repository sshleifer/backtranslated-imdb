This film begins with a number of promises. But in my view, it started to lose it when the protagonist kidnapped the Samaritans who came to help him when the car broke down. The fact that this stranger has a good meaning, began repairing his car while he was going out. The phone was not convincing enough. But she is one of the few people in the country that can help him make his family life like The author began to accidentally be warned not to use in their stories. <br /> <br /> I found this movie the best on average. The direction of the art seems to be a lot better, like movie shooting. Performing well and singing Eva van Gogh's songs.
