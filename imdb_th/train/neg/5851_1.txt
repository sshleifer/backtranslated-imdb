I wonder if jigsaws are up to date. Even at that time, all the themes of LSD are married to a murder mystery, which is a clear attempt to attract young audiences without showing any understanding of the outdated, Jigsaw suffered from various problems, including excessive acting, silly and arrogant dialogue, ongoing LSD events that did not go on. Even after the hammer was hit in the first 60 seconds, the real plot was on paper, a great vehicle to do that, and a boring and predictable ending. (Not to mention the remembrance of many bad television programs) that the climax is an important point in opposition. If it is a better movie, we may be able to suppress unbelief in certain things that will help to enjoy. But the obvious weakness is that they act only to emphasize the probability that the audience may overlook I saw jigsaw puzzles on television and it was a television fare late at night, meant to fill the airspace and pass the time to kill people with insomnia more than what anyone should find the best three out of ten.
