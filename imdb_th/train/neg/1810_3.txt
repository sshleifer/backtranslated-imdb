Think of this film as a live-action Saturday morning from all ages. Even the little ones will find that this is difficult to come to mind because it works like molasses! I do not fully understand how terrifying God is to create something normal and not particularly interesting in the costume department! Too many warrior wizard films have been used many times in old fashioned structures. But this is a very rare thing considering the attractiveness of those who love less. And who in the world would let the mermaids nude be cast in the first place? I think this is a "family" movie! MST3K This is another great gem for your 1999 TV season!
