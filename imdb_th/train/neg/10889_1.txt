The worst movie I've ever seen since Gingerale Af. Afternoon. I think this is a horror / comedy. I can predict every scene in this movie. Special effects are not special. I believe I can come up with a great impact from what I have lying around the house. I wish I had something good to say about this movie. But I was afraid that I wouldn't do it. Even Coolio should be ashamed of appearing in turkeys. I think there is one good thing to say about this movie - it's over.
