This is the biggest insult for TMNT. Fortunately, Venus officially does not exist in the canon TMNT. There will be no female tortoises. This is taken from the tragic story of 4 unique mutant humans who never had a family Be your own anymore The biggest mistake is to cross the Power Rangers to TMNT with a terrible episode. The turtle's voice is wrong and every character comes out. They should do better. Design better. <br /> <br /> Don't bother with this person ... It's a valuable content. Pak Phanang is slow and unnatural. They completely destroyed the shredders. The main baddie, dragonlord friends. Some people have repetitions. The turtles look bad with the things hanging on their bodies. What is around the rap thigh? Plastron, a silly looking sculpture! <br /> <br /> If they look normal, act as a character and get rid of Venus, get rid of the silly little cartoon character ...
