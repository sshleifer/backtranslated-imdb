Women (Sylvia Kristel) seduced a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). They had sex ... but it was tied to a plot, stupid or something like that. br>> <br /> Easily one of the most annoying sex comedies ever Does anyone know that this movie is causing child abuse? I think it's okay because it's a teenager - if we have someone with a man who lures a teenage girl Sorry for causing the boy to not excuse It's still sick I know that Brown is very old (he is actually 18), but he looks 15. I just find it disturbing that some people find this deal. <br /> <br /> The plot of the show. (Kristel is very beautiful - but can't do it. Brown is one of the worst child actors I've ever seen) and boring nudity is boring and not erotic from a distance. <br /> <br /> I saw this miracle at The cinema dates back to 1981. I am 19 years old and have my 14 year old cousin (who can pass easily for 18 years). He wants to see it - I can't but I decide what the hell? We came in and I bought tickets for three immature teenagers. My cousin thinks boring and three children from half way! Let me make it clear - three children from movies with many nude pictures of women! That should let you know how bad it is. I was surprised to have released 1 all the way.
