Wow, the scariest thing at this time is the house price 40 years ago. I will preface by saying that I'm not a fan of the episode described. If it is a story / actor / etc. should be worth salt But relying on the long distance transmitter Psychobabble is boring and boring. But some people like it. It's not my cup of O tea. They can keep the story. But at least makes it more credible and interesting if it comes from a psychiatrist or a newspaper reporter or something awkward little things, such as Peugeot, at a house with a semi-circular road But he seems to have parked his car in the tree that he stood beneath because there was no place to be seen on the road or on the land Sloppy editing as she pulled into the driveway (For what seems like the 100th time) that is 2 people you see at 24m30s. Walk to the car as she pulls into the driveway of an abandoned house? The closeup was too much, for example, some junior drama students discovered the zoom function in his camera for the first time. I can separate But that might be almost as boring as now. It is still dragging and the real purpose seems to be to use all the stock images that they shoot from Elaine driving Newport. I fully expect to see Chrysler's logo and good jingle play while the voice tells us about the 8-track music player, top auto, etc. The only good thing I have to say about He is No tie, loose ends, nothing explained or terminated. Not much to notice, I suspect that most channels change or fall asleep at the end.
