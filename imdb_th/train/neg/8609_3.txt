If you've watched Rodney Dangerfield's previous movies and performances, you'll remember many jokes created in this shipwreck. The film is written like a sitcom, failing to hit any chords that are always appreciated by doctors who help themselves, played by sexy molly, chopped liver and Molly Shannon and 'I'm fat and very funny.' The five wives are fond enough, and if this is done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it may be used. It turned out to be a fantasy man who tried hard not to be politically wrong.
