After reading the previous comments, I'm glad I'm not the only one who is confused, especially in the last 20 minutes. John Carradine appeared a second time, went down in the grave and pulled the lid off after him. I wait for some explanations about this strange behavior suspiciously ... Usually I think he has something about evil behavior at home. But because he was killed by the first additional corpse (Hereafter referred to as Zombies # 1) These scenes are not reasonable. Please, if someone knows why Carradine continues to climb down to the grave - let the rest of us stay there! <br /> <br /> All actions are restricted in 20 minutes ago, so I'll try to summarize John Carradine came to the cemetery to investigate and be controlled by Zombie # 1 until now. But then we got the scene that caused John Ireland and Jerry Sturler to confuse the filming of a small moonlight in the tomb of Carradine's discovery. Strickler tried to push Ireland into the grave. The corpse opened from where Zombie # 1 emerged, but Ireland succeeded in turning him into an open grave and PRESTO! Strickler came out as Zombie # 2! Yes, I think we can deduce that Strickler has died forever (witch?) This zombie is moving very slowly. I think he would like to be in his "normal" form until his business is concluded.) This scene brings questions to you. The IS Zombie # 1 ??? We can assume that Zombie # 1 is one of the murder victims shown during the film's debut. But who knows who is who and why he is not satisfied with the movie team <br /> <br /> After that Ireland saw this change and ran away. We will see the same picture of Zombie # 2 that is shining through the trees as we saw for Zombie # 1 (This leads to a momentous confusion with the real zombies. ) Then in the best horror films of the 1950s that Ireland could travel while fleeing He knocks his head comfortably on the small stone face of Faith Domergue's dead cat (that's not John Carradine's good to dig a grave for a cat he almost doesn't know). <br /> <br /> At the same time, Zombie # 1 is a disaster at home. He easily dispersed three members of the movie, then went up the stairs. Faith Domergue heard him and thought it was John Ireland's lover back from his shooting night. When seeing that it is Zombie # 1, she screams and retreats back into the bedroom where she picks up Ireland's revolver. While actor Carroll Wells is taking a shower at this point and doesn't hear the screaming of Charles Macao Lay, who is her co-star. (The person who drank and drank alcohol in his bedroom) made his sweet time. (And after being flaunted from the hip flask) he finally decided to investigate (One thing that impressed the audience in the last quarter of this movie is the way the stars respond to screams and projectiles.) Domergue returns to the hall with weapons ready. But Macauley's mistake for # 1 Zombie and shoot him six times! He performed a good stunt on the railing. Then came back to the terrifying Domergue back in the arms of the zombies. # 1 <br /> <br /> Carole Wells is leaving her shower and dry when She heard Gunshot and Domergue's screams. She didn't feel great in rushing out to investigate. So during this time, Zombie # 1 had time to pull Domergue from the neck with a rope. Wells saw Domergue's corpse hanging and fainted. The next time we see her in a stream outside the house (???) - but more later While Ireland discovered his feelings and stumbled into a house in which he discovered the bloody murder of Zombie # 1, although Ireland stumbled upon 3 people killed, but he worried that his films would be revealed and destroyed. ! Zombies (and viewers) mercifully for him # 1 Throwing some movie equipment onto his head from the 2nd floor. That's the last time we saw Zombie # 1. At this point, the audience will be cut from death. All shows how new people "reflect" how old people are. <br /> <br /> Zombies # 2 At the same time, approaching the house. (Remember that these zombies move slowly like molasses in January) where he sees Carole Wells floating in streams and fish. She goes out. How do you get there? Zombie # 1 carries her, leaving her and zoom back up Go ahead in time to crush John Ireland or not. Obviously one of the original victims was sunk in the basin, so Wales had to drown as well. (But why the exterior in the stream instead of the water basin never explained) Zombie # 2 Never made it into the house itself. (Now everyone is dead. Thanks to Zombie # 1) But he returns to Carol Wells to return to the cemetery. When the credits end on the screen, we will see Zombie # 2 along with the dead love still in his arms moving down to the grave. <br /> <br /> The audience was left wondering: Yes. But not this zombie # 1 grave? Why is Zombie # 2 home? And if Zombie # 1 comes in and wants to climb back - Zombie # 2 will let him go or will have a zombie fight? Will the zombies share both the dead graves and the Carroll Wells? Then John Carradine, who is dead now - where is he? Finally, from the previous scene, we know that he is clearly at home in the grave ... If this conclusion ends, you are confused. Don't worry because you are not alone.
