Now Star Trek is outstanding because the most serious baby (Yeoman Barrow's) used to use Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in an outdoor location is really different from the TNG and Voyager series which is limited by Completely with the sound stage. <br /> <br /> This outdoor use (and dear) provides the right depth and quality movies almost the same as now. And very familiar performances. <br /> <br /> Except for a few notable exceptions "The city that is forever", "Earth assignment" and "Tomorrow is yesterday".
