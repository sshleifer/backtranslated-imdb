*** Spoiler *** *** Spoiler *** When I watch the preview for this movie, I think it will be at least a slightly admirable story. But as an original movie about superstition, I was left to remain indifferent. This gullible family ended up driving through this deserted city to brake and search for video cameras that show these people to do everything they do and find that they eventually disappear. This is all the heck stalking them. They have more spaces than I can count, and they don't explain what happened or what. It ended with the family having a car accident and being posted or brainwashed or something. (Which never explained) The next thing you know is how you hope they will find it to happen. But it makes you totally confused
