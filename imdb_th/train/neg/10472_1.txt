I should know that I have a problem with Casper Van Diem as the protagonist. The words cannot be explained and they are unfair to this horrible movie. But please let me try to explain: a terrifying performance, a terrifying conversation, a repetitive situation, and through it all you get the feeling that you are being forced to raise faith and propaganda from the Trinity network It is a weak effort to try to show Hollywood that movies can entertain and have profound religious messages. They fail miserably. It's the worst movie I've ever seen.
