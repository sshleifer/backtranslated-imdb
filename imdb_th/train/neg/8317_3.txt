For the movie about this killer, surprisingly boring. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens a lot, and even when things happen, they don't create real excitement or interest. br /> <br /> The performance is good from the two leading actors, especially Cassetti, offering great performance by combining the confidence and stupidity of Succo, but the rest of the actors do what they want. /> <br /> The problem is to write <br bad. The direction and the truth that is true. It's not interesting. Succo is not a unique character. He's not interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> This type of movie often tries to create tension or attention or Evil and this does not make any sense except the regret that you waste time watching it.
