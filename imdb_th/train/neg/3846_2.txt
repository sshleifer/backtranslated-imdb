W. Somerset of Maugham Of Of Human Bondage seems to be an English classics If so, would have been missing from the movie version here. Phillip's attraction (Leslie Howard) to Mildred (Bett Davis) is an unexplainable thing to make the situation seem like a separate post of relationships from a human perspective. As a family lawyer, I heard many accounts such as; The man shows himself as a noble and always right, and that woman is a hell that has no other purpose except to take advantage of that man. <br /> <br /> Of course, unless someone is willing to laugh. With the social assumptions of The filmmaker is an uncomfortable movie. Phillip also indulged Mildred when she brought the fatherless baby But the true peak arises when Phillip allows Mildred to be angry and now has a suspicious consciousness - freed from his flat Betty Davis is an attractive person for her life for about five years. But that time didn't happen here. In fact, at the end of the movie, she looks like the character Baby Jane. She will play in the next thirty years. <br /> <br /> I noticed that Howard's character was dressed and dressed perfectly. Always It tells me that Phillip is longing for the middle class. Some people prefer not being able to run from women with Cockney accents fast enough. Phillip is a movie student, mostly. Such a person will be more reliable if he is younger and has a confusing appearance that beset low income and low self-esteem that often accompanied Raskolnikov's English-language student status and the balance of authorization. Mildred is so charming.
