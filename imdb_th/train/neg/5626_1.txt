Catch this movie on the tube on Sunday. I think it's terrible. I searched IMDb to see what others thought. I am not surprised that this fool like this fluffy hair. However, I was surprised when I watched the comments to read the category that hated it, only to find that they had none. I was shocked by this. I tend to look at those who hate them as always. Those who hate movies, no matter how good they are. Somehow, this film makes it through hatred by hatred that I can't say go to and announce proudly that I hate this movie! I know I should detail about why I hate this movie. But doing so will only make this movie more respectable
