Ah, yes, during the 1980s, it was the time of Reaganomics and Sly, Chuck and the other actors hiding in a remote forest. At the time I didn't want to believe that movies like RAMBO, MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR (and who can forget the laughing DAWN RED) make money at the box office. Winged agenda and they dated very badly. TROMA` WAR is a language that uses cheeks in this type of film. But you have to ask yourself if they want counterfeiting at first or not. Of course not. TROMA` WAR does not have any complexity - although it makes the point that there is no real difference between the right wing tyrant and the left wing - and Sometimes it feels more like a z-grade movie than sending it, maybe?
