This is a short episode that appears in one of the "Night Gallery" shows, dating back to 1971, the episode starring Sue Lyon (from the famous Lolita film) and Joseph Campanella, who played the nanny and vampire respectively Vampires hire a babysitter to see their children. (Which appears to be a werewolf or monster) while he goes out at night to receive blood The babysitter completely forgot the look of the vampire when she first saw him and began to combine two and two together when she noticed that he had no reflection in the mirror. There were many strange books in the hidden library. Heard a strange voice while the vampire talked to the child She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was. She bolted out, the vampire came out looking puzzled and the ending was over. I don't know what the purpose is to make that difficult episode take only 5 minutes. They should expand the previous episode by 5 minutes in the same way and skip now. All the wasted effort
