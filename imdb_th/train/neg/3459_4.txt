"Cut" is a movie about movies that students create. It is very much in the mold "Scream" which is a horror flick that references myself, which at least for me fell because for all its irony, it was just a terrible horror movie. Br /> <br / > But it's not charming A charming one anyway. Molly Ringwald is great as an American actress who despises every minute of working with an amateur Australian film team. She believes that it is tempting to believe that it is not an act, even if everyone involved with "Cut" says she is cute to work with :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene of ridicule Mocking, laughing or filming is great. However, others are shaken during being okay with the frightening woodwork. <br /> <br /> However, "Cut" has some laughter. There are a few stab tanks. Another horror movie is a bad story.
