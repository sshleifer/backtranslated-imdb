Chan Wook Park is not just an invention, I'm a CYBORG person, but that's okay, full of little technical prosperity that is full of intelligent creativity. Trying to follow in the footsteps of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park begins a delightful and joyful story. There is almost no one to blame for his ambition or vision. It is really unexpected. When seeing all the efforts of the Park, very little. <br /> <br /> I'm a CYBORG person, but that's ok. strange Remove from yourself when it goes along with the result is a fraction of the sum of the parts. The location is promising many jokes and abundant humor. But it failed miserably to create a meaningful connection with the audience. The characters were cute and quirky, and played with actors by gusto But try as much as I can. I can't take care of myself. <br /> <br /> VENGEANCE's sexuality for women is wrong. But still able to show the director's unique flame and after the impressive film work is forgiven There is no confidence to be assured that the order of the security zone or the symptoms of Mr. VENGEANCE is evident. Here I am a CYBORG person, but it's okay, so I shake my hand quickly, forwarding instincts from time to time. (Regularly when the movie proceeds) I give LADY 5/10 and with that measure, this thing may deserve no more than 3 for the benefit of the old time. I will be generous: 4/10
