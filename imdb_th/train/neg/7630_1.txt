A boring movie about a boring city. In the 1950s, anyone thought that this was a classic. The producer ended his career by pushing Cybil Shepard to his girlfriend in many films that were beyond her acting ability. I think this movie gives insights into how Peter Bogdovich's future movies are bad. Cybil Shepard's career dives after being in many movies that Peter Bogdonovich produced. It wasn't until "Moonlight" that career. Her began to return I think acting is a bad act of "graduates". I noticed that this film was not shown in the United States. The only place that I have seen is in foreign countries in Europe late at night.
