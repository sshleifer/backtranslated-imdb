You will notice that Stephen King is a chemist who appears in two scenes and has been spoken. "Don't give up your day job" is the standard thing to say. But that is not fair King admits himself well enough: He is not worse than other members of the cast and is better than most people. On the other hand, the story is pure garbage. Please stop working for your day. <br /> <br /> I have never seen many horrific performances before, a leading actor. (The leading actor!) Should be the worst - gathered in a single movie. Everyone has fun. But not in fun They can all manage to the top without expending or revealing energy. I blame the screenwriter / director Tom Holland. It is impossible for all actors to be really bad. What is the odds? Admittedly, I have never heard of any of them before. Still, I don't think I can walk into a talented agency and walk out with many bad actors. Out there capable So there is a greater chance that Tom Holland rolled a dozen continuous snake eyes or that he wrote a script with punches and directed it badly? That would explain why the actors were not so good in proportion to the prominence in the script. The more the actor gets the direction, the more he can perform. ("You want me to bend like a hunchback, talking from behind my neck, showing all my teeth and looking boring at the same time? OK ...") <br /> <br /> This thing This theory was confirmed by the fact that Holland managed to write a script that could not be denied. Many writers here comment on the fact that Billy Halleck is not a favorite character. But that's a misleading way He is not a character that knows What we discovered about him before the supernatural things began to happen was he was fat and what he could think of was food. ("All I can think of is food." He told us it was useful.) And finally ... <br /> <br /> (sigh) I think I should put spoiler warnings at This ... <br /> <br /> Finally he became a wicked person? I can only shrug Perhaps he was under enchantment Yes, that's probably by "evil". Maybe I mean. "Unexplainable" - it's not so bad as an unpleasant social disruption of ordinary psychology means ending However, his actions at the end were not reasonable, and his actions were not reasonable, and this was the fact that the characters did little. But explains their motivation for the benefit of the audience. <br /> <br /> This is my highest nominated person / delivery: "I don't think you like it for sure: "[Stop big plays, pause]" ... I don't think you like it. "
