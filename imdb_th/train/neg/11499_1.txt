Gadar is a very stupid movie because it tells unrealistic stories. It is unrealistic and is a sunny film that aims to beat Pakistan. The goal of this film is to fool the audience. Trying to hide his own flaws will not work and all the songs and songs of the movie are terrible. In most cases, the Sikhs will love the second movie because they mistakenly suck and suck with power. I think only Amisha Patel is good at movies. If I can give 0 out of 10 I will, but the minimum is 1. Please save 3 hours in your life and not watch movies that are dull stupid.
