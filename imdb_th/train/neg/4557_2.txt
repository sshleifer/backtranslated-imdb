OK, it's very rare that I complain what I'm free. So I guess this movie pushed me over that limit. I saw it at the Hollywood Cemetery for free and walked away with great disappointment. One audience member asked the director about using Native American references, as well as "bookends" instead of being made into a better film. In general, everything that this film failed. <br /> <br /> Native American references - references of Native Americans feel unusual and planned. Obviously, this director and writer tried to solve problems that they had never played before. They should be stuck with the old adage of "Write about what you know" If they are proficient in this matter, of course, it is not shown in the film or the beauty of this unique culture is not getting the right justice. <br /> <br /> Clich√©s And the nose --- I agreed to watch this movie on the basis that it was an indie. So I expect higher than this "Little Miss Sunshine" as an indie and see it before it becomes popular. Before it came out in a wide band, I was delirious that it would be popular. By chance, I can't say the same about "expiry days". "Sunlight" leads us to ancient events. But the filmmakers are smart in approaching them that the results will take us in a different direction by avoiding the trap of being "The Bored Word" This film has no way of not falling into the trap because it has been intercepted from the beginning. Comedy of mother, double psychopath, Hendricks, etc. <br /> <br /> I hate to say. But the best and worst movie I have seen this year is both "Little Miss Sunshine" that is the best and this movie is the worst. I wish I could say something else. <br /> <br /> But I would like to congratulate the filmmakers with a great opportunity from family members at the cemetery.
