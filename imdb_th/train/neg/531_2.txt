With this list of actors, I expected it to be better. Venessa Redgrave spent most of the film in bed. The best actress in the world can't do anything that is very interesting when their performances are limited to sleeping and sleeping throughout the movie. In summary, the story says that the daughter will reveal the secret when their mother is nearing death. She never told her daughter, except for vague suggestions for happiness. All relationships in this film have not been developed. I felt that going back and forth between the past and the present was not necessary. It seems that the idea is stolen from the Da Vinci Code that the device uses to increase the suspicion or from The Notebook that they use the device to create the romance of the main character of the story Whether it is a cheap device in this movie because it can't create anything It's a way to try anxiously in a movie without I went out and wondered why a good movie could not be written for a woman. It was really disappointing.
