Oh, people make this movie stop. One thing I like about it is ......... Sorry, I still think so !!!! When John Wayne came and shot the bad guys Oh, sorry. Wrong movie. I miss better quality movies. Let me see now, I'm still trying to protect it. Oh yes, the chicks that come from Clueless are in there. Don't put Stacy Dash down. I mean, we all make mistakes. But Stacy Boy, you created a dooooosie. <br /> <br /> Hey, one thing that has never been done in the West, even all the actresses, they hang women from the gallows. That may be Western first. Although her neck is broken and she still survived the test But you have to give the effort to try the West first. In addition, I have never seen a woman sitting in the horse from the west, although not in this movie. I just thought I would give another director the idea of ​​Gang Of Roses # 2, which should be Do it immediately Edwood's Bride, the Monster # 2 Maybe that's what the creator of this movie will do. Orginality, especially for African and Cowgirl oriental actresses. <br /> <br /> Heeey If the Gang Creator of Roses wants to do the sequel of this story, you may have slang like this "Hey, you don't have to worry about the lady at my house" and "Talk to your beloved hand, talk to your hand". Can have a deputy commander The type Chom Phon surfer who says things like "The Gunslinger is a man totally RAD" You know, something like that.
