We went to watch this movie because my husband liked the original version of "My favorite Mars" We have a 6 year old daughter with us. She wants to go halfway through the movie, which works well for both her parents! The parts that we see are sometimes funny, mostly too stupid or bad. I expect this movie to attract children between 9-12 years. If so It is not suitable for younger children. From what I heard that the original series is much better, and if you are "going back" you may be disappointed.
