This movie can't decide what it will be. There are a few sub-plans that make you think that these items will come together at the end ... but they don't. If you want the story of "The aliens in the frozen garbage" are attached to the THE THING in the 1950s (not a nasty thing that was rebuilt in the form of Gor-O-Vision 20 years later). > Overcome the fact that "aliens" look and reuse freely from independent days. <br /> <br /> The "bare minimum" scenes are more effective if they hire actors who can. Show and get the mood you want. <br /> <br /> Many chewing scenes that give Little return.
