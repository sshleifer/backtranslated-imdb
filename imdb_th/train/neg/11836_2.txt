Finally stupid and pointless too Yes, there is a golden metaphor. But most children may miss out immediately. <br /> <br /> Animation is beyond expectations. The plot line can be best described as being thin but cherished, even though the ending is a dislike. <br /> <br /> Geothermal is a disgusting reflection of the world above and somehow. One wealth and money seems to have a lot. Oh yeah, and there is a romantic interest with women who are smart, intelligent and more paired - in themselves, becoming a boring (anti) image quickly. Your child may love it.
