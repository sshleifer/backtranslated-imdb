What they can do is to break through the pain in their eyes. /> There is no moment in this movie that is True - not an honest line or a single moment of movement Nicholas Cage's character was pulled out so badly that he felt no sympathy for him throughout his hardships. I do not doubt that I saw people suffering there. But Nicholas Cage realized the fact that he was in the worst movie of his career.
