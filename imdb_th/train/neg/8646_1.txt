This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I will get up and go to tape 4. But I stick it out. Now I consider myself a punishment! Afghanistan comes with them! Who is the idiot who forgot to hide the Sanskrit sign? I think the actor (George Calil) is not particularly accurate. In addition to the poor performances and camera shake, I think using 9/11 is the reason why "Larson the Lunatic Implodes all over the screen near you" is embarrassing and disrespectful to victims of 9 / 11 Using the phone from Sarah, Larson's wife, who is expected from a terrorist holding an airplane that day is shocking. The camera shake didn't make me feel sick.
