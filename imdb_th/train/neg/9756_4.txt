Despite the name (in English), this seems to involve very little demons and is associated with a thirsty ruler who seeks Philospher's stones & wants gold made from lead. (And pure blood) Jacinto Molina plays the role of Gilles de Lancre and seems to have a slight problem about how people were executed when he thought they were threatening his position or when he needed a virgin for their blood. In general, he likes the love of women and the mercenary alchemist and the greed and madness that seems to be his problem rather than the demon possession (unfortunately). There are pieces that are at least exciting, like competition and Men who try to fall each other with large sticks and at least this movie looks good. But there are a few suggestions Slightly in the way of blood and there is nothing to be afraid of and the most unusual for a movie. Molina / Naschy is not a joke without intention. Therefore, 4 out of 10
