This film takes a good idea of ​​a 2,000 year old mummy witch and completely destroys it. Nora and Jim are alcoholics who go to Ireland to dry. They went to stay with Nan and Uncle. Uncle discovered a 2,000-year-old witch that was kept in Pete. He resurrected her and she was in the form of Nora. She cannot be killed conventionally. (More regretful) How, Manohra finds a way to do that It is a long stretch. I have to ask why everyone wants to make a bad movie. I was tempted to learn the spell to make it disappear. <br /> <br /> Avoid all costs.
