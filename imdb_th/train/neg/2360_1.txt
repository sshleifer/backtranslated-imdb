This will be the most useless comment I've ever placed. But I have to do to remind you about the cruelty of the movie "Freddy's Dead". It's not only the worst episode of the Nightmare series, but also the most terrifying sequel of all time! It's boring, pointless, and almost without death. A horrible 3D ending and a superior CORNY killing is enough to drive this "movie" onto the floor. However, it doesn't stop just adding bad performances, scary scripts and a number of magic pendants, and you have a terrifying bat! It is not surprising that Freddy, played by Robert Englund, often made two appearances after death. I too, if I go out like that This is a movie that only fans do not stare at our shame.
