Okay, so I went into this movie, not expecting much, I think the action movies are similar to The Fast and the Furious. Unfortunately I must say that this is probably the worst movie I have seen this year. Don't understand me wrong. The car is good and the girl is ok. But the way they bring movies together is just plain crappy. Stories that never make you interested in actors and movies seem to be disjointed. Overall, this movie is not the worst thing. But if you are looking for a movie that will go on this weekend, I will go through this movie first.
