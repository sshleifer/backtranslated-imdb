The suffering comedy received surprising reviews when it was launched in 1979. I remember launching the movie in the LA Times and watching 2 pages for "second chapter" filled with glowing narration. For example: "Better than 'The Goodbye Girl'!" And "Neil Simon do it again!" What does Neil Simon do? He uses the autobiographical situation. (Newly married too soon after the death of the beloved spouse) and make it rusty, unpleasant and the worst of all - unfunny James Caan playing the role. Neil - Uh .. That's George - the writer. Seems unable to come to life again after losing his wife; Enter Marsha Mason (Mrs. Simon's real life will soon be the former Simon) who tries to love George despite his general emotions and grief. Mason is very interested here and may not be able to help today because of Caan's indifference (not talking about the pain-thin sub-topic, Valerie Harper, which led to the screeching halt ) I like the Mason's explosion at the end. ("I'm great! I am my bean! ") But I don't see the end of happiness for these two people ... and the time to prove it to me ** from ****
