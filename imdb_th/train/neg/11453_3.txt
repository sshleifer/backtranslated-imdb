This movie is one of the worst comedy movies I've ever seen. I hate these imitations of Napoleon Dynamite. Just confront the silly humor people who have trained. Do new things at once All new comedies are very scary. And coming out of SNL Andy Samberg is not ready for leadership I hope he will return from this horrible movie and the Will Arnetts character is terrible. Hey, have you read the script yet? The story is the worst thing ever written. Now you tell me it's strange. (This is the movie) The step that Rod's father, Kimble Frank, is dying, and the family needs $ 50,000 to use in heart surgery To allow Rod to defeat Frank in his fight and prove his manhood Yes, that's the movie. You tell me, you'll spend $ 7.00 to see a piece of shit! <br /> <br /> The awesome 3/10 <br /> <br />
