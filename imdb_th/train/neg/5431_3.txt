This is your typical Priyadarshan movie, which is a funny character in stupid missions. His signature Climax has both the actors of this film coming together and fighting with hidden money. Whether it's a winning lottery ticket in Malamaal Weekly, black money in Hera Pheri, "kodokoo" in Phir Hera Pheri etc. etc. The director is guessing ridiculously. do not get me wrong As a clich√© and his movie can be unusual, I often end up enjoying the comedy show. However, in his previous films, most of them had some good humor. (Hungagama and Heraparea are memorable people). Now the coldness of his film is fading as he uses the same formula over and over again. <br /> <br /> The song is Good thing, Tanushree Datta looks fantastic. Rajpal Yadav is annoying and Tusshar doesn't get any better than all. Kunal Khemu is good and Sharman Joshi is the best.
