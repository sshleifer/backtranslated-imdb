I agree with everyone above who said something that would convince you not to waste even a short time in watching this amazing amateur movie. The performance is not very good, the production cost is down, the direction of the foot is fully, and the script is inappropriate and ridiculous, should not be written even if Hollywood "professionals" seem to go to work Receive salary But no one should be paid for this bad job The career should end in an irrational metaphysical. <br /> <br /> OTH has something interesting about watching something bad like a jaw. And Chad Low is terrible and constantly terrible
