This may be a good episode. But I have to close it The representation of England looks scary. Did the manufacturer ever walk in England before filming? At least set foot in England? I don't think any English person will have a different accent than the comedy "The Royal Family!" There are also 2 English boys ... I do not think any English boy has shown to speak or dress like any English child in the history of England since Prince William and Harry appeared before the eleventh To American filmmakers .. more than 1 country in the UK England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland .. have more than 1 culture meaning! I can manage some patterns. But this thing is terrible. I can't see it. The lights look cool!
