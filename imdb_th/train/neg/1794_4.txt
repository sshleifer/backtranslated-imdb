Not your vampy story, not a smoker or rice. Here, the original vampyre story is truly vampyres. These are mutated strains that sunlight doesn't disturb. They are pure evil. <br /> <br /> This film is incomplete. Many actors are clearly amateur. Two leading actors who play van helsing and rallying the vampyre chick are quite good. This film has severe violence that may disturb some people. In addition, it is full of scientific details that many people may understand and may be bored. I was sold in a clever story and both good performances Not saying what the success of this movie would be if they had more budget.
