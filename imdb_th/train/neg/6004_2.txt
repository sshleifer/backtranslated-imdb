The best thing about a typical movie camp is that you know what to expect. It's like watching a professional wrestling match or daily TV drama or Jerry Springer's performance: you can follow the stingy plot, identify the cardboard character and see the satisfaction while all the cliches are filled However, sometimes the director did really unexpected things. It may be something stupid or something strange or something wise. Director Makhinen is there with the best director and this is his best movie. <br /> <br /> In Yon Salalis, everything seems to come together. Nothing good about this But still can be a connected part The movie is not slowing down - action will continue and continue to punch. <br /> <br /> The most strange thing is no time: some characters seem to spend months in Do something Spend an hour at the bar. This is partly due to the summer of Finland, where the sun never falls, so you do not experience the day that is changed. <br /> <br /> Finally: There is a plot there somewhere. You may have to watch the movie three times before you understand it.
