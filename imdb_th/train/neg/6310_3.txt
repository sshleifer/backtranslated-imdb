I watched this movie last night and was a little disappointed. Many "time facts" are closed. At the beginning of the movie, Grandpa commented on his nephews and friends how they felt when they hit 9-11. This movie should have happened in 1994. In addition, one of his nephew's friends wore a bird shirt Donovan McNabb, he has not been drafted at this time. Good story But the truth and reality of the time frame is far from the base that makes the movie look scary. My girlfriend is an avid reader of World War II books and souvenirs. I rented this movie, hoping it would be good. The show is so-so. Very cute dog But the way this movie was done made me happy that I paid $ 4 for rent compared to the 50 that I could see in the cinema. I hope those who have read this understand that I do not feel dissatisfied with those who fought the war. But facts and time frames should be monitored more closely
