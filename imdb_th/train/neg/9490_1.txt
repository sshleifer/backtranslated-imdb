This is a complete and complete garbage which is a good example of a BAD movie that looks like this can't attract anyone, even a movie fan. Bad performances, bad governance, scary scripts (But I mean really scary) and lacking complete ideas about entertainment (any form). I bought a $ 3 DVD. Burning is probably not enough for what this movie did to me. I like movies, b-toys, killer monsters, freaks, lakes. But nowhere near Do you know that those movies are so bad, funny? Not even pathetic, just old.
