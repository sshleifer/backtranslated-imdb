This documentary of Buñuel in the early 1930s about one of Spain's poorest regions was, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First of all, accept that 70 years later, Spain is more complete than that time. (And when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring problems to myself, such as individualism and excessive consumerism. The condition is better than the poverty shown here.) And if poverty decreases in Spain, it's not like that with socialism that Bunuel likes. But with Western European capitalism But one of the most shocking things about the movie is that in one scene, the narrator says that in school, children learn the value of Pi, teach mathematics to the scary poor! Buñuel shorts are the most glaring here. It is not known whether it is access to the latest knowledge and technology. What will help the poor overcome their situation? What does he offer? Whether at school or not Does Buñuel not understand that the lack of modern technology makes them poor compared to others?
