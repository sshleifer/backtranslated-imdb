This is one of the movies that you and many friends sit to drink beer, eat pizza and laugh. Unfortunately for me, I found myself watching alone. My friend and I rented a large movie and never saw this movie. It came back and I thought it was a garbage that shouldn't look. So I got it and I was impressed by the horrors of this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I love movies that are a bit bad and I might like this movie if the "hero" is ugly All the movies I hope he will put down a stupid sword and let someone kill him! He made very little heroes in the movie. He is obese, obnoxious and stupid. He has less redemption properties than the villains do. And all the empty chicks, what is it? I mean, I love chicks as much as the next man. But this movie ended with flooding in that department. <br /> <br /> Okay, if you love bad movies "Then I'm sure you like this movie.
