This movie began to slow and then decreased. After watching for about an hour and seeing that nothing had happened, I walked away. I mean nothing happens. Zero. Zipper Nada has no story. The characters are vague representatives of the most boring people we know. This film producer may be sued in court if they try to sell it as "Animation" does not have animation I can tell the "same" story with still images with captions. The script is a joke. It's terrible. I wonder which script doctor in the world can help. My greatest regret is not that I wasted 60 minutes watching "love at the time of money" but I missed a great opportunity to be a leader I should be the first to walk away. But I waited a long time But I watched about 20 people walking out in front of me.
