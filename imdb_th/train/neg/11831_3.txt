I do not understand how these animated films come out and whether people love it (or not). <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two children (5,7). He likes everything that moves. (Like most people who rate this movie) The theater is almost full, and I look forward to watching this movie with a great actor. To tell the truth that I'm bored It is incredibly predictable and is just an extraordinary thing. There were a couple of laughs throughout the story and that was Of course, they tried again and again to get cheap laughter. But it didn't work My son always told me that he needed a DVD after we watched a cartoon movie. But not in this movie My daughter slept half way In addition, children think that the animation of the characters looks strange. I have not heard from them since seeing The Polar Express, which makes my daughter's nightmare <br /> <br /> Believe me, I'm not the type of person looking Something that is negative in everything But the quality is the quality and like many animated movies that they sent there, it is very rare
