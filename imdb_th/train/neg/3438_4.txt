Haunted ships sell themselves when 'The Fog' meets 'Open Water'. In many ways, this is correct. There are people who are scary and strange to make you interested. <br /> <br /> However, your acting ability is the worst. Showing clear signs that this is just a group of friends who create horror movies Which in all credit they do their best When you accept a low budget, it is difficult for special effects because the ghost looks like a guy wearing a rubber mask. <br /> <br /> Many movies are creepy. But it has problems for using too much twists and turns in a short time which makes you bored and confused In terms of keeping you awake, this movie is very well done. Ignore irrelevant twists every 5 seconds. Near the end, you want to know what happened. And willing to wait for 1 hour 35 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is not a Ghost Ship, but it will do the evening in front of T.V
