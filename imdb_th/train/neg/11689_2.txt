I never saw one of Spike Lee's movies because their trailers were never interested. I saw and admired the work of Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster and had many DVDs. However, I'm totally disappointed with this movie. If this film is an indication of Spike Lee's ability as a director, my advice is "find a job" and stop wasting time and talent of others. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Other IMDb reviewers see the same movie that I've seen? I can assume that from their lovely reviews, they admire that Spike Lee has made them blind to the ordinary of this piece. I only pay $ 2.50 in the "Second Run" movie theater and still feel <br /> <br /> IMDb's "Trivia" page tells everything .......> <br /> * "Take a picture in 39 days" - You expect How to shoot a large budget "Blockbuster" (as promised by the media) in a short time It is not surprising that everyone's weak performance <br /> <br /> * "Ron Howard is the first person to direct a movie ..." - He may do this project fairly. So of course Although the writing is bad But the evidence has some advantages. <br /> <br /> Ok! Maybe not. I'm sorry! This movie is full of boring and boring scenes and has a nasty character that sometimes he can't do much. (Hey Ron! Don't forget Russell ... Good call!) <br /> <br /> * "Jodie Foster filmed her part in three weeks" - and it showed! Describing her "service provider", which makes the problem of people disappear incredibly, just like the chapter she received. She wants to stay there. <br /> <br /> Other Peeves: <br /> <br /> * How many bank robbers will come to the door and inform the police in uniform that they are? inside Bank robbery and he should keep ... or else? <br /> <br /> * When "Detective Frazier" (Denzel Washington) enters the bank to check that there is no remains, the number of bank robbers without guns will There is a "lead" police (very little "give" police) back to the front door, let the police walk behind him? <br /> <br /> * Det Frazier later claimed to have robbers "Why are all the reasons to shoot me?" Why, in their short battle, he didn't try to reveal the robber's face? That might have been the response he was looking for ... The thief would shoot him just to protect his identity later. And why use "Steve, Stevie, Steve-O", (the conspirator of the robber) for a long time to help <br /> <br /> * I understand that this is not your bank robber They have different agendas and do not want anyone to be harmed. But the police have no reason to think that they will not do For them, it's a hopeless situation. Why, when two bad boys step outside to "get pizza?" They are not removed. (First, the bandits will have a lot to come outside without using hostages as armor or not. NY City or this version of SNL, Spike Lee? The fact that they go down will reduce the number of bad people, make their plans worse and the remaining bandits will give up. If not, at least there are bad people on the inside (what do SWAT do or send home!) <br /> <br /> * The police department in this country will allow Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to come to the waltz. Bank and talk Is it about the robbers that you won't reveal them first? She has no power, no government certification information. And in addition, this happens after all "Already" Hostage situation ... more? <br /> <br /> * Why does the bank chief executive (Christopher Plummer) not destroy the alleged documents for a long time? Screw confidence! He can sell diamonds. <br /> <br /> * Who is "schmuck" (the character is not an actor) with a comfortable accent that says that he knows that the recording is "100% Albanian". I can not speak ..... SIR! Put your hands down! And his old wife! She is "schlump" What !!! <br /> <br /> * When questioning the suspect, why does Det Frazier threaten someone who is not part of the ongoing robbery? (Eg - tell the old woman that She will go and she can't do it then can; <br /> <br /> * Who, after seeing the bank robber, demands that the hostages wear a jump suit cannot deduce their escape plan, including coming out of a bank that pretends to be a hostage? <br /> > * Near the end of the movie, a fake wall was built in the parcel room after Clive Owens hid in "a week" .... Where did the material come from? (the drywall & studs) It is assumed that they cut the drain so that he can relieve himself. Did the banker complain about the smell all week? Hello! <br /> <br /> * After the chaos Because the document "has" fallen into the hands of the "reference" kind of thing that Mr White expects to receive from the bank's CEO because he now sees the goal of blackmailing her because she failed? > <br /> * And last but not least, what is "Electric Glide" at Denzel? How stupid! That should indicate his "revision" that will lead them to justice? He looked like a man jumping on a shopping cart while trying to prevent excretion! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> In addition to the normal plot, the punch script, bad performances; And overall poor director ...... yada, yada, yada <br /> <br /> Hope this will give you insights about movies to help others decide whether to lose money or not. ! <br /> <br />
