JUDAAI is a bold movie by Raj Kanwar at the time in 1997 when the subject was cursed out of the box. <br /> <br /> To give him credit, he succeeded in showing that greed changed people. How can a person go to get what she wants? <br /> <br /> This movie is a tedious tale of many nonsense. <br /> <br /> One of the wonders that Anil does not buy a TV for. his wife? When he received so much just to show how poor he was, <br /> <br /> The rotation was well managed. But the management came out of the 1980s comedy The Johny-Paresh which entertained here. <br /> <br /> Even though there are many cringeworthy scenes, <br /> <br /> The direction by Raj Kanwar is enough, but sometimes it looks too beautiful. The music is ok. <br /> <br /> Anil has done his job well. Sridevi is good at her. Urmila is suitable for the Kader Khan who used to be Johny Lever. Paresh is funny. Farida is good.
