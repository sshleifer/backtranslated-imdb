I am a type of person who always has 2 horror stories when I choose a movie, so I chose five eyes. I was tired of this movie and thought it had no story. It makes my skin crawl, thinking that people like watching movies that just provoke violence to hell. It's a low budget and a lot of garbage! I think I can do better than myself I think it's the worst movie I've ever seen in your life, and you shouldn't watch it. The junk actors, the camera is scary. The picture isn't good and the sound isn't even scratching. A bit like a rogue who closes the baler in the project and it doesn't work at all. It stinks.
