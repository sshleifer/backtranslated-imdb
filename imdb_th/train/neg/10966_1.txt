A friend once told me that an independent film about artwork ran in the cinema when - when the film was closed - the audience was so angry that they brought the front seats in the cinema. Of course, my imagination ran rampant, trying to recreate the content of this work. Now, my imagination can rest. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of Andrei Tarkovky all my life and an enthusiastic person in his work. I met many people who thought that Tarkovsky's movie was slow and sluggish. The opinion is that they find that it is not true in the great work of the late director, which is done with meaning, beautiful elements and complex philosophical questions. Upon hearing Aleksandr Sokurov called Tarkovsky's heir, I feel Excited to be able to experience his movies. <br /> <br /> Except the outdoor ride through the fields (Stalker), this movie has no relationship with Tarkovsky. It seems that it has no meaning even at the irrational level. It's probably the movie that "Completely beautiful" without any unskilled work, no balance, no proportions, and a light meter. It looks like the battery is low in frozen snow. The main character is ineffective and unpredictable, so it makes you wonder if his father may live or not. If he decides shortly, <br /> <br /> I'm not bad with stories that aren't converted. Or a progressive story In many non-linear fashion, but not even here We have to go to see this movie with a shaving head. If anyone goes out without anything and does not lose anything because pulling me will be the only possible answer for the rhythm that makes the statue. When Tarkosky looks as though Jerry. Bruckheimer filmed Charlie Chaplin. <br /> <br /> I will not rule out that this may be one of Sokurov's stinkers (Tarkovsky Solaris), but concluded that he is one of Tarkovsky's descendants. This film - will call the successor From Paris Hilton to Aristotle, C'mon. Don't be afraid to speak. There are not many impressive words to bring this celluloid back to life miraculously. I do not agree to fully understand Russian culture and may not have Russian values. But I chose Tarkovsky's work as a wonderful thing, treasures and souvenirs for the audience. <br /> <br /> If it doesn't have Sokurov's name and it says Saturday night, I'm pretty sure that no one will " Read "All these beautiful analyzes into the wet noodles that flick.
