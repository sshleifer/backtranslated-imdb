Wow! There are only horrific scary movies that can inspire similar "Showgirls". I mean, how to start? The song is extremely scary. Pia Zadora's not being shown throughout the movie? The fact that even though it was held in Los Angeles or known as "The land of handsome couches" Everyone (and women!) Turns around to sleep with Pia Zadora in any way or the fact that everyone in this movie is not sympathetic at all because they are stupid. Folly (Pia) or obviously obnoxious person (others)? And when this flick was written by "Screenwriter" actually shows the lack of understanding in the film production industry. (Those who hell will compliment and kiss with SCREENWRITER) <br /> <br /> But it's funny (inadvertently) like hell. The only "break-up" scene will make you laugh and after seeing the weather. "I'm not the only one that has to go to the top." In the "Awards" scene (all done at the normal basement level show that we expect from a group of quality actors like Pia) I hope Pia that Our love will bring that word back to reality when she "wins" her golden globes, making my day. <br /> <br /> Continue on if you're a big fan of bad camps.
