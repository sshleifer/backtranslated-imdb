In the first Howling, we were introduced to a world with werewolves and were organized somewhere. The story in this movie has some reasons. The TV reporter investigated the matter and tried to reveal the truth. She had to kill many of them, including fans who became one. Then she showed the world that they really existed by changing through live TV. The special technique is ridiculous in the first film and they are no better than this. Whether it's a transformation or a puppet or a wonderful computer graphic that shows great power, <br /> <br /> The plot line is not that bad at all. They have to kill the leader of the werewolf for some reason. This will not destroy all werewolves and it does not end the threat of werewolves because of it ... They just want to kill her. I think there are some reasons for making this cloudy. But it disappeared in this movie. <br /> <br /> After the movie "End", we have a 10-minute movie editing that we just watched. The female werewolf leader ripped off her top, revealing her big breasts, while some of the Devo-esquire bands played with a crowd of werewolves. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made this movie look Was Christopher Lee
