In the conclusion of this film: Without a real plot, the film consists of 80 minutes of criticized characters, whether it's drinking or making bad jokes. The music is terrible. Humor is not a joke and all female characters are always stupid. For me, it seems that this movie was written by a 14-year-old boy who thought that drinking cool women was designed to please men and everyone who agreed with that view. In addition, the movie is not related to the original American Pie movie, in addition to a few titles and Mr. Levenstein, who is a little character in this film. The only good thing about this movie is that women look good. Do not watch this movie and do not be fooled by 5.4 ratings because it is clearly overrated and not deserved more than 2.
