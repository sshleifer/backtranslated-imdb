Whoever in the name of God grants this movie to 8.1, I guess the person who created or starred in this movie is the person who voted. Otherwise, this movie will suck! This movie is nothing more than an amateur movie or it may be a student movie. I am a movie fanatic and used to watch movies that are terrible. But nothing really exchanged here The stories and performances are the worst I've ever seen. Props, including the use of a toy airsoft gun that has terrible special effects, which are as bad as others. I use bad language in movies, but F-Bomb has been dropped for every third word and I think we may have the most winners in using F-Bomb in every movie. This movie seems to be filmed using cheap video cameras and not real movies. I expect that this will be rewarded for amateur movies shown on public service stations nationwide. But not on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Don't buy this movie. Don't rent this movie. All I can say is that this is a free movie rental coupon. This is a precious time that you won't get back. Unfortunately for me, that time was gone. But it's not too late for you If you decide to rent this movie, consider my warning.
