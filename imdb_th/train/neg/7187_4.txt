Here we go with other slasher movies, good-looking people and performances from everyone is really great. <br /> <br /> The little boy who plays the phone prank calls 20 years after they are still. Friends, they go to the big house, enjoy drugs and sex. (No nudity) at least half an hour of the movie! Again, they started calling all the calls again! And the killer returned to kill them one by one and the murderer was in the BIG BLACK COAT with an ax like the movie Urban Legend. <br /> <br /> The scene of death is really strange and strange. <br /> <br /> The good slasher movie in this section will give you 7/10, but the twist at the end of the movie makes the whole movie a bit ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The movie killing twist for me, so I'll give it 4/10.
