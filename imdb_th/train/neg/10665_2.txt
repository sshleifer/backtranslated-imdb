About three minutes with this thing, I began to pass quickly, pausing between nudity only. (Why does a bad movie often have women that look good like this?) I finished in ten minutes and hope to get a refund from the rental shop. Those who write these movies should be approved by the MPAA. To the writer - bad people often come in the car with explosions that are activated by the remote control of good people! That is the way that has been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! In addition, in order to add insult to injury, "twist" at the end is a formula that may come from action movies written over the last 25 years. Bert Reynolds is normal. But he should concentrate on the real movie. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't take long - run away! Run!
