I wrote a few notes here on THE FIRST POWER, Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips' 1990 serial killer, hell-festival villain ... <br /> <br /> 1) Lou Diamond Phillips was sued shortly. Come to strike his wife and May spend time in prison. I just hope he will find Arman wearing a stylish outfit: One of the miserable pleasures of the film is seeing his police detective wear a designer jacket $ 4500. $ 7300 designer silk dress and Los Angeles Loft pad with interior design by Mies Van Der Roeh. <br /> <br /> 2) Leading woman Tracey Phillips has a beautiful porcelain skin, flowing red hair that looks like even style. While mussed and amazing breasts In the second half of the film, the tragic silk sweatshirt remained at her body, even though she was ready to sacrifice Satan. At least back in the 1970s, our demonic killer had withdrawn their prey before doing it with them, even though there was something to say to imagine in the last 10 minutes of all the movies I Imagine that her breasts might look the same. <br /> <br /> 3) Professional psychologists living in Los Angeles can buy a $ 4 million Mullholland Drive condo. With a view to make Brad Matt decided that he was rude. In fact, the condominiums used in this film are similar to those seen in David Lynch's MULLHOLLAND, which at least has a good feeling that the condo will be a successful film director. Professional psychics only I met outside of this movie. Everyone was serving a prison sentence for fraud. <br /> <br /> 4) I forgot his name. But the villain in this movie is great. 'Buddy Boy? "The line may be the best overlooked film phrase since "Thank you for riding a lady !!" from CREEPSHOW 2. <br /> <br /> 5) Under the big city there are large vats of simmering acid that will explode into a large fireball if someone throws Zippo lighter. In them, which is why all important public water plants are There are no signs of smoking cymbals all over them, although the idea of ​​smoking around dangerous water is definitely definitely unusual. And because the Zippo lighters have to be filled with a lightweight liquid that often leaks and is absorbed by one garment, the idea of ​​holding one of the bags of Gucci silk dresses for your $ 7300 makes I feel more dangerous> <br /> 6) The stunned performance in this film is impressive to say the least, and one of the fun things about watching it is to rest yourself if you don't watch Tech. Special computer help But the dwarves who risked their lives and limbs Movies that have received almost universal BOMB ratings from critics when released. <br /> <br /> 7) Movie viewers often surprised me: This is a guy who offers quotes for Luciferian power and instead Use it for Doing things that are useful, such as making yourself rich or making fashion models participate in free sex with him instead. He has women bags and lets them float outside people's apartments. The speech here is an irreversible man, able to fly and able to put him in the body of another person - and he also forced the star Lou Diamond Phillips by punching in the movie. A good feeling of living Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed to make sure he wins. <br /> <br /> And so on ... to watch the company of clever friends while drinking beer. You will enjoy as long as you are seriously rejected. <br /> <br /> 4/10
