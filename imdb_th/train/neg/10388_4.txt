From reading all the comments posted here in IMDb, this movie seems to be a bad thing. But I don't think it will be that bad. Actually, I see it worse. <br /> <br /> "The house where evil lives" is a ghost story about his husband and wife Ted and Fletcher and their daughter, Amy, who moved in Old house in Japan They knew little that the Japanese ninja killed mercilessly and his lover and killed himself with a samurai sword 100 years ago. When strange things happened in the ghost house of the residents before this began to occupy the body of things. Live and plan to kill the blood that happened 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I saw this The movie and decided to give it a chance from the cover. It looked like a good ghost story. It's a routine and it's repetitive. But I see that it's worse in my day The ghost sequence is something that has been done a little bit. We can see the transparent blue numbers appearing randomly around the family and taking over their bodies. In fact, the ghost in this movie reminds me of ghosts in riding a haunted mansion at Disneyland. I may be misunderstood But after watching this, it looks like the Japanese horror movie "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the American remake of the film tear out a bit. Ancient Japanese houses with brutal murders, horrific activities, cursing at the house, etc. But I might be wrong. <br /> <br /> To summarize, this is a very cute ghost story. Don't go out of your way to see But if you like this and it happens when coming on TV, you can give it 4/10.
