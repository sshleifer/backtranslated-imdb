Let it be a genius, like Spanish director Ventura Pons, to convince people in his country to rise to compensate for the film's misdirected efforts. The sad situation of the film industry in that country is a product that tries to make movies from thin materials. Most images made in Spain fall under two categories: those about the Spanish Civil War who love to present history through The writer sees fit. Other types of movies show many free sex audiences because 'creators' don't have the interest to speak. <br /> <br /> When this film opens, we see Perera's penis while He tried to cut it off and put it in one of the dishes at the party. Later, Sandra will show all that she has received for the audience to appreciate. The story of attracting Pere to Sandra, a married woman who seems to be happily married, is a false proposition from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Our only interest in watching movies. This is bad "Amic / Amat", but alas, there is nothing related to the clutter that we have been punished for watching this business. As far as comments submitted in the IMDb, all negative votes come from a Spanish audience who talks about the amount that comes from them!
