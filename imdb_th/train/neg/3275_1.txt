Do not watch this movie if you love classics like Tom Wapat, John Schneider, Kathryn Bach, SORRELL BOOKE, Best James, Denver Penny, Sonny Schanye And Ben Jones! This movie will make you incredibly disappointed! First of all, this movie starts with Bo and Luke showing the moonlight to Jesse Bose and Luke, probably not doing that with a real series! This movie shows the characters that cannot be imagined, which do things that never happened in the series. In the series, Uncle Jessie is honest and follows the law. In this film, he is a criminal who makes money and smokes with the Governor of Georgia. In addition, if this is an additional part added to the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion! And the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood. I have one question: How can Jessie make Moyse riser when he dies before the Duke of Danger in Hollywood movies? And how is BOSS HOGG alive when he died before reuniting in 1997! Films and ROSCO RAN HAZZARD. It seems amazing that these characters return to life when they have been dead for 11 and 8 years? If Hollywood wants to make good movies, they should bring James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach back in 1997 and 2000 and create family friendly movies with original characters created. Showing what it is and still being compared to this disgusting and embarrassing movie! If you want to watch a good movie, whether it's buying the original series or going to walmart.com and buying a DVD set 2, including Reunion and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies! They are both traditional and family friendly actors! Do not waste time with movies that are not worth the CD written!
