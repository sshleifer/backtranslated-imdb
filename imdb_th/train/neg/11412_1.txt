This movie is terrible. You can't imagine it. The performance was worse than the third floor soap operas. It's a shame that the film was the most successful in the past 20 years in Switzerland. The interactions between soldiers did not understand anything. The story may be taken from the story of the Bravo photo. The dialogue is a tree like a tree, and the plot is bigger than the black hole in our galaxy. But today, there is no need to satisfy the audience. A handsome actor, like the former Switzerland and the main character, is still hanging (woah !!) and of course the drug is misused. That is really cool guy! Especially for teenagers aged 12 and 13 years, but the media creates an atmosphere in witches. You are not allowed to reject movies because they control the dynamics of the peer group, implying that you are a fool if you do not go with other people. 'Sheep' and say that is As if I had been in the army / that is what I would do when I had to go to the army .. all the wonderful actions related to drugs and coldness And don't think I like the army I was there and I hated it. But this movie is worse than cleaning dirty bathrooms with brushing teeth. (Which I was forced to do because I was angry with the lieutenant) it was not necessary for every movie to be complicated Sometimes you want to be entertained for a few hours and forget the problem and I think it's not a bad thing. But this type of movie has a lot of influence on teenagers by showing them the way of life that is really cool, which is really stupid and causing them to become silly, idiotic and naive. But since I am now my opinion is not very popular, I will be silent at this time and advise you to avoid a terrible flick at any cost and to help save your intelligence! > <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
