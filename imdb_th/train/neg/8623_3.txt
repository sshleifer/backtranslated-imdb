This film is about the police (Ching Wan Lau) trying to catch the robber (Ekin Cheng) at blackmail. The insurance company is led by Kelly Lin. Basically, whatever the police try to steal, they know in advance. This film has a handsome lead actor, a beautiful lead actor, and a good camera image of the Hong Kong scene. There is no content at all. It is all flash and the flash is too dark as well. I lost all the attention to one-third of the way into the movie and there is no quality to exchange after that, except for movies that look good. Consider watching this movie only when you can do it for free. In addition, try to stop watching the movie for 20 minutes in the movie because it's all the same: BORING 6/10
