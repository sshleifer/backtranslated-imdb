The only reason I saw 101 Dalmatians is the nomination for the original song and costume design for the Oscars. I must admit that I was less impressed with this film in this sequel, Cruella DeVil (as Glen Close drew this role very well), released from the hospital due to good behavior. She likes all animals and locks her hair away. From that point on, we waited until she started to have a crisis. Soon she made and tried to create the best fashion shirt in the world, of course, for herself and from Dalmatian hair. In addition to Glen Cols, I found that everyone looked rather stupid. But from the eyes of the children, that's fair enough because the market. Its goal is to think that children under 12 years old are good entertainment for children and families. But didn't do much for me * from *****
