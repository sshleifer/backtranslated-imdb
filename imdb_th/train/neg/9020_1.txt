I intend to wake myself late this night. About the only thing I can say well about this horror movie is that it can be used by film schools to show that it's not going to make movies. No suitable character development is waiting. I'm not even sure that they are characters. Settings are absurd and ridiculous, and the split-screen split too much is wasted because sometimes they can't synchronize with other images. If I give a zero or negative rating, I will Sadly, it's not worth the laughing moment. <br /> <br /> It's just a sad example of Hollywood losing money.
