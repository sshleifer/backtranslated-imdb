After arresting a man responsible for the murder of his boss, Deputy Sheriff Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, III was assigned to take the killer back to Italy. On the way the plane will divert attention to Malta. Soon after landing, the killer escaped. Now, and with a little help from the Malta police, the assistant sheriff Geronimo went out to catch the murderer, but "shot before using the name later" of the Texas justice system will work overseas? I received this in advance. I saw the final justice, both with and without the Science Mystery 3000. I've seen the cut scenes, which helped make this film very consistent. Then And I have seen the edited TV version used for MST3K. Having said that, I have to admit that I like the MST3K version. Why? Because Final Justice is a horror movie, MST3K's opinion helps make it more satisfying. By itself, it is a real gangster of action movies with repeated conversations (Often sent with a thick Italian accent that is impossible to understand) Bad movies and if most of the Final Justice can't "It's so bad." It's going to be a very boring movie, above all else. So yes, I enjoy the very funny MST3K review about bad movies by myself. <br /> <br /> My main issues with MST3K descriptions and most comments I have read about Final Justice. However, involving the criticism of Don Joe Baker The main weakness in Baker's performance is nothing related to his size or the wardrobe options of his characters or other jokes that jump in his direction. But I think most of them are related to bad decisions in selecting him to be a leader at first. Joe Don Baker made me a good actor. But he is not the type of person I would call "Action Hero" with a wide imagination He was more close when he showed two strong performances in the James Bond movie. Or if you want to blame someone who has a problem with the Final Justice, pointing to director Greydon Clark. Clark's work history can't start comparing with Baker, so I said "Quit Joe Don Baker!"
