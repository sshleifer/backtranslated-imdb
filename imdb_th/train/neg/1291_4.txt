I regret that the moments of history that are interesting and rich in material for movies can be made into events that happen. Never mentioned Frank James, Cole, as well, and Bloody Bill Anderson, who cried for the sister who was killed every time he entered the battlefield. But we were forced to watch the fictional characters who had never developed into anyone we care about So sad The costume is great, however, as with the filming locations in Missouri. I hope Ang Lee will create another movie from that time and try again, otherwise other filmmakers will look at the great wealth of material in writing screenplays.
