Believe it or not, I have my own DVD copy of this "movie" which I bought at Walgreens for a great dollar. I am still not sure if it is worth the money or the stupid money. <br /> <br /> The design of the scene and the beautiful dress clearly have ideas and efforts. A lot The scene design is very Mexican style. I like them a lot And Santa is impressive One of Santa's more impressive than movies. <br /> <br /> I guess the original intention and purpose of this movie is to raise and cheer for the audience. In fact, I'm shocked how it is. <br /> <br /> Maybe it is English that makes it look polished and strange. One of the reasons I like to experience movies in the original language that they created, and the use of English subtitles because of the dubbing often makes it strange. The voice of the child was dubbed, at least with the actual child sound, compared to the woman who pretended to be a child, which tends to be very strange Ballet dance in their Longjohns? you do not? I wasn't until I watched this movie. We learn new things every day. <br /> <br /> Is this movie worth watching? Now it is the pitching. I can't be guilty of guiding everyone because it is rather disturbing in its own strange way. However, the unintended strangeness is worth watching. You decide what to do, I don't know ... For myself, it makes me feel uncomfortable seeing the devil dancing all the time. Now it's wrong ...
