I walked out of the movie very little before they ended. But I can't make this piece of garbage This is the greatest burden of people trying to pass on a legal movie since the "national origin". I don't see any actors wanting their names associated with this movie. Lee must have something better to do this, throwing garbage like this. I know that I and anyone with a brain have better things to do .... such as watching dry colors. I hope to have a filmmaker about the relationship between races that are related to the topic that is true. There is more depth in this story. The ranting of the director bitterly like Lee.
