I'm looking for a simple cute comedy. But through this film selection proved to be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I can't write good things about it. First, the script is stupid and not funny. It relies on exhausted jokes and fart turtles to laugh. In my book, it's not funny. It's pathetic. <br /> <br /> 'Cost-effective effects' (if I can call these effects) by shooting awesome movies in many It feels like an indie movie that has no money. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I feel sorry for the actors. Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards want the money they agreed to participate in this story? (See their latest work, it will appear.) Despite Pamela's outfit showing her age and overall, they don't find sexy but funny. <br /> <br /> This movie Not in a bad category, it's a joke. It was as bad as everyone involved bored with it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
