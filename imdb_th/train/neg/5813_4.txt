Tierney is a true strong man. But this film made a mistake from RKO that has the ability to normally undermine his impact on every turn The script about the possible OJ Simpson in the evening. Ten Cmmandments. Just count the number of times that Tierney's incredible car companion swallows one excuse. Ancient thoughts about this "Happened in a movie only". Can be used with a spade here. Then there is a guy who plays as a guard who seems to be walking in the WC Fields comedy movie from boozy which will destroy the frightening emotions in the process. A fixed room scene doesn't help as well, and the director Feist lacks clear feelings for the content. Then add the final car chase that is missing, both imagination and reward, and the results are quite flat. In fact, this film was picked up in the scene at the police station where the police were bitten to discover the hidden power of the innocent service staff. Unfortunately, Tieney's career was never really gel. I gathered that most came from being a big guy outside the screen for a while and getting on a grater for a lazy one after another. The cool appearance and clarity of his emotions reminded me of the time Lee Marvin saw his strongest man. However, this project may work as a radio program. But as a movie with a famous Noir name, it is disappointing
