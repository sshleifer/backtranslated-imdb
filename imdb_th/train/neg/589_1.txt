Actually, I go to the movies, not because of the actors, not because of the plot. But because it is ranked 17th in Luxembourg and the movie must be cruel or obscene to be in this category I believe that as a strange movie, I have seen many cruel movies in my life (Ichi, the killer, Irreversible Hellraiser), but this movie is the most annoying and cruel movie I've ever seen. <br /> < The plot is stupid. Ordinarily, the director is terrible. The performance is not normal. Even the song is a cheap song called "Horror Soundtracks". There is no single smart aspect in the movie. All and some scenes are difficult to stand (Especially the scene where you see the embryo in the glass and hear the baby's cry - scary) I can't understand why this film was ranked 16th in Germany, which is usually a really difficult threshold. (Eg kill-bill (brutal, but it makes yourself fun and has an allusion to Asian cinema Like the status of Grace ranked 18) No one can call this movie as horror because it is really about blood acting rather than scaring the public ("Creep" acting in the middle of the movie is Very bad decision); For me (excuse my expression) it's just a crazy director who uses his annoying imagination. In some scenes where you see violence, nothing is related to the story or explain anything. The plot has holes and bugs. The dialog box is really boring. I can't talk about the only good aspect of the movie except the English and Scottish accents. <br /> <br /> If I have something to do Say i will Forbidding this movie from the cinema, I fully understand why big manufacturing companies don't invest their money in nonsense. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to receiving feedback from my posts. And I am happy to Talk about a particular topic. <br /> <br /> "Make your baby dreams come true." David Aames
