I was watching this with one of my friends who was a strange vampire and I was very tired of the fact that this movie actually existed. This movie should be shown to prisoners of war. Yes, it's terrible. Even John McCain could not sit through this thing, why score 3/10 because it had a vampire dwarf? So what is more entertainment than a vampire dwarf? There is one scene in this film that John Savage was put on by saying that "I want to feel human again" and the chick is her idiot stripper slut she gives. I hope i will "Feel like a human being" with Jessica Alba or Megan Fox. This is a movie for stoner. There are objects with bright light and random movements. Conclusion Do not waste money on this garbage. I get free when I walk down the street with my friends and we see trash that is filled with video tapes and badges that say "free" so in one way I haven't been torn but still ...
