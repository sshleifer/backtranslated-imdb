The creativity of the film disappeared from the beginning when writers and directors left the story just to replace the horrifying special effects. This movie seems to focus on children who are amusing, but can't do it. Many small budget movies have the potential to be a great movie. But this film is not close to that place Fortunately, this film was easily created and easily forgotten. This movie may be an opportunity for actors to make a little money on the side until their opportunity comes with the real role in a good movie. Everyone who has respect for movies should avoid watching this movie at all costs.
