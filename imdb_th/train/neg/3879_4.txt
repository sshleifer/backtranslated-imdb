Rebar is the first astronaut to perform a space mission in the world with Saturn, but of course this is an ugly horror movie and he returns to the world as the sole survivor. With some strange symptoms that caused him to slowly melt and lose his mind, unless he regularly ate human flesh. He killed what was clearly the only nurse in the hospital and fled to the nearby city. Side by side /> I like places and monsters, and the effects are really beautiful, but the space scene has just been combined from NASA's stock image and the hospital looks like a curious warehouse. see The script is very weak, little character development and overall bad performances make this chapter not above anything other than a moderate flick that flicks with the novelty of having a life-killer candle. <br /> <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 for the hardest dead monster movie fan
