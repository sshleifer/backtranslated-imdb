First of all, I agree a little that fled from the mouth of Chomsky. Delivering an interesting difference in his true story is what makes this man popular in the circus on campus. He met humble people and didn't take advantage. He does not focus on the current political pattern. (Partial offensive sides) and he sets his perspective on the far left and the rightmost side to teach both. The movie itself is a fool. In fact, I will not call this documentary. But just a speech, watching "Rebel Without a Pause" is no different from watching the speakers in the tape recorder on the CSPAN. No camera movement, no editing, no rhetorical touch. There is no story, no story telling. <br /> <br /> Technically speaking The sound is terrible and inconsistent. Sometimes we don't hear Noam say, sometimes we can't hear the question posted by the participants. When Noam says we rarely see the audience's reaction, except when we get a shot from his wife who can see it. It is clear that everyone participated in speeches and beams with pride every time they saw her. /> I can't recommend this movie and will say that you should check the speech recorded or not. CD to listen to in the car <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars ... and today I have a generous mood.
