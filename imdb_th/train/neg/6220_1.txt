This movie really disappointed me. I have been a big fan of Gram Parsons for a long time and when I realized that they were making movies about him, I went out a lot. The movie isn't about his life, it's about the aftermath of his death. I think it will be a movie about Grams Life and Music, but they have to make movies about his death. I'm tired of hearing about his death in books and movies. I want a movie about his life, not his shameful death. I was very disappointed. I hope people will look at his life more than his death. The only good thing about this movie is the movie soundtrack. This film disappointed Gram Parsons Fan.
