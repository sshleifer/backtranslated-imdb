Paul Naschy created many horror movies. In terms of quality, they tend to be in the range of quite good to the inaccessible waste. And unfortunately the horror increased from the tomb near the back The story is just your average story about witches, wizards or magic. (As is the case in this case) who was executed - but not before swearing revenge on those who did it ... etc. etc. Then we will be happy One thing leads to another, and soon the magician who is executed is no longer good. The plot is slow, boring, painful, and the movie gives the pointless feeling all the time. The characters string out the reat of diatribe and it never serves the movie in any way. Paul Naschy writes the screenplay and if you ask me, he should act because the above dialogue is overly and makes the film more boring Used to be Carlos Aured, director of Naschy in the Blue Eyes of Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil, giving a boring direction here, which the dialogue did not help at all Sometimes crap movies like this have some charm about them; But the horror increased from the grave did not have that This film is a painfully boring movie with little or no interest.
