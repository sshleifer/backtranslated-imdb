The Choke was released on DVD in the United Kingdom as Ax, a teenager who failed in every department: the story almost didn't exist, resulting in a movie consisting of most people walking around the dark building, except for two characters. (Which is clearly a survivor of this film), everyone is thoroughly dissatisfied, which means that the audience is less interested when they are killed Death is not enough. (Unless the minced meat is minced, one pound is filled with fake blood, causing your stomach); And that free sex scene is next to no nudity (Unforeseen mistakes in the flick of the flick!) <br /> <br /> The plot with a thin sheet sees members of the punk band locked inside what appears to be the world. The biggest nightclub (There are endless passages and rooms that are different from other clubs that I have ever seen.) They were attacked without seeing. For efforts with a low budget, production costs are ok, and every actor seems to be a fairly capable actor. But with the fear of the truth that is not enough to hesitate to mess (this is a slasher) how to talk too terrifying (Especially from drummers who don't die - fast enough) and some people recommend using tacky video techniques in an attempt to add some style.
