Watching this movie is like eating nothing but meringue. At first it looked good. But in the end it was not satisfied - none at all. <br /> <br /> A messy story about a toy factory and the power of evil. So how is it possible with this basic plot and Robin Williams that this movie is still bad! It is because the image has a look without any content - just like the terrible Popeye image that Williams did in the beginning of his acting career. This movie requires enormous money. But there may not be enough money to hire a graduate-level writer. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the nasty jokes that happen. I'm not really sure why it. Was originally created - it was not created for any entertainment
