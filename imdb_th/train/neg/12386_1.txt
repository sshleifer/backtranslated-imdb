It is difficult to judge objectively about such movies that affect me at a young age. This is without a doubt the worst exploitation movie. I was unlucky enough to watch this movie for the first time in my childhood. I never forgot it. I think it's the most horrible movie ever created. I saw it again at the beginning of the year and felt frightened again. <br /> <br /> I'm not an enthusiastic person or one who will say what others should and should not see. As scary as rape is handled in this movie I like the lowbrow cinema, but this is just a nasty place to rent Rus Myer instead.
