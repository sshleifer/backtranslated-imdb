Overwhelmed about three beautiful women in California who went to the festival (Or something) All hotels are booked so they have to spend the night in an old house that is creepy. What they don't know is that there are creepy people there. Like killing ... <br /> <br /> Yawning the "horror" movie that is boring, ridiculous and ridiculous. Bach and her two friends are beautiful. definitely But the movie itself is boring. Dull! Bach and her friends are not actors - their faces are empty all the way. "Revelation" finally can be laughably predictable and there is no blood or blood that will keep you interested throughout the route. There are some nude pictures of the expected girl. But not enough to record this Boring, pointless and unknown (For good reason) 1 all the way
