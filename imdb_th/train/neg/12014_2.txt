The mysterious spy is quite clumsy with predictable plans about the dangers of World War II. The mystery is that Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) Is there any memory loss? The best performance was made by Raymond Massey while Dr. Ingersoll, a good doctor, became a wicked person. He is the head of the spy ring that tries to get information from the memory of dementia which is information related to the activities of the alliance. Will you tell her? Do you remember Moroni Olson (as Khun Goodwin) believed to be a collaborator with Massy? The role played by John Garfield (as Dr. Lewis) has nothing to do with disaster. It seems that he has a lot of mistakes, so casting must be ranked as one of the worst movies in history. It is a pity that the talented actor is full of roles that are not suitable for his abilities. This movie is worth just one face, even if it's a half-and-a-half spy movie, and despite the parade of the dead characters. It's easy to forget this. Memory loss is not necessary.
