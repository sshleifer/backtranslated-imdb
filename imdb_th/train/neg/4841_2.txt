Really??? <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised to see the glowing comments here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is a big, pathetic, ancient grain. I will laugh out loud and very much, but dating a man who used to be a soldier. I can't hide my other answers. BOREDOM Yes, I think my date is flat. "Good old boy" likes it. That's not a compliment. I know that actors want to work .... well for others, but Ralph. <br /> <br /> It's a painful tease from Ralph. I vote 2 only because Ralph. Looks very shocking But I have to ask Ralph, how are you and why ?? <br /> <br /> I'll go to see The End of The Affair to maintain and restore now .... C1
