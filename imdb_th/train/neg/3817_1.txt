Seriously. This is one of the most stupid performances of the family. <br /> <br /> Synopsis - 3 families with no mother and 3 dads. Raising 3 little girls in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> Characters - Nice, weird, Danny, cartoon, love, Joey, I am passionate, Jesse, impatient, Michelle, Michelle, DJ, Idiot and Stephanie, almost normal. The creator of this program wants you to really hate the character, right? <br /> <br /> So I don't think anyone should watch this program. I chuckled for just a few minutes in the whole show and I think instead of being injected with death, every criminal should be forced to watch this show more than anything else. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 or: D
