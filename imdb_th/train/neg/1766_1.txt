Baldwin bowed down very low in film production. The song script about everything in this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The sound of FX doesn't sound real. They are too far away. (Technical gadgets, etc.) if they try In order to make a movie about things like this, at least try to make it true, and put those beeps and beeps special because those gadgets don't make a loud noise Natural sounds like footsteps and nonexistent, which makes the atmosphere like a void. <br /> <br /> Directions seem okay for movies with low budget. (I'm sure that hopefully it will be a low budget). Although it looks quite professional at times, <br /> <br /> Most characters seem to be empty and unreal. I think it would be a better idea to make Baldwin speak Spanish better than to make Spanish actors speak English when we all know that they are more vibrant and lively. That is the reason why actors If I use a strange language, I mean, eventually, somebody may know that it sounds stupid to make international actors speak English with a bad accent? It should have been buried for a long time in film production. Did the filmmakers hear the description? This film once again shows that European police are lazy and corrupt, socially weak and useless. I mean, if the plot looks like "The Interpol can't make a jack, so call an American to reduce this international organization" or whatever. <br /> <br /> Sony Pictures walks on the path. Same as Columbia before It's just making movies for its hell. I think they will respect themselves. Buyers should buy every name that is dirty because Sony produces a few good things a year or not! Perhaps they should use the same team as Di Que Si - saying I do it in Spanish and Paz Vega and Santi Millan do well to maintain this movie. Looks and sounds a lot better! Came to Sony, waking up, producing less, selling more
