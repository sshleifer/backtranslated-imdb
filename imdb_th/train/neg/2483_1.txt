Turkey uncombakably discombobulated The mix between anti-Nazi music (!!), pre-war said and Agatha Christie boasted a swirling head with one big problem: it was a joke besides the single main IQ, storyline and dialogue, the most remarkable thing of "Lady. .. "is a crazy actor selection. Gene Wilder (actor and co-writer) tries hard in every story: he is a romantic lead actor. (With his appearance !! And his age !! He and Woody Allen should start the club for comedians. To move and funny and painful and smart and try to sing and dance and succeed in NONE !! Looong shot from his prehistoric period with Mel Brooks <br /> <br /> while I think I have short-sighted eyes because everyone in this movie says that Cherry Jones is a cute chick and that Michael. Cumpsty is an incredibly handsome male horse !! The person who plays Claire Bloom's male secretary is a thin, sexy bald actress as a chair and is loved by two leading women !! Mike Star's exaggerated acting is the most incompetent police you've ever seen, deserving to be one of the 10 most disgusting performances in recent film history. The most sad thing is to see Clare Bloom and Barbara Sukawa completely amazing. At least I hope both stars will pay back home. (And later shot the agent) with this failure There is no doubt that the great performances like Sukowa came back to Germany after she saw what Hollywood had prepared for her !! <br /> <br /> If you want to see how to make a movie The really bad thing comes out of a very bad script. Director of this study - otherwise! - 1/10
