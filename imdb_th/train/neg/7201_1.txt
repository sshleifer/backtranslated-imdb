Fortunately, I didn't pay to watch this movie. In addition, I cannot reveal any spoilers because I am willing to walk out after forty minutes of the movie. It's so bad I laughed once when Yahoo! Billboard fell in love with men and the song began. However, that's just because I think it's fun. But then I realized that it was just another product placement. <br /> <br /> I love cartoons. I've watched it almost religiously. (Although I missed the last episode, I heard that they performed Dr. Claw and it is nothing more than a claw. Someone commented on the show.) This cartoon has more money and brains than the movie has. I hate the settings of all things, reminiscent of Robocop. Then the Broderick screw that gives the whole feeling of Inspector Gadget. He's not quite clumsy like a cartoon. The truth is that his device actually works to the point that I see except oil slippery. In addition, he was also drunk with "Wowsers", which used to be an exciting voice. I was very disappointed that they killed the cartoon badly. Everyone feels that way too. We are 14-17 years old. Remember the cartoon with love and we love it every minute. <br /> <br /> I went to watch a movie with an open mind knowing that they are drunk with cartoons. I was surprised by the fact that this movie is a moron. It relies on visions, jokes and silly conversations for humor. Disney requires pain and physical humor to push the movie for children. The product placement is pointless in this film and it shows. A clever car is not good at cracking gadgets. Looks good, but it's almost too shiny. That cartoon looks better. The ridiculous stupid scene in 40-45 minutes. I watched this movie. No one heard laughter and they laughed at Dudley-Do-Wright's example. Shouldn't watch this movie by those who want intelligence in Family entertainment I recommend "The Iron Giant" which is sad but very good. This movie is a mimic of the whole family drama. -------- 1
