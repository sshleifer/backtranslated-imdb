This little horror movie is actually one of Renny Harlin's best movies. The story is quite routine. But the atmosphere is lively In fact, the ghost story is almost later. The real horror comes from self-confinement, and Renny H. does not show the details of how we show how bad the environment is in the flattened spills. As usual in the leading role that has been supported by prisoners who look real (No this actor). Horror fans should check this.
