Terrible ... Terrible. Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. And I saw a picture that was not good enough over the years The sound will suck the quality of the picture, the direction of the show ... etc. and others. Taking good pictures alone Overall, laughing for about 5 minutes, the remaining flick will damage your brain.
