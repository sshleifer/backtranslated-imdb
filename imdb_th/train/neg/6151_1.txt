... and in * there is no * clean, logical and understandable way in the pathetic overview of the weary Hollywood cliches. <br /> <br /> I'm 27 and I spend my 16 years of life. Who struggled through panic, hallucinations and paranoid hallucinations As with the main characters in the film, I succeeded mainly from reason: because I constantly think so misunderstood from reality and know what really happened and what is not. In the end, I was truly successful because of drug use. But I was absolutely free from the madness because I knew before I could take medicine to differentiate between what is true and what I can't. <br /> <br /> So I feel right to tell you. That this movie is a fraud, overall it not only cheats the story of the main character (Which is dishonest to his wife, who is bisexual - is really important here), but in most cases it shows the comfort and tame in the view of schizophrenia - which is all gone. <br /> <br / > Schizophrenia is a mental structure, not a disease Schizophrenic patients * are not * "normal people with the disease" but are people from a previous perspective and feel things that are different from most people: for him things such as time, space and people's personality are not things Stable He felt that it can be bent. It can change, can mutate and may disappear. In order to cope with this, schizophrenia has an inner world that is rich in imagination, which "normal" people don't expect - but he's stuck in it because he can't relate to most people, and his world is getting worse. Until the end of an empty and misunderstood dead end. <br /> <br /> This is very different to what appears in the film "Unsolved". It should be horrible. Someone other than the main character should look strange, strange, and ridiculous. For example, in Lynch's "Eraserhead" there should be * really impressive. The initial hallucination because that's what is schizophrenic It's not about * details * <br /> <br /> I mean, see "Naked Lunch", "Lost Highway". Read PK Dick "Martian Time-Split" or "Ubik", see "The Cell", " Perfect Blue "," Dark City "or" American McGee's Alice "on the PC Stupid trick "The Cell" is the most precise movie about the minds of psychotic patients, his vision and Another internal security - it's intense, weird, confusing and scary <br /> <br /> Again, patients with schizophrenia are not involved. The details are not a taming trick for you. It jumps into your face and will not let you go: the walls break down. People become strange monsters. You feel like going back in time. You are not sure who you are .. Strange. Believe me. This is more. What appeared in soap opera
