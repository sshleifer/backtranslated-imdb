Amateurs do not have a budget movie that can do surprisingly well ... but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Ah, the brutality of Brad Sykes. The show is ugly except Emmy. Smith, who shows the camera's "direction" promise, needs serious rework and doesn't have to "hold the camera and run" anymore. It doesn't work. Special effects are unexpected things. Specify effects in real time. If you are going to cut your ears, please do not let us see the true ears of the actors under the blood. The scenery is boring and boring (like Mr. Sykes, other ventures) and music is the intersection between pornographic images, cheap motels and metal-driven, terrible guitars. No real plot or development. character? Obviously, the script writer can't. <br /> <br /> Anyone who raises this man's money ... Please stop. I've seen his other "home movies" (which I won't plug) and They are also bad. Usually the director "" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this man. It is one thing to be an amateur filmmaker. But everyone can hack. <br /> <br /> Certainly not even popcorn. Of course, chewing popcorn seeds is less painful than this effort. <br /> <br /> Reward: Bad push ups. The most in the movie
