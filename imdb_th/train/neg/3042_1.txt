I was allowed to write 1,000 words about this movie. But one word is enough: Strange, Hubby and I didn't laugh so much, looking at the truly scary movie. We watched each other with the best of us. "What is ...?" The expression doesn't have a way to adequately describe this movie. Killer tomatoes are funny. But this is just sick What kind of mind is creating this image and then making it into a movie for others to see? What kind of mind includes an innocent child in this strange strange movie, then filling it as if it were suitable for children? Parents, no matter what you do, if your child still believes in Santa, don't let him / her watch this movie. Preteens can see it - maybe "What the ...?" Expression on their faces. If you decide to make this movie with others, you may want to interrupt their eggnog. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly the worst movie ever created.
