(Avast, a little spoiler in front) I received this tape from my local library which kept a copy for obvious reasons. <br /> <br /> I've been to Matewan, West Virginia and in the museum. There, I saw a schedule for the theater in the city. In May 1954, the movie changed to the theater each day. Since there will be no TV for another ten years or more in these parts, this is a lot of entertainment in the city. "Assault" seems to have been built for a city like Matewan in 1950, although it was not listed in That month But I am sure that there will be Monday or Tuesday nights for viewers who may not be too demanding. Historical attacks - courageous and remarkable achievements - seem to not have been well-researched, so the film is full of Hollywood embellishment, including the cannons played. By Lee Marvin Marvin took the opportunity to practice as Liberty Valance and it seems that St. Albans will have more Yankees in the city than Washington DC. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes me laugh really is when people The invasion changed into a coalition uniform. Only in the Civil War painting without uniform Lovine <br /> <br /> And Ann Bancroft himself While watching movies, I watched IMDb really to see if there was a second Bancroft. The actress with a studio contract doesn't look like her next movie, and she doesn't appear later in "The Miracle Worker" "Agnes of God" and of course "The Graduate". > <br /> Look, if only 1) you live in St Albans and 2) you have a few hours to kill the characters in Hollywood of the biggest news story of the home town Your birth
