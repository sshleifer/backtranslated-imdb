I want to like this movie more than I thought That is because I love the strange foreign comedies, especially the strange ones that catch you completely surprised. However, although this often caught me by surprise It reminded me of South Park, almost all social norms were violated until the only person left in the overture was too sick to be funny. For example, after exploring drug adultery (Almost all types, from pot, heroin, speed to sniffing, glue), prostitution, prostitution, S&M, suicide, murder, etc. The mother encouraged her son (who was about 12 years old) to sleep with a side man. In fact, at one point in the movie, she gave this boy to the dentist instead of paying for dental work! Joke?! You must be kidding This movie went too far and penetrated deep into "Black hole of comedy" What should they do with the next cancer, cancer or anus?
