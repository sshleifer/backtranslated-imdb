Your first clue that this is a magical movie is that it was filmed in a video, not a movie. The story is complex and the production is amazingly absurd. For example, when the couple's name is on a plane landing in Vermont, they celebrate the civil union ceremony. The plane will appear at the airport surrounded by palm trees. Their ceremony - in Vermont - occurs in the gardens of tropical plants, including palm trees, which will take less than five minutes in the New England climate. In another plane journey, the visualization of the FedEx cargo plane assumes that they can travel instinctively only. In the story of the story, this movie is expected that you believe that Victor, a Christian sibling of Arthur, who is faithful, was fired from his church when the congregation learned that his brothers were gay not only But the pastor eventually determined that Victor and the killer were to kill Ben and Arthur for "Get rid of the spirit of sin" It is obvious that no one in this church has heard the Ten Commandments, not for Jamie Brett Gabel, which is surprisingly powerful.
