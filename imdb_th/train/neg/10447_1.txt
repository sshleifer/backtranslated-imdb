I chose to watch this movie because it got a good score on IMDb, but a lot of people have really bad tastes or have someone edit the score. <br /> <br /> Whatever the way, it Truly disappointed This movie is stupid and can be pulled out as it should be. There is no real reason to summarize the synopsis - but go here: feel like someone is thinking: "Wouldn't it be cool to create a movie with snakes on the plane? The reason is crazy and start biting and stuff ?! "And that's about it! The story is thin and not original. The snake is a bad CGI (but it's reasonable to cut corners in movies that nobody in the right mind would recommend to anyone! The acting is bad and everyone is an unbelievable stereo. <br /> <br /> To sum up: It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - stay away!
