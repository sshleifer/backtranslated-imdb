It's a very good actor. But this movie is nowhere near the elegance of the original Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street". Anyone who is looking for a movie for entertainment should visit the original. Our most life But here he uses less And his role in the manuscript was shown by Marcello Mastroianni, so I regret that he tried to fill those shoes May try to mimic Bogart or De Niro as well. The direction of the art is full of textures. But did not present any additional stories that they added to the story, feeling completely unnecessary and what they had to miss Even the beginning of the way they do is worthless and strange from the original. Sam Rockwell has his strange and friendly charm and Louis Gussman has a strange charm. But the love story of this movie seems to be nonsense and flat. It's terrible that no one knows how to create this movie and it was first created. But after that it was too bad that we lived in a culture that we felt we wanted to create amazing things instead of learning to taste the original.
