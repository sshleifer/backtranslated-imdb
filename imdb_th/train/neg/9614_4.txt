I will not recommend this thing until you are interested in David Copperfield and want to "complete the scene". There are good performances (such as Uriah Heep) and good times. (Like dancing) but overall, it looks pale compared to the BBC version 1999 and the previous version. <br /> <br /> There is a mysterious change with stories that do not have a good purpose unless Make it stupid (The stolen jewel is an issue.) American actors have been poorly chosen: Sally Field is a good actress. But she's wrong as Betsy Trotwood and her English accent is a little better than Cockney's Dick Van Dyke. I can see why Michael Richards was chosen to play Mr. Mubur He ham, it's quite too much and becomes annoying. In addition, he also spoke of his speech with an unusual accent and became unusual. Anthony Andrews is intimidated when Mrs Stone But almost expected that he would wear a black coat and tie David's mother and the train. <br /> <br /> I received this free from the newspaper. It helped through Sunday afternoon. But I was disappointed more than the charm at the end
