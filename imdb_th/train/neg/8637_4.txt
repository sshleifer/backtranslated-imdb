Another mystery movie with some horror elements thrown in. Overall moderate. <br /> <br /> It started with a woman with a nightmare that her partner got up from the bed and walked into the room, crying and killing him. She woke up Then the man was dying in the hospital spraying blood. His separate daughter arrived and he tried to contact her through her dreams (I think) and he wanted her to know who killed him before his body broke down in the grave. <br /> <br /> Not too many mysteries about who do it or how? Most viewers will know that long before the disclosure I'm not sure how the way he was killed will really work. <br /> <br /> However, the horror element through: autopsy, blood, the dream of a murderer, a nightmare The egg dish became a cut eye and many shots of men who were rotting both in nightmares and in his grave. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised. Who saw the dedication at the end to Clive Barker! interesting
