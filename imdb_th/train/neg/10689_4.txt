Cuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent who blames himself for the assassination of the United States President. I will immediately point out that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor and the film shows us why. He collaborated with a permanent news reporter. (Angie Harmon) to reveal the plans that surround the death of the president and so on. Blah, blah, blah <br /> <br /> Even with the actors of James Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr, Ann R. Sher and Angie Harmon 'The End Game' failed to attract your attention, plain and simple. Some performances are good, acting is not a bad thing and the story, even though the old and old ideas may lead to fun and entertaining movies - WELL IT can't! Writing the script and direction makes sure that it will not bring you into the story or remind you of the smallest character. <br /> <br /> 4/10 It's boring, predictable and boring.
