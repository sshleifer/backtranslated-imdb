The killer who raped the eating people was killed by a madman at his latest murder scene. At his grave, the cult merged with the plan to revive him by peeing on the grave. This course is usable and he wakes up with the penis pulling out and he returns to the old way of killing with a new look of zombies. Two policemen, one of them, are crazy about the garbage city and have a drug problem back again. The other two original cult members tried to stop the murderers by resurrecting other types of death. Think that they have handed them out But coming out of the plastic baby doll grave used in the original resurrection Sounds a bit confusing <br /> <br /> The performance was terrible, and one police officer was the same guy who played Dr Vincent van Gore in the blood and he was terrible. As an annoying policeman in this movie, the other police are fighting to get rid of his horrible line. Now I'm all for a cheap cinema. But this movie is scary If it's not easy for women with their eyes and nakedness, I might fall asleep. Have a little blood But never had anything more than the courage of an animal placed on the victim's stomach The make-up of zombies, on the other hand, looks very good and his long-legged penis that he used to rape his victims with fun sometimes. There is also a scene where the other half of the killer falls in love with the sex doll. Dolls that have sound of Chipmunks are the most stupid things I've ever seen in a movie. It's just a plastic toy in the fishing line. <br /> <br /> The ending is terrible. You expect the killer to fight more than he thinks. God knows how much money they can make to create a sequel. <br /> <br /> 4/10
