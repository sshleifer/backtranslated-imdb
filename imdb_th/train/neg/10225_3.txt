Now I will be the first to admit it when I say something that may be insulting or unfair, so I apologize in advance for the rant about a story that I don't like this movie. <br /> <br /> About Sum it up as well I don't like this movie In order to be more specific, I don't like the concept of this movie. The movie was very good, the mood was good and the performance was satisfactory. <br /> <br /> However, the story is full of agility, inaccurate and misleading. It's a nasty story. <br /> <br /> I was one of the four Cree Indians and for some reason I felt insulted at the personal level of Whitaker's character. First of all, he is a black person. And this is not a racist statement. I swear. The idea of ​​a Caucasian, Hispanic or even a Native American who holds a katana on the roof is illegal to represent Katana. Katana represented the spirit of the samurai, buried the spirit of his ancestors, guiding and protecting the samurai for Ghost Dog to use his gun instead. Katana was also insulting the blade and spirit inside, and he took Katana from where? It must be one of those models that despise the caste class. <br /> <br /> In addition, Ghost Dog has no honor. Near the end of the movie, he shot a bodyguard behind the window and assassinated a man by shooting him in the face via a drain pipe. Not only is it a funky way to kill enemies But is a ninja way more Silent assassins The group that the samurai denied was there. <br /> <br /> Then he tried to kill his boss when he realized that his boss was a bad guy. Do you know what the true samurai did when he knew that his boss had been proven to be bad or untrustworthy? He killed himself to prove that he was quite dead and lowered himself to the level of the dog's owner. <br /> <br /> Everything about the character conflicts with the giant code that every Samurai holds. < br /> <br /> So we have great movies, good atmosphere and good performances covering the storyline and place. (Which, unfortunately, is the most important thing of it) makes it an overall film that is not satisfactory and Insulting everything that the honorable beloved bushi (samurai) <br /> <br /> 2.5 / 10 Bleah
