This is one of the worst movies I've ever encountered. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing new - but it's a cartoon. So who cares? As long as it's beautiful and fun? <br /> <br /> I'm not going to go as deep as the character or I'll stay here all day. (Except to say that none of the characters will change the personality whenever it is convenient to plan) but anyone who writes the script and the direction of the image should be prohibited from reaching as much as a pencil and paper. Thumbs down? I will vote to cut the thumb. <br /> <br /> "Narrow down on objects / crutches back to the characters closely. The characters provide knowledge that the audience will not understand from a distance. Repeat many times using different objects / props. "<br /> <br />" Make the characters ignore the large stones floating around, bumping together in general, causing rain to break around. And Which can kill them at any time - but causes them to stop and gape with fear when they see a green stone that is not dangerous. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is a long continuation of events, actions and The behavior that is for the convenience of the writer will only help him not have to think or use any effort to write the story correctly. <br /> <br /> This is the 9th plan of CG Comics except that There are no Ed Wood, lamenting that so it's fun to see <br /> <br /> do something like: spend your comics in Pixar films.
