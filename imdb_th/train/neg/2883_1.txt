This movie is so scary. Terrible that I can't afford to spend anything but a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> There are no details of repeated crimes correctly. Many slaughterhouse images Cutting and strange correction without continuity with the plot The show is the best amateur that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> This film was created to generate revenue without regard to the accuracy of the content. The camera does not always focus and shake. Looks like it was taken in the video. <br /> <br /> Actually, now they have Dennis Raider come to life in prison. <br /> <br /> Seriously, don't even think Will see this list I will let that star be negative if possible.
