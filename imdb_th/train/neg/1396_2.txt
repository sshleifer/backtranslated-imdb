This film is about the mental experiments of the secret government and the use of civil damage by people with mysterious and ridiculous shapes that have the potential to be really interesting movies. But for me it failed I will not explain as much detail in the plot line that is quite confusing. But if you are looking for a detailed explanation of user feedback "reluctantpopstar" gives a good explanation. <br /> <br /> Working for me, I found it slow, which is ok. But for the fact that it looks like nowhere The audience was left in the dark about too many things to be able to handle this movie. In some cases, we can confirm that the filmmakers intend to stimulate the mind. I don't think this is the case. <br /> <br /> For the two buildings that other users talk about often ... I see that they have a point - they give the audience time to drink. Again without missing any "action" and I suspect that many viewers welcome the opportunity to have many drinks on the board to pass this device
