<br /> <br /> The main question I posted about this movie is how do you shoot Cole Porter and use only 3 out of 15 of his songs, merman and lahr play a role in Broad Whey here, they will be replaced by a red skelton and a weaker lucille ball. Plot has many changes and fun will disappear. <br /> <br /> Jump over it.
