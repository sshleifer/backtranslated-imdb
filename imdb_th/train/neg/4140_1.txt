As you may have heard or never heard that there is no battle between vampires or zombies in this movie. Then someone might ask why the title suggests this. But actually it is appropriate because there is nothing related to this movie There is no story or plot happening. The performance is terrible, unbelievably worse than automatically safe ads. <br /> <br /> Not only are there fights between vampires and zombies But I think it has the same scene as zombies, even one scene. Their makeup looks as if it were used by an 8 year old girl. The scene was randomly out of place and focused on one character in the fight against zombies with a tree trimming machine. (I'm not kidding) but they use frantic sound effects. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the worst. Movies that i've seen in my life The only situation I will not ridicule anyone responsible for producing this film is if I learned that it was produced by all of the 11 years old. <br /> Actually, though, despite all the criticism Where i am The proposal here, I suggest watching this movie. Solely according to the fact that it may be the worst movie ever, and because this story is quite funny Even if just counting the flaws in it will make you enjoy.
