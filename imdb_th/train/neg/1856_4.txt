I am very happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie! Jack Frost is my introduction to movies produced and distributed by A-pix Entertainment. And without exception, everything that this company deals with is nonsense! The first time, and this is very important. Never watch this movie! Why are you different from many other bad movies that I feel do badly? I can't understand how snowman is a fake, which is why it only shows for a moment how it moves best! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay Better than the shit of Michael Keaton because it is made from good movies and that version is terrible.
