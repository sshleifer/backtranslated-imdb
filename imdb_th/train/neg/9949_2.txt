This movie is probably much better when writing a new chapter. Not that I expect to be very reliable in the movie. But do you think that even the homeless and Jack Mason in the city would question why hunters with a group of experiences And when the Ice-T hunting area arrived, the poor shared with him as if he were going to lead these people through a forest he had never seen before. <br /> <br /> Jack and Mason Found that? <br /> <br /> I suppose this movie is based on Richard Connell's short story "The Most Dangerous Game". A few years ago I performed this film for grade students at 9 After they read the story I edited the movie, cut all the pointless scenes and rudeness. Ended in 43 minutes
