I'm a big fan of horror genres! I love horror / slasher / gore. All my favorites are some "good" horror movies. But this movie has nothing to guarantee that it is watching !! I won't spend time talking about everything that is wrong with it. <br /> <br /> Scary script. The show is horrible. FX is not worth it to talk. "Dress" is definitely a joke !! The sad thing is that I think there may be real potential in two actors. But this car let them not work too !!! <br /> <br /> Suffice to say that I saw it for "free" & felt I was robbed !! When you waste time watching this thing, it's better to use your cat floss.
