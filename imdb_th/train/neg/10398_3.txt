There is nothing wrong with popcorn movies that won't make you want to go anywhere. It is just some parts that are better than others. It's terrible. The performance is terrible. And the exaggerated effects. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood treat the audience with contempt? So why did they create the sequel?
