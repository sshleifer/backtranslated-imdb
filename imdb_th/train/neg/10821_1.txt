I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time in 1986. It was a time when I saw the BBC-version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was a great version and like many books. Many years later, I watched this version and felt frightened. William Hertz was mad, like Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is an energetic character, with William Hurt showing that he is like an ice cube like Charlotte Gainsborough. It's like watching two zombies together. This is a story about love and passion. But I can't see in this model Not returning to the BBC version, guaranteeing a great time.
