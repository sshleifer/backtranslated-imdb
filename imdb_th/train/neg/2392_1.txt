We actually watched twice in the theater because we couldn't believe it was so bad for the first time. Maybe we miss something ... No, the missing thing is the beginning of production. First, I actually go back to Robbin's novel to see if I can find the problem and I searched. Found that what I think is funny and exciting now is that junk that is not connected and a lot of junk. <br /> <br /> So the first problem of this movie is the decision to Do it both The Ant and the train wreck that left it progressed from there. Nothing works, of course - not a happy thing. Shooting some beautiful external images is controlled by randomly positioning the camera in the internal photos. All the actors look at least uncomfortable - Angie Dixon looks shocking in a positive way - except Rain Phoenix that makes her feel that she is too unaware of how bad her performance The dialog is one long, cringe does not change. The scene is not reasonable, from seconds to seconds, and the connection between them does not exist at all. But this movie stumbled with blindness, believing it was saying something profound. <br /> <br /> This thing is too bad to be funny. It was just sad. Gus Van Zant made some other great movies, which I suggest you look at and I'm glad he survived. (And seems to learn from) this mess
