I already know that some critics and audiences say that it is a word that has many political and social messages, names that refer to other names, etc. It may be I can't realize things (I don't want to do that) because I don't care. I'm interested in 'cinema'. For this film, it is said again that the movie is very smart and powerful. I can not see anything that we do not see in the monster movie, except the scene that takes place in the office in the second half. Yes, that scene tells something about humanity. But it doesn't make the movie look bright This movie provides entertainment. (Mildly) and exciting at certain times or scenes But not more than that For the biggest flaw in the movie, it's a visual effect. It's shocking. I can't pull myself for a while because I expect to have a realistic monster because it's not one of Gojira's old movies that were created in 2006, but it's not. It's like you don't believe that there are monsters. You can't care. If you agree with me about this, I recommend you a very realistic Cloverfield. The design of the monster is not interesting. But at least it is planned Very powerful criticism Some critics refer to it as if it were a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it is a drama rather than a thriller or action. But should not mean that it is very powerful I don't want to compare The Host with other demon movies, but I try to mean that The Host didn't do something that other demon movies didn't do. By the way, some might call it a movie masterpiece because of compassion To Asian movies Yes, I like Asian cinema too. But this is true
