On the surface "Show me money" at least should end the full season. You have William Shatner who is always entertained as your host, surrounded by Baker's beautiful long legs model called "Million Dollar Dancer" You have knowledgeable contestants with interesting stories to tell about their lives and those who know that it's about pop culture. And you have a lot of money! What happened? <br /> <br /> The theme of this game is failure. A good game show requires at least two of the three things: very simple rules, exciting pacing and the ability for viewers to play at home. The best and most enduring things are all three. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SMTM doesn't have it. <br /> <br /> The rules of this game are the most complicated games in the history of the game show. At any time. Let me try to explain how the game works as short as possible. <br /> <br /> Contestants start with a single word or a short phrase followed by the option options A, B, C (thoroughly plugged in For the network)) Each letter is connected With all separate questions starting with that word or phrase When the contestants choose one letter, they can answer that question or pass and choose the second letter. If they pass, they will have to look at the next question and have the same option. However, if they pass the second question, they need to answer the third option. <br /> <br /> After they answer and before they find their answer correct, they have to choose one. In 13 dancers on the stage, each has a different amount of moves by their side. They reveal the dollar amount (from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000) and depending on whether the contestant answered correctly ... or wrong answer ... that amount will be added or subtracted from the pot. <br /> <br /> Still with me so far, there is also another dancer who holds something called "killer card". If you choose a dancer with a killer card and get your question right, you are safe and the game also. Will continue However, if you are wrong, you have the last question to answer. If you have the last question that is wrong, you leave the game. If you understand correctly, the game continues. <br /> <br /> There is no pause, not walking along with the money received until you answer six questions correctly or ask six mistakes. Holes that you can't find enough income to get back Understand, right? Okay! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, as I see it, is totally tense due to the design of the game. Contestants can pass questions that they know they don't know and answer many questions they know, causing less pressure. Then they were able to find a low dollar amount, even if there were questions that disappeared knowingly. This means that there is no "drama" and the fact that they can answer five wrong questions and still have a chance to win. The big mistake And the timing of the question is very slow: the question is often very clear, it is ridiculous to try to create tension as if there are doubts about the most common answers. <br /> <br /> pacing The lack of real tension at some point during the show and the very complex rules make this program unable to work even with the special abilities of Shatner.
