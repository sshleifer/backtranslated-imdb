This is the worst brain that is damaged, the cheapest, the most stupid, ridiculous, junk parts I've seen. Unbelievable junk of cult status immediately among strange fans. That is bad ... let me tell you it looks like "Citizen Kane" compared to that effect. Special effects ... Again "Plan 9" is "Star Wars" Â¿is showing? Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... but if you're looking for an amazing movie, it's right for you! I am a big fan of American International. For many famous horror movies, Price-Corman-Poe saga and the most remarkable things. Of course, 1 in 10 of me works the opposite. If you like watching bad movies for fun. (The man who plays as a great Indian leader) So fun and fun ... if you can.
