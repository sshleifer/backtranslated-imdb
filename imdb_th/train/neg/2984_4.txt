I agree that most movies do not receive attention. But I still get entertainment It has excellent magical power over general music and women in this movie are fiercely self-defending. I can think of many other films that are even worse. At least, this movie has an interesting storyline with social commentary. They talk about how soldiers are involved in the spread of viruses, destroying everything in their eyes, even if they mean. To whom you Should be economical. In addition, how dangerous martial law can be at that point when the democracy ends It seems that Fulse will try to combine his previous work (zombies, more, the gates of hell) in an attempt to improve them. But certainly not miserable, like many people will think that I have a weakness For the zombie movie, so I admit that I am quite biased when talking about reviewing them. All I say is that this movie is good for one round without much success in creating this movie (fulci quit and bruno (me Can be their best hacking) Mattei took it) it would be better and more focused than it would be in my collection as a song of swan zombies fulci, one scene in The 3 zombies that the human cemetery is actually torn. I don't want to believe it. Let's see if you are surprised.
