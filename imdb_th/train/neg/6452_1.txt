You know this .. Many children are alone in the forest when Bam has something to start cutting them. <br /> <br /> This shit is no different. Many children go back to the cabin. The brother disappeared many years before. The star "UNKOWN CREATURE" cut them off and their only help was a doctor / biker. <br /> <br /> Can say that this movie Very bad The performance is terrible. <br /> <br /> The creatures look wonderful. And while every movie is made today, they try to make you end with a twist that they can't do! <br /> <br /> There is one bright spot for this film - LOST star Maggie Grace as a female lead.
