Hello again from the darkness What happened to the great Barry Levinson? He directed my two favorite favorites in "Avalon" and "Diner". He has a good movie as well ("Rainman") but gives something that is always interesting ... until now I believe the worst thing that You used to talk about funny movies, it's boring. "Envy" is a definition of boredom. Never been a big fan of the innocent ("Dumb and Dumber"). I'm just shocked by the horror of this movie. Maybe there are 2 laughs in everything - if you care for a long time, the best part of the movie This is the sound of the title song by Redbone that sounds like If this film has been written as well as music, it will be accepted. Rachel Weisz is a great actor and I know that they all want to make comedy (even Julianne Moore) but that real world. There is only one weakness. The actor from SNL Amy Poehler is normal in her role when the trash parked the trailer turned into a princess. The film's downfall is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. But after that, their chemistry disappeared because of a poor chapter. This script is like most of the characters in Jack Black, not a bad idea. But do not hope to succeed
