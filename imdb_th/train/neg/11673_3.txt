1st View 5/17/2002 - 3 in 10 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): A fairly fair account of the Titanic disaster is the first filmed version of the event with many publishers The simulation of the disaster is not bad. But the drama around it is sometimes stupid, acting badly and being like an opera. The story is the same as the recent Academy Award, except that we show that the team is trying to hide the real disaster almost too late. Good for nostalgic purposes only and to get a sense of what James Cameron is competing with (hardly) in his competition.
