This recipe was filmed several times, most recently in the title "You Be Got Mail" by Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" Ryan. In many versions, this is my least favorite thing. The problem that I think is the studio next to the charm of the stars, which is not cut here. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two leads to never boil in this movie. No real sparks Van Johnson and Judy Garland reminded me of a delightful but gentle old-fashioned donut, and when the leading actors were bored with the rest of the movie, they could only follow. She looks like she doesn't have a neck! I don't know if you are having problems with pain or something. But she looks like a turtle trying to pull the head into its shell. It bends up and everything. I can't understand how much Van Johnson is hot. I will make a bee line for that lovely violin player. And Van was not as great as well I tend to think he is a Hollywood star that is quite ordinary and he doesn't do anything to dispel that image. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the stars or early 1900s, you might like this movie But also have more romantic comedy that gives you more entertainment and they give you more than pending advice
