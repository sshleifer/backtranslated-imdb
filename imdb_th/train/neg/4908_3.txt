This film should take place in and around Seattle. Why does Porteau Cove P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L Park appear? Provincial parks are in Canada and not the United States. Inspectors use a stylus palm pilot with a stylus to 'read' with someone piercing the computer data of the bridal shop I do not know if this is possible using a database storage device. A woman appeared in the movie without introduction and never recommended. We learned halfway to the movie that this woman worked in the district prosecutor's office. Then, in the correctional center, the security officer really accomplished Jenks through the door and made him return to the perpetrator !! This will not happen in actual corrections settings. The director is really busy with this thing - this doesn't happen in real life. The performance is sufficient. The plot is good. Filming is a good thing However, many errors found in continuity lead to 3 out of 10 votes.
