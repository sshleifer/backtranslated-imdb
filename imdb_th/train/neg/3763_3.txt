A group of forest hunters and scientists enter the forest to search for fossils. (Not noticed in the dark) CGI Bigfoot scene is scary, but better than the endless scene Talking about them rarely spaces I used to think that there might be a good Bigfoot movie to do. But now, after many sad and sad films about the myth, I have serious doubts. In pouring salt on the wound in watching this movie, one good-looking girl was not naked. And while the film could be better "Boggy Creek 2" (without any meaning at that), it was also sad that the film is the best in Bigfoot still the "Harry and the Henriksons" grade. My: D
