There are some good philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die And why are they doing this movie badly ??? The evidence is nonsense. The performance is one dimension. There are too many special effects. And this movie is one of the endless gun battles of all the Hollywood shots that were produced But if they shoot well, everyone will die in the first five minutes and there will be no movies. Unfortunately it didn't happen that way. Tempted to close it many times. I stuck with it to see how bad it was. Glad I do because (spoiler?) The last line is the great stupidity of the trance situation that is full of despair. It's not worth the second feature status at the third rate. In addition to the general horrors of the film, I am also deeply concerned about the impact on young audiences. The Americans swung shit like this and wondered why events like Columbine happened. This is a truly boring theater. Brobdingnagian!
