Since the 70s, Charles Band, writer / producer responsible for science fiction movies, fantasy and horror, hundreds of stories Some are excellent examples of using a little budget to get maximum results. Many people are bad. Trancers (1985) are one of those rare gems. <br /> <br /> Terminator style story of a cross journey. Time and action Trancers see Tim Thomerson playing Jack Deth. Future policemen give missions to the bad guys. Whistler, who traveled to the past by residing in the ancestral body Whistler has the ability to control other human beings with psychic powers converted into obedient zombies (at the 'trancers' of the title) and tries to change the path of history by killing the ancestors of future leaders. Jack followed him in 1985, striving to stop him. <br /> <br /> In the sequel of 1991, Jack continued to live in 1985 after destroying Whistler. Married to Lena (Helen Hunt), a young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie. But for Jack, things were not long-lasting and there was a problem in the form of Wardo's brother, Whistler, who tried to create a transcendor army. <br /> <br /> Trancers II lacked. The charm and simplicity of the manuscript and is very disappointing when considering how good the original is. The story is hard to get if you haven't seen the first movie. (Or at least not long) and has many impressive action scenes and poor special effects. Gone is an inventor and intelligence that makes Trancers a lot of fun. Instead, we get one magical liners and a script that feels like it's right. Write on-the-fly <br /> <br /> About the only reason I can give for introducing this movie to fans of the genre is the actor. Which has many names that are familiar with sci-fi movie followers and horror movies: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, Martine Beckwick Unfortunately, most of them seem to have 'holidays' while filming. Trancers II and performances are moderately good. <br /> <br /> The Trancers series has four distinct fans. Upset If the quality doesn't make the big swing up, I can't imagine how good they are.
