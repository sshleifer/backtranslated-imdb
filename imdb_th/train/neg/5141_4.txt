1914 was an amazing year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in the movie and he appeared in more than 30 movies! While most of these movies are not very good. But they gave him a chance to develop his screen personality slowly However, by this film, the familiar "Little Tramp" character is still under development. Sure Charlie see this chapter. But his character still lacks the sweetness and suitability that he developed later Chaplin often gets kicked or done by other people without any reason Although they are not familiar today But Chaplin performed with Blaine Normand, Chester Conclin and McSwen - all popular stars with Keystone Films. The problem with this movie is that although it has scenes that A few beautiful scenes But the story looks vague and improperly developed Chester and Mabel go to the racetrack (A very common theme in the production of Keystone - it must be close to the race track) Charlie and Mac appear and sneak in. Mac is chased by police because of doing this while Charlie slaps him. Leinster goes around and steals his girl. In the end, for obvious reasons, the police brought Chester and Mac out - leaving Charlie and Mabel. (Which strange seems not to be driven out of Charlie's imprisonment behavior) <br /> <br /> If you're not a comedy or a big silent movie historian, this movie is a very difficult movie that is important. Only in Chaplin's evolution What he and other actors actually do on the stage while not unusual for Keystone movies is not a joke, especially when watching today.
