This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen ?? I don't know why, really? Just a story about your chaos about a man who is getting married and begins to imagine another person There are thousands of stories. There's nothing new about this. <br /> <br /> I don't know what happened to this movie. Most of the time when this type of actor / actor gathered to create a movie that had been done over a million times before, it was really fun. Usually there are a few smart things in them that are not elsewhere. For some reason, this is not your interest. You can choose some funny or clever ideas in it. But for some reason they are not funny or clever in any way? I hope I explain the new method. But I can't? Don't waste time on this matter?
