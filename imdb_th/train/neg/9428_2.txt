Normally I will not take the time to comment that few people will read about the movie, few people will see. However, in this case, I feel I have to warn everyone who may consider wasting time on it. I just finished watching it just five minutes ago. This is just one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The performance is terrible, the plot is not intangible and the production value is at the highest level of poverty. I know that even movies with a low budget can do well. But not this movie There is only one thing that can save this movie for the purpose of horror fans - there is more blood on the screen! The total of three times that happens is to close the screen. Although it is effective and disturbing when it happens, especially the last scene - it is not enough. This film is too long for too little content, the conversation is too heavy and almost impossible to watch. What happened? In order to make everything shorter, with the remaining space, three teenage girls without responsibility and knowingly drove out in a secluded area where more than 20 girls were kidnapped and killed. Of course, their cars collapsed and they were taken to an old boring house where three people were mad, one of them being a psychotic killer. Eventually, the three were killed one by one after the screen, after what seemed like a boring and ridiculous nonsense. As I said, the only thing that should be worth watching even once is murder. Please do not buy or rent it for that thing and don't be fooled, as if I was a box maker and misleading movie descriptions. Save your money and time
