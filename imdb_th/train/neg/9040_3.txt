I agree that although Melville's story may not be resolved. But this is not a reliable attempt If you want to move the story to the 20th century, just destroy the intention and nature of the original story. It is possible that you can move to England. But must be a period Even the narrator of our story - the owner - was told to go back a little further than around the 1800s until the end of the 19th century. A strange, disobedient worker would be left without thought and the 20th century Come! Request to remove the deleted deletes for me !!! Even around 1800, such behavior did not work well when viewed at the end. And the ending of the movie? I don't know what it is because I didn't see all the imitation - I had to stop. This was like setting up "Streetcar Named Desire" in Elizabethan England.
