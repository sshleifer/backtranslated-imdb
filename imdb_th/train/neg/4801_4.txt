I really want to like this movie. There is a good prison, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, 80s-touch that is completely scary and an attempt directed by actor John Saxon, who plays the evil role It reminds me of the Italian horror flicks. But the direction is very woody and there are no scary / horrible moments in it It will keep going and after that it will end. More dubious and daring images and their fate as a classic cult are sealed.
