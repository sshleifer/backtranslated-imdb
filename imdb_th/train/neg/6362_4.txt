I am a big fan of Italian movies from the age of seventies and I do not hesitate to show the beautiful Barbara Buchet shows among my favorite actresses of all time. hope However, soon it became clear that this was the most ridiculous movie that wouldn't go anywhere. Obviously no one can expect this more than this. But the fact that this is pointless makes it more annoying when you think it's quite boring and doesn't have any interesting characters As the name suggests, the movie focuses on 'cheating'; In this case, people who stole women and smuggled their goods That is the whole plot that this movie has. This movie has style. The true 'seventies' for this film and the thoughts of all the things that look worry-free together Sometimes it seems that the director Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson tried to talk about some issues. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on the screen is always a delight, and that is the same. She is the best thing about movies and the order in which you go out with an empty car is the best part of this movie. Overall, The Rogue should be charming for people who like the seventies style. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much.
