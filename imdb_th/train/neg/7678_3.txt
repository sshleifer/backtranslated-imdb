This is a bad remake of Bimalda's classic Parineeta. This story is based on Sarat Chandra's book of the same name and is a distortion from the original. One can appreciate creativity at a certain level. But not deceiving creativity Everyone's performances are affected and all movies are a hoax. The selection of the words of Shekar's father in disdain, Lolita (Balan) listens to insult and unusual and destroys the spirit of the original story. Once again, the scene in which Shekhar (Saif) Slap Lolita is quite incompatible with the flow of the film and the characters are quite shaken to the senses and can be easily avoided. Similarly, the sex scene between Saif and Balan is quite inappropriate for movies and cheap mechanisms to attract viewers. When the creative work is not honest with the original work and destroys the soul, the work is separated. The song "piyu bole" is quite okay. The other money lining up in the dark clouds of the film is the scene where Saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father he This is a positive journey from traditional credit and deserves. When counting these, the film deserves 3 stars. The music and dance of Rekha has an aura of art and is an option. Is a beautiful song But I remember having heard it somewhere before, and if Iam didn't understand it, the song seemed to be stolen. <br /> <br /> Well, the time that I agreed to change from now to now. But this film does not reflect the era. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when the new Bollywood filmmakers are obsessed with the impressions of NRIs and attracting the wealthy NRI entertainment market. Such ends do not belong to India or to other parts of the world.
