The US television series 'Knots Landing' has all the entertainment value attached to the elevator. Every episode has a plot, such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking, not much different from the plans of other drama of that era. For the actors, I have seen better actors in the cereal box. From the mid to late 90s, the repetition of 'knots' puzzled up. U.K-Gold like a mountain with soft dew I am sorry to announce that I suffer because my mother is a big fan of the program and will look religiously. Although since then, running repeatedly will be less (hopefully it will be like that). The only positive thing that can be said of 'Knots' is to adjust the catchy saxophone sign after that. The title for ITV's sitcom, The The Hand. Great legacy, right?
