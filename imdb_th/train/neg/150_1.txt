Really friends !!!! Where are you in the last 20 years? It's shocking in every horror aspect? This is a joke. There is nothing wrong with having a limited budget, but this is a joke if you want to see the classic Freaks of Tod Browning, victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, the immortal monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener's The Golem and Passengers of The Ghost Train You can't compare it to bad names, bad performances, bad screenplay, etc. Including money and free time watching many movies is a horror story. The most favorite time I can't speak, nothing to say more, please don't try to see something that is terrible. Please understand.
