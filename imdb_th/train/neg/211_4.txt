"Drama" that is clear about many high schools (I think). Children who enjoy hip-hop that does not stop, stop graffiti and try to be a DJ that Roxy says straight. I forget! Even people who love music agree that this film has a huge role. We should find this cute and nice child. I found them polite and boring. What I really hate is Ramon. He made graffiti on the subway and it looks great. Sorry? He is protecting his non-public property to begin with. In addition, these "great" children can experience the electricity of the city in order to organize a large dance event in which the building is abandoned. > I can forgive everything if good music But I can't stand hip hop The best song - medium and they don't stop! They are always playing! Up to the point that I fast forwarded through many endless music numbers. (Cut the song and you have a 30-minute movie - maybe) There are a few fantasy figures - fighting, dancing, subway, Santa numbers, truly funny, and Roxy shows. But you are looking for a good drama mixed - forget it. In addition, this method is rated PG? There is an incredible amount of swearing.
