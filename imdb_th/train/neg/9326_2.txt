I and a group of friends rented awesome videos to laugh with them. Believe me that it led to horrible spending money. It has some sick good laughs. It's one of the horror movies. But funny that we rent The plot is all finished. Bring your friends into the forest and never come back. Very old things. The most interesting part of the movie looks like you are visiting a local butcher shop, except for a little dirty, and there is blood on the powder to watch. And if anyone who has ever been afraid of this movie, they should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their lives. A good aspect of the movie is that the two women in it are fairly hot. The other one is better than the other and you will see them both naked while watching movies. Another good aspect is that this movie is terrible, sometimes you will laugh until crying. I don't like watching horrible performances or renting these scary videos. I don't find it fun. But seeing the amount of effort these people put on and still coming out is terrible, hilarious and worth the rental. Laughing with the devastation of someone I want to recommend. <br /> <br /> If you rent / buy to laugh at it, I'll give you 8.5.
