The plot is not good (although it's good for movies B). The most fast-paced battle scenes in 5 out of 10, but there are some things that always annoy me about this movie: Why Mariska Hargitay never spoke in the TV version She shared a moment closer to Jeff Speakman, even kissing in the garden. But in the normal version (video), most of her scenes were cut and she never spoke. This thing makes me annoyed because it's not just But will make women look at the movie's perspective But also makes the final image look creepy This movie would be better if they kept her scene in that scene because at least she had a personality that undermined what Speakman said.
