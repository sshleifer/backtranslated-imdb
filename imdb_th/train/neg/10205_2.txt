So I suspect that while watching this movie, the producer of this movie saves money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by dragging "before" clothes from Miss Congeniality? Bullock also had to sleepwalking through the role by cursing "before" Gracie Hart or not? As many reviewers have previously mentioned, this film is a very unique formula. In addition, deja vu audiences will experience the character of Cassie Maywether as Gracie Hart, which is darker with more retrospective stories and it quickly becomes a snooze festival. <br /> <br /> Two male serial killers That used to do (and better) in other movies As "A good guy tries to protect his partner, even with evidence." The characters have seen before. In fact, there are no characters in the movie that have received more than two dimensions or are trying to be anything other than a repetitive stereotypes. <br /> <br /> One last peeve - using the word killer as an ad. The killing of a person - even if it is a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer. You may have the potential to be a serial killer. But you are not a serial killer or even a fun killer
