Ok, honest people ... This is one of the worst movies about the show that has been done. But I laugh myself stupid (which may be the reason why I'm fun). Basically it's all about sex, sex and how to make you famous. 15 minutes I talk about sex as a key issue Is this movie? If you have something to happen to bizzzzare characters and entertainment that is easy, watch this movie when you have a chance. (And there is nothing better to do) <br /> <br /> *** interested in spoilers !!! *** The funniest thing in the movie is the guy who asks Jerry that he will marry His goat (!) In the list, then blink the purse with a triple A love image for bad taste and fun!
