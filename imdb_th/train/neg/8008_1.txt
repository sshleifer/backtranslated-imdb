For Daniel Auteuil `Queen Margot 'is much better for Nastassja Kinski` Paris Texas 'Is much better The biggest disappointment came from Chris Menges (`CrissCross 'and' A World Apart ', unable to compare with this) and Goran Bregovic for using the same theme song from` Queen Margot' for this film. The end of the movie) If this is an American pop movie, I won't be surprised. But for European films with more independent actors and directors, similar general methods of child abuse that do not have a traditional understanding are simple and frustrating. There are criminals who kidnapped and sold underage people. There are those poor children who hate people who sell them and wait to receive help from someone. And finally there is a great hero who kills all the bad guys and helps these poor children from the bad guys All characters are shown with simple black and white vocabulary: advantages and evils. In addition, from the beginning I can understand how the story ends. Is this the end of history of child sexual abuse? I believe that the problem of child abuse and child pornography is more complicated than what we present in this film is not original. I think this movie is not disturbing. But very disappointing
