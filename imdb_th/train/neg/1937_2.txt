The first half hour of this movie that I like The clear love between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer is lovely to see and I want to see the inevitable things that happened between them. However, when the action changed to the house of Ingrid's fiancee, everything collapsed completely. Instead of being romantic and charming, we see a pathetic character that appears pathetic, which destroys this film. The son imprisoned the fiancé's fiancé and the military attaché, vying for the interest of a stupid girl - the type of subplot from the old love ship The charm and elegance of the first part of this film can make it more than me. This film is a clear attempt by Renoir to commemorate the success he has received with THE RULES OF THE GAME, since the film is very similar when the action changes to use the country land I'm not a big fan of the rules of the game, but ELENA and HER MEN make me see the value of the art and the difference of the original movie.
