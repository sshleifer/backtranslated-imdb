I have very high hopes for this film because I love the original lot. It seems that Disney is trying to create perfection for the next DVD movie. They deserve many razzie. I think the idea is valuable. But the music is terrible and the story isn't much better. What happened to the great music that Disney had in their movies? Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King ... Even Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame Over the years, it was really sad that they sank in creating a bad sequel that would be screened in theaters. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie. Not an indication of things that will come to Walt Disney Company.
