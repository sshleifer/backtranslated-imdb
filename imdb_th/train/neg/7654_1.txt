I remember reading all the scary and scary reviews for this movie when it came out. I intend to see how scary it is. But it left the cinema in three weeks Another matter that must be dealt with is Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the movie comes out on the DVD, I bought it to see how bad it was. I can't think of the terrifying interest that this movie has received. After seeing it, I understand. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that this movie doesn't have a cool picture. There is a good starting point that shows that the bullet was fired from inside the gun, which I think. It's neat And the way in which the monster in this movie dies looks cool But it will get older after you see it first. <br /> <br /> Let me start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If bad performances are sinful, hell will throw Tara Reid out. Immediately because she was incredibly scary in this movie, which was unthinkable And in all roles, she plays the curator Now, if you play an empty brainless sex toy, maybe I forgive you how you treat your character. Obviously, Uwe Boll didn't realize that, even though he thought that if she removed her shirt in the movie, people would see it. He didn't realize that making her do that in the middle of the movie in the wrong moment certainly made this movie even worse. And that is the Mexican song or something in the scene that is buzzing I can't tell. <br /> <br /> Which leads me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows the worst governance skills you have ever seen in a movie. I mean, I will give the House of the Dead an F (and I do that with only a few movies), but the HotD will give at least one B rating compared to this junk that is drunk. The movie begins with a very long description that causes confusion immediately. (And read by the scary narrator) and from there, the cut is really real There is one point that Slater and Reid look around the destroyed buildings and the screen becomes darker. When it came back, Slater and Reid shot everywhere and suddenly the whole army came together. <br /> <br /> And there are people who don't care to check the mistakes in this movie. At one point, the team broke through the glass. But the glass broke before touching. Tara Reid's earrings changed color in one scene, and after Slater walked from a dead companion, you will see her begin to rise. <br /> <br /> For the story ... I lost Really Something about the old tribe who released darkness and had people "Open the path" or something and all evil monsters emerge. It's an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes. (Technology is advanced here until there is no need to put the characters in this movie again) that is boring. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie in the hope that he would laugh that it was so stupid. I don't laugh But I still think it's very stupid, very stupid
