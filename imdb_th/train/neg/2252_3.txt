So I heard from a few people that this movie caused them to tear in the theater. As I watched it for the first time, I expected to have a torn romance movie about Barbra Streisand. Something like we are I'm absolutely wrong The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and John Howard, does not exist, making it impossible to stick to the character. There is nothing romantic about it. Streisand's character falls in love with an addict who cannot sing without making me want to press the fast forward button. At one point, her character found that her husband was in bed with another woman and she forgave him five minutes later. There is nothing romantic about the famous rock star and the woman who seems to be unaware until he dies. Some parts of the movie seem to drag around and I always ask myself what it is going to end. <br /> <br /> John Howard's death is predictable. There was a clear prediction about his careless behavior at the beginning of the movie and when he died I didn't feel anything. It's not a tragic accident. He's a typical fool. Not to mention the whole story that I was disturbed by his terrifying beard. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth watching is the movie Streisand. The ending of the movie when she sings "With One More Look You / Watch Closely Now "It is my reason to make this movie a huge size. 3/10 7 minutes is just part of the movie that I feel other emotions apart from irritation and anger.
