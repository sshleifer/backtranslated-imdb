I must say that this is Priyadarshan's worst movie (coupled with a much better kyonki, who is also directing his performance). It doesn't have a specific story and focuses on the body acting by the actors. Female launch I think that Pridiada Chan is repeating too much in his comedy, such as Govinda and David. Dakhan has done it in the past after giving good entertainment. They also make the audience loose too. It will be good for him. Try using different styles in his direction to give us more than herapheri and malamal weekly rather than giving duds like garam masala!
