I must say that during my childhood I was quite proud of the movies I rented. The exception is Theodore Rex. Talking about movies, frauds all the time in the actors' resume. You can imagine that the agent of the Whoopie shoot must tell her to sign with this shit. "Hey Whoop, have you ever seen a dinosaur performance? They're making a movie and you will see Germany! "After that, the agent must reference a lot of Star Wars. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. I think Whoopie must buy every copy of this movie and destroy it. I just hope you can do the same thing with my memory because my sister still gives me shit for watching that movie. I mean, c'mon. I would even agree that I watched the mentor and Kazzam in the cinema (The good reason I gave up both Hulk Hogan and Shaq for a moment) But this one stuck in my heart that my worst. Childhood and the greatest regret in my life is 16 years ago. Now I'm 24 if you want to do math. <br /> <br /> Whenever I think of the worst movie of all time I am not talking about this because like a child being raped I tried hard to suppress that it had happened. Screw Whoopie. Just glad that only people know Eddie and Sister Act 2 that you're lucky.
