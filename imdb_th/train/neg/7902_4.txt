Cute and playful But weak and cheap. 'Munchies' is another clone of the Gremlins that came out of the 80s. I'm not a fan of many imitations. <br /> <br /> At first it was a wonderful 'Gremlins' <br /> <br /> Then came the 'Critters' on average. <br /> <br /> Don't forget the horror of' Ghoulies'. <br /> <br /> But the complete hole must go to 'Hobgoblins. '<br /> Are there any more? <br /> <br /> Now,' Munchies 'for me must be between' Ghoulies 'and' Hobgoblins '. In fact, I may find it more fun.' Ghoulies' but I like darker colors. <br /> <br /> From playing, it makes nature look foolish. (Which is better for it), but because of that nature, the performances of Hammy (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips) can make you more angry Just see how the Munchies run rampant. That's where the fun happens. Mostly flaky, gently, as if most stories focus on munchies (who starved him and devastated) in a group of funny encounters should (In some work hours) in a few small desert towns on the chase. It's stupid but strangely involved. Thank you. Walk, walk, cheer. That creature looks quite polite and not very well detailed because it is a basic doll that has been thrown away. Their personalities come from where they can speak ... and with an attitude. <br /> <br /> Charlie Stratton and Nadine Van der Velde, the noble feisty. (Those in the 'Critters') are fair leaders. Harvey Corman was accepted in two roles. Robert Picardo appeared. <br /> <br /> Attractive low-end entertainment for people who don't want much.
