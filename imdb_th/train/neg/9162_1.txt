The only reason for this film to score 1 is zero, not an option to choose one. With a thinner plot than cabbage soup, a depressing era, terrifying performances and special effects that seem like they came out of the TV series. It's amazing that Widmark didn't kill the director wearing this black mark. Although the standards of the 1950s had brutal special techniques, except in the order of two submarines. I can assume that it has been nominated for the best special effects because except 20,000 leagues under the sea and they! No one made an effect. Of course, in that year, there was no contest for Disney if it was their only competition. I do not want to recommend this movie, even for hard-core movies in the submarine, because the most realistic scenes in the submarine are limited to one shot, only to be able to see the sea flowing down in the higher periscope. There are many other sub movies that you can enjoy from this era, such as 20,000 Leagues or Torpedo Run as mentioned above.
