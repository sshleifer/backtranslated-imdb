I checked this on a DVD in dollars so I could smile easily because this scary movie spread out. Every time you think it will not be worse than this The performance was excellent. The story doesn't make sense. The name "Cold Revenge" in the DVD version of the US has nothing to do with the script. The action scenes were clearly captured in the first shot. There are many mistakes during the discussion that there is no intention to do anything else to try to make the film acceptable. I do not remember having seen a movie that is worse, and I have done a good job, except Wesley Snips. No, I'm a joke, while the Unstoppable bad guy deserves the Best Picture award at the Oscars compared to this shit.
