After watching this movie for 10 minutes, I was dazed. 30 minutes, my toes curled up - I almost didn't want to believe it: this movie is really bad. In fact, it was so scary that I had to watch it all to make sure (!) In the meantime, I realized that it reminded me of many Danish comedians from the 60s and 70s. As follows: Get a popular comedian, write a script for this comedian in the most peculiar situations possible, add jokes (Especially one-liners) and spices with two beautiful women That movie and you succeed! I do not know whether this film was successful or not. But unlike the Danish tradition that died quietly (with a great comedian), it seems that there is a market for this type of film in the United States.
