If you read the original novel like you've done, you may hate this. <br /> <br /> _Absolute's Beginners_ movie version is a dreadful group in the 80s with an era of trying to create In the late 1950s and failing to create a new one, or even showing respect at that time - the terrifying dance of _Dirty Dancing_ was similar to the year 1963, except for movies that proved to be financially successful. In addition to suffering from the "80s look", the characters have changed, re-arranged and measured to the point that they are unique to the novels. They are superficial and most definitely their name. A lonely and stingy girl who plans to marry an old woman with a frustrated personality in exchange for money. (During her first few pages) became innocent and innocent. And glamor was exploited and cheated in the marriage of her boss, which is not surprising that he had not received a van and pointed hair She and the narrator "Colin" again (after the author of the book, Colin MacInnes) for this film also has a relationship. <br /> <br /> Big Jill's character "In the mid-20th century, which acted as a pimp with a lesbian group with a small head and a bubble, and one of the narrator's close friends distributing the straightforward wisdom to the narrator. Only a few "special names" and many funny sets. <br /> <br /> The Fabulous Hoplite, a young gay man and a close friend of the narrator in the novel, was reduced to the point of no point in the movie. Set up and ignore. <br /> <br /> The narrator's father in the novel is a tragic little character, but in this film he has shown that he is optimistic and has Strange and strange, the chaos of his marriage with the narrator's mother seems to be for all practical purposes. <br /> <br /> In a way that likes music. (For what it is) is peaceful and you have to give credit to the production and writing for the team to play the role of the book ("... some days they will write plays about the 1950s ... ") To be an inspiration for writing musicals, but in the world of bad theater, this is the worst story in the group. Unlike _Shock Treatment_ or _Starstruck_ important plot elements will be treated according to the idea. Unlike _The Apple_, there are irregular and irregular changes between numbers, music and dialogue. <br /> <br /> You can't blame it. "Feeling the same in the 1980s" in the fact that it was created in 1980. The movie _Annie_, which was released in 1981, paid great tribute to the look of New York City in the 1930s and _Napolean Dynamite_ managed. The look and feel of the 1980s had a low budget in 2003 (although not clearly defined in the 1980s, but those who lived in this decade could not deny that the image This movie "Feeling up to 1980") is clearly _possible_ to do good things, especially when considering the status as a symbol of the original novel in the United Kingdom. But it failed most clearly in the look and feel If you do not read and do not intend to read the novel, you can enjoy the unusual of the 80s of this period concentration camp, which is an embarrassing parody of the modern Zobonon era jazz. I can clearly see what the writing team is trying. But they did better with Boy George as household names and musicians and mixed-race bands in the UK charts in 1986. They want _not_ of course to make the characters mess up the way they do. In fact, I would say that the writer did what he had been criticizing for both books and movies - it ended with a group of people ejecting shit and keeping two-year-old young audiences like the target. Stupid people who make money fast
