I do not remember the last time I responded to the emotional performances that I did with Justin Timberlake in "Edison". I had a lot of emotions. I wanted to scream in pain, break the screen and get hopelessly shouting. From destruction Timberlake is a terrifying monster. In fact, the selection of him is like selecting Andy Dick to take the lead in "Patton" or Nathan Lane to play as Jesus. But that was almost a key point. <br /> <br /> Timberlake is just a bad actor. I had a problem with Ben Affleck's acting abilities, but Timberlake made Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench with the old man's ripple (read lithp), baby and expression. The emotions that arise from something, such as "25 performances of ancient ideas for actors", he makes the screen toxic, which makes him painfully mercilessly. No, and will not buy his role as an amateur journalist who turned to war for justice. It will not fly. <br /> <br /> However, Timberlake alone should not blame him for his failure. Director David J. Burke not only gave him the main role but also made Morgan Freeman , Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and (I'm surprised that he is good) LL Cool J I can imagine that almost everyone suffering from watching this actor's performance interacts with Timber. Lake <br /> <br /> Of course it is POSSIBLE: time these actors interact with each other without Justin. If you are happy. Freeman and Spacey may have more than 10 minutes of screen time together, but ten minutes are full of happiness compared to their scenes with the heroes we call Dylan McDermott. It's a pure breath. <Br /> <br /> But when enough of the Timberlake can be beaten - not enough words in this case, especially in order to make a trick "Edison" is a story of corruption that should be followed. It has a plot from the ancient idea to the ordinary. However, I admire the inspiration behind the creation, which I interpret as a homage to movies such as "Serpico" or "Donnie Brasco" or maybe "Chinatown". Don't understand me wrong - "Edison" is not Get in the same ballpark as these movies. But I can extend the period of unbelief to appreciate the reason of being there. Perhaps it is the reason that I sit through <br /> <br /> The script in and of myself has a very bad writing. surprised Yes, it has a good exchange. But the conversation between Piper Perabo (who lost here) and Timberlake seems to have been lifted from the episode of Dawson Creek. It's a conversation that is far beyond your reality. Try to impress the audience with dialogue ( How good this conversation is in your heart is separated by great music at the wrong time - sometimes it feels like "Edison" wants to transform into a music video, which is the mood of Cha. That did not communicate through acting But through poorly selected songs And the speed of the film varies (Read Slow Motion) <br /> <br /> When thinking about this, "Edison" is a curious thing. Of course, the hell has actors to kill. But the show was destroyed by Timberlake, which didn't work In movies, as in most art works, if something falls out Directors must make difficult choices. David J. Burke missed the mark here. Some scenes play well and on their own. But overall, it seems that they are not suitable for puzzle pieces from different puzzles that are forced to be one of the discrete images. And it is not a particularly exciting puzzle
