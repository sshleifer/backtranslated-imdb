This movie is terrible, I feel uncomfortable calling it a film. It is a general "mumblecore" movie that doesn't have any plot and has a pointless story. Twenty years trying to "Think about it." I tried to give a chance to people muttering. But honestly, it's scary. <br /> <br /> I'm not syncing with the cinema. I appreciate Dogme95's movies. Idioterne is one of my favorite movies of all time. So I don't think the movie was created correctly, as long as there is something (ANY). <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is awesome. (Or is it all temporary?) Direction, but above all, above all else, the camera works vain and simple The camera never had any reason, without stability. I have to admit that being a man I have heard that there are nudity in this movie, so I thought to myself well, although at least it was scary with nudity. (Yes, I know I am a jerk) Thanks to the uber crappy camera that you have never seen anything and what you see, trust me - you don't want to see. This movie makes me want to vomit on many levels. <br /> <br /> The conversation makes me want to vomit. The camera makes me want to vomit. But for the most part, the idea that this film has been praised by some critics Now more than anything makes me want to vomit.
