I'm sorry to report that I have watched this movie many times. When it exploded at the box office, it was repeated every night for about a month on HBO and I watched it over and over again because the TV is generally very bad - or at that time I didn't look anymore, so it might be great now - like Samuel Jackson talking about pigs. "It may taste like sweet potato pie. But I do not know because I will not eat dirty dirty people. "Let's see Dudley as Arthur lost his way in the desert a few steps away from Moses. It came out immediately after Life of Bryan, so you can guess where the inspiration came from. A bit funny, a few pieces are too long until you close your eyes and bite your teeth. There was a scene where Arthur and Dom Deluise met in the desert. They were both dragged and hopelessly dying from thirst. Then they met like old acquaintances who didn't know each other very much, promised to do lunch. It can be a joke. <br /> <br /> But the scene I remember most clearly was meeting Pharaoh, which Pharaoh was a black nomad in King Tutankhamun. He had to read the straight line, because at one point before they let them go beyond his scenes with Hollywood, equivalent to the black light on the street, voiced by Jimmy Walker wannabe. Jimmy Walker - Who knows? Who's the junta? They manage to change a very boring scene into a disdainful, disrespectful class and a very long piece that is one of the legendary things that won't be washed away. No matter how you try it a few times. To deal with <br /> <br /> that is my opinion If you rent this movie (Do not buy it, do what you do!) Prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and a six-pack corona. <br /> <br /> Now they have competed in the Poseiden Adventure. remakes. Maybe they will hire a funny writer this time
