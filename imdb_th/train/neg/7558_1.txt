What you have done is not wasting time. Movies, remakes that do not need to be replicated. Everyone who comes out of the theater has the same opinion. The worst movie I've ever seen Save your time and money !!! <br /> <br /> Nicgolas Cage has cycled down the hill, swimming in the turbid water and rolling down the hill while being attacked by the bee. <br /> <br /> Although A good actor with Ellen Bernstein and Cage. The performance is unbelievable as in the movie. It's amazing that good actors can make bad movies. They don't get a copy of the script first. If you are still interested in watching movies, at least wait for it to come out on DVD.
