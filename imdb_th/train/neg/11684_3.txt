This movie has no reason. There is a hole large enough to drive an enormous NYPD vehicle. Characters do not act in any way possible. I will put my opinion on the discussion board. But save your time and money. It's silly. I couldn't stand it when Hollywood spent millions of dollars on flash bang devices and used fancy editing and cool music and didn't care about having a plot that hung together on a basic level. the best But it's a good thing to see Denzel W. surpassing Man in 3 flavors: Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Capt. Von Trapp. There are even cute little kids with good video games.
