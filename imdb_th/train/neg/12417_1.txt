What movie started with a hand cow that made a woman's calf unable to guarantee much? For the Israeli pattern, while 50 years ago I was there and it wasn't like that. Okay, every Israel has something that is shown in the movie. (For example, children who attack the kitchen at night) But you can't show that all Israelis are full of these things. Each Israelis has his own problems. But almost all Israelis have no problems. Israel's view is excellent. I still remember my children in the Garden of Eden called Emek (Valley). Yes, and the performance is also good, so you will see that not all blacks - just the wrong picture - may have a purpose as well.
