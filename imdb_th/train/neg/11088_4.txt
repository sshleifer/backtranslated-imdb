This is an ok movie. But lacking real depth, whether emotional or in the storytelling story. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real events and this is a limit to the number of actions that are almost impossible br /> Washington believes in bringing But he is sleeping through it, there is no boundary to be flexible, any acting muscles for him or the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> The story falls. Slightly flat, even though he had never heard the ending of the character. But unlike other films about injustice that have no emotional impact, you don't care about him and the inspiration of those outside helps to look like academics. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to inject some emotions by using the children outside who are the idols that worship Carter. But this thing seems to be forced. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that's OK. But immediately forgot.
