This film is worth watching if you enjoy various special effects. There are interesting pictures. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is the average value of a Hollywood Hollywood that doesn't dazzle. There is no real substance with the name. <br /> <br / > It's not worth it to separate the story. That's like brain surgery in dinosaurs. There is not much to start with. There is nothing original and not very special. So don't go through the story. Just watching the effect <br /> <br /> As mentioned, it has a little light at the end, diluting the purity of the wonderful FX treatment of unseen humans. However, if you don't care about "standard" fireworks, it's something you can see. (Or don't see) <br /> <br /> This is a good FX movie that should be worth watching.
