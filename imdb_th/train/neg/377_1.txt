Don't even ask me why I watch this! The only excuse I can make is that I'm sick with bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. :) It's very bad for speech, non-bronchitis movies. Richard Greco is a very disappointing actor as a serial killer who is happy to trigger a shot with the liking of causing the police to fall off the phone. Nick Mancuso is shown as a cop in his path and Nancy Allen. Was able to play a sympathetic role in the entire film The script is sad. There is a clich√©d line that "Are you ready? Parder?" Voiced by Richard Grieco to all his victims.
