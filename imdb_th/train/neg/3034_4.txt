This film has a talented adult star. But did not pay attention in the way that adult movies should have Among all the stars, you can't get kicks from every scene. This film was filmed in a dream like an embarrassing middle-aged scene. The performance is worse than Keanu Reeves. The sex scene is very exciting when listening to your neighbors talking about their children in college. The plot is ten times worse. I will stick to the amateur route. The narration is useless because it is a flick of the skin. But even so, too bad Unless you're a Jenna Jameson fan, here are only a few. 4/10
