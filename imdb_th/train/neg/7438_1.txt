This movie wasted a lot of time. The plot is terrible. The conversation is terrible. <br /> <br /> The performance is ok. But actors do not have a plot or script that must work as well Photography and some special effects are ok too. But again, there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch. There is no logical progression to the story. The story is the most nonsense. It's not scary at all. For scary movies, there must be at least elements of faith. This movie is not reliable. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the movie. Each character is shallow and has no personality. <br /> <br /> Special effects and most make-up are not good. Time with this movie There is a curiosity to see the movie that is totally scary.
