It's incredible! Fidani (whom he is a spiritual cult) is one of the cheapest directors in the world. This movie stole the original name of Leone's "Lollipop Duck!" But tells the boring story of Agent Pinkerton and the murderer "Testa di Ferro" (Gordon Mitchell, an improbable stuntman). Filmed in the beloved landscape of Lazio The story is not good and crazy about the same time. Fidani cannot and ingenuos at the same time. In the story, it happened with some irrational madness. (Such as the conversation in the sheriff's house and the appearance of Butch Cassidy!?!?!?!?!?!?! Terribles famous America, ridiculous, illogical plot, bad performances and The appearance of a priest by Ann Corman, one of the most acclaimed in the story of Renzo Arbora. Of course: Klaus Kinski. Yes, it's great and terrible. But I'm sure he's in it for the money and playing with the iron horse) 2 out of 10 but don't miss !!!!!
