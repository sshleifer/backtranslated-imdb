Facts about National Lampoon Go to see the movie, aka the movie's madness of National Lampoon: <br /> <br /> 1. This movie is bad, even according to the general standards of Lamphun 2. It's not a joke 3. No one goes Movies <br /> <br /> So after I finished watching it, I began to wonder why this world was called 'Lamphun National went to see the movie' and why it was thought up Do less than true It's like calling Austin Powers 'An American Guy to watch a movie' lame. He's not an American, and he's not going to watch movies. The characters in Lamphun, called 'satire', are not funny and no one is watching the movie, which causes minor problems. I hope it will be something in the veins of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it's not <br /> <br /> This is the first National Lampoon movie after Animal House, even if you can't tell from the quality of the movie. Poorly developed, rough and skillfully by any standards. Does it cause headaches? Not a good sign for a 89 minute movie that looks like a double length. <br /> <br /> I noticed the pattern. In general, does a really bad movie be renamed? And this little disaster is under that category It has two separate names - may help try and promote it. It's too stupid to remember that the camera was received from home video critics in 1982/83. I have never heard of this before! Let's rent! 'And then, realizing that:' Hey, wait, this is just Lamphun's national. Go to the movies! '<br /> <br /> It was put on by MGM / UA. Never be released into a movie theater or DVD. It appears occasionally on television a few times a decade, which is the only place where you can find it. <br /> <br /> It's divided into three stories ?? My own parody video, Butter and the cruelty of the organization, and the cruelty of the police / police friend movie (I guess). The first group is the actor Peter Riegert (the animal house) as a frustrated man who is divorced from his wife and Doing other things. I'm not sure what happened because it made me get bored. Until the sex scene emerges. <br /> <br /> Episode 2 is about an exotic dancer who was raped with a butter stick (don't ask) which decided to become the queen of the margarine so that she Can cut the supply of dairy products. Ouch! This is the only comedy line in the movie: 'Only me can love my son!' If you think it sounds not funny, are you right? It's not. And imagine. It's the highlight of this movie. <br /> <br /> The third episode is about the police who chased the serial killer. (Christopher Lloyd) only to make his nerves and shoot men It has one funny scene. But it's beyond reality, right? Only Lloyd shows any humor. Play as his character, arid and sympathetic. As he choked his victim and the police humbled to stand by watching it, at least causing a laugh or two. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see the famous actor Is famous for its low semi-standard level. The writers of each group clearly believe that they are very funny and intelligent by counterfeiting the map called The film's offense became one of the biggest conflicts that favored the standard T&A instead of the storyline. Rough humor instead of sharp conversation Desperate performances instead of inspiration It's easy to see that there are no actors who are attracted to the material, so muttering. They are often shy and almost in contact with the camera. <br /> <br /> The movie isn't as funny as I said before. I laughed. Just once in one line, and even then it was one of the softest laughs. Laughing twice. Laughing. Compared to Movie Madness, there are many comedians who look like normal laugh songs. <br /> <br /> I like the series National Lamphun Holiday (Or at least three quarters) and their traditional animal house Direct bursts of recent videos such as Golf Punks (along with the great cartoons like Tom Arnold) are a good example of why their magazines have been published more than a decade ago. It's really old, fast. <br /> <br /> Sad to see a new movie called Gold Diggers being released with their approval stamp. Is it like condemning a movie before it hits the cinema? Maybe they should not start advertising their names all over the place? <br /> <br /> Distributor: 'This movie is not good. It received the national seal of Lamphun Province. That will teach you not to do anything scary next time. <br /> <br /> Forget the death penalty. Just stick the criminals in the room and make them see it over and over again every day for a month. <br /> <br /> It's terrible that I can't explain the viciousness of it. I give up.
