Hey everyone ... <br /> <br /> There's nothing to say for this movie. The basic plot is a man (Brandon) taking a friend to a hut in the forest to relax on weekends. After a young woman is traveling there, things start to go wrong for them. <br /> <br /> The only story. (Written by the actor who played Brandon, I believe that even though I am wrong here), unbelievable and unreliable and follow it. "Clown Killer" himself is a sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being a mysterious dark hunter But most importantly, we have presented a clumsy orphaned buffalo song that seems to have passed through a life crisis in middle age. The only thing guaranteed to write this comment is the sex scene and whatever is in the movie. (The quality of the movie makes me enjoy from things) <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is below the standard set in all respects. Admitted that I had shared the beer with a close friend when I watched this thing, so we tried to combine the relative entertainment value of the film together so it was fair to mention that SICK only fell Just shy However, in reality (And with the benefit of understanding the problem backwards), scoring one star is a more legitimate score for this film. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of ten
