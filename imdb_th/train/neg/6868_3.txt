Agree to be accepted as an Orthodox woman living in Boro Park. I must be slightly biased with this movie. However, it seems that the only purpose of Boaz Yakin in creating this film is to beat Orthodox. With simple wigs and separate seats, we are already a relatively easy target. Edible pills never make it through the surface. The result is a movie with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia to love him more than GD or parents. Then he deliberately challenged his father's orders that he would not go swimming because of ill health. 2. Sonia turned to her son Bris. Why Hasidic women from Monsey had such a violent reaction? It is hard to believe that she had never attended before. Let's face it, even though the Jewish reforms still have a Brilmall ceremony today. 3. Is Mendel sleeping during his class? He should meet his wife's interest in bed and avoid kissing her on the road. Especially in the heart of Boro Park's busiest street! 4. Sonia and Mendel have to be married for more than a year and now they just notice that they don't have any meaning to each other? A little clue to the marriage that does not mean that the girl must take the first man that her parents set. She will not mind the community if the marriage does not work. 5. If Sonia wants to do a really bad jewelry business, she doesn't have to go through her terrible brother-in-law. There are female doctors, lawyers, lawyers, professors, etc. Sonia is free from sympathy. Instead of controlling her life, she sat back and waited for things to happen and complained that she didn't like the results. That doesn't depend on the environment of people. Swinging Frankly, I think she gets what she deserves.
