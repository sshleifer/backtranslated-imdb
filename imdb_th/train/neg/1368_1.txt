One is the highest rating I received from this movie because it doesn't allow the use of zeros and negative numbers. Pee Yew, the nonsense story of a movie with a wasted b-list performer that works better, written and directed by people with the idea of ​​a twelve year old smirks and giggles that are silly, stupid and funny Poop and fart. For example, the character of Gene Stapelton (The Ding-Bat from All in the Family) tells Marilu Henner's character that she "flings both ways". Sex is a cheap effort with a sense of humor. General weakness Of movies ... you want good Cheeky humor? Rent American Pie Animal House (Part 1 only) Old school or office space
