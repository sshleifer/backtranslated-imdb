In general, I read through this movie. But enough to see this To tell you the truth, it is boring for me and at some point it is not reasonable. The only reason I watched this movie first is to watch CHACE CRAWFORD !!! He's very hot, but in this movie, his hair looks weird, but still hot. <br /> <br /> However, despite how hot the CHACE is, I guess the plot is not bad. But what really makes me understand is the fact that they swear like every sentence. It is difficult to express your anger without saying the word F every time. Insulting is annoying and has a flash of light. The whole body shakes and makes me headache. Found that this movie is boring and amazing That's why I just cut the scene with CHACE in there. Hahaha. Not worth it to rent unless you are a big fan of the members only like you. Oh yes, the actor is hot, hot girls !!! But goodness is the best !!
