The concept of legal gray areas in Love Crimes contributes to the appeal of about 10% of movies; Another 90% can be attributed to the obvious badness. To say that Sean Young's performance as a district lawyer called as a stick is a bad speech With her politeness and extravagant hair gel, Young also performed well to convince the audience of her hatred for men. Why did she ask her only friend to act as a prostitute just so she could catch the police trying to get them? This hatred is the only reason for her to pursue the photographer in the wrong way, which makes women excited and the driving force behind this movie. Watching Young begins from the cold to the full frontal nudity. Increase interest But the anger that she threw by the fire at the lake caused Watching ranting and crazy about sex hatred and irritability makes Love Crimes worth the rent. But all fell from and went there Despite the desire to bring Patrick Bergin's character to justice But her healing skills helped her escape her desire and passion. Patrick Bergin worked as well as a sociologist. If it works in Sleeping With the Enemy, of course hell can work on this issue. But I can't help but wonder if the lack of energy clearly that Young brought to the film conflicts with his slimness or not. I guess it's like that and the result is "Thriller" that is thoroughly excited and still funny
