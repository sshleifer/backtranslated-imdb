This movie is a bit confusing at first. I tend to like Gina Phillips, but this thing I have to say is that it's a bad choice, just like you do a movie around the Rosie ring. That's not a good movie. However, Faye Dunaway is a good person. She crawled out and at the end it was crazy. It's about Jennifer Cassi (Phillips) who came to her twin sister's funeral. She is at the house that her sister owns and grandmother (Dunaway) lives with her aunt Emma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) is sacrificing her relationship to live and as long as she wants to live, she is Can't die Although Jennifer tries to kill her, which she tries to have, there is a strange part in it when the relationship goes to sleep. Gaga eats the organ so it can't sleep, but they do it basically. It's all crazy and Mary A. Allen will not die and her relationship will be buried. But not dying, they have to suffer forever Yes, I hope this helps. If I didn't apologize to love you.
