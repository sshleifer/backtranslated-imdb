As a young pastor, I heard good things about this movie. Then I watched it. The show is not the best. That is forgiveness It's a non-message: Give your life to Jesus and everything will change - you will cope better, catch an amazing stop, stop fumbling, start playing, touchdowns and play-offs. All because Jesus changed the miraculous weak person to become an All-American athlete. I laughed aloud when a coach claimed the scriptures to explain to the players why he missed the goal on the field. But wait, that's not all. You will get a new $ 6,000 truck, and you and your wife fighting infertility will end in pregnancy - twice. You will then win the state championship because God Helping the younger player to take the field far more than he had kicked before 12 yards and not in the wind - all because "God wants him to do". Then you win the championship. State again next year This good thing will not happen if the team does not choose to follow Jesus, will lose all their hearts. <br /> <br /> This is what I took out of the movie: God can do everything he wants. Do it every time he wants to do it - and it's all about making our lives better, easier and more enjoyable. He chose his favorite team and helped them win the game. Which story has this scripture? I would bet that Saint Stephen hoped he would recognize the key to a safe life before he was stoned to death. Some people should make this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles are killed to follow Jesus. It will help them with many problems.
