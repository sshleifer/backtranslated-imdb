I know that the US military morale broke out in 1971, but this movie is unbelievable. It should be a training camp, not an SS battalion punishment. In the novel, Sven Hassell, the author must hate the real army. The sergeant, who is still attacking the shit of those in prison and a useless black sergeant, should also be fired. These people are traveling abroad, the receiving unit will have to wonder where they are from the damage that is not available and the investigation will take place. The scene that is completely sprayed is electricity. Farrell, a lawyer who is accused of being a jailer, must have a coach to issue illegal orders (to torture POWs that are against the Geneva Convention). Just walk After this, training will be reduced to the hospital. I don't know how it will end. I go to bed.
