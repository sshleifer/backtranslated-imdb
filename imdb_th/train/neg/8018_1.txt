Wow, I hate this movie. The topic should result in a really good movie and the lead actor is sensitive and capable enough to handle the topic, but the script - if there is * is * a script - is a mess. This is a movie that is less than a slide show. Random that doesn't go anywhere I will say that it is impossible, except that it is the longest 81 minutes you will ever encounter. As I have already said, the leading actors are good, so Faruza Baulk (SP?) As a compassionate mother The filmmakers have many answers here because this is a mess. Real shame because I really want to like this movie. But in general, it is not the story of a movie that has never been done this way - it's not worth the $ 6 that I spend to pay to watch.
