There is nothing wrong with the little wet fart, the extreme depth of the movie, it's hard to know where to start. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's a horrible horror movie. Even the Amercian standards of dialogue are ancient thoughts, two-dimensional characters, the writing is Ho-Hum and small stories that are not consistent and interesting from a distance. <br /> <br /> We find the next pattern. This: Balding Loser Guy (maybe Deserted, but who knows? This film didn't tell us) with a brave heart, Young Hero (who didn't do anything brave), Brave Little Kid (with a mile of suicide) and Black Bad-Ass Bitch (with These muscles continue to fight with Tall Scary Reaper Man and his evil Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Oh and this movie is full of evil metal spheres when there is a chance. They will perform sudden brain surgery with the person. No mental ability to duck when they BOOH! In fact, one of them was a great demon. (But then again, it might be a deceptive demon) that seemed to help our brave man restore the kidnapped friend. <br /> <br /> No background of the character. Or even introducing any character. It begins with a brief summary of the ending of the previous movie. But it didn't explain much If you've seen the first two movies, well Otherwise, you don't know who these people are, why they don't go to school or work, or why you should pay attention to whether they are alive or dead. So you can't The only point of interest will have any impact on the water splashing and there is not enough to keep you awake. <br /> <br /> The interest and fun that exists is the three stupid Raider Punks. Like the evil that threatens our heroes But they didn't get much screen time They almost immediately Then they were buried. (Why should everyone spend more time than me?) Then they appeared again as demonic zombies zombies. Just to be truly attacked again within a minute. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie seems to contain Caspar the Friendly Ghost that appears and disappears. Drive around to find places and Balding Loser tried to score Bad Black Bitch Booty. Using a pickup truck that would make a teenager with mental retardation, no dice, not even a worthless sex can help this movie. So the good things never /> <br /> my head bad guy <br a tall man can not fool anyone for more than 3 years, the great "Booooy!" Every five minutes is not enough. Why does he have the amazing power of Carrie and the strength of the strange upper body, not just squash our heroes like unexplained insects? He didn't manage to kill anyone before being shot in hell. <br /> <br /> Movie watchers who like masterpieces such as "Friday 13, XXXXVIII: Jason go to college", find entertainment. The rest of us with pubic hair will be bored out of our skull.
