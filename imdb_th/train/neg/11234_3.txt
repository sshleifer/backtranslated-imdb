This movie is not good to be okay on Friday the 13th. This movie is about a killer named Bernie who killed people around the camp counselor training camp.

Intro is seeing Bernie killing his first victim. Then we were introduced to a family that was camping in the same forest shortly after they arrived. They would be joined by a strange old man who likes to talk about his son. Later we learned that his son was Bernie and that he had locked him on the back of the caravan after separating him from the mental institution. He put Bernie by the family so that they could bring their belongings and chase them. <br /> <br /> This film is suitable for those who love Slashers, Grade B 80 only.
