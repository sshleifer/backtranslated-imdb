I never knew that this movie existed until I found my old VHS copy hidden in my dusty horror cabinet. The name on the box says "Insects" and the illustration on the back makes it clear that it is another matter that is insignificant. Of course, they can definitely enjoy, as long as they do not expect the situation to be wise, and as long as you don't get frustrated when you see a huge amount of makeup effects. Every important aspect that makes watching horror movies is lower than the standard "Blue Monkey"! The plot is ridiculous and highly informal. The show is very painful to observe and without doubt. According to the popularity of the popular "Big Buck" movie, "Blue Monkey" deals with new and unknown insects that will eliminate doctors and patients in remote hospitals. Manufacturers can't avoid more about the true origin of this huge critter! What we know is that it does not come from outside the world and begins to crawl out of the tropical plants. In addition, there is no clear explanation of where this new insect comes from! As I said, don't make your hopes a genius screenplay. In the first half of the movie, there was enough entertainment with good blood and the introduction of the insane pair of characters. (Blind and alcoholic girl aged 80 years!) But in the second half Horribly boring In addition, near the end of "Blue Monkey" began to screen movies that are older (and better) exaggerated. Obviously, near the peak, they don't have a budget as well, because the light is getting worse and the men in the demon costumes are no longer disguised. "Blue Monkey" is worth the sneak in case you are really bored. Or if you want to watch horror movies every 80s, B-cinema fans may know John Vernon ("Killer Klowns from the outside world", "Curtain") in Roger's small and meaningless role, responsible for the clinic.
