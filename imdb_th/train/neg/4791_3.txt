* spoliers * Do not read more if you haven't watched this movie. <br /> <br /> The pick-up after the "Phantasm II" fell. The tall man kidnapped Mike while Reggie and the new boy. Tim spent most of the film trying to bring him back and not become a slave in the "red world" of the tall man. This is really stupid: Trio of the three thieves in a bright pink truck is only for relief of cartoons and black karate chick. (Can't remember her name) was annoying. I couldn't wait to see if the tall man killed. Her character This makes it almost seem to be Tim's character who is slow and eventually a hero, but ... it doesn't work like that. At the end of this story, Liz is beheaded by a small dwarf. Mike has a sphere inserted into his skull. The sphere makes Reggie and the dwarfs get Tim and no one left to stop the tall man. The bad guy wins - what is it now for the surprise at the end? <br /> <br /> This was filmed in 1993 and has not yet been published until '95, and the end of this story ends in time. last Disappointing and anti-cancer, it is a suitable and appropriate ending for this weird little series. But the fourth changed this end and added something new but funny, worse and worse and more ridiculous ending. ... <br /> <br /> * 1/2 from ****
