Traditional Clay Rudolph: quite good. Traditional Frosty cartoons: need a little work But maybe worse, but Frosty and Rudolph combined on the fourth day of July? C'mon! Let me take a break !!! This is one of those movies that shouldn't be done. It is terrible. It doesn't go on holidays, especially except on the 4th of July, which makes it especially bad because Frosty and Rudolph are often associated with Christmas. And every movie can be destroyed by singing too much, often songs that make this movie look longer than it really is The movie tries to blend the characters. Chirstmastime Two familiar places with American holiday traditions (Which almost seems "limited" to America) too many pointless songs, outcomes? Bad movies that cannot be viewed at any time of the year I suggest you leave this movie even if you like Frosty and Rudolph.
