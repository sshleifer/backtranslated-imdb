I can't believe it. IMDb has every TV program that men know! I have never seen this program for over 20 years. I only remember two episodes and I can't remember. I remember Tony may not have been at first because the one I remembered was when everyone tried to join Tony. But he denied them But in general at the end of the show, he became a member of Power House with everyone cheering <br /> <br /> The other person I remember is the person who Lolo for some reason pretended to be dead (With funeral and attendants) I can't remember why he died or the show ended
