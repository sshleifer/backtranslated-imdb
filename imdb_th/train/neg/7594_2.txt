From the history of this film director, it's hard to believe that this is a very painful movie. The night before I was in Europe, the premiere and one of the producers was there. He hasn't watched the movie and he is surprised. I haven't read a book that is based on this, or I don't know if it's rated high or admired. But I read "Captain Corelelli's Mandolin" and received the appropriate adaptations for the screen. Just assume that something similar happens here. The performance is not bad, even though there are eyebrows raised from Farrell. Actually, I can't believe how much I will take care of the characters in this movie. The situation plays on the screen in an empty sequence of emptiness. Donald Sutherland consists of a few scenes in which he opens the door, speaks something and closes it again. I watch the clock all the time when I don't talk to the screen. I never go out to watch movies. But I was tempted to start in this period I rate the movie '2' for a reason that looks shy for me. But these are the best things I can say about this movie. The first is that I like the earthquake scene that is too short and the second is Salma Hayek, naked and beautiful. I can say something positive about this movie. Don't ask what dust it can't say!
