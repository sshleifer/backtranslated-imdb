I stopped by BB and picked up 4 zombies to watch the weekend. Now I understand that the effect will be a magical thing. The performances are not digested and the scenes are suspicious. So I didn't expect much. But at least there should be a story The story doesn't cost anything except the time ..... It's obvious that they don't have the same time. <br /> <br /> "Zombie Nation" has 5 zombies that appear near the end of the movie. all Looks like a new wave Pictures of zombies on the cover never appear in the movie. It suffers so much to see and there is nothing to offer. <br /> <br /> Working time is only 81 minutes, but it feels like 2 hours as my wife. (Who will hear this movie since she is on the computer in another room) It sounds like a zombie porn movie .... which if you think it sounds bad but ..... even if it's a good thing > <br /> The only suggestion I can do is that sometimes the writer tries to do too many things and end up with a disordered mess. <br /> <br /> It turns out to be a free rental and I Still feel torn I rate 1 in 10 because IMDb doesn't allow me to use decimal.
