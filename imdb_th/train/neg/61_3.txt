There was no sunshine in "The Sunshine Boys" which made the title of this alleged comedy a ridiculous moment for Neil Simon. Simon, who adapted the script from his plays (Which is not checked) equals the old age with unreasonable behavior - and even worse, clumsy, impulsive, meaning irrational behavior Walter Mattow, we show merciless mercilessly to the older actors who talk to George Burns, a former comedian partner on a special TV program. (It was said that they were a team for 43 years, which asked the question of whether Burns, who received the Academy Award for support, had the misfortune to enter this movie for about thirty minutes. Tua destroyed the material into hell and returned. The louder sound in the movie will be less reliable and can be viewed. The director, Herbert Ross, worked hard when he was not with one of Neil Simon's screenplays. Here, Ross set up a joke like an amateur threw at an opponent who refused to pay. (Eg Matta, the semi-continuous appearance on the mechanic's garage to test TV ads). At this point, Matthau was too young for this role and he compensated by bent and yelling It is up to Ross and Simon to diminish his personality for his emotions. "The Sunshine Boys" is sunny, but Walter still shoots as if we were all deaf. The image looks very drab and crawling at speed. One person lost hope before * 1/2 from ****
