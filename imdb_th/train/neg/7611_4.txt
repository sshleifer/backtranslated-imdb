1st View 2/28/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - DVD version I watched "3 Days of the Condor" - so the CIA drama is full of casual performances for relaxing movies. Evidence of the story revolves around 7 out of 8 members of the CIA research group that were killed by the character of Robert Redford. Name = Condor is the rest. Who killed them and why That's what Redford is trying to find while trying not to be the eighth victim at the same time. On the way he was involved with the character of Faye Dunaway, originally because he wanted a place to hide and eventually she helped him out after a little love. This is one of a number of innocent young men in the running story. But this person has no doubt Flat performances do not help, and the ending performances cannot be sold to viewers as well. Although there are good directors in Sydney, Pollack and the group of classic actors, stories and performances are not what should be, so the movie is not what it should be.
