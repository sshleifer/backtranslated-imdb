Some unrealistic spoiler movies are also included. <br /> <br /> Based on real life experiences, this film still disappointed from the beginning. I am taking a second tour of Iraq to be a soldier. This movie has nothing to happen in real life. From the beginning to the few names: EOD bomb carts began to be screened solo without an escort. EOD staff sergeants of the VBC stole all the time in the ACUs until where I had to call it. Stop with me. 2 dollars copy Haji Night Scene The list will continue. But it is not necessary to list the wrong things that happened with the 2 minutes before things are wrong and the issues are created. <br /> <br /> This movie is for people. And critics of watching without understanding or experience about deployment or military. <br /> <br /> Those with military backgrounds or knowledge The soldiers must be disappointed with the inaccuracies.
