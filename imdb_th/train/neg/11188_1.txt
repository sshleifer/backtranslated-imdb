This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The period I paid 3.50 pounds to see this movie. Incredibly boring, the script is terrible, often uninterrupted, and there are too many scenes that do not seem to be related to the overall movie. (For example, when Heath Ledger's partner was taken to the wall by a ghost ... what was the point In that scene, there is an answer for a favorite postcard ...) <br /> <br /> I should get a medal for this movie because it takes all the time. I want to kick the groin harder than watching this movie again. <br /> <br /> This thing should be thrown into the bottom 100 of IMDb. Hopefully my vote at 1/10 will help. have
