I can't believe that I wasted time watching this garbage! I do because Leonard Maltin scores "AA" and for television movies, this is a reliable indicator for quality entertainment. <br /> <br /> The performance is ok. But anyone who writes should refuse access to any media of communication forever. The plot is ridiculous. The motivation of the "bad people" that are completely absent and the interactions between the families is stupid and shy. "Not because of him "Ignoring foolishness" philosophy, but because he is quite good with fleas ... <br /> <br /> The only message I can gather from this pap is the nuclear family, and the management of other housing is not good. Oh and bad people happen to good people.
