This woman never stopped talking throughout the movie. She memorizes all lines and presents all without having to have a natural mood. She also had a ripple that had never been before and her voice sounded like a nail on a blackboard. This film has too many methods. Betsy Drake and Cary Grant are not enough to bring the rest of the film out on their own.
