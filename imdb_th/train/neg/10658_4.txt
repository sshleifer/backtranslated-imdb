On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose, California), all five of us (Your heart, the three of us who are hardcore Kamal fans) of us have come to a unanimous decision. VV is hard shit and thanks to the movie we're going to make it pretty drunk on Monday. Not to mention, we swear to leave the theater next year. <br /> <br /> I will not blame Kamal here because he is not clear in the latest interview with the cartoonist Madan (on Vijay TV He said something like "Tamizh Cinema'la Photography, Editing'la namba munnera'na maadri Screenplay, Directions, Acting'la innum namba munnera'la" (Tamil movies grow in terms of photography and editing When talking about the movie, direction and performance ") while you are watching the VV, those words are really loud. <br /> <br /> Now, here are 10 reasons to hate this movie: < br /> <br /> 1. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 2. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 3. Harris Jeyaraj I can't help but use swearing here. But in truth, HJ specializes in the ability to wind up in his latest film (remembers 'Anniyan', 'Ghajini') with a shaky sound. He recorded the background music the next time. I have an eardrum transplant. He will pay. <br /> <br> 4. The song doesn't have any songs that will help the movie's narrative go through time and don't make you sit up. Noticing the movie feels like it's done. From Pelham Four music scene with a few scenes. In the meantime, <br /> <br /> 5 is too short to go. VV is the best, suitable to be a short story, not 2 hours, plus "thriller". If you want to use ancient ideas here, like Energizer bunny, it will keep going. Only in this case you do not want The next part of the movie feels like a big deal. <br /> <br /> 6 Kamal-Jothika Pairing two ice cubes that rub together can cause sparks more than matching. There is no reason for you to take root for them to be together. In fact, every time they gather in the second half of the movie, they create frustration towards the lecture. Hate to say this, but Kamalini Mukerjhee's 10-minute adventure is better than what Kamal and Jothika achieved in this movie, along with 'Thenali' <br /> <br /> 7 accents of Kamal Haasan Kamal. Has a formidable accent that no one speaks in India or in the United States And it is not new He has done since 'Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae'. It is exciting. Imagine the damage that occurred when his talent in using this strange accent matches the shooting in places in the United States. He didn't leave it at the immigration division. He offered advice to his people. (Puzzled the TN police from Keeranor, Sathoor and others) innocently. Kamanglish ("We have this is a terrible police pan"). Of course, the result is not satisfactory. <br /> <br /> 8. Logic has a few directors. The person you expect to get the exact level Gautam makes us terrible with a crappy performance in the common sense department, which DCP in his sense will find his love and interest on the road to discuss matters. Such as self-action And life after! The scene in the theater is terrible. We can hear the people behind us challenge the hero's IQ challenge. "He's stupid. He can't use his siren or light." (On the busy Madras road, Kamal-the-cop-on-a-Police-Jeep Will chase men on a bike like a normal person!) "Can't he use his gun?" ("The guy on the bike" starts walking and we have Kamal that is fully focused on seeking Hot for a long time) I didn't vote for support later. But I just tried to explain the emotions inside. <br /> <br /> 9 Blood and violence If I want to see women being raped, their necks are slashed, more women are raped and thrown into the bushes as well. Trustworthy, shocking. I'll sit at home and watch. "Police report" or "Kuttram". Too much violence should go in the way to expand the story, not overcoming it! Where under the Gautum line seems to be confused about the extension. What is the murder (rape, murder) and what is the lead (story)? <br /> <br /> 10 Even the second shot, Espresso cannot escape from the pain.
