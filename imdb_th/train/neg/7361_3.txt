Mr Perlman gave a great performance (as usual). Sadly, he had to fight with some ridiculous and handwritten scripts. <br /> <br /> Sen is in "Die Hard" mode with a tank and muscle Embossed. I am sure that he has done better but is satisfied to make a grimace and groan. <br /> <br /> Lovely Erika is very decorated. (Even if it's fully dressed! Most of the bad CGI and stealing from other movies <br /> <br /> A pitiful shot - worth the A-Team. <br /> <br /> Not worth seeing Perlman - AVOID.
