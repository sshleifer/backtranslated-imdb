I rented the movie tonight because it looked fun. I think you are not wrong with the concept of an ex-girlfriend with super powers. <br /> <br /> ... But this movie is confusing and pointless ... <br /> <br /> Looks like That every time the author threw away the garbage Humor in the bathroom and the sexual situation that only teenage boys will love. <br /> <br /> It seems like it's very easy to draw a story from the superhero hero Fatal Attraction, but I can't guess. <br /> <br /> This is not a romantic comedy that it's advertised. You can't take the child to see it and you will feel embarrassed when you see the day. <br /> <br /> If the author does basic things around the concept and cleansing - the movie may have a chance to fight. br /> waste a lot of time <br /> <br /> B
