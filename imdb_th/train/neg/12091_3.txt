ART Farti of Cannes may like this movie But not me, I'm afraid If you like the type of movie that has been shot for a long time, you wonder if the actor is asleep or the photographer has lunch Most of it is like this with a short stay in the land of discontent. I didn't find it shocking or disturbing other reviewers who were - slightly disgusting and pointless. The only reason I didn't give this star is that the performance is commendable and the film is filmed quite well. The plot, however, has little to suggest. Most of the film shows teaching women who are not happy or listening to the piano, which may attract some people. But fear that you think this thing is not dangerous enough to prepare for pornography and sexual violence to wake you up with a bad taste. Not recommended.
