The most terrifying storytelling of the series. Should not name Battlestar Galactica because it is the only name There are too many changes that will change. You have a character that turns from a man to a black woman as an Asian. "Attract female audience" when having a strong female character that can make it stronger Lost is the feeling of Egypt Lost is a quest for the world. The lack of a cylinder at the terminal refused to let the film go out, especially when someone made a fembot. The original show had lots of cheese But it is large as follows They try to stick to the following things, but don't let the fans work and spit in front of them because they make it. Change is good when they do something better, not to make them better.
