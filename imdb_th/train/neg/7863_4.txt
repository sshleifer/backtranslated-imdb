THHE2 is fun for you to laugh a lot and flatter and may say "Oh sh * t!" And "Put your face away from the goddamn hole that you are mute" or things along those lines. But I don't know if it's worth seeing or not - I'm very annoyed throughout the whole story with a terrifying military character. Knowing the first thing about fighting <br /> <br /> Yes, there is more violence, blood and body that counts higher than the first body. But I still argued that I would cancel my feelings throughout the story. How ridiculous it is (And not a good nonsense like Dead Alive or Feast) My time should be better than watching the Aja remake for the 5th time. <br /> <br /> Try to laugh or go for some blood But don't want to be satisfied
