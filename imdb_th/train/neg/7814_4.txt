After a long period of time in space, look for the remains of the planet Krypton Superman (Brandon Ruth). Superman returns to Earth. He misses Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) who is married and has a son with Richard White. (James Marsden) At the same time, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) plans evil by using the crystals he stole from the fortress of Solidia to create a new land and submerge America's memorable Christopher Reeve or TV shows like "Lois and Clark" (And Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville". Great expectations were created for the return of Superman. In Bryan Singer's version, unfortunately, the horrifying story is too long and boring. There are many unnecessary parts. B Emotional and overrated in IMDb. In addition, the love between Lois Lane and Superman is a shameful thing. A twenty-two-year-old actress, Kate Bosworth, made a mistake by playing as an adult journalist and an experienced mother of five-year-old boy Brandon Routh, two years younger than Tom Welling, who played Clark. Kentt, a teenager in "Smallville", the character of Parker Posey, Kitty Coweski, is a ridiculous caricature, last but not least, and despite Lex Luthor's excellent Kevin Spacey Have She was forty-five years old and older than any other actor. The recurring conclusion seems like opera and terrible. My score is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
