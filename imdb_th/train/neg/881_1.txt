Thanks to some embarrassing home video distributors who brought the independent German series called Four For Venice. But also scary So scary that I had it left at a second-hand shop for extra cash. <br /> <br /> Nick and Charlotte are married couples who have reached a sexual agreement on Tuesday only. Due to their busy schedule, Eva and Louis's career is a couple who live from the hands to the mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and artist Louis. Nick causes Eva to be unemployed as a waitress. Louis and Charlotte have a relationship at the back of Eva and Nick. Louis cheated Eva by lying to her that he would fly out to London to do something related to his art. But the truth is that he is flying to Venice with Charlotte as a holiday shot. Eva kidnaps Nick and drags her two children to Venice to face. The trip to Venice ends. Both Nick and Eva fall in love. <br /> <br /> The presentation of a trip from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva is a show of comedy failures. Still looks scary In this movie, Nick tries to ask for help in many ways. But it is useless Whether it's a stranger around him who acts like a mentally retarded person or just a fool While some problems can be solved with common sense, no one in the movie uses common sense to solve the problem. They want to pass one big round to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> It's terrible. Even the beautiful scenes in Venice fail to draw the film's reputation
