There's nothing worse than renting an Asian movie and getting an American movie experience instead. <br /> <br /> It's just my opinion. But a good thriller depends on creating a clever and cute character. As long as there is a connection, the helpers in Say Yes are strange married couples who do very well. Unfortunately, they are too stupid to believe. Let us count the way they make mistakes by fearing drafts. <br /> <br /> 1 After waving the car, waving, threatening to kill you, please tell him that you are staying at the hotel when you send him out. <br /> <br /> 2 Beat the hell out of drafts in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses, allowing him to attack (Because there is no good reason) that the police bribed him. <br /> <br /> 4 while Escape your woman from the eyes as much as possible to make sure they are kidnapped. <br /> <br /> 5 After receiving help from someone to find a cheat after kidnapping Your wife is sure to send them out as soon as possible so that you can face him face-to-face. No issues that are not fair, right? <br /> <br /> Now, I never expect any person to escape from making a slight mistake under these stressful conditions, but the characters in Say Yes are dense. And made many incredible mistakes that were impossible To allow viewers to take care of their safety because they are victims of their own actions This is killing the enjoyment of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> In the event that you suspect, the script writer doesn't stop with dimly lit characters. They decided to create an unrealistic situation where all the feelings went out of the window. <br /> <br /> 1 Draft, kill the police in the police station? While the protagonist sleeps no more than ten feet, <br /> <br /> 2 The secretly engaged in all kinds of suspicious activities during the day and around many people, but none other than the married couple seems to notice. Seeing his strange behavior Actually, there are some scenes that are directly drawn from the movie. /> <br /> The only differences are <br plus was beheaded near the end, a very brutal scene because it was damaging to his wife. It's too bad that the filmmakers will follow with a stupid end that comes out of the left field. <br /> <br /> Actually, the Koreans behind the saying yes should be ashamed of themselves. Better yet, they should move to California and find work with people who make movies with no regard for quality and intelligence.
