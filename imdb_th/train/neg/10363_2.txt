I grew up with stories about the wrinkles of time in the chronicles. My dream is that one day, the screenwriter will find their children sitting on a large sofa, reading a book about A Winkle in Time and thinking about what this movie will create Sadly enough that the screenwriter failed to change the character, throw funny humor and destroy the plan. I know it's a difficult task to change a popular novel into a movie. But why don't you hold on to this book? Why do you have to change the way you think and act? For those of you who haven't read the book, pick it up and find a soft sofa and let your imagination go forward.
