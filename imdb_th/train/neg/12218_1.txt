Very bad. Very bad as a friend who wishes to do in or at least inhale the banquet table in the movie series. I think it is difficult to criticize independent lawyers who have received all kinds of movies. However, this movie ... Oh, my dear. <br /> <br /> Awareness of Frightworld doesn't require anything more than rude exploitation. (Something that has honor in itself) and trying to make it to the standards that are more important is wrong and for justice it is more fun to say - Cuba Red Zone ... but not so much so I Will not try to criticize, just ask me to leave some observations Hire three men to be sure If at least one person knows how to use the device Then ... <br /> <br /> 4) There are many talented video technicians in the Buffalo / Rochester area, most of which you can rent cheaply. Find someone who knows how to set the scene. <br /> <br /> 5) Just because you have people who know how to use After Effects and other good programs doesn't mean that they should do that every two seconds. <br /> 6) The glory that makes girls have to take off their tops But the next time, pick up the girls that the tops that we want to remove. <br /> <br /> 7) Editing should help tell the story or set the mood. Suddenly the chain that appeared in the character's belly was not scary. But it was sloppy. <br /> <br /> Some good things. All performances are not bad. Jack is quite good and I like acid when she starts fighting. Have a picture Unfortunately, it was thrown on the screen without touching or there was a reason "Acid Poptart" is a name that deserves a better movie. I like Frightworld's moxie. Under their belts, I hope everyone will be ambitious with what is better than Colman Francis, at least Ed Wood.
