I saw the original "Chorus Line" on Broadway. God knew how many times and felt the passion, hopelessness and happiness from the live theater experience. Michael Bennett knew he had to imagine "Chorus" again for screen But can't find a way to do it If the man that comes with the show is stumped - that should answer your question There are some programs that have been created for live viewing by the audience. However, Richard Attenborough has a new song "Ghandi" and dance with animals in "Doctor Doolittle". Similar to the stage performance With adding awesome music (Surprise! Surprise!) Great music has been left or given to other characters (which are not reasonable). Michael Douglas is not correct. Those who can't dance can try to show and have sexy "Landers" women who don't. Can sing, dance, or dance - I think she's just a wife of Ghandi. The dance by Jeffrey Dayton seems nothing more than a schlock from "Flashdance". Rejected and nothing works. I was stunned that there was something sensational and emotional enough to drain away. If you truly love this show and will return to Broadway in 2006, try it, but don't think that the long-running musical work called "A Chorus Line" is involved in this movie.
