I picked up this DVD at the Dollar Store. The DVD is on the 2nd floor for $ 1. But since Michael Madsen is there, I think that since I never saw the movie, I bought it anyway. <br /> <br /> I have to say That I did not like to watch movies, this movie plays like a documentary or advertising for religion more than anything else I found that using the director's past events did not add to the story for me. I want to watch the story in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I will not leave it like other critics, but maybe for a moment before I consider watching this movie again. > <br /> Who knows because it's the first movie of Michael Madsen? Maybe it will be worth the archives in the future.
