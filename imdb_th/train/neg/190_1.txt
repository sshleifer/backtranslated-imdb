I always feel that a good movie should have a story. This movie is missing one story and I feel it will be more effective with the story. This story is even worse than the fact that it seems to continue forever; Finally I want to finish However, I just noticed that it only took 123 minutes to feel like four hours, not only without the story. But still lacking notable conflicts It's not the worst movie I've ever seen. But I used to say that it was until I saw "The Fast And The Furious", so do not think that this review came from someone who doesn't want anything but action. Today I hate most action movies. It's just that this movie is going on the other way around the spectrum. There's nothing actually happening in this movie. However, the scenery and costumes are good.
