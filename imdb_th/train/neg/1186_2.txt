Walerian Borowczyks La Bete (1975) apparently received in different ways: Some people were shocked. Some people were shocked. Others admired courage. But I was not touched until I was bored and could not stop asking myself why the discrete and inconspicuous performances that had orbit around the theme of the theme were a wise journey. <br /> <br /> What is this movie about? Sexual growth in women? I've seen great movies on this subject. But this is not one of them One can try to draw an increased sexual image in a girl without a little trying to explain her appearance as a person not only But is a story telling device that will dream (In the nude) of the beast in a place where there are no letters, no character education Women who were harassed by the beast were not teenagers, young women who had sex with black butlers. (Does he look like a beast?) There are more attitudes towards sex. Is it a movie about religion? If yes, we need content that is more important than the priest who does not have the function, character and talent. But with a strong desire for two boys <br /> <br /> is it about wildlife? The comparative sense of the film prohibits physical examination that is true, especially when realistic monitoring requires realistic characters. So there is no real nature here. Some mythical creatures and two priests talk about the sin of wild animals. Enough for the college essay on the topic? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Is it about sex? About what I don't know, I know that shooting a gun doesn't make the movie a war movie. Managing the topic must be more meaningful than expressing your own relationship with the theme. <br /> <br /> So overlook the dispute. Don't be afraid of arrogance, nude pictures, ejaculation, self help and things I don't. Watch it when you look at other stories and you may discover that this is a work that is not good, bad, bad, bad. (Okay, some pictures are quite good and the main characters are women who look really good). The obsession of the director's brain that thinks dancing around the bush in a hypnotic manner slowly makes the story The rose does not make it boring.
