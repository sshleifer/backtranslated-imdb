Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain. He is a bad actor who makes you feel uncomfortable ... very embarrassing. Nacho has done television commercials. I can remember one of which Nacho is looking for Paul Mc Carney around Madrid (the advertisement is about the CD collection. Mc Carney's) <br /> <br /> This little movie is like Nacho's ads: the story is not good, bad governance and terrible performances. I can't believe that this disgusting movie in the Kodak Oscar Theater is bad ... <br /> <br /> Nacho can make this movie because his wife, the filmmaker This story 7:35, which is a woman who has a good relationship with the Spanish television business.
