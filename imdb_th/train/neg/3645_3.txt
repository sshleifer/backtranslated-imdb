A young man had bad hair on the hill and fell into a place where he could not escape. He then met MR ATLAS "Legendary" friend 2,000 years ago as his best friend and Arnold Schwarzenegger. That looks and sounds the same His strength of Hercules helps children escape from danger and adapt to modern life. So what's the big deal? This is the worst idea for "family" outing! No matter which method, this should not be tried at all! Our characters in the matter of strength and power are nothing more than ordinary strangers that appear throughout the universe. To add insult is to have no new or attractive thing, and before you know that there is a violent effort that is not considered to be a "family" entertainment. Shaky Just spend a nice and quiet afternoon in the garden for change.
