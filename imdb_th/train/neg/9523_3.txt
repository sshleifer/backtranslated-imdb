The story of this movie is not strong at all. If you approach it as a car movie, it's not bad. Many excellent cars in this one. The reason I like it is because I came from this filming area. I get the most enjoyment of seeing places that are known in St. Cloud MN and see how the city has changed since 89. It is an interesting historical story for our local people. It seems that every time a movie is created here everyone needs a relationship with it. It is impossible to find a copy in any local video store because they are all stolen when it comes out on the VHS. Having received a copy from Japan on eBay, I think it's interesting that the path of the race is dragged around. city I don't know that the director came from St.Cloud.
