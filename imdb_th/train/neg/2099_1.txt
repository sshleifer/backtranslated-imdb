Warning: possible spoilers (Not that you should be interested. In addition, sorry for the capitalization) <br /> <br /> Begin with unnecessary unnecessary sounds which are even more annoying for nonsense. <br /> <br /> We know that space travel is a risky organization. There are complex systems that have high possibilities for malfunction, radiation, stress-related symptoms, etc. and unexpected things occur in most unknown environments. They know that things can be wrong. In fact, something went wrong. It's called true learning that Appollo 11 is not safe according to today's standards and has many political pressures. But the overall performance of the technology in that mission is impressive. <br /> <br /> Different errors / comments I didn't look up: <br /> <br /> 1) Nixon prepares words. Say in case something is wrong. Uh, that's what I will do. It is the highest point of the propaganda war after all. <br /> <br /> 2) NASA gives green light despite the fact that Appollo 11 might explode (this is "implicit" only). Yes, that's the reason they give. People and real-time viewing <br /> <br /> 3) Driving capsules is not working. As if it were not working when the chimpanzee was there Who survived? It was a test shot and the capsule exploded, accelerating and landing with a parachute. There are videos of it. You may find it on youtube or at least looking for somewhere. <br /> <br /> 4) One interviewed man said that the explosion would erase Florida's justice. I can assume that it is meant to be a hyperbole, because if not, I just fear how misunderstood he is. <br /> <br /> 5) The technology is original compared to today's standards. In fact, traditional software and hardware have been used to this day for the reason that it must not fail. It's worse for a spacecraft because their computers must be built from fairly large components that are not sensitive to radiation. (And the craft itself must be able to drive on its own, so complex steering systems like B2 won't do). What they use is "TV screen" instead of "computer screen"? It's the same technology. In fact, the TV monitor is built and has a higher resolution. <br /> <br /> 6) "If the object is not part of the rocket, it may be just one thing." We see that this happens. Where? In addition to the fact that the statement is wrong, who says it is not a rocket? At least the interviewer understands that if anything is flying and you don't know what it is, it is a definition of an unidentified flying object. <br /> <br /> 7) Voice and error. Something makes It looks like the lander foil sheet is the real hull. Which will make it thinner than the space suit. <br /> <br /> 8) Neil Armstrong's death is nearing the moment of training as an image that I can admire; I've never seen it before As I have already said, any clear technology can be wrong, especially if it is not adequately tested because of the well-being. You know, unprecedented. <br /> <br /> 9) The difference in the way of children Abnormalities in the density of the moon) are not fatal "The fuel left for fifteen seconds" which in reality "Fuel left for fifteen seconds before canceling the mission and returning to the command unit." <br /> <br /> 10) A "Disastrous chain of events. "Often resulting in a disaster I don't know how to make it easier. However, this is an important example of the rhetoric used. <br /> <br /> 11) There is a short sequence of astronauts walking and jumping around aimlessly like a happy child, followed by a voice telling us. That the cause of this strange behavior "can be revealed". It turns out that he is walking and jumping around aimlessly like a child who is happy, hilarious. <br /> <br /> 12) It is said that During the new entry, all contacts will disappear. This is a perfect natural phenomenon and is well known at that time because it is impossible to avoid with contemporary technology. Again, the gravity of this thing is implied, but very deliberately. <br /> <br /> 13) There are no shuttle wandering in space, while the voice shows "truth". This is evidence that Appollo 11 is a division. Shit Appollo 13 is near losing But the two real disasters occurred during the flight and back again, respectively. In any case, the comparison of the space shuttle with the Saturn rocket is ... It's okay, just plain stupid. The successful space shuttle mission doesn't seem to get the attention of the audience. > <br /> 14) What happens to UFOs? Even in the context of the movie, it is unreasonable. Besides that you think it was created for entertainment aimed at a specific audience. (Which seems to include those next to not understanding history, science or rhetoric) <br /> <br /> even the point of the movie Quite vague Catchable phrases such as "Concealed to the present", "First public disclosure", happened, but this film is not to blame or offer lessons or whatever, which may be expected that this film will create emotions. There is a lot of interview pictures and parts that are not always in the context or with people we don't know anything about. "NASA scientist" Wow, so astronauts are so excited before trying? Thinking that this is related to the movie's point again? Oh yes, which point is it? <br /> <br /> In summary, in addition to inaccuracies, deliberations or inaccuracies And believe me I am a person who likes to watch crappy movies This movie is not funny, witty, strange, it's nothing.
