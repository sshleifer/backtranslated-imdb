Well, AWFUL is just the first name. This film is a piece of ancient thought. High school in military training camp I'm sorry. I have to give this 1 star, which is unreasonable. <br /> <br /> This may have a spoiler: <br /> <br /> Everything about being completely forced, unbelievable and unrealistic. HEPO (military police) will not come to you if you do not show, especially on the wedding day. The actor is quite embarrassed in this scene because the scene is not effective because it is unlikely. You can feel in their voice. Although they are not bad performers But they can't help the scene. <br /> <br /> Next, men have to exercise in the wedding dress. No time for him to wear a uniform first Man, this is a great movie! I will remember this scene all my life. <br /> <br /> There are also girls in the camp - exciting - one of them, even a model. But didn't look that good - and the worst actress I ever saw I wondered in Hollywood that they would let her say one sentence in the movie B. <br /> <br /> Okay, women in the army! Is now fun Girls are still in the same class so we can go to the room at night! In fact, they will be placed in different buildings one and a half miles apart by two fences with barbed wire. <br /> <br /> There is a service tank that we can use for a fun ride. In the free time that we have many No, the tank doesn't lock and put the key. No one noticed the engine noise, especially at night. <br /> <br /> There are many sex scenes and references. We need these things, so the Germans who are sexually obsessed will like movies as well. Switzerland is too small for the market for documentary films. Very well done. <br /> <br /> There is a sex scene in the kitchen. Of course, none of those facilities are locked. The military routines are as messy as they can find. <br /> <br /> At the end of the flap, the Mafia hit a man about revenge on the poor who tried to shoot him. Because he abandoned his fianc√©! Sure, I bought it. The Italians are like that - envy. (No) <br /> <br /> The bad guys try to do this during the daytime with two dozen witnesses. Not at night in the dark alley Again, military training area (Which is fired with live ammunition) is open to all people to be able to drive or walk freely Nothing is a guard or fence. <br /> <br /> That action is prevented by a good captain in time to launch a rocket into an Italian car. The explosion caused the hit and fiery fiancee No one was injured in the 40-foot distance when the car was blown to the smelter. It's a joke. Remember, <br /> <br /> Okay. It's a joke that I received and I can live with it. No need to use realism. The filmmakers can use this method easily with it if it is funny, funny or fun, interesting, challenging. It's a shame that it's not those things. It's embarrassing. Torn from an idiotic American comedian. At least do it professionally without amateur actors. <br /> <br /> It's quite boring and predictable without wasting time and energy.
