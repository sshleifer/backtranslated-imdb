This movie is very scary. I swear that they will not write the script. But they just winged it throughout the movie. The annoying Ice-T like hell. * Phht spoilers like no reason to watch it. * They sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. The ground is difficult to follow without using a dog and when the ICE-T is on that hill and uses the Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN like a rifle. (Then cut the tree with eight eight shells? And the hand gun is considered incorrect at 100 yards and they see the reflection What is reflective? I don't see the scope of that. In addition, when he was shot in the stomach and continued to walk, that was the way to make him lose blood there. Plus the ending that he put stones or cigarettes in them It will not explode and kill him. The ammunition will continue to fire. Kill Ice T but cause the tank to muddle.
