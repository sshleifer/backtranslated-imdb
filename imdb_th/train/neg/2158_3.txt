I can clearly see why Robin Hood fell quickly. At first, perhaps the worst thing that the BBC ever broadcast, the opening scene was violent, meaningful and intelligent, like fighting with two monkeys. Robin Hood had no character and the sword fight was ridiculous. The worst part of this episode is Robin Hood snogging some cows at the beginning of the episode - how many people wear eyeliner in the 12th century? No one series may have developed much since then. But at first this caused the hopes of the people to fall quickly and be a pile of cr * p. Great British heroes were dignified. <br /> <br /> "Can you endure?" I won't do that. Unless the BBC begins to understand what a wise investment is. 3/10
