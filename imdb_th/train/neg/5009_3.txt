This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. This plot is not reasonable and the performance is terrible. I'm a big fan of Amber Benson. I think she's always a great actor. I can't imagine why she decided to make this movie. Her character Piper almost screwed up the entire movie, except the opening scene. On the plus side, there are many points in the movie that the performance is very bad. Actually, I laughed out loud, but even then I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone It's only 80 minutes long, but that's 80 minutes in your life that you have to waste.
