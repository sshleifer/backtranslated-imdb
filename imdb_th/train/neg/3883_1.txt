Not just kidding. It was so scary. <br /> <br /> I watched sci-fi stations in my area last night playing movies every night on a monthly basis. This month is "Turkeys Space or: I learned to stop. Worry and love exploding "The movie is terrible. They shouldn't do it. This is a good choice. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is very scary, with two exceptions: makeup. (Which shows potential) and corrections (which came out slightly in the rest of the movie in Terms of horror) The performance is terrible. Scary dialogue. It's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> Consists of two special effects, a blood pattern and a stock area. I will focus on blood. Watching this movie, I thought to myself that "What is the inspiration for creating this movie?" People like to do certain things. But I hesitate to think that anything good may happen for everyone involved I concluded that this movie was created as a way to add Demo Reel to his make-up effects (Rick Baker) to a pretty career. He worked with STAR WARS (1977), KING KONG (1976 ), Men in Black (1996), and even the contraction of unbelievable women (1981) plus the number of other notable flicks. In addition, I can't say that I have ever seen people who are actually living dissolved. - Unbelievable or otherwise - but I have to say This is a fair representation of one person. <br /> <br Now, when I think of a bad correction, I often think of the scene where people talk on the phone and in the middle of the scene, the phone jumps down to the shoulder. His or something like that This film serves to emphasize the fact that bad editing can have many forms. The scene is too long and extremely useless. Every scene dragged too long to be from the background to the screaming scene that was so crazy with Cleaver Girl and the head cut down in the river, the head was thrown into the river. (In Slow Motion) This movie continues for a few minutes and then we cut back to the floating head and see the waterfall falling. While I'm sure they are all proud of their cut heads. Finally, what the hell. <br /> <br /> In the end I will talk about fat women running / slow motion scenes near the beginning. The slow motion image jerks, telling me that they did not shoot scenes in slow motion. Originally decided that "Do not work like that" and then slow down. Oy vey in any case, if you've seen other movies that the fat woman hysterically went to the hall and then passed through closed glass doors - all in a slow motion. You can remember - the molten ones that are incredible for * this is everything. Started. <br /> <br /> This kind of movie looks best at home with this friend. Slowly, most of the time. But that is just more time to come up with one of your own torpedoes. It's not the worst of the worst. But it's bad, bad
