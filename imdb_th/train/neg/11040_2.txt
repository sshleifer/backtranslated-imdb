You have to watch this show once to see all the recipes are the same every time. Jim did what he did well. But he made his wife feel bad. Finally, she found out that what he actually did was her. She smeared his cheek. In fact, the story is weak and is a formula that I will enter once. <br /> <br /> Episode 'Valentines Pay' <br /> <br /> Now, Jim's wife noticed that every Jim Week The payment was lost. Then he explained to him that he had lost it to the casino. She screamed and left the house, lamenting how scary he was. Then, on Valentine's Day, he went on a limousine with tickets to the ball. (By explaining the lost wages) She realized the mistake of 'Her' and 'Oh Jim. Normally, you are really cute.' At the end <br /> <br /> Another very clear thing is the truth. That Jim's character is based on Homer Simpson, a cartoon character, able to escape from war and not knowing when it tries with humans Not working and Jim has just become a self-centered person. <br /> <br /> IMO The only reason for success is just because we now have a lot of human beings who have a TV today. About the wall guy and you accept the audience. <br /> <br /> 'Two and a half men' are wonderful and hilarious.
