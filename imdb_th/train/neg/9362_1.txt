The plot sounds like a contract. To be honest, I didn't watch the whole movie. After about an hour in the movie, I have to decide. This film is worth watching or not until the conclusion. The answer is unclear! Not the fact that the human body cannot receive transplantation from other species without denying Or the evidence that he was chased by a secret government officer for human / wolf transplantation When he ran to the zoo with a dog pack and left them in front of the zoo door, saying "If you can't run with a big dog, don't leave the balcony," still running through the bored heart. Save yourself time and skip this movie I can guarantee that if you dare to watch, you will sit idly while I wonder why everyone loses money, time, energy, and attempts to make this disdain for the American cinema.
