First of all, this is a movie with a low budget, so my expectations are so incredibly low. I think most people are looking at the information for this movie. Need pure blood and that's all it is <br /> <br /> Plot? Not really In general, Saw but in China and hell is very bad. Cast? No special technical timing? Very scary in my thoughts ... There are cutaways and blood. It's completely unbelievable because of the amount of water splashing, color, texture, etc. <br /> <br /> I believe that the purpose of this film should be The movie is a brutal shock. Now it has great potential at a higher price. But the script is not good, bad conversations, horrible performances, what looks like video footage of the camcorder and "gore" that is totally unbelievable The movie is worth getting some opportunities to review. Even the "b-rate" movie deserves an opportunity. (For example, the blood marks are the latest that I see when compared to worth reviews) but this is terrible. I hope people who consider this movie read my opinions and decide on this. <br /> <br /> All of us are merciless and shocked. But unrealistic overall images and truly terrifying performances save time / money and there are other opportunities you won't be disappointed
