This is a terrible movie and there are no scenes that have true emotions. The characters are not drawn, drawn out, clearly predictable, and the story is clear and true as Hollywood wants. <br /> <br /> William Holden (Very sad to see him in this chapter) was 55 when this movie was created He played with someone in the early 1940s and it seemed that he was 60 years old. Kay Lenz was 20 years old and was scripted to find that he had an irresistible charm. I think the dogs that they find on the road are more sexy and alive than the sexual connection. <br /> <br /> Holden's character - the age of Clint Eastwood when he directed this movie (not) Coincidentally - placed with the clear jewelry of the 60's. Great hippies: bachelor, hi-fi, swinging, lunch at Yamashiro. Antilock fog old free spirit who wishes they saw the sunsets and the Laurel Canyon to find them and large cars /> <br /> sexy youth culture never <br despair. And I trembled to think that Bill Holden was a very hopeless boy whom he had received this shameful part
