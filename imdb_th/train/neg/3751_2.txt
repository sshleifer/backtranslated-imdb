I'm a big fan of David Lynch. However, this movie is a rather disappointing experience. Besides the background music? Which determines the mood of this film ?? It lacks almost all the qualities that I have involved in Lynch's work. The boring pictures, the least talked about and the conversation is vague and the only sound that will be interesting Awkward, trying to make arty dogma movies more than the work of experienced directors. I've seen many amateur movies that have superior camera, landscape, sound and script. This film lacks almost all artistic qualities. I felt as if I was watching one of the home videos Davids produced during a weekend trip with some friends.
