If my grandmother made a movie, they should have done a lot better ... very bad ... The main character (mother, father and son) is ok, especially the mother that she is a good actor and the child proves. To be seen as a good person, especially in the scene that he should be scary But the director does not know the meaning of the plot, plotter and script. The script does not develop an atmosphere that will become suspicious. If you like being chased from a tree, you may enjoy it. Otherwise, stay home and sleep. Oh ... Actually, there's something funny: a movie from 2001, but we can't understand because the picture is not. Good (such as mini-dv) and older cars (such as 70 and 80)
