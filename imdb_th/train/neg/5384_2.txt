All Hype! Is there a better way to lecture movies about people who are upset because they can't publish their movies through the main distributors? So they do it themselves Otherwise, the advertisement of this film does not adjust the content in the movie. The story is missing and can be easily short-lived. The performance is not good, but the animation and music are quite good. Otherwise, don't waste time - don't believe advertising! However, if you have the opportunity to watch free movies, do so. Then you won't have to waste money. Even so, the filmmakers acted well to press their stories and create excitement with their own mini-series. Otherwise, they will receive a miracle that has never been popular.
