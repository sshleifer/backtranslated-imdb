I'm really surprised that this movie has been rated like this! I have not seen bad movies for many years and this is a really bad movie. Not enough splashing to explain unnecessary blood scenes (almost funny). If you don't like Hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007), this story reminds me of RL Stine goosebumps! <br /> <br /> I can't. Can tell about the performance because the script is very bad all the time (why do I have to write 10lines? I never understand this) <br /> <br /> == Here, spoilers come == <br /> <br /> A story about a butcher who kills people all the time in the subway. We are talking about killing thousands of times and not being noticed. In fact, those people just disappeared. And there are good people who try to solve the mystery (Because there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning that bad people) and as usual, nobody believes him! Surprisingly! He eventually wears flesh clothes and fights with the murderer!
