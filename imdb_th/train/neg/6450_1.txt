This movie is very scary. I feel sorry for the actors involved in this project because I'm sure they didn't write their script. Which is sometimes sent with a little friction, which makes me believe that they did not make this movie seriously and that no one can watch this terrifying movie while watching "unknown creatures" I can't help but think that there are not many budgets or talented writers in the team. But if you watch this story to laugh, you will be happy. This movie is unscrupulous to mock yourself because I can't see who can see this and proud to be pumped directly to DVD. Horror movies fight for light
