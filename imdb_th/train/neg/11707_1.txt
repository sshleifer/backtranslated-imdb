This year 2003, made for television movies, was shown in the natural women's channel. Why am I trying to see this too? I don't know, but I should check my head. And the director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed to give him injustice as he did He uses the strength and confidence that men have for many dull women who make him bored. The first is Joyce Hyser. As a wife, I can't wait to release her. Her revenge is stupid and silly and very confusing in most movies. Another evil woman is Nichole Hiltz, about the coldest person you want to meet. Her appearance does not guarantee that our conductors will go to raise monkeys with her and her performance is so clear that only the fool will miss the loser. Tembi Locke is quite good. But slowly, in the face of being sucked up with the body, she tempted her husband to play again as a man who was a loser by David DeLuise. But scared at our hero Stephen Jenkins as our hero or should I say that the victim is not good At first I thought he was just a bad actor. But later I believe He never received a part from the ground and repeatedly Although as a man I became angry when two women fled with it. Men watch out for this channel that makes men frustrated and women escape even in the LMN murder as a careful channel. Note: When watching this for the second time inadvertently, I believe in my initial thoughts. Especially with writer / director Simon Gornick. I still believe that he has dignity, male species and should be whipping horses. Only the elegance in this film is Tembi Locke, who has no chance to show her talent with Jenkins' horrifying performance. Plus a stupid plot that only gets worse Go down with Gornick's movie and his free star in it. Please LMN. Don't have to repeat this again.
