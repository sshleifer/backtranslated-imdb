They are difficult to manage. When the party continues (And alcohol consumption) The more revealing secrets and conflicts arise ... <br /> <br /> Comments: The work of new writers / directors is disappointing. Watch this movie to follow in the same song that Swedish comedian has been following for many years. There are no new elements or concepts. The film is divided into three basic areas. 1) Humorous humor depends on the character that makes himself stupid. 2) Grief and 3) Concern. This movement focuses almost on the last point. Will forget the first point while the movie proceeds Although there is no loss due to humor that is not funny I think the performances from the actors are good, although it will disappear from the pain and forget soon. I hope to have new ideas and influences, but none. To conclude that there is a better way to spend more time with someone than watching this thing. <br /> <br /> 3/10
