Ok, I have tried and tried. But I won't get this thing. Maddin Tales guy from Gimli Hospital makes me cold. The movie about the Austrians and people about Ice Nymph is beautiful but lacking in the department ... and this film is about Abortion and hockey are boring. I'm glad that Maddin appreciated the silent movie. But I don't like his movies for the same reason that I don't like Quentin Tarantino's movies: they're empty with better movies and more imaginative - movies that develop art forms or break new ground - and have style and without substance. The number of skips and strange camera angles couldn't conceal the fact that Maddin was a native of David Lynch Wannabe, although he had an advantage over Tarantino: in general, he didn't write embarrassing conversations because of his most movies. Based on the description The bottom line is that Maddin's schtick is a smart movie creation for the film majoring.
