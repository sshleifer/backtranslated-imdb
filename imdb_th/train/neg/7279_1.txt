I just saw this film on a local TV station ("Big Chuck and Little John" of TV8 in Cleveland, Ohio). I have never heard of this before and decided to watch. <br /> <br /> I know there is no Thesaurus That can be close to helping me to explain how bad this movie is The script is terrible. Performances other than one of the two exceptions are pointless because there is nothing in this content that has actually been tried. <br /> <br /> Looks like a little thought left from a wide variety of writing. That was thrown into the blender It is not just a joke. The "parody" is the best. Some references are almost outdated. (Even at the time of release) It is not surprising that I have never heard of it before. It's worse than anything on Saturday night, live MAD TV or even the color of In Living on the worst day. <br /> <br /> If you see it on TV Is a good example of not creating a movie No matter what you do, <br /> <br /> Adam
