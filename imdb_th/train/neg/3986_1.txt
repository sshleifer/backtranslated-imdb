When I talked about Malice as a noir movie, I didn't compare it to masterpieces such as Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon or I compared director Becker with Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel. Protest against the darkness that expands the film from beginning to end to the extent that you cannot tell what has happened I can understand the darkness in the night scene. But this movie is dark even in the daytime because I understand what the cause is. However, it doesn't make much difference if director Becker filmed in the dark.
