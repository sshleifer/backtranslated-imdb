The story is rocky. The show is just south of the junior high school. The movie was not bad. But it looks like it was cut with a machete I can't decide if this is a flick, flick, intentionally, or if the person behind it thinks they are making a good movie. Think of Death Valley Days with Mayberry RFD. People run around in the modern city. 'Lawless' by wearing a 6-cylinder rig. It has more than a fair share of 'harrowing' things. Imagine a good person pulling up at an old farmhouse and parking a Ford Mustang in front of the train. Imagine the staff in the hotel watching western movies (hemispheres) that are obvious along with the Japanese soundtrack. It's really weird, but may be improved if viewed while participating in a little peyote. It's a curiosity. See true, with modern ideas for all the ancient ideas of western movies that you can think of. There is even a modern girl in a great dance hall and there is also a Jewish harp in the soundtrack! If someone brings this thing to your home to watch a movie on Saturday night, tell them that your DVD player has died.
