The only reason "The Norliss Tapes" deserves any stars is the presence of Angie Dickinson in casting. In addition to seeing Angie Baby in the previous performance, "Police Woman" Nothing seems to be here. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: <br /> <br /> Slight spoiler ** * <br /> <br /> David Norliss tapped to write a book about supernatural things One day, he mysteriously disappeared after speaking with the publisher's phone and said he had found something that caused him to be in serious danger. The whole set of this victimized pilot was written, apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks through "Norliss tapes" - a set of audio tapes that the writer recorded while investigating a supernatural case. <br /> <br /> When a wealthy sculptor pilot died - but not before buying an ancient Egyptian scarab ring from a local superstar who confirmed to him that the boy would make him Immortal after death Soon we will discover the ring itself does not give immortality. But it made the corpse of the sculptor only save him from his grave so that he could run around the city to drain the beautiful blood-filled girls. <br /> <br /> Color faces Sky, yellow eyes and roaring Never heard since you watched the cartoon "Scooby Doo". Last time, the sculptor attacked his wife (Dickinson) one dark night. She escaped and contacted Norliss for help in solving the mystery behind the mysterious appearance of the late husband in her land. <br /> <br /> Are you a vampire? No, no vampires in this story, even if you read or hear. The sculptor didn't drink the blood of the victim - how did he keep it? Don't know. We see him attack. Never gather. Why? To fill the second part of his bid for immortality It turns out that the sculptor will be allowed to remain forever if he creates a real-life statue of a demon named Sargoth from a mixture of clay and human blood. When finished, Sargoth plans to rely on the statue as a gateway to our world. <br /> <br /> Final analysis: <br /> <br /> "The Norliss Tapes" didn't pick up. Is a series for a very good reason ... It is rubbish like you see from my conclusion. The story is messy. The performances and conversations were no better than this. This is not a competitor for the award. "So Bad It Good" Sometimes it's bad. <br /> <br /> After hearing many loud, loud noises for years about the great advantages of "The Norliss Tapes", I was so excited that Found that it aired on Fox Movie on 10/15/03. I hope I will not set myself for the fall. <br /> <br /> When I received my first lament Last day I was able to accept The applause that you have heard from inspectors IMDB others are from people who are reviewed by the dim memories and nostalgia of youth. Or maybe they are a big fan of Dan Curtis. In any way, they offer misleading reviews about "The Norliss Tapes". <br /> <br /> Polly Orchid - 17 October 2003
