I remember when this junk came out, every newspaper complained that it took years to create the movie Barbra Streisand. It didn't take years. The play will be opened only in 1975, eight years earlier. It is the Broadway star of the best actress Tovah Feldshuh, who should be screened in the movie, but NOOOOO ... The great Barbara actor must do what she wants. And with no music! This movie is a total disaster from beginning to end. For one thing, Barbra was forty years old when she built it and she watched every minute. There is no way that everyone will swallow her as a girl who wishes to learn Torah. And when she was dressed as a boy I received the impression that Streisand was unable to endure the unattractive things, so she played with cosmetics. She is more beautiful than a child, like a girl. And as if it weren't as bad as she was involved with both her schoolmate Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin, the best time to shoot his bare end) and her fianc√© (Amy Irving schtick, a poor woman, often turns to use when the director doesn't care about her and she doesn't know what she is doing). The cold Myrtle also goes as far as to marry a young woman; I won't bother talking about the scene of "wedding night". <br /> <br /> Then there was music. All nine forgotten songs were sung by Streisand via voice-overs. (Probably the image that is on her mind) and each song is annoying and annoying, like a nail on a blackboard. <br /> <br /> I won't say that. Streisand doesn't show the promise of promise Directed here Some pictures are cute (the back of Patinkin in particular) and she has a good eye for balance. The problem with this movie is that she will not go out of her own way. I do not believe her for one second in the title role; She should not add music and, moreover, all the clutter continue for another two hours and fifteen minutes. I was bored with regret after forty-five minutes. <br /> <br /> Terrible, terrible.
