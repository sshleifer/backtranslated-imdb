<br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a waste of time. Scripts and conversations, bad writing, lacking direction and the scope of the performances of Hammi. This film is intended for the Rang De Basanti crowd clearly but it is too short to mark because it is not one of the elements created. RDB connects to its audience script, excellent performances, good directions and a powerful social message that never preached. But showing <br /> <br /> in comparison to the masterpiece near, Halla Bol stepped back to use that scene While the hero is leaking on the villain's Persian carpet and the hero's advisor stared at the gunshot in the truck. Not less! All of this may have been accepted in the 80s when the quality of movies and movies was not as good as DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante became a popular hit. But filmmaking became an interesting and slow idea. <br /> <br >> Rajkumar Santoshi is a talented director and I thank him for wanting to send social messages in every movie he does. But maybe he doesn't know how to do that! He turned to the sermon, ignoring the intelligence of the audience in understanding what he was trying to say. Sometimes he should concentrate on entertainment and leave social messages at Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khans. <br /> <br /> Even if you don't agree with everything I say, you will agree throughout the selection. Filter. You will be thinking that Rang De Basanti is much better and you Santoshi should leave the industry to Om Shanti Om Bash Industry? Correct! Santoshi shows the industry as a place of bite after casting and casting, in which the hero receives the pleasure of having a star named Sania. Some people will think that these parts show the face that True of the industry Don't believe everything you see. <br /> <br /> Summarize your voice with this kind of movie and don't use the hard earned money from this explosion. <br /> <br /> * From ****
