I have two good things to say about this movie: the scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk gives good performance. However, as I said, I found this movie extremely boring. Watching dry colors will get more entertainment. It seems that for more than 97 minutes, starting with the opening sequence that everyone talked to, and Paul Reiser is repeating everything that was said to him on the phone. This movie is annoying. The film is full of clich√© and shtick. Not to mention the endless events of flatulence. Hear by Falk. In addition, the director seems to have a problem deciding whether to intend to laugh or tear. There are some parts that touch But they all play to laugh. If schmaltzy, emotionally and "cute" attract your attention, you will love it. But if you hope to have something more content to watch other movies
