Remakes (and sequels) are considered the core of Cinema since the beginning of the media. It's quite risky to hit or miss. If you do something good with the original and create it and update the important features that are currently standard, you can succeed. Note that such movies, such as THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1924/1940) or KING KONG (1933/2005) succeeded in their efforts. Others, such as KING KONG (1976) failed miserably. <br /> < br /> BRIEF ENCOUNTER (1945) is a template for this film It's as perfect as possible in that matter, and we rate IMDb. ********** Ten stories are easy, love, innocence found accidentally and lost miserably. Why is it happening for both (2) employers involved at the wrong time? These things are credible and delicate. TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON are not the leaders of the Star material but are quality actors. See details of this film. <br /> <br /> What happened now? T.V. movies set a new scene for the scene with actors RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN. At least should have scored IMDb ****** six, although both actors do not care. But appeared to punch at the clock and picked up their checks No involvement with the characters or each other You do not believe that they are in love or when they are separated. Eventually, it is their big loss. That shouldn't be and that is the reason that it failed in intention Sometimes it would be better if you let alone
