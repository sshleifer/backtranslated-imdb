When I heard about this movie that was hilarious, I finally rented it at <br /> <br /> video store and for 75 minutes. Maybe I laughed 3 times. The movie <br /> <br /> which is the call A collection of games that make television a mess. <br /> <br /> No matter how funny, depressing humor, humor is related to <br /> <br /> from the 1970s that are no longer relevant and <br / > <br /> The jokes continue for too long. (Almost like new, SNL will skip <br /> <br /> A few years ago) Yes, Chevy Chase is here, but maybe <br /> <br /> all about 1 or 2 minutes. I like The fact that this is terrible and has many nudity But isn't it funny? <br /> <br /> Let yourself be a favorite and hire Kentucky Fried movies, which are superior movies. <br /> <br /> Created in
