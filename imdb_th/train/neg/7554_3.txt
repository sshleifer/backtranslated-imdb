I have never seen a model that has been ranked higher than in 1973. I am a fan of Nicholas Cage. (By the usual good method) This movie may take five minutes to complete the whole plot. (I saw that it was done on a cocktail napkin at the dinner party). If you can't find the end of this saliva in the first thirty minutes, you will May find that this movie is entertaining This was the end of the terrible time that Hollywood seemed to dig himself in with the horror / mystery / horror genre. Can not give enough credit to the audience and write a fresh, intelligent and provocative screenplay. And throw a couple of things that will make you jump a little, then send the final print to your local theater At least it does not have a mobile camera jerk.
