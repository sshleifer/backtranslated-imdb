A horror story that is often found about the luxurious buildings that Brooklyn hides the door to hell. It is reminiscent of Polanski's "tenants" (published last year "The Sentinel"), but is far from the movie of Polish filmmakers in all possible ways. "The Sentinel" doesn't have anything. <br /> <br /> The surprising thing from this movie is that the actors: It's full of good names of American movies, Wallach), actors. Veteran cook (I guess) <br /> <br /> Verdict: barely entertainment <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
