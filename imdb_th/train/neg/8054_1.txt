Oh, it's a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The production is cheap and nasty ... Remember that shooting from "the Natural" that lightning strikes trees. Where do bats come from? The producer of the film uses the same scene to bring the scene in which the branches bumped into the house. <br /> <br /> I wonder if they paid to use images from The Natural or did they hope No one will watch this movie to pick it up. <br /> <br /> Then, at the end, they tried to escape in the truck. Such acts served in the cabin. <br /> <br /> The movie is really bad. The movie is really bad.
