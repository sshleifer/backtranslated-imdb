Now I just had the pleasure of watching a hilarious comedy party, a bachelor party, one of my new comedians laughing until it just hurt the genre. So I want to see the sequel, hoping that it will laugh the same way, but Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation created by American Pie generation, which has no taste and overcomes the purpose of the first movie. Yes, the first movie has nudity. But it doesn't show in every scene. The plot is the same from the first time. It's not always a complaint to me. But it may be a little more original The only thing is I'm glad that at least there are no older actors from the original movie appearing in this movie because it looks scary or looks really stupid. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda get involved. After only 2 months of dating, everyone doesn't agree. Melinda has a wealthy family. But they are quite happy with Ron and Melinda's brother. Todd is afraid that Ron will do his job. So they went out to a weekend party in Miami to go to a bachelor party, and Todd made sure that he would stick in the picture to make Melinda change her mind. <br /> <br /> <br /> Party Party 2: The Temptation Last time there was a couple laughing here and there. But above all, failing to deliver what the first film accomplished These people, Ron's friends are more disgusting than cute, except Seth. He's quite funny. Another favorite character that is not Seth is Ron and Melinda. Everyone is excited about you more or less. Do you want to watch this movie? Just watch Girls Gone Wild. It's the same thing, not trying to pretend to be a movie. Acting like a bachelor party that is a movie that will make you laugh until tears. <br /> <br /> 3/10
