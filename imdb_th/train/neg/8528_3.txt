What is written on the poster is: "At first he was given 6 years of life ... At the age of 34, he spent a lifetime traveling." Ami was an Israeli born in America who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. At the age of one year at the age of 34, after the love for his 22-year-old caregiver was not good, he decided to come to the United States to meet a doctor who said he could only live for 6 years. To show the doctor that he was alive and weighs 39 pounds, why? You can guess as well as mine, even though I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously it's brave to live when he can move, his left index finger. But why is he so angry with the doctor Who diagnosed his disease 34 years ago? His doctor recently told his mother that, according to the medical history, the person with his disease could not live long. What was the purpose of his appearance at the old doctor's door? Why is tracking this old doctor in the United States a lifelong journey? There are many things that we might be interested in Ami's life: How can he create those animations with just one finger movement? How will he go in everyday life while all depends on others? How did he live the life of the doctor? How did he deal with emotions when others looked at him like looking at strange creatures? The movie tells us that there is no The filmmaker received a van and departed for Ami to appear at his old doctor's door to show him that he was still alive. I think it's a joke.
