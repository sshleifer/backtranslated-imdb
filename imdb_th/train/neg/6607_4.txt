Not as bad as some people do, even though it is clearly poor compared to the original. In my opinion, Amitabh is great like a villain. Babban Singh - Try not to compare Gabbar in the traditional way because they clearly don't have the same effect. In addition to the ordinary action scenes, some parts of the film still have bugs. The development of the character is not good and the development of the story is hopeless with many vulnerabilities and missing information that I never knew before if I didn't read the back of the DVD box. The worst part of this film is the supporting role from Nisha Kothari and especially this new friend called Prashant Raj. Nisha is annoying since the first time the lips are open for Prashant Raj - who is this guy? Where did he come from and why in the world that he presented in a movie studio for anything other than serving drinks? His acting ability is zero, and he has the same tone of voice, delivering conversations and acting actively in every scene, whether it's a comedy action or even a scene when someone dies. Ajay Devgan is an average. His expression has changed, which is more than I can say for his mistakes in being friends. Overall, RGV's Aag is worth watching. Dong's strong Amitabh and Urmilla Matondkar very sexy in a special format.
