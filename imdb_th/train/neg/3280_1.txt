I won't go and give my 10 coins. I go and buy the fourth season of the original and the best. At least my children enjoy it and can watch without worrying about what they see I have a teenager and she thinks that the picture is ridiculous and rather looks original. And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a terrible daisy. Actually, she thinks she looks like a fool rather than a daisy Those shorts, she might not wear anything. And when the American Pie is involved with Dukes SHAME, they have to have nasty sex about cars Which in itself should get the rating of this movie The only good thing that could be caused by this film is the original reunion movie. Give all hope So people who go there and go to see a movie will see how it should look.
