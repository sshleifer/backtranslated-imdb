I don't like to comment on good movies. But when it comes to bad movies, I have to come really hard, talking about Vivah, Sooraj Badjatya. This person, seems to be doing all gone. After the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he could make money with a wonderful wedding video. Vivah was so wonderful that Badjatyas left Johars and Chopras back. <br /> <br /> There was no time for the movie I can say 'Oh! At least this is good ' Cheap soundtrack <br /> <br /> Spoiler now reminds you what happened in his other films after the disaster film ended with happiness.
