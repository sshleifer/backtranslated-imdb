Place to suck me in But it's clear that about 30 seconds on this issue is David Lynch or something very bad. Interesting to watch just to run through the laundry list. I can be a sucker for exciting spiritual parts. (Romero came into his mind) but nothing about the spirit about this The message seems to be that we all have to pretend that we have an IQ equal to 80 (or just get a lobotomy - Jennifer, what happened to you?) And follow the Bible without any manual examination. It's an attitude that makes people fly Jumbo to a 110-storey building (I work near the WTC location in the past). I like to think that God is a little bigger than that.
