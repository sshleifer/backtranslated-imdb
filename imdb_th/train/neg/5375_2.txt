After watching this movie, I almost felt a waste of 2 hours in my life. But I think everything will be better: <br /> <br /> If I rate this as another movie, get 1 or 2 tops, but if I rate it like a low price Movies may receive 3 or 4, that is, movies that should be 'perfect' and never be too boring or time consuming. This movie is not But I think many independent movies are about acting, movies and considering this movie. There are some highlights. If I would comment on what the director should take with their next project, I expect the distorted sound effects to be of quality. They can also create some characters. However, this makes me to continue to do things in the project because the character creation takes too long because most of them are not related to movie plot. The Shouldn't take a long time to walk around in the next project - what is the point? I guess this movie tries to do everything a little. (Creating characters, characters, suspense and short stories) and ending with nothing (not much). <br /> <br /> This movie is trying too hard and too hard. I think it should be cut into short films. I can easily find a path around or a pointless conversation to cut from a movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many irrelevant things going on in this movie. The story should be more streamlined. I know that there should be a mystery in this movie. But a little surprising that the killer is not a mystery The story behind the "mystery" rarely gets the attention of this film, which makes the "final" issue a quick, unsatisfactory story. <br /> <br /> So I want to say that this movie is a game. Good But i can't I hope that the directors learn from their mistakes and produce better results next time. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in learning from movie production at an affordable price, you don't need to. Look at this thing - not even seeing why everyone thinks it is not good. <br /> <br /> As others say, I'm pretty sure that many of the 10 that were given to this movie came from people involved. With movies This film cannot receive "10" judgments from the perspective of a remote objective.
