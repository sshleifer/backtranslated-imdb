Like most people, I love "A Christmas Story". I have never heard of this before and perhaps because of good reason - it's very bad. Same place, same speaker, same director. But the warm ambiguity of the manuscript is not enough. Charles Grodin is a bad choice for replacing Darrin McGavin, but I can't imagine that anyone can replace him. It seems that the story is forced and the lack of sweetness of the original. Interaction with neighbors Bumpuses is ridiculous in "A Christmas Story". Ralphie's obsession with BB guns seems cute. But the passion for this film is boring. Scud Farkas, the original bully, was replaced by this movie by another child with braces and strange hats, but with a scary Fargas slightly scary. It would be difficult to equalize with the original, although this film will be made with the original team.
