Seriously, I don't even know where to start. It's like someone gave a billion dollars to a third grade student and said 'Make me a movie about secret service' The fix is ​​ridiculous. The movie is the best random. Every conversation is completely cluttered and the director ... also has the director there too Everything is pointless and crippled and pointless ... and random .... and lame. <br /> <br /> This is a spoiler for you. This movie is the most stupid thing you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> However, if you like this piece, you will enjoy it; Deterrance, Dark Blue and partial frontal lobotomy
