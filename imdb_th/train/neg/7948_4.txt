"The seventh signal" is borrowed from "Rosemary's baby" and "the omen" (actually it's a two-tier blend). Even though its name is remembered as Bergman's "Seventh Seal" <br /> <br / > However, it started well enough, with all the omen that were scattered throughout the world and in parallel with Moore's husband trying to save the poor boy. (Who killed his parents, brother and sister) from the death penalty When both religious and Christian Jews were called to help (Even the wandering Jews) who sometimes make unintended jokes (Have you ever been to Sunday school? But they taught me that God is love!) The IMHO scene is a short conversation between the clergyman John Heard - it seems that he does not take things seriously. Too bad that he doesn't get the most important part because His relaxed performances are priceless - and small Jews. <br /> <br> Demi Moore may register the same wishes as his ex-wife Bruce Willis: save the whole world. Movies for everything
