Honestly, I don't want to take the time to write about the major incidents of incompetence in this film - life is too short. What I will say is that Alone In The Dark succeeds only in three things: 1. It will make you laugh. But for all the wrong reasons 2. It will handle many useless transformations into the air <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole thing is in the classic PC game based on the complete failure in all aspects of movie production. <br /> <br /> Doctor Bol, if that's what you really are here.) What do you do in the world on the director's chair?
