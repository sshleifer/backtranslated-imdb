Don't waste money on this movie. Don't even go into your car and think you might see this movie if others don't care about you. If you have to watch the movie this weekend, go see Batman again. <br /> <br /> Scary script. Perfectly written from a random horror movie format: places in a confined space, a madman with various weapons, a curious man who can discover all the clues that a faithful police officer cannot unite and Is a naive and curious woman Viewers will like to be able to call their fans. Mix together, add a lot of blood that has been executed, and what the hell has come together to "spin" a bit in the plot. <br /> <br /> The performance is terrible and the characters are unbelievable. More reliable. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** and somebody please tell me that the butcher's vest can make the bullet reflect from the person after being shot without causing People who are shot and shaken ??? I am in the army We need that kind of thing for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 and I will put it in the decimal place of the flick up to get the lowest score possible.
