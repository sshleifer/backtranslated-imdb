A terrible movie with a Canadian actor, a D-list that looks awestruck about the fact that they are on camera that their performances look too real and memorable. <br /> <br /> Film This was written badly. Badly edited and poorly directed It's separate, difficult to understand and strange - but not in a good way. McDowell works great with what he gets. But being the only person in this movie to do that - he has a bad story and a screenplay that must work too It's not a good comedy Often in Toronto, more than a boat outside Africa. <br /> <br /> Did the director see that 'animal' looks like a jazz dancer in an alien costume? The battle between the blue lightning and the lightning and the color of the Pellets is 'magic' (!?! Due to the lack of better words), it is clearly a result of a poor performer without choreographers. There is even a director in the room or in the film editing room. (Not a good model)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... Don't waste time with this one. You will have to regret what I used to do. I have nothing to say about celluloid anymore.
