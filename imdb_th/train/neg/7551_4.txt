Eventually, finally having to see the remake in London last night, hilariously, unintentionally, sexually and without humor. I really don't know where to start, while I get the respect from showing this strange respect. Didn't motivate me at all The show is an outcry. There are no original songs, costumes too far away. 'Disney' has ridiculous inserts. 'Six months later' after the burning of the Nic Cage (which didn't come soon enough for my liking). The bit with the Cage in the Bears set for the audience to suppress the comedy as well as comedy, punching various 'baddies' on the island It was a strange story that I couldn't believe it saw. It reminded me of something that The Comic Strip had to offer to do in the eighth decade, like their Hollywood interpretation of the excavation. mineral
