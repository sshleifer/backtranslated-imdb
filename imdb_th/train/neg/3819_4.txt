T.Z. Post, a college professor, received a false letter stating that he had inherited $ 750,000 now. With financial methods, he withdrew his life savings of $ 4,000 and decided to leave and live in the end. After he sent the baggage to Chicago, he met with the tour singer and decided there was enough for him to perform on Broadway. The poor post-era show had to hide from The creditors paid the relationship between Panzi's girlfriend and the best actress Eleanor. After seeing Keaton's silent jewel, one of these is the pain that has to be seated. But I felt that it was much worse Supporting actors Durante, Todd and Selwyn come out very annoying sometimes. But still a favorite pre-Charlie Chan Toler, as well as a disappointing acting director. 90% of the script was badly written because MGM tried to pass on this as a poor man's Marx Bros. movie. When compiled with Keaton's drinking problem at this time, this movie is a sad moment in Buster's life. Score - 3
