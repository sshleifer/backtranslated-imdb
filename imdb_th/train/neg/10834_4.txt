Sorry I missed something? Am I walking away quickly? The first ten minutes of an unusual story (And not true!) Makes me think "This will be a classic" but it's down from there! The performance is great for what is valuable. William H Macy is great and just getting better and better. Everything I watched him. I am waiting for a great moment in which all the stories are connected and then suddenly there .. If the author says "I'm down deep. How can I pull all these stories together wisely ... Oh, I'll make the frog rain." I like smart movies. But this is strange and boring 4/10
