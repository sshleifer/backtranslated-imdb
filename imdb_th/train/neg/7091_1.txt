This movie is skillful. I hardly believe what I see. It was shot on video! Not filming! I have never seen this thing since the early 1970s when the late night network showed the movie of filming. 'Horror flick' in the video ...... It looks like a bad drama and that is a compliment. Some actors give the best picture. Michael Des Barres is okay with what he gets, which is acting like sex addiction. I cannot say that it is a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Nassas Jacintski as a therapist sitting on a chair to watch the whole movie. I am not wrong that she is blocking others. But she is unbelievable in her role Her little girl's voice works with her here. And I think I am a Nastassja Kinski fan. Of course, she is immortal and exotic. But she is outside of her boundary with this thing. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul is overwhelmingly poor. Every line you deliver has three exclamation points. Someone must guide her to shout at all costs. Why would Michael Dresden want to have sex with anger? <br /> <br /> In the end, Rosanna Arquette, as a sweet and wicked wife, came out ok. But that doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've seen for many years.
