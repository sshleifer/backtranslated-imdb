It must be the most watched TV program in the air. This may be an escape for Jim Belushi and all his bad movies. His brother sucked all the talent off him. I hope this list will be canceled and never mentioned again except for negative use. Jim has to retire or something. Please let them go in the air. If I'm funny from acting here, I'll throw up and wash my eyes with a toothbrush. The code will be taken away from the devil itself rather than watching a full half hour of programming. I still don't understand why the program is still aired and broadcast. We all know deeply that we want to shoot our TV screen when seeing Jim's face. In conclusion, no more.
