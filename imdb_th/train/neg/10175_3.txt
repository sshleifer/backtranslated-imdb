Can not sleep again So I got up, flipped on the tube, and this movie was here. <br /> <br /> The movie makers dropped out more than they could chew. Like the ambitions of the same extent as "Forrest Gump", but Gamp read like a fairy tale that a special lucky man guides us through the era. TGMB just relies on clich√©s to tell the story. Almost like the Broadway musical that the actor had to ham it up. The purpose of every character is to fill up the 60 poop templates. <br /> <br /> Follow the way we were introduced to Finnegan: embrace his black maid. Criminey talks about tough Why not just give him a shirt that says "I Heart Black People"? <br /> <br /> Sunshine: "Does love come from Groovay? Oh no, I don't have my time." < br /> <br /> Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not UCLA Square." Uh, sorry? Nothing about LA in the 60s. Instead of spending time showing what makes Berkeley like no other, we just hear the clutter of children who don't go there. <br /> <br /> Can't. Can remember the name of the black child He is just a pillar that is used to show that children are tolerant of race. <br /> <br /> That is a time that doesn't have to be magical. Get "puzzled and confused". See how we know about Football Hero Randall Floyd First of all, we don't see him at the football field. Actually, we have never seen him play football at all. We were introduced to him in class. Invite his poker colleagues to a party. <br /> <br /> In popular women, "trance" is not a by-product of some chicks falling down. It is more organic than serious. It has been refined in the women's room rather than talking about Gilligan Island. Serious ideas can grow in the most global settings. But the real life is like that. <br /> <br /> Some warm comments here. Please note that the theme in this film is still relevant. I agree! This is the reason I am extremely disappointed with this Baby-Boomer pornography.
