This movie is the most horrifying movie viewing experience I have to endure, and the worse thing is the fact that I have to watch and not have a chance to stop because it's school! Accepted that story well But I found that acting was terrible! The exception is Marianne Jean-Baptiste. I think her performance is wonderful. She is the only one highlighted without her. I wonder if I can endure watching movies. Every time I hear someone say "daarling" I cringe! I almost attacked customers the other day because they said "it". It made me remember one of the worst things and half an hour of my life! <br /> <br /> (I'm sorry if this makes anyone offend me, just express my opinion)
