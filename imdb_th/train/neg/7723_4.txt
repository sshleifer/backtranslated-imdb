I do not like even this movie so much for its religious values. It's a B-movie action movie by the director of "Commando", which looks silly and too stupid to consider it as a good B movie with good entertainment. <br /> <br /> It is '90's flick, but the most important movie should remind the action movie' 80 when these types of B movies are high all the time. These films are outstanding and never pay much attention to their stories or performances. It's all about blowing up the big muscular heroes and bullets flying around. This movie has all the ingredients in it. Still, I don't like to watch this movie as much as I like to watch movies of the same type. It's hard to say why, because stories and performances and such are not as good as they should be, in other cases, other types of movies from the same era. <br /> <br /> Maybe because this movie is often far away. Too stupid, this type of movie has a silly moment. But this movie is full of fighting. Dolph Lundgren runs around by wearing a character's shirt. Everything is not good because often the words are too weak. Sometimes the story doesn't try to understand and what is the most important thing for the movie as a whole. The story is really all over the place and it seems to be written to create a movie that has scenes of fighting, fighting scenes, guns, and so on. The time was too short and quite disappointing to actually watch from people who brought us "Commando". <br /> <br /> It's the most important thing for Dolph Lundgren, which he plays the big hero. Of the kick-action action, seemingly knowing how to deal with guns and other weapons, and of course, makes girls play by Tia Carrere. All this makes us one of the worst editing scenes in history. treatment Lahore Action and one of the worst sex scene in every movie I've ever seen. Both are too weak and unassuming. <br /> <br /> The characters don't have any characters. Good people are police, but they never act like anyone. They just kill them without having to face anyone's responsibility and they are not eager to arrest or let others know about their discovery. Even when they found that there was a big criminal organization in Japan trying to take over the streets of LA and the brewery was working as a shelter for a large drug and drug factory. And just think for a moment. What is the overall aim of Brandon Lee in the movie? This film can be easily done without him and the girl. <br /> <br /> Too stupid, weak and simple and not fun enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
