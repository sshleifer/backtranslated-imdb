This movie is another story that has no limited budget. No effort. No movies that shoot videos and get protection from unsuspecting tenants at video stores. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what? Watch this movie, grab a red-colored video camera and shoot it for yourself and your friends. Walk around the neighborhood at night and "attack" people. Congratulations. You just created "Hood of the Living Dead. "! Now let's see if the distribution company will buy from you. <br /> <br /> I've seen a low budget, filming movies, videos showing talent from filmmakers and actors, or at the very least. Are you a real self-punisher or amused by horror movies that do not work well?
