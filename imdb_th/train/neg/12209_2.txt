Many years ago, when I was a teenager who broke my best friend and my brother, both had a policy that people choose movies should pay. And while I never paid to see the shit they took me, I couldn't resist traveling to watch movies for free! That's the way I watched shit like Conan's second movie and never said it again! Now, despite being a miserable movie But it is in a place that is entertaining to watch and techniques for stunts and cameras are working well, so this thing raises my rating to 2! And why is the movie so bad? Unlike the first Rambo movie, this story has no real plot. Rambo himself only speaks only 3 words (other than roaring and shouting). There is no need for love and complete development. Stupid) Special effects and A. What special amazing effects are amazing? While bullets 12383499143743701 Ammunition and rockets were fired at Rambo. There was no effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow that Rambo shot was popular. And while the villains use AK-47s, helicopters and rockets in some scenes The scene in which a bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly releases these explosive arrows quietly, especially for stupid audiences! It was amazingly mocked on UHF, starring Weird Al. In addition, HOT SHOTS, PART DEUX also made funny comedy movies - not just stupid scenes. <br /> <br /> All-in-all movies that are dumb and without Destination!
