This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it at the premiere at SXSW and was very disappointed. The director knows a little about John Lennon and even speaks at the premiere. This is a drama, but people laugh all the time that this movie is like. That was never a good sign. The only saving facility is Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Livien's roommate / roommate. They are funny while the rest of the movie takes itself too seriously waaay the lyrics of the wonderful Beatles. The most ridiculous However, the soundtrack is great and may be the best part of the movie. If you're not a fan of Dominic Monaghan, don't worry about this.
