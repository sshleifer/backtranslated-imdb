The Gospel of Lou is a big disappointment for me. I received an email from the cinema, showing that it was a wonderful and inspiring movie. It's not great or inspiring. The film was quite incredible when used in both movies, many scenes were back in a way that could not tell what had happened. The sound is often distorted without reason. A lot of people in this film have been drawn far. The relationship he had with his ex and his son was never clear. In addition, all the movies have a large part of him in one way and from all of BAM's sudden, he has been healing and inspiring to people. The whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the bad things in his life, causing him to live the way he lives. But when he changed him, he did not leave boxing. He taught others what to do. Box. Thumb down.
