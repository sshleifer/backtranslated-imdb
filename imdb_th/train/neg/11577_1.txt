The director tries to Quentin Tarantino, writing the screenplay for the Tennessee Williams, Deborah Cara, Unger tries to Faye Dunaway at the end. James Byrne tries to Orson Welles, Michael Rooker tries Will inherit Dunaway (older version), Cameron Diaz tries to get out of the frame as fast as possible (unsuccessful) Am the It gives a little meaningless dialogue and action. <br /> <br /> Tulsa is a city with a lobby, a beautiful lift lobby, an Art Deco church by Bruce Goff and a lovely and sprawling mansion. The branches of Frank Lloyd Wright visit Tulsa. Don't watch this movie. It didn't do justice to the location.
