Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy starred in this film, one of his weakest werewolf films ... but patiently with me for a moment Most people are familiar with it under the most common television names. THE FURY OF THE WOLF MAN and have many home videos over the years. If you want to be serious about making it the most fair, best-used work I have ever seen, it comes from the name THE WOLF. MAN never sleeps and is a European version that doesn't have to be modified and complete which will return the scene. And disturb There is an original nude picture missing from the FURY print. There is also a post box. <br /> <br /> Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky, returning home from a trip to Tibet, only to find that he has made a curse. Curse the werewolf and his wife for adultery. He takes care of her and her lover while being in animal form. But then became a guinea pig for her sexy female doctor and female assistant Obviously, the doctor tried to "tame" the werewolf and had a very strange sado-socio-loving scene between her and the hairy and hairy Daninsky under the trance of She at least in the original version We finally got two werewolves for the price of a Daninsky. Fight with her - Wolf! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem of this movie is the director. (According to Naschy's claims) is often drunk and the results are quite inconsistent when watching THE WOLF MAN. Never imitating, it is not difficult to do what happens even if the correction is still bad in the spot. Worst of all, it's a picture that doesn't match the time of the starving werewolves of Naschy. Swipe directly from another movie (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, also known as "FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR") The wolf's clothes changed from a black shirt to a white one and returned again as well as his behavior; At one time, the wolf was walking around in a sleepy, hypnotic trance from FURY. Then he was roaring and running around cruelly from BLOODY TERROR.
