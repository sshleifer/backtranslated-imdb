Kojak meets the Mafia Telly Savales, one of them from the past that seems to be forgotten. I never thought that his performance was great. This is a one-dimensional look of the bandit leader with very predictable results. If you drive, chase and hang out in general, the development or action of the plot will not be much. I found that the mafia movie was boring because I didn't respect or care about the general criminals and their actions. Hollywood and in this case the Italian cinema considered them a hero. I saw this movie and in a few days I can't remember much. A large number of shooters, innocent dead, innocent, betrayed and loyal patients. This movie took quite a good picture and the performance was good. But the voice-overs are terrible. (Due to the sound that could not come out of those bodies) made me almost start looking for Godzilla that came near the bay
