Who is researching this film? It was located in Baghdad in 2004. However, all soldiers wear ACUs and have a Universal Camouflage Pattern device. No one has put that in 04. <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie while being used in different places. Country and I can say that the overwhelming feeling from the audience is WTF? This film has no meaning, has a character coming and going without explanation and people who do nonsense things that never happened in real life. I know it's a movie. But apparently trying to convey what is true It failed miserably, but tried <br /> <br /> It was like someone thought the idea was to chew and swallow and then film. I will not recommend this movie to anyone. I'm not sure why I'm watching the whole story. GI Joe is someone who makes you think that this is far away!
