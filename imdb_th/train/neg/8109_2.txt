*** Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> I don't like this movie. <br /> <br /> I found it amazingly boring and quite superficially regardless. The importance and depth of The proposed theme: Since ultimately we have to die, how should we approach life in the form of "light" like Tomas; In a "heavy" manner such as Tereza; Or should we find a way to not face questions like Sabina? How important is integrity in relationships? Professional life can be destroyed because the people we love? We have to participate in the political life and social problems of our country. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I didn't read Kundera's novel, but after the movie was dropped I would: I want to understand. That the story was destroyed by film adaptations (Which is my guess) or if it's boring from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I don't agree with the positive comments that the movie is. Masterpiece. I don't see the reason why What I see is a lot of flaws and examples of them. <br /> <br /> 1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it's very difficult to understand what drives them when deciding. <br /> <br /> 2) "Secondary" characters are there to fill the gap. But they didn't add anything to the story and you wonder if it's really necessary. <br /> <br /> 3) I'm not the same as Thomas disguised. Nothing good for him He is selfish and selfish. He is not a human in one sense. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and has an emotional relationship with someone, I do not find a reliable interpretation. <br /> <br /> 4) Unlikely. It is possible that artists like Sabina would be able to pay. Her lifestyle in the communist country in the year In 1968, the three main characters were very successful in their profession, which sounds strange to me. A) Tereza can easily become a good photographer. B) They will do well in How does an economically motivated country motivate people to succeed? <br /> <br /> 5) The fake accent of actors who speak English is ridiculous. And I didn't speak my mother tongue Moreover, the letter that Sabina received while in the United States was written in Czech, which I found very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> 6) Many comments, watch movies that say that Prague is beautiful. Extreme: I guess most The movie was filmed at the location, so it was not difficult to make this film a Eastern European feel and the true beauty of Prague was not difficult to make it look good. <br /> <br /> 7) I found the spot. End Trivia Tereza and Tomas finally enjoyed the countryside far from the temptation of "metropoly" that is far from the social struggle that their citizens live away from their career, die from a road accident. Car But they die after knowing that they are happy. Of course, what? They died unhappy. The message from this movie is different or not? I do not think so I think it's a cheap trick that will make the audience satisfied. <br /> <br /> 8) The only thing in the movie that is unbearable is the way the director shows the character. You see them for almost three hours. But in the end you don't have anything left You do not feel sympathy, you do not relate to them. You are left on the sofa to see events and scenes that are hardly spoken. <br /> <br /> 9) I hate "Stop music in the shop. Food "The scene (which some comments are very appreciated) Why does Sabina have such a violent reaction? Why did Franz agree with her? I don't see the point. The only thing you learn is Sabina has a bad mood and a strong personality. That's it. There's nothing special and unique about it. <br /> <br /> After all this negative comments for me Point out that there are two scenes that I like very much. (That is why I gave it twice) <br /> <br /> "Naked women Photoshoot" where jealousy, jealousy and insecurity of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented. <br /> <br /> Another scene is an investigation image after the occupation of Prague by the Russian picture Tereza taken to let the world know what happened in Prague was used to identify people who participated in the riots. I find it quite primitive and the feeling of despair and guilt of Tereza is well conveyed. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a small possibility that the movie was intentionally designed in The appearance that "Tomas type" to like and "Tereza people" will hate it if this is the case. (I highly doubt that) my opinion should be greatly modified.
