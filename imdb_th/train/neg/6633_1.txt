Where to start The best way to explain how scary this movie is. <br /> <br /> Start with humor from a humorous camp. It's not funny. Add musicians who pretend to be actors. the awesome and Deborah Harry even worse. Pity the poor Kearney who should know better than making this movie. <br /> <br /> And then there is a story. The principal whose purpose in life is Alice Cooper's performance. Meet a young woman whose life goal is to be a group for Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> Then, when the movie should end, they can't create the last scene that is more reliable - well, I won't destroy. For you, if you really want to watch movies, <br /> <br /> There are some actors that let you know that this will be a movie "B" or maybe worse. Gailard Sartain is one of those for me - and him. Has a dominant role That is a sign that this movie may not be good. If nothing else, the movie will live according to low expectations - even more than they are worse than the poor. <br /> <br /> We say this, this is a movie that compares all bad movies. And no one is worse than Roadie
