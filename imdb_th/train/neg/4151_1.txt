This may be the best horror movie Ed Wood has done. <br /> <br /> I can't destroy the ending because I don't know what happened. I will try my best There are some lesbian vampires. But they are still shifting, so any character may or may not be the character that you think should be. <br /> <br /> Does it make the sound confused? It's not as confusing as you think because there aren't any characters that are suitable for starting. No plot, no character development and random people appear. Say a few lines and disappear. Never heard again. There are also zombies that may be * vampires' enemies. But there is a continuous scene inside the dream in a mental hospital, so there may be no real thing. <br /> <br /> Upside down? Girls take both, take off their shirts briefly. Special effects are incredible. (In particular, I like the slow and incredibly unbelievable fighting scene) Everyone has a really stupid Canadian accent that increases the level of general excitement. <br /> <br /> Worth the rental price We laughed until we cried.
