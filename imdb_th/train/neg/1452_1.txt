From 1919 to 1933, Germany seems to be unlike the post office of the Czech Republic in World War II. Sorry, that is the capital of the Czech Republic, and it was 2003, so funny. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most terrifying historical films of the past. Röhm is the chief who is higher than Adolf and looks very good. Göring's bad looks like 40 when he is 23 and "Führer" seems to look like 56 always and building folks or even buildings, sometimes still young, especially 1919 Many homes in Germany are almost new (WWI does not reach German cities!). There is no plaster! Then go to Reichstagsbuilding There has never been a valley in the city around this building, and this may sound like a miracle: in the year 1933, the Berlin Brigade occupied a large number of vehicles with some engines, even a rotating staircase. <br /> <br /> One last thing: Is this PLAYMOBIL castle the last one? For me this is "Adolf's Adventures in Wonderland"
