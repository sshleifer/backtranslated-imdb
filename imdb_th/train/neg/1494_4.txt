Yes, better than I've ever seen the Death Tunnel. Of course, some deaths are quite original and blood is good. It's like Wrong Turn. Meet Hills Have Eyes. <br /> <br /> But: 1.) When "kids" (high school or college?) Are talking about horror movies in the kitchen, everything that Shae says is almost Will be the right words from Scream (1996). Things about girls, big breasts, etc. <br /> <br /> 2.) Did Steve not be a pirate thief from Scream? 3.) In addition to the fact that it happened in October, how did this movie relate to Samhain? Quite unnecessary if you ask me I find it funny when I see horror movies from the 80s that describe the end, pointing at the druids or the five-pointed star. <br /> <br /> 4.) Wow, they reference Sam Raimi! !!) 5. Why is Gary and his sister in the movie? They are characters that have nothing to do with it. And he was so surprised that he didn't even see his own death? 6.) When Gary is killed in the bathroom (at that point, death becomes a matter. Troma-licious) How can you hear the scream when you are below? But didn't hear them when she stood outside the door 7.) Gary's sister commented about Hagis, mostly Scottish food, not Irish. <br /> <br /> 8.) So the lesson is if you are like chat and not fun or smile. Both movies, you will be alive. 9.) The mutations are very cool. But they looked like Chili con carne's dish. <br /> <br /> 10.) When they brought Gary's sister, they forgot that Steve HAD was bound there and wondered where he went? 11.) Are there more than one killer? But she never met anyone anymore. <br /> <br /> 12.) What is going on with other people? Half of them do not know if they are dead or alive. So what? 13.) Why didn't they kill Gary and his sister before? 14.) Why does anyone call police? And apparently everyone knows that those people live in the forest, why don't they organize some attacks? 15.) As far as I know, they are not zombies or vampires - so how can you "become" one of the end? I am with other people on the giant "huh?" At the end. <br /> <br /> Better than the tunnel of death. But still quite sloppy I still do not understand why they put it in Ireland because Samhain was not involved in this matter.
