This movie should be called "Plan 9 from joseph smith". I think its strangeness has decreased. The playwright seemed to read Paul ehrlich's "Population Bomb (1968)," and created a musical response made especially for Mormons. The whole point of the drama is to have as many children as possible as part of the plan. "The Father of Heaven" (God) and anything that is blocking the way to have more children is worse Therefore looks and feels like 1983. The play was actually written in 1973, and of course theology was part of the 1840 year, while Galatika Battingar Some actions occur on Earth and some in "Pre-existation, romper-room romper is no longer the point that annoying children wait for their bodies so they can come down and try not to knock the door of the glory missionaries. <br /> <br /> It's Like the stage they came But do not let the poor drama lose your gratitude for this corrupt Mormon universe All 'cool children' are in control of the population (assuming) counseling. Their parents do not want to have children anymore !! Having a big family is while writing plays, cultural norms in the LS community, and more importantly, being part of God's plan since the church did 180, making family planning the choice of parents And a large family is not a cultural norm at this time, creating the location of all the doctrines of the Mormon Mormon movies for the modern era. Users really only as good as the songs are catchy, something that will not allow the movie to death in 1970, which was predetermined. The brothers and sisters sing a love song which makes you wonder if something might happen there. - Winking and strong and cool kids make the kids look like metallic. So cheer on everything! Gather around the family, create sharpshooter and have fun with the show! <br /> <br />
