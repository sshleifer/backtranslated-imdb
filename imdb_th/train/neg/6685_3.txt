Although this film takes place at the college "Ivy League", but actually it was filmed in Northern Arizona, mostly at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff in the fall of 1976. I participated in the theater department there and most of Free In this movie is a member of the drama department. <br /> <br /> There is a very laughing scene in this movie. (If you know your Arizona geography) that shows many actors, cyclists from college to the creek. We don't know the university and speak the creek. (Actually Oak Creek Canyon) is about 35 miles apart, and while traveling down the entire hill, it would be impossible to ride a bike back onto the same road!
