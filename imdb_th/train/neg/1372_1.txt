See this on TV I'm glad I didn't go to the cinema to see or spend the rent. All movies can be predicted - from damaged owners and planners to power lines that snatch. The story is weak and unbelievable - an avalanche expert has been hit by a 20-foot wave (using real images) and all he has to do is get up and shake himself. The avalanche came down to a million miles per hour and stopped at the side of the road. <br /> <br /> Some avalanche materials are impressive and demonstrate the destructive power. But the contract between the real avalanche and the various scenes makes this movie look sweet. <br /> <br /> Act like a favorite. Don't worry about this. It's not about T.V.
