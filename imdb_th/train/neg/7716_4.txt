I just watched this movie only once when I was very young. This movie is blurred in trying to remember. However, I can say that it is not as funny as it should be a killer tomato movie, and the most memorable thing from this movie is the song and the scene with the couple who spoke of poor Timmy. This is just a scene of small tomatoes and large tomatoes rolling around, and people show fear and act out too much because people should do in this type of movie. However, just having very stupid evidence and a catchy song doesn't make it funny. Receiving this movie should be a movie B, nothing to be taken seriously. But you still make funny jokes and do not try to expand the comedy place gently as a full-fledged movie. Maybe briefly may be good because the trailer shows the elderly couple mentioned above and a man who tried To shoot tomatoes that are bigger is quite good. The trailer looks like a trailer. But none of them made the movie full and quite weak at that time
