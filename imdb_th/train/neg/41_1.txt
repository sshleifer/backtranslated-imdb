How can you tell if a horror movie is terrible? When you can't stop laughing The plot is well protected by other investigators, so I will add something about all of its hilarity. <br /> <br /> Some comments have placed their position in South America and others. In Africa I think It is in a random island in the Pacific Ocean. This can happen where it seems to be a mystery. The humanoid tribe consists of two black men, some black men and a young man who looks like Frank Zappa. The youthful drumming is ... The demon god is a big black man with a terrible pink eye. /> One of the moments in which the "freakiest" in this movie was when "Pablito" searched for his partner hanging from a tree covered with what appeared to be an orange substance that I considered as blood began to scream. Vail several minutes (That was really funny) Then his partner's head fell into the ground and "Pablito" kicked a bit for what I considered "shits n 'giggles" and the eyes moved ... <br /> < br /> But of course "strange" disappears when you realize that your eyes move because this movie is terrible ... <br /> <br /> I haven't laughed like this for a long time and I would like to recommend this movie for Sunday afternoons with your friends and you have nothing to do ... grab the beer case and start watching this movie. You will love it! If you are looking for horror or real horror movies, but ... don't worry.
