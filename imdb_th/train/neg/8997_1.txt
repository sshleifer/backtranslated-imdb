This is the worst movie I ever paid to watch and except "They Saved Hitler's Brain" which is the worst movie I've ever seen. When this movie came out, I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV and expected what I thought would be the most fun movie that could be produced because there was no restriction on the TV program that needs to be updated. <br /> <br /> Writers must think that we will put some humor, bloating, some sex, cheap and hey. We have a separate risk, funny, laughing. The game show is nothing more than a price that can't be imagined to deal with Let's Make a Deal with foolish inefficiencies. Sitcom took a trip about a single woman and her boyfriend is just a high school humor that is not plain good. Stun gun advertisements are a sense of humor for Seasame Street. LA's subway dance is a joke with a bloodless taste. French chefs who walk around the blind speak regularly. "No difference" with a French accent is that you get my points. <br /> <br /> The only funny dance involving Chevy Chase that lasts throughout the minute. That means you will get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. Oh yes, I have read reviews about all the countries that were stoned in the 1970s and you will like this movie if you are tall. Most of the country was not stoned in the 70s. If the author didn't get stoned, he had to use a sleepy sinus drug. There were 4 other people in the theater next to me when I watched the movie. this story Of course, the words did not come out about the badness of the movie.
