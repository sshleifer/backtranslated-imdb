This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I've seen horrible movies in my time. But this thing takes time to make a cake. Don't wait. I mean pure bakery. It's terrible that I believe the words that will explain how you feel after watching this cruelty have not yet been created. Please do something you like yourself if you are stimulated to watch and watch thirty minutes of annoying purple dinosaurs at Barney, then multiply by thirty times and you will get just a little horror In conclusion, I think you can be called a horror movie. But if you are willing to be frightened by the worst performances in the business and the most ridiculous stories, <br /> <br /> real scores, -10 disgusting
