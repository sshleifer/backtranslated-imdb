This movie is ridiculous. Anyone who says that the performance is excellent and that the selection of excellent actors has never been seen in an ordinary movie theater. Obviously, the performance is terrible in the first 5 characters you encounter. incoherently. I feel like all other "soaring" comments have to be made by people involved with the filmmakers. I'm not impressed with the story. But want to see the beautiful countryside of Oregon and have a good movie - but casting is something that has been inspired I think that this film also causes a mockery of the general noble advice that there are some things that are deep in the Amerindian culture are ignored and may disappear. It's funny in places that are wrong and too clear and make me think it's written by the foreign ministry or something. Back to the drawing board In suggesting that this film deserves a place in the vicinity of classic movies like Harold and Maude, like never before and along the lines of begging and pretending.
