The only movie I ever walked out Amazing because I paid myself and my date and I was really right. But my brain is no longer able to withstand the ruins, especially when I can write fun content while tying and gagging. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, this movie displeased it. It's not funny now. It's not funny at all, and it's not funny. But worse, this film is the beginning of the end of a really funny and sophisticated comedy. It is a complex chapter of children and youth. The chapters and ideas began in the era. (Which still continues today) where cheap laughter and sexual friction dominate the culture of comedy movies. <br /> <br /> Which high school boy doesn't think so? The beginning of the end
