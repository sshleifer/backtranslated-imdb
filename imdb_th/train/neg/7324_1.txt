Being a movie graduate, I would like to think that I have seen many types of movies, both good and bad. But I must say that 'Summer rain' is a movie that's worse than I have ever seen! I chose the movie in the hope that it would be a great English class, like 'Secret and lying' or 'Lock Stock' but oh no, this is so bad that my flatmates and I laughed And a wonderful script (Reminded me of the production of theater in the theater for bad education) The main characters of Michelle and Gary began to disturb us from the beginning of 'Michelle'. There is a face that you will not be bored with slapping and Gary is very wet. (He still tears every 5 minutes) at the end of the movie. Did not give anything to both All I can think of is 'I paid 3 pounds for this stack.' I never wrote reviews before. But after watching this movie, it urged me to remind people of this disaster. So please avoid all costs Thanks for reading.
