When you choose a movie, I hope that one thing you have to consider is an actor in a movie that uses their reputation to influence the moral structure of our society in a positive or negative way. This is not a political statement. This is a moral issue that affects society. When comedians / actors talk about sex and racism about teenagers and her father, we should ask ourselves. (I want to support that behavior) or not? In this case, the behavior of Mr. Fox rips at the social fabric that teaches our youth to be from bad behavior, good behavior, from badness to mercy. Mr. Fox should remember that he is just entertainment and there are many things to choose from. Saying that apologizing doesn't make him fall off the hook It will not suit the pain or remove the bad behavior that he spreads to our youth. One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. Do not see what they are part of anymore We can't change But we can stop the reputation we give
