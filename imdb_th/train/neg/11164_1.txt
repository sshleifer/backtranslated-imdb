Really disappointing. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be trying to mimic the 'modern' comedy, but the direction and script is sloppy, sick and grateful for the worst movie tradition. Black is a self-indulgence and takes into account myself ... and other characters are exposed and not equally interested. The boring soundtrack, we are Black's fans (WERE), but none of us can do more. Arrange The climber who was forced at that time Why does he feel that he needs to make this mistake? <br /> <br /> We will not watch his other movies without reading the detailed reviews first! <br /> <br /> He is drunk when He read Script before registering to this drivel
