I'm not nearly hit with other investigators. Of course, it has a pair of cute young women playing vampire, erotic lesbian vampire Marianne Morris and Anulka D. Play these two cute sirens with razor teeth. Who ran down the road on a far road, hitched at their home (at dusk) and invited their victims .... What happened there ... Well, after they took off their shirts and kissed each other Most of them killed the visitors. Information director Jose Ramon Larraz blinking with his camera. Some scenes are quite creepy and can be shot effectively. But only sex does not hold the film (No pun intended ... at least conscious) There are not many stories here. We have two women. We will show an inexplicable and inexplicable starting point which we see them shooting with a pistol. Why? "Why do we have men who stay for many days, greet men at hotels that confirm that they know him many years ago? What is the purpose? Of course, I have more general questions, such as beautiful women who act as vampires in the English countryside. And whether there is a wine cellar full of wine from the Carpathians. However, the script is full of such flaws. To the victims of wine and eating them (quite literally), then going to bed in the basement, eventually going to the exciting scene But it was anti-climatic, as I said, a powerful scene by the director ... I especially like the way girls dress and shoot in the woods to find their prey. The house is the most impressive scene. And both girls are the ones that I say are very cute. Marianne Morris is special - more than one way for you Ex-movie fans, veteran silent screen Bessie Love has a short pendant, the end of the film.
