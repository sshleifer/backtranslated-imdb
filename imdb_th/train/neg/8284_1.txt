Who wrote this story? Some men named John Cohen I guess this is the first screenplay he has ever made. Some people should tell him that you should write a message that looks like something someone might say. <br /> <br /> And who is the director? Scott Marshal, Jerry Marshall's son. My nut fell from the tree. Some people may want him to know that you can shoot a scene in a taxi in New York and it will look realistic and you don't have to fake it with a blue screen without reason. May want him to know that he should stay away from Jessica Simpson But hopefully he will learn that lesson now. <br /> <br /> and Jessica Simpson ... Usually she can't show Hell, she makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn and she also plays in this movie. Oh, wait, her father is the creator. Okay, that's why you are involved. That's the only reason I think. <br /> <br /> Should I be surprised? No, I should be surprised when I see how bad it is. I think a lot of people will if they see it as much as I do. I mean, you expect the movie starring Jessica Simpson will not be good, but this ... It's not only bad, it's the opposite of classic movies. Think of the great Woody Allen movie. This movie is not as good as that movie. Well, it's Anti-Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I didn't have to pay to watch it. I stopped watching. Ten minutes in the cus that I can't go to No doubt I will walk out of the theater sooner. In fact, I wonder if there are 6 people who really see it in the theater and then rest and see everything. This film started not very ludicrously, and then went to the point of being so bad that it became the Chinese water torture. And when the first show ends, you will know that it will only get worse and that is the time you have to go away or kill yourself. <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is under the category. Not as good as it should be used instead of boarding water at Guantanamo Bay Although some people like to swim
