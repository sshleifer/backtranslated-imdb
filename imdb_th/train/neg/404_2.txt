Shortly after watching this movie, I asked the mental abilities of all the actors and actors who accepted the role of Elizabeth Shue as a praised actor, why she had to accept such exaggerated opportunities I have to give credit if the credit is due. Some moments in this movie are unpredictable and quite transitive. But they almost refused to do because of the tendency of the warp character of Kevin Bacon Sebastian Ken. I will not recommend this movie to anyone, man or woman with any form of self-respect.
