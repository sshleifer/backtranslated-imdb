Not even the most enthusiastic followers of the movie might like this movie. (I'm one of them), the minions didn't give any content. It's really a shame as well, because this is the only lengthy movie that the stooge has to do with Curly and one of their efforts is an unlikely pain. afraid The great musical numbers did not help anything short of what they did with the same name, with more laughs.
