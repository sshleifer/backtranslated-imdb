Råzone is an awesome movie! It's very easy. It seems that they are trying to make a movie to show the life of the reel. Just as Zappa did many years ago Unfortunately, Denmark does not have a good young actor. Leon is also a little girl in "krummernes Jul" and Laura is not good enough to play this important role. She played with the spirit many times and this was the destruction of the movie! <br /> <br /> Although I think it's a movie you should see I do not agree that the youth act like this. But I think it can show how it will end if you let the ball down. It is important to support Danish movies and new companies such as "Film Folket"! <br /> All <br /> I think people should see Råzone. Not because it's a great movie But because it is a movie that deals with important themes I still think it is important to point out that there are violent scenes in it and actually in these scenes, Laura is best shown - like the ending she holds a gun!
