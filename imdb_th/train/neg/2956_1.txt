What are you thinking? File: Whoopi Goldberg plays the future policeman who collaborated with Talking Dinosaur (!) For a crime involving a madman who wants to start the ice age again. Strange, straight to the shameful and ridiculous tape, which is a high level concept of finding yourself. Obviously this is the work of the love of Jonathan Betuel, the director of writing. (Which also serves as one of the producers). The end result is anemia for charity. Goldberg's only on-screen appearance can spark good wishes and laughter, no matter how bad the script is. But here you drown and you can see unsatisfactory results. No stars from ****
