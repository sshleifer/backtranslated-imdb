I have nothing compared to a quick flick. But Stephen King's nonsense, which has been refurbished, is too bright and too modern. Plot about a new teenage boy in a small town that is "Sleepwalker" - a sort of cross between vampires and werewolves - and those who eat the blood of virgins. Let's treat a vague mystery. This thriller has The colors and looks that are not suitable, along with almost every atmosphere, are very cute and powerful. But the advantage is that Alice Kridge, as the mother of Kridge's children from "Ghost Story", never freed from the female-filler molding and it was a huge loss that she didn't use more. Her performance is creepy and intense and gives a hint that "Sleepwalker" may be a much better movie with a focal point and a more tight direction. It is beyond the possibilities and commercial driving force with an uneven tone that is drastically changed from thriller to comedy to drama. Stephen King appeared in the cameo as well as director John Landis and Tobe Hooper in real life * 1/2 from ****
