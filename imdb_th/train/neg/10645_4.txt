I have never seen Tarzan movies before, so when I saw it on tele I thought I would give it a shot. Unfortunately I have to say I'm disappointed. Tarzan is over 40 years old and is quite overweight. Not that I would imagine Tarzan looking at And if I didn't think of it while making tea for myself, Tarzan would not yell at his original warbler Tarzan swinging on the tree also disappeared - jumping from vine to vine However, Jane is there - Cheeta Monkey is there. There are some men and guitar there. There is a villain and a good person, with romance ... totally harmless and predictable. Nothing bad, you understand <br /> <br /> May not be the best movie to introduce Tarzan: 4/10
