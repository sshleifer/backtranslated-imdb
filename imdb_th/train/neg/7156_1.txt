Dooohhh! Bwainn My Hurrrts! Of course, after testing the film's endurance The way in the world I managed to go without having to press the fast forward button, God knows. <br /> <br /> May be me !! Maybe I didn't get the evidence of the movie ... or maybe I didn't feel it was a mysterious atmosphere. In my humble opinion, although this film has a mysterious atmosphere as much as traveling to McDonalds, <br /> <br /> In addition, every character is scary and has developed characters in the cartoon Tom & Jerry Yaarrrghhh! Why am I doing it? Why do I see rags like this? It's enough to escape once and join the monastery or foreign troops !! YAARGH !! Movies that are absolutely terrifying in every way Other than that, it's not bad.
