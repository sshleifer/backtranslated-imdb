This stupid and unbelievable story has been ransomed by the opening scene that the police detective who was being quacked for a voice that almost heard has confirmed our greatest fear: he was dead. Perhaps this film will be received. Rescuing the director from forgetting Martinez's amazing star power in favor of an anonymous actor who is full of grief in a short time. None of hacking Tor out of the road may be delivered as a film dishwasher is unlikely to be a gangster to kill someone by dropping stones into the mines to unsuspecting divers. His time was short His promise is great. Maybe we will be treated according to the time shown on this screen by those who are not sure if there is a bad movie sequel.
