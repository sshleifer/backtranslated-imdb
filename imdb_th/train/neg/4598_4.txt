The stage director's wife in London hoped to repair the American singer and dancer who starred in the latest show of her husband, along with an American woman acquaintance, who made her a fashion model in the social community. Unfortunately, both couples met by themselves, with the young woman thinking that this man was a producer who married her friend. (The fact that he did not wear a wedding ring should cause misunderstandings) Finally, the Wafty Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers was dragged back into the world by Dwight Taylor and allan Scott's stupid script. Children and youth behavior Astaire and Rogers not only 'Meet the cuteness' - They meet funny. (He danced like a madman in a hotel suite above her and she complained.) The audience in 1935 might not be interested in how they could gather - as long as they do and are happy. As you see today, the main character doesn't seem to have the motivation to be in each other's arms: he embraces her with flowers. (After telling his friends that he wanted to be in "free love" in the love department) and she gave the brush. Nothing that little dancing could not cure! This attractive twosome has unrealistic intentions like setting up in London and Venice. But we only see because the prospect is Fred and Ginger It is a fantasy for people who don't have people who don't care about foolish things. The musical moment will destroy the monotony of the planned scene. But failed to overcome the foolishness around ** from ****
