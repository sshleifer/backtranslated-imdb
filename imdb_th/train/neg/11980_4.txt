This was marred by a great race that could be cut very short. <br /> <br /> The opening of the race lost the Legion of Doom, but I guess the only way they will be eliminated by Demolition is twice as much. DQ Otherwise, Mr. Perfect would have to work overtime. Kerry von Erich won the IC championship here and this is the third ppv in the row with Perfect jobbed. Remember that before this he never lost the match. > <br /> The second match is great. Ted DiBiase and Under A great taker while Jim Neidhart had one of his WWF highlights. Honky Tonk Man Koko B. Ware continued his tradition of being the first to put on a new heel. (Remembered as the big boss and Yokosuka?) This is a snapshot of Brett Hart's solo career, as he returns from two to one and almost survives the race. He and DiBiase join. The wrestling clinic made us forget that the point of the competition was DiBiase's dreary feud with Dusty Rhodes. <br /> <br /> Although the visionary is the first team whose members have survived (and the second Since '87 to None survived four) competition is not squash. This is the longest race tonight, and Jake repeats his '88 performance when he is left alone with four men and dominates. I think he can actually get upset. Today the competition will end again. <br /> <br /> One of the shortest matches of the SS is one of the most surprising matches. May be the lowest-priced wrestler ever. Tito Santana is an inspiring wrestler at night wearing war colors and pinning Boris Zukhov, Tanaka and even the warlords in the last surviving match. It was strange to see him overwhelmingly, then returned to use his mediocre career. Sgt. Killing was well done. Removal of Volkoff and Bushwhackers. But that's not a strange thing. The pairing of survival is that Hogan and the warriors win together at the end. <br /> <br /> This list is boring and the competition is also short. The debut of the Undertaker is great, but Tito Santana is the reason I will The thing to remember is
