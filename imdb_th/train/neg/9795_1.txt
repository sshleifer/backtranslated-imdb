Come to the agreement with this program. How are Power Rangers? I always felt that the acting that was brought from Japan in a better way had been a great thing in Japan and became one of the most ridiculous and ridiculous excuses in toy sales history! This show has no point at all. <br /> <br /> Bad hairstyles, bad dresses, earrings and others all show the ridiculous things in the 1990s from both stupid groups and skulls. To "duhs", from the main actors, Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say something: let me stop! <br /> <br /> Saban brought this thing from Japan and Disney. Buy the rights to this show five years ago. <br /> <br /> Now, the public must endure this repetition in the Disney channel. And so <br /> <br /> All I can say again. Is to give me a break!
