It's like you use the common theme of The Usual Suspects and Fightclub to bring their style and class to mix with the awesome new wave. "I am a knowledgeable person, so my movie must be hard." Mash the junk in a few special forms for a good measure. At the end, there you have a pistol. <br /> <br /> Yes, I think about it. A little after watching and yes, it's kind. <br /> <br /> Wasted money. <br /> <br /> Being there as the worst movie I've ever seen, even though it is. Any new matter
