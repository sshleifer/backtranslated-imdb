The sun should be on this movie forever. <br /> <br /> It continues forever. (Which is not a bad thing - the British patient Schindler's name), but it's boring The age of the actors is unbelievable and the story is never ending, which seems to be nowhere. <br /> <br /> In short, talent and movies are wasted
