For the beginner, I want to say that I am a big fan of American Pie series, even though 'bare miles' and this is the second worst. But this seems to be the collapse of the entire series. <br /> <br /> First of all, the best part of the movie is that it's always an admired American Pie movie. <br /> <br /> However There are many bad things to say about this movie. First of all, the story has a very 'arch' structure. The first is the introduction of the character. Then the promise of Beta House and the last is the Greek Olympics. Each is 25 minutes long. In addition to the general chaos of the plot, there is still little character development, which makes it a bad plot twice. <br /> <br /> Besides that I don't like the pattern in this movie. That is to show that the athlete is a person who is cool and has sex thinking only and clearly shows inferiority. It also shows that women are just sex objects and males are just wanting to treat women as sex objects. <br /> <br /> In addition, the performance is not good as well. Perhaps the exception of Steve Talley. <br /> <br /> So in the end, horror movies are generally viewed from an important perspective. If viewed from the perspective of a teenager, I think it will be better. But this movie has ranked 18+ in most countries, so minors should not be seen
