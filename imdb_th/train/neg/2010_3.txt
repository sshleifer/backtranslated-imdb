Oh, it's a movie - I think I waited too long to take the dog away ... I can't believe that I watched everything. I guess I expect optimism that it will improve. A frighteningly separate dialog box, pathetic performances and all unlikely events Like Toby's mother who hung herself at the time of using Col, went upstairs and returned to the room with a 24-inch ceiling and without a counter chair or anything that was not moving around her. The little girl who plays the daughter of the last family is the best actor in both movies and the puppy of the first couple is very close. The basic story has potential, and with good chapters and directors, it may be a terrifying story. But this version is not sad. I am more afraid when I open the electricity bill every month.
