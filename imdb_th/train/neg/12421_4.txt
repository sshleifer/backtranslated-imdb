Mark Pirro's "Deathrow Gameshow" game in 1987 is a black comedy that has many jokes in many parts, but sometimes it's very funny. This movie is probably much better. The performance is quite bad and some wonderful scenes make it difficult to see sometimes. But this concept is funny and has a fun time. <br /> <br /> In the near future (1991) the game list has changed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) hosts a game show called "Live Or Die". In which prisoners who were sentenced to death have the opportunity to play for their lives and for money Candidates who fail to receive air executions using a variety of methods, such as guillotine, electric chairs and others. More strange executions, followed by applause from the audience in the cheering room. Of course, acting is more than an argument and Chuck has created many enemies ... <br /> <br /> "Deathrow Gameshow" is amazing and terrifying in many ways and the performance is terrible. But it was terrible No doubt it's fun in many parts, especially if you're a big fan of humor. You didn't miss anything if you didn't see it. But it was funny and was a good time 4/10
