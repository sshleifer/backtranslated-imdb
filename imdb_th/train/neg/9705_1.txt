I saw the movie as a child when it was screened in the cinema and it was so bad that it became a joke for the family. If the rating has zero, this film will be received. The dinosaurs are scary. Nonsense story Actually, there is no qualification to be called acting. The only reason I remember the name of the movie well is because my family still talks about how BAD is.
