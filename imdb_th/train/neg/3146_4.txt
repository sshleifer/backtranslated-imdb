The author of the book using the same name should not have her name applied to this film. If you have read the book, this film uses the free meaning of the real events in the book and its spirit that movies and books seem to have the same thing except the names and superficial details The movie does not add anything in terms of art for the literary success of the book. <br /> <br /> For those who do not read books: You will be disappointed. Not only plot But moving at an incredibly slow speed, it does not give anything more than when it moves slowly (Such as character development, etc.) Some viewers may be entertained by some lesbian scenes in this movie. But you may see a special show time for what they perform in Tessa and Isabelle.
