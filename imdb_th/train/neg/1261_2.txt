I am a Jean Harlow fan because she is a star. I don't think her movie is good and I don't think she will be a good actor. But she is a great comedian Every joke in the The Girl from Missouri is great, but this movie may be more like a love story than Jean Harlow is great in this story and you can forget the rest of the actors - their performances are nothing new I was very impressed that Harlow's beautiful body was a sick woman. In this movie, she looks beautiful.
