This cowardly and nasty movie makes me interested in starting with The characters are familiar expelled young men, often seen hanging around bored in the seaside city. Robert is an outsider But he has his music which may be his soul But the soil made Robert become a madman who began to travel to marijuana and joy and entered the wrong crowd. It seems that Clay will believe in "madness" and Robert ends the film as a murderer. One wondered how much the real life experience of this director was. No one can help the poor Robert. The soil gives us a message that the young British man cannot control. There is an unbelievable link to the Iraqi insurgents. During unnecessary rape, we have to face the explosion and the image of war. This film demonstrates the mania that has been pushed to the limit. The young bomber plane in London draws parallel to the man's image that shows the hatred of Clay Clay. From violent violence It is surprising that the British film industry allowed to invest in films that support such indivisible propaganda when in London. This is Clay's first movie. I would be glad if it was his last story.
