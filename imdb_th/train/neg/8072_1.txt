(A possible spoiler or two) <br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" may be the worst movie ever released. There is nothing reasonable. There is something about a woman with a strange vision of someone who may die or die. The whole movie is just a random picture, many things that are not bound together at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting without an identity, camera jerks, and very confusing scripts makes the movie more difficult. > <br /> What are you waiting for? To tie the movie together But nothing comes The worst movie of this year, of course - **** 1/2 stars.
