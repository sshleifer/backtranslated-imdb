When I saw the first ten episodes, I had to say that this program is terrible. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing is filming in Canada. I know it's cheaper But they should be filmed in California so we should have scenes in the desert That will be more true to the movie. The first scene they were outside in another world was in a mountain with many pine trees that it looked cold. That doesn't feel very Egyptian. Things that work very well in movies are felt like being in ancient Egypt. It feels like they are running around fighting aliens in Canada. And it is obviously lame that on other planets, the fall also comes You can see the leaves on the ground in a forest that looks like a forest outside Vancouver. It makes the show more unbelievable and dumb. <br /> <br /> Then there was Richard Dean Anderson. He's not Kurt Russell. Of course he did a good job and he tried to imitate Russell's performance a little. But he is not as cool as Russell And not as good as the actors like Russel and Russell O'Neill's playing methods, he was more insulting than the Andersons. O Neil was too soft. I like the Russels version that does not give the sound of S. and there is no problem in igniting the bomb until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks works well like Jackson, even though he came from James Spader. br /> <br /> Teal'c is a really annoying character. He is Jaffa, not Jaffa. Just Jaffa Aaaarrgh !! The former bodyguard of the pathetic Ra character can only be seen in the pilot and in other episodes. Until now, Teal'c talks about speaking and acting like a robot. I have seen better performances from Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> And the fact that Teal'c and the characters Ra and the people they recorded in the movie can speak English immediately. As well as stupid. What makes the aliens scary in the movie is that they speak an ancient language and are real monsters. <br /> <br /> For special effects, they are good at pilots. But the effects that are very rare in real performances are poorly done and look cheap. Especially the planets they visit with crystals Obviously they walked around on the sound stage with bad paintings in the background. It is an insult to us that makes them very insulting. Especially when they can make the bluescreen screen with the background cgi. <br /> <br /> The X file has a better effect when they first aired in 1993. That is 4 years before SG-1 will Beginning and they don't have a budget of two million dollars per episode when SG-1 anticipates they have to spend all the money in the banquet. Because I didn't see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Incredibly boring and ridiculous performances that might be great if they were filming a show in Hollywood with a higher budget. And better writers and characters
