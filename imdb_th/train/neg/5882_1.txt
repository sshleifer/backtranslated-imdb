Not sure why this movie was advertised as a comedy full of humor. There is not much in this movie that will entertain and not like watching movies. Annette Benning (Which the performance was dubbed as the Oscar) came out here with courtesy of her performance as a recurring character. Brian Cox's characters were confusing and annoying and the leader of the play Augusten Joseph Ross seems to have no personality to do his job. The best thing about this movie is Evan Rachel Wood, but she is not enough to endorse boring and unsightly movies. <br /> <br /> The film quickly disappeared and it seems logical. Good I found some nasty scenes (the scenes with Brian Cox and his used bathroom are the worst scenes in 'You and Me and everyone we know' and 'The Squid and the Whale'). They are not stable I found that the whole experience was a waste of time. Don't you waste time?
