A group of aliens that are looking for humans to the world to eat the land falling on the planets of prehistoric animals instead of where they all eat mushrooms that are shaped like bodies. Full of images from "Planet of the Dinosuars" and awesome jokes. This is something you can't miss. The show is also brutal, and at the moment it's not as bad. "Chic boxer" (What can this movie be?) This is also a nasty story. It takes 90 minutes to feel like an eternity and you may have to curse your life. So do yourself. To be a favorite and move forward with this crappy movie, nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers Trying to sell this carcass into a MST3K style that makes fun of the movies they had created ten years ago, and it works as well as it doesn't have anything to watch. > <br /> My grade: D- <br /> <br /> Special DVD: Funny comments, 17 behind the scenes features; 7 minutes to black features Jessica Mills Report; Slide gallery; And original samples
