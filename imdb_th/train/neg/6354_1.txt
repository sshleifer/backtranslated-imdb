Woody Allen loses the ability to write conversations or characters that are different from each other. This is the case of "Melinda and Melinda" in which all the characters speak to those who are complex and have problems and perspectives that are not related to anyone outside the four-block radius that Allen lives. They also have the same strange condition that can buy a multi-million dollar Manhattan apartment that looks like it was designed by a professional decorator, regardless of financial status or things. They do to earn a living. <br /> <br /> The characters that are outside of this boring idea are Will Ferrel as the representative of Woody Allen, who is authorized. Although he not only But came out to just impress Woody Allen (eg Kenneth Branagh in "Great God" celebrity) Ferrel lacked the charm or charm that Woody had when he played the role of his best movie. < br /> <br /> The result is another tedious story from a great filmmaker who has been trading his reputation for many years.
