I will give 1 in 10 of this film, if not for ms. The performance of Claudine Barretto and I will use this time to overlook Chris Aquino here and ... end <br /> <br /> me I like to watch Pinoy's horror movie because the story lacks originality and I think that some writers (people) don't give enough attention to the characters (redundant ??) as if they were 'pushing' movies Go when their story stinks And my goodness, creative exhaustion, why do they copy other films? Why does this movie get a good review ?? I will not give that much merit. This movie is a horrible genre. But this movie looks more strange as it relates to Filipino villagers ... It enters my category that is most likely to happen. I just hope that they will spend more time improving the story and editing those sequences. It's okay. If the light sucks, it won't matter if the content will disappoint you .. SAYANG
