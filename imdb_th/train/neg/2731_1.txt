Not really good and easiest when I've seen .... Ever <br /> <br /> They try to do it by giving 'We know we are doing this.' That would be a joke, if not because of the fact that 'The Simpsons' has already been done and it still doesn't give up if they think at first. <br /> <br /> The incident is part of the normal imagination of the character (mostly of JD). The incident does not even the actual event that occurs. Just gather, say, JD fell down or I do not know .... Elliott fell. down If I want to watch the Scrubs collection, I will go to youtube and don't waste half an hour of my life. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, scrubbing falls into the trap that most sitcoms have to do. I can go 5 and four seasons without any episodes like this. <br /> <br /> I hope that Scrubs doesn't have to be a sitcom like that. <br /> <br /> And it's an idea. That has passed, why the hell is bald. Dr.Cox
