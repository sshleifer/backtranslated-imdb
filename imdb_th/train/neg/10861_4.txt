Maybe I lack something because I read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than I read the bad reviews - and I didn't understand. I like my noirs to have a little style. For them with characters that speak and act like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura. There is no character in this film that has style or identity or whatever you want. g the call As the lead actor Lee Jaebob The flashy look and his body roll is far from the simple master of Noir that talks smoothly as you will find or use Jane Wyatt as a femme fatale as another example. This is one of the worst cases of abortion I have seen for a while. She doesn't believe in the role at all. <br /> <br /> For this story, it's tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre. I can predict the result of The Man who cheats himself after about five minutes. And the last cat and mouse chase scenes are boring, ten to fifteen minutes old. Nothing really happened and then destroying the movie, walking around, may have gone.
