This movie makes the Canadians and Brit become stupid and stupid. The men are drunk / drunk and they yell / strike in almost every scene Are women extravagant about it? I do not understand what they have for? They spend every scene causing noise or worse. Obviously, a Canadian woman is a vagrant, rude, or quarreling with hippie chicks. It was a fan who fell to the standards of her loser boyfriend and the ridicule of his wicked mother that we had seen in countless movies before. <br /> <br /> Every character here is Childhood pattern Not to mention that they all seem like they need a shower! And the idea of ​​any scene that shows having sex with George Wendt ?? The shiver is enough to make everyone gag! I watched this movie because Samuel West was there? But I do not understand why he accepted this role Perhaps he wants money. Ian Tracey is a great actor - the only one with a vague redemption period. But his talents are lost here. <br /> <br /> The rest of the plot: The three imbeciles try to pull back - or Carl ?? Who is the dead, but who is the living character in the minds of those who are left behind? (Almost like Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, although I'm ashamed to think of comparing these two films) Carl expresses great regret that you find the situation of death. <br /> <br /> At the end of this tragic movie, I think they all would be better off going with him on that boat!
