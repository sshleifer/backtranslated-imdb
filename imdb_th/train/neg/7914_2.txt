This movie is due to be a blockbuster movie and is true. This is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn and watch the flashy graphics. Considering this, the film may not deliver like the flashy Iron Man, but it is enough. In addition to the action of chewing popcorn and special effects, this film quickly fell out of the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote. <br /> <br /> Many viewers gathered themselves. But that makes this film badly adapted, not a poor movie This film is not satisfactory for other reasons. Manufacturers focus on making it more visually appealing than they do to the mind. The characters that have been waiting for a long time and are promoted to 4 images. The main characters of Wolverine, Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the movie) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was surprised by the performance of Liev Schriber. The remaining characters were thrown along the way to avoid all important eyes. Wolverine's characters were fully developed after 30 minutes, just like the Sabertooth. The surprise came at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> "The last boss" of this movie is a movie adaptation. The original character and hardly any development will show why he is the way he is. The filmmakers feel that what they really need is to create a bad character that can do everything they want and hit the name of the popular character. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ...
