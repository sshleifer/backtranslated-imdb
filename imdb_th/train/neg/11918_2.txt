This seems to be a good movie. I think it's going to be a good movie and throughout the movie. I hope it will take meaningful time. Truly commendable But despite the full effort, the film still lacks the meaningful message that seems to be something Somnath Sen tries to do. The final point came short and the ending seemed unsatisfactory after what had happened; A bit like real life in that respect But movies that are not like real life will end in about 2 hours and the ending should make the audience satisfied if that is the director's intention This is the most disappointing thing for me. <br /> <br /> Another aspect about me is typing an American stereo character of an American character - they all seem to be carved from the same block. For me, it seems that most American characters in British Indian movies depend on how the general Indian people look at themselves as Americans, and clearly don't have Any attempt to bring a sense of depth or complexity to the Americans in Film /> <br /> both sides together they made disappointing.
