I can't say anymore that saying that this movie is terrible. All Chinese being awakened in your well-being because your ancestors are difficult to sell. But telling the audience that all Chinese people know Chinese history without having to study even laughable stories. That's like saying that all Americans know the history of America without having to study or the Philippines, etc. It's unbelievable. <br /> <br /> That story is nasty. It talks about Chin coming from a monastery in China - later identified by Bejing. However, the early sequence of this film shows a map that focuses on Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese regime wants to claim in areas such as Mongolia for themselves. But it is a different country and still labeled "Mongolia" on the Disney Studios map, failing in the 5th grade geography? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is excellent. But she felt linked to him Her training is also wonderful. And to cut the chase: everything about this movie is not good It's terrible to laugh at and cry. The action of Taekwondo ends in many unrealistic and unrealistic play. <br /> <br /> The evil eye is wonderful. However, the left end is the only thing about it. They should leave the evil eye in there. But instead of being beaten any way yey! <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not worth the time of the dog in the movie. Brenda Song should go to another studio "F"
