So it came to this. Fast and expensive cars that are only 1% on top to drive. Girls posted next to them in the gear magazine. Second level actor and without name Cheap promotions that appear by people from a specific culture <br /> <br /> This is the garbage that Hollywood has to offer. Don't understand me wrong. I like to flick the action unconscious with the chicks that are as hot as the next guy. But please, the most environmentally friendly Braintrust will stop this. Stop counting to ten breaths. Happy. "Woooooosaaaaaah" then go back twenty years and think about what makes the movie fun once. If so, will some movies be like that again? <br /> <br /> I don't have anything against poker. But all the pop culture bombs that they received in the last five years are ridiculous. Everyone and their mother thinks that it is unbiased now. (Not half of them even received that reference). Some executives said "Hey, do you want to remove the demographic group $ 9.50?" "I know the market 18-35." "Okay, let's give women poker and fast cars." "Great ideas." Results? The movie that I saw late at night, Spike TV and more often not starring Dolph Lundgren. <br /> <br /> Now, don't understand me. An excellent flick like The English Patient does not float my boat. But a general movie that should not be created to match the DVD disrupts my mind as well. There is only a teenage gear head that will only get their engine updated and I think what is at the highest level of their IQ range will see this thing for what it is: antiques.
