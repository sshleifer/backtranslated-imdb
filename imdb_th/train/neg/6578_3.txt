Hybrid without rotation of "Cruel Intentions" and "Wild Things" but not as good as these classic junk It's about Acting sheriff, Artie (Taye Diggs) being summoned to investigate a near-death overdose at the upper class univesity. But to maintain it to a lower level As he digs deeper, he thinks it is more than just the first glance that seems to be We follow Alicia, a girl who takes an overdose in the incident as well, about 90 minutes. If this film is welcomed to start, it will make it deteriorate. This movie definitely brings something new to the table. But it's also the only movie that doesn't have the top part of Miss Swain, so the grade will be higher for that. <br /> <br /> My grade: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dominique Swain gets naked (correct mistakes of "Happy Campers"); Another girl has no part in her heart. <br /> <br /> Anti-eye candy: There are more men than women ass.
