Revised and confounded the original version of Man On Fire's screen, at least ten years ago, when it was created and the past year did not make it better. This is a type of movie that manufacturers have too much money and too little experience to get attention, and everyone just pays the outstanding support or their drug dealers with Scott Glenn's bodyguards to go out. Save his life A young daughter who was kidnapped by a wealthy Italian family Interesting actors - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce - do better. The action is quite sluggish and sparse, and only the best score of John Scott. One positive impression that remake (done by Tony Scott, the original director's choice in this version) is an improvement.
