It's almost worth watching this horrifying "movie", just knowing that I can't touch this bad thing again. Actors - 0, scripts - 0, fighting scenes - 0, leading actors Man-0 (Cheddar, Bob, from eight miles as a gentle war hero that makes this girl) Nadia Bjorlin-10. This is the criterion I use to find the average of two. I lost count But I believe that there has been an ancient idea in this movie When the driver who killed her father miraculously appeared at the end to compete with her from nowhere, it will seize the previous statement. Including he just appeared without reason He never mentioned before. I don't know what to say here Just watch it when it comes out on TV in a couple of years. At least there are some solutions for ads.
