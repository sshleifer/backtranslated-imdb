This is an idea that is an important work of the open source community, which is remarkable and screams at the world media to observe that we are not trapped in marketing with our choices. After downloading the basic version (Big fan here on dial-up modem) Finally arrived here. I hit my first hurdle. Media Player, Mplayer Classic & winamp can't be opened in my xp box. Then Totem, xine & kaffeine can't. Open it on my suse server. Mplayer manages to run it flawlessly. It will be difficult to publish this word if the general user cannot open it ... <br /> <br /> Beautiful soundtrack movies, excellent lighting, expert camera work and complete textures. model Everything looks realistic Then the two main characters moved .... and said ... and the movie died for me. Everything other than lip sync and real animation of the two main characters (except Proog in the dance scene) looks slim and totally lively. The two main characters did not move well until I sometimes wondered if there were any games in the market at the moment that had a more realistic cut-scene. <br /> <br /> Any frames In the movie is excellent .. As a frame and this is great if there are no active actors. I'm glad I didn't recommend this to anyone. I will destroy my reputation. <br /> <br /> Oh and fantasy. Finally, there is a follow-up plot and more plans. <br /> <br /> This movie will receive 10 stars if not for The tragedy that occurred on the screen
