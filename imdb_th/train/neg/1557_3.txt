This film is a string of boring ancient ideas that do not really have a deep cross-cultural understanding. Traveling in the Middle East can be described as annoying, especially: there are mud brick villages, desert soil, women wearing black robes and belly dancers. I wonder how the camels and palm trees disappeared from the whole picture. The characters of the two main characters were clumsy and many unreliable situations. <br /> <br /> The original concept might be interesting. But at the end of the day, if you are looking for cultural insights, you should skip this movie.
