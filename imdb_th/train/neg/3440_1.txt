Never watched this movie ... It was the biggest division of sh * te that I had encountered all my life. And that's what it says The show's story and filming are extremely scary. This is the worst movie in the world !!! Seriously, it doesn't make you popular due to my 99p price from sainsburys and it was created in 2005 only? Hahaha. This movie is like a cheap college movie. You can see the camera at the corner of the screen .... Even if you really want to watch it, you have to watch. "The scary shark scene" ... may be the best scene in the show. I've seen in my life ... haha, I mean seriously. This is the biggest waste 2 1/2 hours ever !!
