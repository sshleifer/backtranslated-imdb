I don't even know where to start. "It's a family affair." That must be the worst conversation that has ever been in the movie "Horror", even though it's not a horror movie, though it will try !!! Ugh!!! And I know Owen Wilson is a better actor He wants to stop playing tokens that have died in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). After that, the man wrote "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore". He has special abilities. In addition, Lily Taylor should adhere. Next to indie movies She has no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There is no room for acting that is legal for you. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
