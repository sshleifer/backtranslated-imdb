The screenwriter tries to create a new "magician", but put blah-blah love stories that make you sick instead of making you participate. There is no content in this entire movie. But it exploded by acting. Many people shouted about things that no one was interested in. Very boring. I wanted to leave the theater when I saw this. But the dumb movie ticket is expensive, so I have to endure the boring torture that feels like it lasts forever. There is nothing on the screen that links relevance back to what the characters say. <br /> <br /> They use computer graphics here instead of making me sad. (As intended, I hate CGI) Just destroy the movie even more. Some people say that this movie made horror movies in the cinema because "Stimulating thoughts" and "Slow aggression without action - because it is a genius movie" is something that is clever or thought provoking when the story is basically About Pretty Boy Eath Ledger is a priest who has love, interest and disobedience to his religion? It seems like a concept that doesn't get attention. Oh and there are some mumbo jumbo about "sinners" (at first the movie is called "sinners"). The concept of a lame person. But this movie is serious about "sin-eating" too much, making the movie look pathetic and mistaken as dark and intelligent. Yes, I know that people are really sinful in the Middle Ages. But this movie makes it sound scary. <br /> <br /> There's nothing in this movie that was executed and I forgot why I had to watch this movie. If you want a deep horror movie, watch Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant, Naked Blood, Society, Cannibal Holocaust, Pin, Exorcist, Omen or Romero's "Dead Trilogy" Romero's movie. clever But mainstream movie fans think that although (The same type of people who think that ridiculous movies like Hulk are a movie masterpiece) If you want incredible horror horror, watch the command. This movie makes the church seem like a roller coaster ride.
