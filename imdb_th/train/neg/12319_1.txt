I felt that I had just watched the movie snuff .... The thing that made out was beautiful, tight, obsessed and scary! It took two hours to distort the meaning in the most basic and comprehensive terms, violence and torture, rape, destruction, incest, corruption, burial. There is no redemption and I am entertained. I can't stop watching What does this say about me about the people who created and operated in this kind of story and the world that became meaningless movies until finally the true scent movie became the norm And I am not a mess or without humor. I do not try to hide from the darkness and I do not have a sheltered life. But I am ashamed of myself And I am sorry to see the English cousin drag the drain of the kind that my tribe made It doesn't have to be cozy, but it must be indulged in sadism instead?
