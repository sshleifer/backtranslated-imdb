You probably don't expect this movie to be a good thing, but it's not a budget. There is a special violent zombie movie, taken with a cell phone camera that doesn't look good ... and it's hilarious. Done before and it shows in their horrible hilarious reading There is no storyline to see the small plot that I can find. It seems that the government's experiments have escaped and a group of zombies seem to make two families fear. The impact of blood is the most disgusting fact I've ever seen. It seems that the effects of Gore broke into the butcher shop for various parts of the body, and many scenes involved zombies that separate people and eat their organs. It's a funny and nasty movie, and it's as bad as you can get in every movie. <br /> <br /> My score: BOMB / **** 90 minutes.
