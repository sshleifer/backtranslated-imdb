Three Russian aristocrats absorbed the decay of Monte Carlo, even though they had reached their final franc. In order to support their extravagant lifestyles, the three use counterfeit and banknote services in the casino hoping to exchange counterfeit currency to receive jackpot. Andrew Hughes, US diplomat, arrived in Monaco with Helen, his wife, and the three men decided to make a colleague with visitors, hoping to receive financial help. One of the three Russians is Count Sergius. Karamzin plans to continue by heading to Helen continuously while the disappointing Count's housekeeper, who loves Sergius, finally handles the situation with three nobles Obviously, Von Stroheim tried to convey the message. (With the stupidity of American women and inappropriate behavior of the nobility) instead of telling the story and the film can easily penetrate modern targets like me Even the best performances in EvS later, such as Greed and Wedding March, are just a stone mill here. This film may be used to improve at various levels.
