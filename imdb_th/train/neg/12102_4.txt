This film is only interpreted by Bill Maher's religion. There are many funny moments and there are some interesting issues. But do not expect to talk about religion This is what I think is the worst documentary - everything is prepared in advance and edited for the director's sake instead of making your own decision. <br /> <br /> Editing - It's been shuffled. And refined with clips from pop culture and media to enhance the point The interviewer had almost no chance to finish the sentence before he was interrupted by a correction. Only people who have a fair chance of speaking, their thoughts are those who say what Bill Maher wants them to say. When people deviate from the gospel according to Maher, they will be resolved. <br /> <br /> Interviews - They mean being the most extremist religious representative. From the gospel news on TV to the image of the best Jews to the TRUCK STOP church (seriously, as the TRUCK STOP Church). He chose the worst money collector, the big extremists and people who had no budget to deny. And when he got a good person to interview, he solved the hell Especially the heavy attack is Muslims On the part of Muslims, he hardly gives anyone the opportunity to speak before interrupting them by themselves or fixing them with suicide bombs. All Muslims have acted as extremists in the revision, and no interviewer has been corrected fairly. <br /> <br /> The end - the message at the end is very incredible and while It's interesting The idea is not presented with justice to many people who are not religious. Bill Hur describes himself as a devastating clip playing in front of him. This caused the message that religion was stupid and dangerous and that it would destroy the world. In addition, he said that everyone involved in religion is a fool But knowing that going inside it was a one-sided view of religion. Bill Maher's view, he didn't find anything. He tells you what he thinks. <br /> <br /> 4/10 - Good time. But it is a very irresponsible documentary work
