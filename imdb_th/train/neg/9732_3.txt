First, lead to Brad Dourif as KOOK. If you try to make this movie seriously, I guarantee that he will destroy it for you. If you are not too serious about him, he should enjoy watching. I like the scene in which Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - while dodging a beam of fire from his arm in the car. Another great scene is seeing John Landis as a disgusting radio producer and killing all the rooms. In fact, I found that the last 15 minutes of this movie was a ridicule to not stop - I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper means it or not.
