"There was this bride, she saw, and she was crushed to death by this statue that fell on her on her wedding day. Then received a year later, her former fiancee fell in love with a beautiful psychic ?? Then the beautiful heart will be haunted by the grumpy dead bride who wants her from stealing her boyfriend. He will be hilarious! "Politely laughing. <br /> <br /> This thing, I like to imagine Jeff Lowell. The man who dreamed of" Over Her Dead Body "presented his concept in the studio there at New Line Cinema. The great mystery is how those big companies can turn right and the green light project makes Lowell able to direct the film and write the script. <br /> <br /> Because if you think there is no movie Probably not as good as this original sound is clear, you have other ideas. The only way that it may work is if the author is crazy and becomes a controversial joke. Rather than want to make sure that he has sent a vague, romantic, dangerous, and warm romantic movie, Lowell participates in a dull half-step drill every step to reduce the irrationality to support A boring meeting. In fact, "Over Her Dead Body" is very inefficient and there is no difference until it is difficult to know where Lowell thinks he has gone with it. Every funny and funny story in this film looks flat and is incredibly executed, even the actors are still aware of their situation. Is there any other way to explain the lifeless and lifeless Paul Rudd performance, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? <br /> <br /> I choose not to blame the actors, some of whom have proved their abilities in vehicles better than in the past. (That is especially the case of Rudd) But Lowell and those studio executives are sure that there are some 'splainin' to do.
