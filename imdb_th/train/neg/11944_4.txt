I rented this movie because I thought it was sad that I saw it when I was a kid in 1959. It wasn't so I was very disappointed with what I felt was acting, marginalization, poor character development and most importantly Can not emphasize the relationship between children and dogs in this version ... "Dog of Flanders" cute "together" in the movie. Get version 1959!
