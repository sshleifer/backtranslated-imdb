This movie is really boring. It was banned in the Chinese cinema and I can see why. Not because it is important for the communist regime But just because the movies are of low quality I don't want to pay to see this I love movies from Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou and I am also disappointed that poor movies will come out of China. It seems that it doesn't appeal to the audience and the director seems to create a movie for himself. The image of someone standing there doing nothing in one minute is hilarious and there are many. Movie and video quality is incredibly bad. I watched this movie on the internet and it seems that people really like this movie. The only explanation I have for this story is that some movies think that if this movie isn't in English, it's good automatically. I don't see the reason why people like this. This is not an art film that loses celluloid. (That is, if they shoot it on a film that they don't do)
