There is no character in this movie and shows that this incompetent hacker, the director, wants to learn how much his craft is. All of his characters in this movie look unique and I care less. The best point in this movie is the end credits and the shower time after hours. After this, I felt so dirty that I lost money with a foul load. Hey genius .... triads and yakuza come from two different places. Know something about Asian culture The dog scene here feels freeze and useless. This DVD is very useful. I like the new roller coaster. <br /> <br /> So kids don't have to pay for this hostel instead.
