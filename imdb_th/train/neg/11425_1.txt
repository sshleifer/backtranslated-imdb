I don't know what it is about the movie that makes me react to it clearly. Maybe it is a nasty character and not interesting enough to be interested. Maybe it's a messy story. Perhaps it is the fact that Rob Lowe wears long earrings and eyeliner. Probably because in some parts of the movie, they all sing together. Probably because the 80s had never been like that in the 80s, probably because everything was plump. It may be because the character pumped his fist while driving from the camera while he was fading away. I don't know what it is that makes me hate it. But if it means trying again, I'm not willing to search.
