Unfortunately, the only spoiler in this review is nothing to spoil about the film, although B. Mattei never made any masterpiece that he used to work with humor and madness. Made him the director of Eurotrash. Fun. But in the last 10 years, it seems like he is losing it. This film is empty, nothing to wake us from the deep sleep that you sink after. 1 0 minutes, no sex, no blood (It's probably a story about snuff?) No actors, no dialogue, not as good as 90'TV movies. It's worse than his last poem and zombies. So rest peacefully. Bruno, you'll always be in our hearts. Go Gems: Zombi 3, Robowar, Rats, L'altro inferno, viruses, cruel jaw and a few others This But if you don't Do not know that a good craftsman's career, follow his old movies and be happy
