Maiden Voyage is like that. I want to say that I watched 5 minutes before I couldn't stand it. As already mentioned in other comments, this movie does not fall into "bad things". The performance is terrible. Even the sucker still has "bag guy guards" and seems to hold their weapons like a water gun. <br /> <br /> Don't even watch this movie. How low are your expectations? You will still be disappointed.
