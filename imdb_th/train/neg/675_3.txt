Meg Tilly's girl receives a terrifying phone call from her mother and shakes in an intriguing way. Go home, return to her family's country house only to face the mystery: why all the villagers act in strange ways Strange and unstable? The radiation thriller, which is almost a nod to ecology, has a small town that is berserk, which includes two women staring at each other with desire in a public place. The image looks too stupid for words, losing Tilly's curiosity and quiet violence on the trash while compelling himself to be in an unexpected angle from Some of the movies of Thomas Del Ruth are good scenes (especially the fire scene in the garage), although he is cut from the scrape-editing and the final scene of the drama. Simple screenplay, not surprising, or a novelty occurs * 1/2 from ****
