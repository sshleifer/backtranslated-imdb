I've heard about this novel for a long time. Many of my friends suggested that I read it. I searched it everywhere and finally found it. This is a book that everyone should read because it is genius and because of vision. I enjoy every page. <br /> <br /> I know about movies and can't wait to see. Finally, when I do, I feel very disappointed, many things in the book are not in the movie. (I don't think this is a spoiler) that makes the movie unreasonable ... Michael Radford may be a good director. But is a bad writer Especially as a book author The movie is not dark at all. The writing is not really good. The only good thing is that the show John Hurt is an amazing actor and only one face I saw as Winston Smith. What makes me the most angry is the people in IMDb who call this! Or know anything about screen writing. <br /> <br /> You can understand the meaning of the story by reading the book. Don't think this is an alternative. As a book fan, I'm very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The point that I gave for this movie is about acting.
