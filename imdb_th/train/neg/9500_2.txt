This movie is really bad. The performance was terrible except for Michael Ironside. I didn't understand the story. Richard Grieco was the only survivor after fighting between the two gangs. He came to a city and suddenly he chose to fight with the bad guys who wanted the land of India. On the cover, it said that he was an Indian who came back to his hometown. I didn't hear it in the movie if it wasn't clear. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco is one of the underworld's. Bad actor Stiff and ugly He said that his line was like too. And we will not talk about Sean Young. She is not my favorite actor But in this movie, she plays a terrifying Indian woman who falls in love with Bolt (Grieco). She's terrible. <br /> <br /> When I rent it, I choose between this and Subterfuge and Amanda Pays. In casting Maybe I should get Subterfuge. <br /> <br /> Don't see this until you think Richard Grieco looks strong on a motorcycle with sunglasses. <br /> <br /> I'll make the list faster. I have it at home I wrote it down after I watched the movie.
