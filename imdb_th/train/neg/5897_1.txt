Takashi Miike, a highly regarded Japanese director, can't move with the horrifying thriller. This story is adapted from Yasushi Akimoto's book about an evil old woman. (And child assault!) Which is part of the new urban legend Ringing with a strange voice - and you see the message 'One Missed Call' - you will repeat that message to hear the last word before you die The most successful part of this film is the profanity of reality TV that attacks future victims. But the death is not complicated (Including red sweets!) Disappointing and discouraging The common image of the destroyed remains has been shown quite carefully and this overall politeness may be the reason why this film looks so elegant. Hollywood predicts a significant increase in the plot drawn in 2008, but the US version does not improve. There are no stars from ****.
