This is another one of many negative B movies that are tagged as noir movies, hoping to create interest in something useless. Every aspect of the movie - the script to show the direction - is moderate. The performances of the three leaderboards are wood. I guess John Dall is expected to work in the movie business. But then someone knew that he had a little talent and ended up working on TV. Lee J Cobb, who is wonderful, often can't rise above bad scripts and bad directions. Jane Wyatt should be a bad woman. But come close, no one believes This movie has the most strange car I have ever seen. One of the things that John Dall has done after Lee Jake is strange. DVD transfer is normal. Alpha
