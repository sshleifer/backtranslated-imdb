It's frustrating It started well enough. But when it continues and loses every opportunity to rise, Maria Schrader's acting is terrifying, never seeming to mean what she said or even knowing what she said until she spoke. She did not show true emotions, not for her happiness or mother's story. When staying with Lena, she seems to have more than a little academic interest in Lena's story. There seems to be no real relationship between Lena and her mother except her mother seems to have a good time at the wedding, which is not much. The parallelism between Hannah's "mixed" love and the relationship between her mother and her father is boring when they arrive and fail miserably. The wedding is completely unreliable and dumb finishes. The pinnacle of protests is not impressive, and whether Lena has or doesn't do anything to influence the results, she must show some complex feelings at that time. In fact, there are no characters in the movie that are deep or sparkling. It's very difficult to pay attention to them. Even a little Ruth, everything with Louis is a distraction. (Why don't you like him when you're on the phone from the hotel? There is no context or explanation for that matter.) If the reference to him is removed, it will not be observed. <br /> <br /> A simple story creates confusion by poor character development. (Who's the mother again?) The weak and direct acting that makes everyone look like they're acting. You almost heard "quietly in the scene! .... "I started to think that this thing is equal to 7, but when the film started to show up quickly, then received 3 after the stupidity of the wedding scene This is a cold and sterile movie that I have seen. Scary waste in a good story
