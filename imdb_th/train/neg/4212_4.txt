The beginning of this film is excellent with great sound and good humor. But when this movie changed to an animation, it would make it interesting. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons for that, at least for me is The color of most animations will be muted with too little clarity. It doesn't look good at least on VHS. For a long time, it will break and look good. But not too often, the characters will come and go too fast For example, I would like to see "Moby Dick" more. When the movie starts to drag, however, it picks up again with the dragon's entrance, then the movie will end up strong. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is unlikely Remember enough or be able to compete with the best animated movies in the past decades.
