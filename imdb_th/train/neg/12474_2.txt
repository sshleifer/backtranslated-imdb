I saw the version "MST3K" Deathstalker III "and loved the movie a lot - even" unconscious "- I decided to watch all of my animated series. Buy I and II and judge with laughter. Nothing about "Deathstalker I" is a joke on every level. Too much ugliness and nudity It looks a waste of money. I didn't open "DS 2" because I will send tomorrow night. Now I may leave this DVD because I can't return and nobody wants - including me too! So don't worry about this. Even nudity (it's a lot btw) is not impressive and scary.
