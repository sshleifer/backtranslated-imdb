This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole life. It's slow, boring, not scary, not funny, uninteresting, unhappy. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gaillard Depends on her old playlist that expresses fear and panic She can't sell her character and can't let other people in the picture. <br /> <br /> For those who think that Grudge is 'kind of okay' then don't watch this thing until you enjoy losing. your Your time and life <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for free, so I didn't want this to be a scandal from a guy who paid 8 dollars to a horrible movie. It's free. It still sucks. I hate it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
