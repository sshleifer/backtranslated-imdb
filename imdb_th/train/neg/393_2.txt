For everyone who wants to create Slaves of New York in 1989, what are seven of you? Here it is ... is <br /> <br /> This unadulterated movie has a boring character. (Well, they are a club for kids, a big jerk!) That is in the holding style. How big the question seems to be, how long can young people remain young? Three people write this 'story'. Good God. It's easy to come up with Citizen Kane instead of bringing the audience back. This movie should embarrass everyone who was staged in the early 90's. <br /> <br /> The idea that a fifty-year-old woman is jealous of that era is a world that only absorbs itself. Twenty things can be imagined. A strange sidebar about the work of the library, not the expected plot from the equivalent of Parker Posey's Breakin 2: Electric Bugaloo. She "I'm serious with the graduate school!" While the stripper crushes her Posey always shtick, but there are projects under her. I slept before crossing the 40 minute mark.
