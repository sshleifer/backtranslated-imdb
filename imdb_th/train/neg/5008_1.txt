There is no reason to watch this movie. The concept of good planning is poorly managed. In the middle of the movie, everything changed and from there there was nothing appropriate. The cause of the killing is not clear. The performance was terrible. Clearly, Nick Stahl wants a better director. He's good at In Bedroom. But here he is terrible. Amber Benson from Buffy must change her character someday. Even those who love sex and violence will be disappointed. Although the movie takes 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (But too long for this movie) but there are no deleted scenes on the DVD, which means that they never bothered to fill the missing parts of the character
