Pathetic efforts in using science to prove modern religion / both philosophies have nothing to do with each other and things that speak of quantum physics on this subject are unusual. <br /> <br /> Example? Quantum theory supports the concept of Eastern religions, how truth is illusion? In the world of Subatomic, you cannot predict the position of particles at a certain time. You can give its odds precisely at one point at one time. In addition, the actions of observation seem to affect the event. Solid particles can pass through obstacles. All of this is correct. But they insist that it means that if you sincerely believe enough to walk through the wall, you can do it. This is a complete poppy flower. The theory claims that at our level it is possible that you will walk through the wall. But only an opportunity and nothing related to faith You also have to walk into the wall to give eternity the opportunity to walk through the wall, even the most remote occasions. But these are just one example of how they Distort scientific truth But more annoying is the story that is related to the unhappy photographer, played by Marle Meilan. About half of the pictures are confusing to understand. Things to do with negative thoughts lead to addiction and self-hatred. There may be some truth about that. But quantum physics does not involve this matter. <br /> <br /> Plus string theory is a hot new thing in physics today. Instead of wasting time with this ruins, I suggest you rent The Elegant Universe, an amazing series for NOVA in PBS that lets you learn the history of physics from Newton and gravity for Ed Witten and M Theory. In just 3 hours, quantum mechanics are described quite well if you want to know that there is no fog of metaphysical allocation.
