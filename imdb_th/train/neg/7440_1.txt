I will go to save as a second person after using IMDb to search for movies inspired by Nacho's movie, The Abandoned, to create an account and post comments. This is the worst movie I've ever seen all my life. This plot is virtually non-existent and there is no "puzzle-piece" coming in any way. That show was laughing and the writing was embarrassing. This movie has been supported and has come back. The only thing that helps me save is Anastasia Hille. Use f and repetitive words (and excellent sound design). If I have to face the option of watching this movie again or being severely mauled, I will have to face With difficult decisions I'm disappointed that I can't give 0 stars.
