It seems that there are reviews from 8-10 stars that are surprisingly high from those who have never written IMDb reviews before or after. From the fact that others give a very low average score, I think you might conclude yourself. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie. I agree that I think the concept is cute and I am happy to see the actress playing the Eve and Harmony on Angel, but it doesn't take long for the horror of this movie. Known <br /> <br /> Acting: The prospect has enough talent but everyone? Very bad. <br /> <br /> Plot: Full support, big enough to drive a truck. <br /> <br /> Direction: No <br /> <br /> Humor: They think Are people really laughing? Oh boy <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: OK, there are really beautiful women in this movie. Not just the three main female characters As if the producers hoped that the scenery would distract the male audience, so they would not notice that everything was scary If so, they fail miserably. <br /> <br /> On the right hand side, this may be a lovely classic camp. It's not closed.
