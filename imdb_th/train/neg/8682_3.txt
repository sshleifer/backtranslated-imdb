I want to start by stating that I am a Republican, although I do not agree with the many things Bush has done in the office. And I love the daily show and the Colbert Report They have to be two favorites on TV. I enjoy Bush's jokes in Conan, Letterman, Leno because I admit that W is not the smartest person to walk on earth. (I believe he is not the most stupid person), but it comes to a point that is sufficient and enough. Not really funny anymore I see where it's funny and what is it? (Hey, he makes fun of our authority. He is hilarious) The comedy center, but trying hard to mock him. I mean, maybe a special episode But the whole series is stupid. It seems that CC is talking about the jokes about the same bushes that we have heard many times. I can't see this item for the past 1 season.
