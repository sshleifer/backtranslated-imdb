While it contains facts that are not widely reported But it is not true They use a lot of freedom to organize new events, not include people and use sets that do not match the facts of life in the 30s. There are more Bonnie Clyde and Double D in the gang many times and those people There is a lot of facts involved as well. Buck and Blanche convince Clyde to go faster than the one penalty point, and in fact, is committed to crimes. Some events that are shown in the daytime actually occur at night. Bonnie's wounds are severe and not cured. It was terrible that she had to be carried around until he recovered, and even it became stiff, so she walked hard. Clyde also walked limp because in prison he cut a big toe. I know that I am a picky and it is a TV movie. But even though there is no real mistake in the story "TRUE", this movie is moving too fast from one event to another. Instead of a flowing story, <br /> <br /> I suggest reading a book or watching a documentary if you want to approach the truth.
