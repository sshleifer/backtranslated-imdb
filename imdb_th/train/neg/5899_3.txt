By everyone who wagged the tail made Miike and his job, I sat flick, flick tonight I think if half as good as Ringo, as I think from these comments, it may be worth my time. <br /> <br /> No luck. <br /> <br /> All for finding the next great director (Or writer) but I don't think Miike is one. I don't have NYU Masters of Fine Arts, but I know this very much: horror movies must have pacing. In addition, it must give the audience more confidence than this movie. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this movie shook my head. Some scenes near the end dragged badly. I went to the refrigerator and lingered there, while Kou Shibasaki stared at the camera to see the last minute, the eyes wide and the mouth open. Famous directors have demanded and I can transcribe the film by changing the camera to a beautiful woman and letting it spin. Kou is not a good actor enough to do this job. She stared at the girl who was paralyzed in the scene more than I remember. And she is not the only one who plays the role of a deer in the headlights Clearly, other members felt that they needed to imitate this performance. The script gives them a little space to do things for a long time. <br /> <br /> I like Asian theaters. Hong Kong's action movie has changed from 30 years ago. Korean horror movies like "Phone" and "Coma", the work of Angie, a Filipino film that is full of garbage Chakushin Ari.
