Whenever Columbo deviates from the familiar plot (Colorful killers committed crimes, Columbo smokes away the killer, Columbo became a pest in the process). Writers somehow fail to match the quality and interest of traditional episodes. Now deviating from the extreme and the result is a huge failure. <br /> <br /> Will you believe: Colombo never faced a villain to the end? <br /> < br /> Frankly, I Being tempted to close it for about two-thirds. <br /> <br /> Oh, the self-criticism that we criticize has done !!!
