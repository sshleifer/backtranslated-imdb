Buck Bunny accidentally went to the South Pole while trying to travel in Florida. Where he met a little penine which he tried to help from Eskimo This short effort and a lovely pen But in the end it was too light in the laughing department Eskimo is not a great foil for Bugs, and I just saw many better Bugs Bunny cartoons. Frankly, even the other shorts, so I couldn't be able to conspire to recommend this one. However, it's good to see it in uncut form. This cartoon is on disc 3 of "Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1" <br /> <br /> My grade: C
