It said that a woman named Susan Montford both wrote and directed this movie. It is not surprising that she has no credit for her name for writing or directing. She made a serious mistake in choosing this career. This is one of the worst human beings of this millennium. <br /> <br /> The basic thing that is wrong with this movie, apart from the ridiculous story of a woman who escaped from a weak gangster, four is the lack of. The intuition and completeness of LOGIC. <br /> <br /> ** After she left the mall, she was contacted by four gangsters as they surrounded her. Tell me which woman will attack those who might happen while being surrounded and insulting them verbally? I do not mean that after the attack has begun, because of course it is normal for some people to fight. But she pushed that man and moved up to the next level No woman can do that unless she 1) has weapons. 2) Have confidence in knowing that the backup is very close and is relatively safe from danger. 3) The attacker is still young and looks weak that she is quite. Confident You can take them There is nothing that is applied in this situation, so she behaves like someone who requests rape or robbery. When the security officer came near as he came to see Kim Ba Singing, why did she not rush to him for help or scream? <br /> <br /> ** When she drove away after the security officer hit her head, she drove into the deserted city and fell. She had enough time to chase for three minutes instead of running away in the diagonal direction behind the house and climbing the fence and continuing. She took out her red toolbox. I understand that she is trying to fix her car. But she should run. <br /> <br /> (I don't mean that this is a chronological summary of the movie because I hate people who do that in Their reviews But it happened that all the main scenes of this movie had something silly until I had to comment) <br /> <br /> ** Why did you carry a red tool box too? Trying to sneak away in the dark? When she was arrested, a gangster wanted her to open the tool box. First of all, she resisted and then opened it. And took the wrench out This scene is full of profound intelligence of the failure of a completely stunning effect. I have to break it down. It's one of the most boring scenes in the entire movie. When asked to open the box, she initially resisted, as if it were her plan to get a thug who opened it in anger after she didn't open it in the same way that some people May action There are some devices that the enemy calls for that person to touch / push / open / manage, and when that hero refuses to open it, the enemy grabs the device just so that the device will automatically dispense / shoot him in the face / Render, he is unconscious, which is the plan of the hero all along. Feeling like something they tried to do with Kim Basinger here while she quickly opened the toolbox and pulled the wrench and quickly got rid of one of the gangsters. Br> ** Throughout the rest of the film, things You see is the wife in a suburban house that sneaks into the forest while she holds her red toolbox. Pick up the tools used as weapons for KILL HER ATTACKERS. > <br >> ** When she ran away, she ended up moving back to the thugs. I think it's a scene in which they have a radio that plays loudly in tribute to dead friends. She crawled up to them when I thought she was moving away from them. <br /> <br /> ** Finally, all this evidence is very weak because of all the reasons that she was chased from the beginning because of the gangsters. Her point of view, she witnessed the murder that they had committed to security officers earlier, and therefore they felt they had to kill her. How ridiculous As one of the gangsters said that they might leave the city and return to any city where they drove, no one other than her who saw them already and she might not have received a license plate. Although these possibilities do not work as desired But adding hell and hunting people to kill them increases your chances of getting the first kill.
