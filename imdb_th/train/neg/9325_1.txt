Ill. Really means crappy. So incredible. I killed myself. There is no acting to talk about for sure. The best part of the whole production is the art on the cover of the movie's budget box is enough. The filming is a sub-sesame road. Production seems to be an underground filming for the popularity of the crowd. The props used in this movie were stolen from the clothing store. The ending is predictable, so you should hurry to the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there is a book for this movie, I'm sure it will be better. I will avoid all this costs. I enjoy the scene in which they make the whole movie worth it. I'm joking.
