This is the worst thing and I mean the worst biker movie ever! And that can be said a lot because of the foul smell of long and foul lines Tina Louis looks scary. (She may be afraid that someone will see this mess!) Is a car driver who is suffering from the most nasty motorcycle gang in film history. But don't worry about the fans! Batman, I mean, Adam West, as a town doctor, Pow! Crush! Boom! Batman Holy Toledo! <br /> <br /> The only good point of this "bomb" is a cute girl. Some of the scenes are ridiculous and Tina Louise "sexy"!
