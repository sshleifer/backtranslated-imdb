It's so lame that I closed the DVD ... maybe halfway through It's very weak. I can't accidentally say how much I can do. I want to believe that Carlito's image is different. I didn't blame the actors because I thought it was a script that might fail. I found myself laughing a few times. But I do not think that those lines are intended to be funny The price I made with the original only This is one case in which they should let the classics be lonely.
