Hopalong Cassidy with a horse that is not white and has no name topper? Let's go! <br /> <br /> This imitation is a gross injustice against the greatest cowboy hero, Hopalong Cassidy, an actor who played with him younger than old, blonde hair and white hair and killing people Compared to the real shot from the hand of Hopalong, please stand up! <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies ever created & believed or not by someone who brought us a grandfather's fairy tale!
