I do not like the idea of ​​a female tortoise. Since 1987, we know that TMNT is a four-brothers, with Splinter teachers and their enemies, and one of the four brothers is named after great artists such as Leonardo, Michelangleo, Raphel And Donatello, so Venus here has no meaning or play any important part and I believe that the old TMNT series is better than the new one with Venus. As a female turtle will not add any action to Ls about our favorite TMNT stories as we know it in 1987 to a new enemy in all a great spot to take some action. But having a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action. We want to see more new TMNT series. The same character that we knew in 1987 without the female turtle
