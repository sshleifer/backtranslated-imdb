This is a documentary, not a documentary. But I think it is because they escape with the camera shaking and shooting. This was just released in the UK on DVD as "American Pie style comedy". Not that. <br /> <br /> In general, there will be a group of teenagers in the spring traveling to Mexico to drink cheap drinks. And finally, the pursuit of pure friends Throwing a few dwarfs and staying on the same mission, and you have a hilarious story of a drunken teenager trying to find a woman. <br /> <br /> Consider the score. 18 points. Actually sex scenes are mostly true. I think scoring is a swearing, which has a lot. <br /> <br /> If you like rude foolish behavior without humor, this may be your story if you have brain cells Already gone, I'll probably avoid this!
