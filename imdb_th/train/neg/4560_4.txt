Men In Black 2 is a real disappointment for me. While the actors perform quite well, especially Smith, there is no way to treat the bad script once in production. This film has a "sequel" feel. Actually, playing some parts of the first movie. The story is in the words ... worst. It doesn't think well and seems to be missing and uneven at times. <br /> <br /> In the first flick, the MIB Organization has a "strong" feeling. You have a few special agents and It gives a "secret" feeling in the sequel. The MIB Organization has the scent of JROTC Summer Camp. <br /> <br /> The movie isn't scary or anything .. It lacks "coolness" (because of lack of better phrases) At first, many old humor films were recycled from the first to the last. And did not add any initiative to the universe. MIB <br /> <br /> The perfect comparison will be the first episode of the first 3 stories. It's good, right? Yes. It's worth carrying it. name? Not really
