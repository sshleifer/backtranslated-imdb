Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (hahaha). The cook cooks for a pirate ship that serves as the captain after killing him earlier. Although he saw the buried treasure But he began to lose his memory and the treasure map he received was empty So Dick was forced to find someone who could see and communicate with the ghost. (Do you place ads for that thing?) And help navigate to the treasure It is a belief that everyone can control this nonsense movie. Former Goon Spike Milligan instead of Medak is a director and with Medak's ability in The Ruling Class, you might guess that the scenes with rough grain And there is a bad light. Milligan is in the director's chair. Peter Boyle has appeared briefly in the first 10 minutes of this film as a pirate captain anymore. He may be very grateful that Young Frankenstein made his debut in the same year as filming and canning so he didn't have to do this. Franciosa looked terrifying as the power behind him. But both he and the seller seemed hopeless with the makeup and hair of the seller that looked terrible. They have to know that this movie is exploding even while filming. With this line, I can understand the possible uneasiness: <br /> <br /> Pierre: (Being hanged) You will pay for this. <br /> <br /> SCRATCHER: No, I win. 'Shirt, I'll do it for free. <br /> <br /> And that's one of the good jokes. It is amazing for me that the contents of most sellers are still in the basement. But this has been published on VHS over the past 15 years! And those who stepped on the plate and released a British TV show that was well received. A Show Called Fred Starring Milligan and directed by Richard Leicester
