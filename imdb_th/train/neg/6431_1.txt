This film is a distortion of the lies and horrific exaggerations collected by the most unscrupulous priests who have worked in television movies. The story is wrong and is a complete lie. There is nothing in this movie that shows Senator McCarthy precisely. It was a scary trick and surprised me that anyone involved in this production had a new job in the Marxist-Leninist industry. Proved by history and fear that anyone who dares to destroy communism Unfortunately for these communist bolts, Ronald Reagan replaced McCarthy who had gone out and they could not stop him. So, the end of the Soviet Union and colleagues. <br /> <br /> Never watched the movie. If this You're looking for truth about Sen. McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's book "Treason" to see the truth about Sen. McCarthy. <br /> <br /> It will help if you read about What happened to the Senator McCarthy by reading http: // www thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
