This work of this youthful mind may attract a large number of people in the 20s, who are still trying to find their place in the world while obsessed with every neurosis. However, I cannot imagine that a lot of narcissism in the navel, staring at the navel, repetitive humor or repetitive stories will be involved, especially for everyone over the age of 30. Another problem is the surrounding characters. Being tricked into such ridiculous caricature for the cartoon effects that they failed to create in real relationships. <br /> <br /> However, we have to give some points to filmmakers. That grew up in the age of creating videos and using all possible editing tips in the book to make the plot really non-existent. There are 2 points to remember here. First, be careful of the festival love. Secondly, even though we are in the age of youtube, but not everyone who lives in the world deserves to take care of the big screen. But these young filmmakers have all the rights to create their movies, and if 20 directors can find something in it to identify all the better Even so, I couldn't help thinking at the end of this movie that the latest generation who came into this age will travel in the real world that presents many challenges and complications. In an age where every child is constantly confident that how special they are and they deserve 15 minutes of revelation, the flexibility and ability to cope with adversity doesn't seem to be the strength of this generation.
