This is one of the movies that I hope I can get in the bar. <br /> <br /> This movie is really boring. What stories are very sensitive and you have to guess as well. This film indulges itself with a formidable camera technique that seems to cause migraine and makes it look like a student movie. Do I think it's boring? If all the characters suddenly died down at the end of the movie, I would not care less because I had no connection with them. <br /> <br /> There are about 4 minutes in the movie about it. This is the first time. I used to think of walking out of the cinema during the show. But I believe it must be better. I am wrong. <br /> <br /> A type of movie that you can intimidate the puck with.
