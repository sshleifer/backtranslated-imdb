"Raising Victor Vargas" is one of the family movies that you can watch and make puzzles to solve crossword puzzles at the same time. And if you want to go to the kitchen for tacos and corona, you don't need to "stop" the DVD temporarily. Let it roll because you won't miss anything really important. No twisting, rotation or stiffness It's not an ethnic film. It's a movie about a poor and struggling immigrant family that is Latin. They may be any ethnic group. It makes very little difference. I've seen one million times. Just connect with Jewish families, Italian families, black families or Irish families. Just different accents and names If the Vargas family, Bush or Clinton's name and Presbyterian, this movie will be all the same, <br /> <br /> It's funny that critics here can't access that place. have Some say that Haarlem is Spanish. The Bronx and another Brooklyn As a New Yorker throughout my life, I voted for the Lower East Side. And it seems that everyone in the family will never meet anyone except other Latinos. They live in a small, insulated / isolated enclave. Interactions with non-Latin people may create excitement, attention or stress Can you remember the story of the West? <br /> <br /> And now, for movies that are often criticized I don't know if it's a TV or something. But all the pictures in the building look very orange. For me, clever, furniture and faces are all orange. What does that mean? And my intelligence looks narrow Some people here say that the old shophouse / building has a very large room, perhaps 50 years ago. The thing that homeowners have done is to divide one wise, big 2 or 3 small and squeeze as many immigrants as possible <br /> And another annoying thing .... This is a family movie, the second story I've seen and criticized this week. Is this personal sexual act necessary for us to watch? Please reserve me! What happened to these directors? <br /> <br /> So "Victor Vargas" is a delightful little movie. It is good for a change to see a young Latino actor stay and have a chance to perform. The ability that they do But the author let them make them have scripts that are flat and unique in their work. Enjoy the show But do not let your finger close to the button "Fast forward"
