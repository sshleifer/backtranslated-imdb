Terrible performances by Potter and the flat plot without stress. And for the argument of feminism, it is laughable I saw this garbage when it was first released, and although I found it too boring to believe, I'm glad I went to see it. That's because I now have an answer to the question 'What is the worst movie you have ever seen?' In addition, I have the convenience of knowing that every movie I see throughout my life is better than The Tango Lesson, but I have to admit that I was impressed with the way. That Potter wrote a script that will compile the highest number of art councils that have been funded around the world recently. See Orlando and I can see that Potter learned the wrong lessons How to create this movie? The thing that needs to be done is that the clothes are shaggy, scattered, hard to stare to bring the camera from the top ladies. So why shouldn't she think that she will be able to escape by herself? That is Tango lesson?
