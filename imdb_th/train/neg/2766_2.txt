I went to watch this movie with high hopes. Usually I don't like movies and monsters, it's always fun to watch. I'll show you the good parts of this movie: - Life effects All living things are doing very well. Their movements are realistic and they get along well with other images. In fact, life effects are the only reason I gave this movie more than 2 items. Now, the bad things: - Performing good people. I've seen bad performances. But this movie requires a cake Not the only character to believe It's like the director sends a call to the selection and pick the worst thing from it. I tried hard not to laugh too much because I didn't want to make others in the theater angry. But the performance is not good. - Story: The whole story is filled with holes, plot from beginning to end You can choose at least 5 holes from any movie that comes 30 minutes. The hole of the plot definitely has free with cheese. This may be one of the most ancient ideas, not thought out, and the most stupid story I've ever seen on the screen since I had a serious misfortune of sitting up one night and watching Parasite in the SciFi-dialogue channel: this Is a world in which everyone talks about the most wonderful and boring things they can do at every opportunity they can In this world, it seems that every line will be discussed earlier in a movie with a low budget of at least 30 stories. It's a world of cheese and antiquity - special effects, while the scary animal effects. Much But the special effects failed miserably Yes, they are better than those seen in other movies, but there are many stories in the presentation. And this movie is not presented in any way. It looks like the special effects used in the Power Rangers TV show are faithful. In conclusion, Dragon Wars has no value for your time and money. That idea is good But it stuck in directing the dialogue and the beauty of the movie Wait until the next monster movie comes out. It must be better because Dragon Wars is really scary.
