To create a good movie, you must have a great actor or director. You need at least one of the two in the Eye of the Needle. We don't have at all. <br /> <br /> I can't remember the director's name. He shouldn't do his career very much. I like Donald Sutherland a lot, but he can't be the main star in the movie. He is short. Sutherland is great in the movie when he appears no more than 15 minutes. Stone when he talked to Kevin Costner on the park bench for 10 minutes without stopping the breath, but Sutherland was the main actor in the movie. <br /> <br /> Kate Nelligan? She may be good for a TV drama. The DVD is very bad. The color is terrible. The light is terrible. I can't appreciate the scenery of Storm Island. How photographing is scary. <br /> <br /> Ken Follett's story This is a good story.
