Serious crappy movie <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie begins with the police and his partner parked outside the store. The "bad" police / furniture warehouse takes a woman whom they pull into the warehouse attic. While the rookie police sat outside and thought that there was something going on there, the "bad" police finally came back with a heavy bag and the new police didn't. Thought that there would be any problems, but he still wondered what was in his pocket so he asked if he would receive a bad response. OK (now) <br /> <br /> "Bad" police do Repeat this process and even once with the nipple scene. (Made a little better) but eventually people began to catch, which took a moment when considering how it was A girl cursed Voodoo with her in the event that she died just as you did. Now, the "bad" police finally killed this miraculous defenseless woman. He then eliminated the corpse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because She has magic to show herself. There are many eye shadow which should indicate that she may be a zombie ... as well. Magic curse makes every woman become "Demon Eye Shadow" Some girls meet with a friend who is clearly a currency expert and he offers them to sit. (They seem normal to him) But when a woman sees others like a husband and a woman, he is strange because she is ugly. (Some strange people go out But other people didn't notice) .... The big hole hole <br /> <br /> To wrap it up, the sleek monster will kill the "bad" police who will turn into zombies in the final scene. As if they were trying to prepare us for the sequel! Like everyone wants to see part 2 of this cow's decline
