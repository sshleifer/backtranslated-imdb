For those of us who lived in the past week of filming in the city and around the valley, so don't forget the boring days of road closures and "Making movies" to remind people who live here - places such as Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin etc. The bank is a BC fireplace; Chase scenes, including Moon Drive off, Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd and Hwy 1. <br /> <br /> Production: Jeffrey Jones is the most easily accessible person. Matt Broderick is above all of us - even then. As long as this film is a joke of the script and even a bigger joke about the show and plot But who is interested in this level A good time capsule for those who enjoy the coastal and valley scenery. <br /> <br /> Additional notes; Joe's Bar (Jed's Tavern in the Movie) The original name of this film. Welcome to Buzzsaw - the old Erba parking lot is the town square. The backdrop is shot from Grove Street in Boulder Creek; Cover the idea and see a few actors in the early days.
