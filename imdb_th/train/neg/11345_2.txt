I mean, the word "pedestrian" looks like the film producer forgot to have something interesting to happen. Domergue faith can do better. She should be the revenge goddess Cobra, torn in love with Marshall Thompson. She is an ordinary housewife in the fifties and expresses the simplicity she wears throughout the story, making me think. They shot it every morning before believing to drink coffee. For the remaining actors, they all have "Every American" seriously to get ridiculous results This is a more comprehensive reason in Val Lewton in "The Cat People". I think "Cobra Cult" should be called "The cult of contractual obligations" Why others who are unable to sleep because of this slow and predictable failure
