NATURAL BORN KILLERS (1994) <br /> <br /> Cinema Cut: R <br /> <br /> Director Cut: NC-17 <br /> <br /> It's a Oliver Stone image that Strange, but when I read him with drugs during filming, I didn't want any more explanation. 'Natural Born Killers' is a film that creates a crazy risk that we don't often do. <br /> <br /> 'Killer in nature' is the story of two popular killers. Hailed by media There is a wonderful scene where the interviewer asks teenagers about Mickey and Mallory and the teenager says 'The murder is wrong .... But if I am a murderer, my group will be Mickey and Mallory.' Mickey explained this to the situation of 'Frankenstein (Monster) and Dr. Frankenstein '- Dr. Frankenstein is a medium that turns them into horrific killers. <br /> <br /> Most Oliver Stone movies examine the shortcomings of America, a country in which the director loves and admires, I guess the 'natural killer' is about the impact of the media, technology and enchantment as an American nation. (And most of the world) above things such as massacre and strange situations. <br /> <br /> Killer, played by Woody Harrison (Mickey) and Juliet Lewis (Mallory) was surprisingly executed by two great actors who stepped into the lives of two interesting brutal killers. Mickey and Mallory believe that some valuable people should be killed, perhaps in the cruel theory of Darwinism. (Survival of the most suitable person) - Micky said in an interview in prison that other species have committed murder. The script environment is interesting. But it is suspicious of how much the film cost in terms of making us think about society and human behavior rather than the bloodbath concentration of 2 hours that we have seen. <br /> <br /> The last hour Of this movie occurred in the highest security prison We see the brutal reality of life in prison. The attendant's attitude, etc. The addition of the prison too - perhaps Stone is asking questions about the future, the path that society leads to <br /> <br /> two other interesting characters; First, the journalist who made a list of 'America's Maniacs' and obsessed with giving a higher score, he went every length to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. Another person is a police officer, Scagnetti. The madman may be a sadistic officer who loves Mallory. He also has a strange fascination with many murderers since his mother was killed during the massacre at Waco, Texas Charles Whitman <br /> <br /> The movie is fantastic. Different colors, shadows, styles create confusion. The most obvious green color of all is green, similar to the killer's illness. (In the pharmacy when they are looking for a snake rattlesnake drug) <br /> <br /> The camera work is crazy. Shaky, intoxicated, use the determination to use it and accept it. Highly psychedelic, psychedelic, and unusual This ... <br /> Although the above review is quite good But I don't like movies Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the screenplay, was dissatisfied with the adaptation of the screenplay and he asked his name to be removed. I can see why At the moment of interest, sometimes, Natural Born Killers look messy. <br /> <br /> 4/10
