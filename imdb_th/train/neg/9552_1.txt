Just stupid, good, old, <br /> <br /> I mean, really stupid people, not a good fool, like a tomato killer or Ed Wood. This is probably the most stupid movie I've ever seen. In order for this movie to have a golden turkey, it is an insult to turkeys. If calling this movie as a fool, it is nasty, even with a fool. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of American movies and art, we should start the World War 3 and 4 war at the same time. Run the show after <br /> <br /> Now I have to be drunk to clear the insult of my brain. <br /> <br /> This is a really good movie if you commit suicide.
