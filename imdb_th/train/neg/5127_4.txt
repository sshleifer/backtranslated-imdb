This film has no large stars in it. But there are very good actors who are full of great actors and Gene Tierney before she becomes a big star with George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke. You expect more From this movie For the most part, I think this is because of the second screenplay because director Henry Hathaway is a talented and respected person in the film industry. <br /> <br /> This film is based in East Africa during the world war. Second-time-justice before the Americans entered the war. The Britons tried to control the African colonies, while the elements of the Nazis that were toppled were trying to create trouble for the villagers. A white man in this film is a double dealer - working to destroy the British Empire! But the lovely Tierney plays the daughter of the Sultan (!) To save the whole day for the good old English. <br /> <br /> American filmmakers favor the Empire and 1930 and 40 pro movies. - Empire today with a feeling of change, the idea of ​​seeing the happy black people who are dying for the queen and the country seems ridiculous - and it's hard to root both sides! Even today, this piece of advertising is effective in drumming to support England - even though it can be seen today. But this film has a long chapter and stupid casting. One bright moment in this film is the final confrontation between George Sanders and the enemy agent. Too bad after this powerful scene, the movie seems to talk and talk - lose some punch.
