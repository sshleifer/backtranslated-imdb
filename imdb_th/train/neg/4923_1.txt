This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This movie has nothing to do with it. Some people really like this movie! I've watched many movies of Dracula and I like everyone I've seen. But when I watched this movie Is a stupid movie Now they have become who they are because of Judas Dracula. For those who do not know who Judas is, he betrayed Jesus Christ and felt guilty that he hanged himself. You have to tease me for sure. That's the stupid reason I've heard why Dracula became a demon. Who asked for reasons What is this story? ** Anyone who has had an excuse for apologizing for this movie should be defeated. Even Dracula is scary. If you've watched this movie, you don't think it's Dracula. Should the name impress me? Do not waste time or waste money on this trash.
