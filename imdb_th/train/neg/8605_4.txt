This is a very interesting festival in the late 80s with some nasty slugs that have a taste for human blood. If you get past the absurdities, you may get a little bit of enjoyment from this. The performance was terrible and the story was there to keep the movie together during a bloody bullet attack. But this movie doesn't waste time. The special technique is really good and the blood is doing well. It reminds me of the Blob remake, which may be due to the thinness of it all. Overall, you can do worse for half an hour. But I would not recommend going to watch this movie until you have diarrhea and get into this kind of thing.
