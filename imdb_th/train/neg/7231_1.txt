I saw this in a movie theater that shows "Last Days" and some Charlie Chaplin movies. I decided to give the opportunity "Immortel" based on the quality of other properties. I almost walked out of the film and I like science fiction! The story is set in the New York city of the future, filled with Blade Runner-style sky ads and similar discussions about cloning / synthetic humans. Unfortunately, the screenplay is not enough for one hour and forty-five minutes. There are three groups in this world: humans, human beings and Egyptian gods. Artificial humans seem to have superior skills and control the politics of the city. Humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. Egyptian gods have floating pyramids (Replica on the Great Pyramid of Kufu and the dilapidated exterior by leaving the "cap" on the pyramid smoothly. The future pyramid will not be in perfect condition or The pyramid is over the city and no one is on the ground. Understand what it is or why it is there. I will not make you bored with the plot called But there are many unnecessary scenes and a whole lot of scenes As I said, this movie seems to have been influenced by Blade Runner, and perhaps because The Fifth Element and The Matrix at the end of the movie credits were registered thanks to the UK, France and Italy. This film is in French. But using an English actor who doesn't speak French Therefore it is clear that their French conversation has been called This is a distraction and I think that switching between real humans and animations is quite distracting. It doesn't help the bad animation - it's better than this cross video game.
