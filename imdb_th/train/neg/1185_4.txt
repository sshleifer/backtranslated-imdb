Different styles and adaptations of famous children's tales and beloved La Bete (1975) aka The Beast trying to imagine (In the graphics and things that may look nasty and annoying, beast? I am amused by many reviews and comments that seem too profound to watch in this movie. I will not go as far as saying that it is a serious and gloomy survey on matters such as sexual dissatisfaction, yearning, fulfillment or satire, criticism about Catholic religion. I will not call it a horror movie. It's a parody of more than any type that touches or mentions, even though there are shocking moments in every department that are sure to stay in your memory. <br /> <br /> The long scenes (too long) between young boys. Elites Girl and scary person But the most funny thing I have ever seen in a truly impressive animal movie ... A good anatomy is defined as the clavichord of Scarlatti and hysterical. My husband and I laughed out loud in exaggerated details from the encounter. The moral of the scene is - beauty can and will overcome the monster. The question is - who is the target audience of the movie? For erotic images it's too much For art movies - it has too many jaw-dropping scenes of real madness and I will say that the sudden ending of the IMO filmmaker doesn't mean that it will be a serious drama. As a parody of the art house / horror / erotica, it is absolutely funny and original. There is a good laugh and try not to look for deep meaning. The story of the beauty that is curious and the animal has this desire. Of course, it is not advisable to watch with children. The infamous scene of wild animals can be used to discover channels for programs such as "In the world of animals - habits, breeding and rituals of horses"
