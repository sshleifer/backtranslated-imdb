I've been following the progress of this movie for a while now, so it may be a bit more anticipated. I think both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are good at what they do and are interested in seeing what Dan Reed will do. But unfortunately it didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> The problem is the fact that the movie doesn't seem to really understand what kind of movie fell in love and it failed to impress. Horror drama and thrilling elements because instead of focusing on one of them and doing it well All trades and prototypes have no <br /> <br /> Location (as with most revenge movies) is easy. Couples meet and go. The bad things happen and they get revenge. It is a simple formula that has been mastered over the years. In this case unintentionally, as though Dan Reid thought "It is good to make a little revenge movie by showing the human side to all the characters and delve into their state of mind in more detail .." wrong! There are also some important elements that are missing in this type of film. In general, there are some warnings. Things that should not be done or this may happen which increases tension But there is no order here It just happened and nothing happened for an hour. The interesting thing happened and it ended. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of fierce competition in this genre and Dan Reed's hat. Try i have No problem with his ability to direct But in terms of writing ... I would say that the next time he should stick to the formulas of the movies he created instead of trying too smartly and he would have his quality movies on hand.
