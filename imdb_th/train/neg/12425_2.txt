I do not know if you are breathing, but please stop this film as a complete trash But at the same time he is strong as well. <br /> <br /> New Alex? Annoying as hell! Just a selfish person who tries to match the charm and elegance of Kalkin can not suffer with that. <br /> <br /> The villain makes the crap completely. Harry and Marv, they are a fun team on the screen. They are funny. They have a sense of humor and just make you want to be more rooted in Kalkin, which is what the good guys should do. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are perfect for them On the other hand, in the 3rd, we have 4 stupid people who just fight again trying to take advantage of the charm and charm of the first villain. Didn't say that they were scary But they are not really memorable or even entertaining <br /> <br /> Then we get a real movie, part 1 and 2, a memorable classic, perfect for watching Christmas and bringing a wonderful Christmas feeling and bringing Lots of emotions It makes you fall in love with the story and pay attention to the characters. Simple, memorable and close to the masterpiece. Episode 3 Masterpieces of enough shit. <br /> <br /> All and all I don't know why people like this. I think people don't really know which movie is good anymore. It is a crappy sequel that has unrealistic traps and new main character children that I hope the robbers have to overcome at least a shit. <br /> <br /> Run away from the garbage. And don't even start with Part 4!
