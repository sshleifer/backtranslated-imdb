<br /> <br /> When I really ignore what is not possible, this is a horror / monster that is quite good. So I will give you a good score first: - The dragon is quite reliable, especially when she sneaks around through the tunnel to find lunch. (Hint: She likes humans) - That action doesn't stop and after The beginning is weak, I can absorb quite a lot of stories - sorry to say that I am the root of the dragon - she should be a consistent and convincing character. The most /> <br /> In the movie now for something <br unbelievable ** can be devastating. Are you pursuing the Fire Dragon in the year 1100? Will you jump into its cave with gunpowder under your arm? Duh - a female character with an American name, blond hair and a slavic accent that obviously tries to pretend she is a Spanish? Ha? - Lead scientist with a Slavic accent that you can cut with a knife and he was born supposedly in Chicago studying in the United States? - The military helicopter pilot who has repaired himself, flew a large transport helicopter that doesn't have other crew members and is a sharpshooter, an expert and a soldier fighting to boot or not. Minutes while communicating with his base <br /> <br /> It's still better than some Japanese monsters at the temple from the 60s, but not much. If we are lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2. Although the ending is usually wide open Or maybe they will hire a true director next time. <br /> <br /> In spite of everything I have to flick 4 out of 10, add 2 if they write a new plot and Dean Cain gets Eat in the first ten minutes. <Smile>
