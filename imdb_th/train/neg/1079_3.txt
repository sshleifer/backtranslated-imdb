I felt like I was the only child in the city that had been annoyed by Branagh's performance. He was a good performer in most accounts. But he could not pull out the southern accent I mean it's a pity As if he was trying hard to be a Yank, one of the previous investigators asked why the US actor didn't act in this film. I think the two were great when actors / actors wanted to expand the scope. their But it is another story that has to be tried too hard to make the show get tense. It may be Altman, but he is a great director ... <br /> Well, I don't want to beat Branagh because of the accent That is too ugly of him Everyone deserves to screw here and there. But it's hard to see something annoying until you want to choke on chicken bones or eat a bucket full of shit rather than sitting through The Gingerbread Man
