Note to all directors: Length is not necessarily good. This movie is incredibly long. However, not good The scene is pulled out the way, the way, the way, the way, the way too long. The sex scene is unnecessary and too long. Movies edited down 2 hours, 10 minutes or more will be excluded. But it became a very boring story that I could give 2 out of 10. It's lower than average. <br /> <br /> Some other problems exist in this marathon. <br /> <br /> 1 ) Ralph Fiennes plays the entire family tree People who play grandfather are not like him. But grandfather, father and son (That gives us unnecessary sounds) is Ralph Fiennes with different faces and the same basic cow head personality. It seems that nobody will notice that each of these children seems to be clones of the last person, even if their photos are held every time. This is a minor issue. But if this movie didn't have it for 3 weeks, it wouldn't be that annoying. <br /> <br /> 2) The fact that no news from Germany has been whispered for a long time. The Jews were rounded and sent away. There are some words that speak to them and the idea of ​​trying to run away may be mentioned. Uncle in France will send a warning to try and take them out. <br /> <br /> 3) All the love stories in this movie are wrong. You spend all the time telling this to us and developing the relationship between the main characters is very short. Suddenly ... People are in love and almost instantly ... married. Then have children. Then we pull things out. Came out for 6 centuries and forgot about developing relationships Again, this will not be a hindrance in the 2 hour movie, but with the time spent with nothing for us. <br /> <br /> 4) The ending is terrible. I don't want to destroy it for everyone. But you will not like it either ... unless you have a bad habit of being lustful. <br /> <br /> The director / writer should be tortured by looking at solid waste in Every week I mean endless loop oops. They are the same thing. <br /> <br /> I wonder what Robert Redford did with this movie. I mean, I think Istvan Szabo must be her. The style that directed his performance after him A long drawn movie that completely destroys any substance in the movie. A short description of 'The Horse Whisperer' and Sunshine <br /> <br /> Sunshine is the perfect name. If you start watching while the sun is shining, it will be quite good after dark when you go out.
