What I think I would like the most about Star Wars's new movie "Phantom Menace" is that it might explode "Titanic" into the water if you forgive the player when it comes to the box. Devastating Office receipts and make it out of one point Every time I hear someone declare that "Titanic" is the greatest movie they have ever seen, I think to myself that "You don't watch many movies, right?" Imitation. You can create 50 great movies that are better than "Titanic" and at the same price. <br /> <br /> "It won many academic awards. A lot of people love it very much. "Some people may speak in defense. Many people, such as the Spice Girls and billions of people and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but that doesn't mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans aren't correct. <br /> <br /> Be the first to admit that part of the problem for me is mega-hype over movies. I waited a month or more to see it and eventually it did not depend on the expectations set forth, which only triggered more attention from stupid love stories. It is true that "Phantom Menace" tends to suffer the same fate, but <br /> <br /> James Titon "Titanic" is a) a lightly flick, disguised as a serious moment. B) Great A three-hour epic with the best moments in the trailer. C) A love story that is deeper than belief or entertainment. D) There is something better for a documentary, which I will have more fun. E) Movies that With pride There is life to the level that represents the real ship. F) 3-hour robbery that I will never get back. Therefore, the greatest motivation for the time machine I can imagine. When I meet someone who has never seen me say "I wish I could exchange with you." G) Slap the face for the true victim of any temperature. How long should we believe that people can be immersed in cold water and still keep the sentence? Can you understand? h) Thanks to movies that are not accepted for success in acting at the Oscars i) Technology achievements in filmmaking and others <br /> <br /> The only reason I post this is An anonymous comment is that I do not welcome the controversy from Leonardo DiCaprio's ex-girlfriend, 10,000, thirteen years old, no doubt. Came to his defense and I was not interested in hearing the defense, story, performance or length of the Titanic
