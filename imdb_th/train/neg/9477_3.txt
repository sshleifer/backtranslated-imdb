This must be one of the most formidable wrestlers ever, and will be rescued by only 2 matches. A hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley, including Vince Mcmahon and Shaun Michaels The main event between Cena and Triple H is a complete cleansing and, to be honest, I almost fall asleep. It is smokeless. The match in the coffin is not worthy to have the Undertaker. If you are a big fan of WWE and miss the first days of WWF and Wrestlemanias 17 and 19, you may love this, but I find that Wrestlemania has a lot to choose from.
