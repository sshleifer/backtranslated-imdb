Rent a movie set from Blockbuster last night and this is the first movie I watched. (It's late on Saturday night needs "Editing horror movies") ... <br /> <br /> Wow, this is scary, almost embarrassing ... silly story. I think the movie like Scream ends; Amateur actors with unclear conversations and unbelievable conversations that are actually printed and read from the page. And scenes that are nothing exciting (Especially when this movie has a bad script) <br /> <br /> But I always believe that this movie doesn't have 100% of all.

And proud that they all deliver stupid expertise when trying to make a I almost separated Ginger Lynn Allen from this group, if her character shouldn't be an Irish mother and she tried to emphasize the accent which made the smile. <br /> <br /> It's true.
