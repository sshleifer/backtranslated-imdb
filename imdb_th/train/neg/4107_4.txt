The problem of "The Killer Elite" is to just search for this movie and take time to watch. You are trying to use more experiences than many executives do, especially director Sam Peckinpah. <br /> <br /> Peckinpah, which has Already fluctuating, heading to rough weather with this movie According to at least one biographer, this is where he is familiar with cocaine. Add to his drinking and it is not surprising that things are broken. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the idea behind this movie is good and the first ten minutes promise Mike Locken ( James Caan) and George Hansen (Robert Duvall) are private contractors working for the CIA. They move fast, live a good life, and seem to be the best friend. Then there is something going on with their broken brothers. <br /> <br /> The scene opens to show them the buildings that tumbledown For the course in terms of the dark inspiration of this film But the meaning is that these people attacked people and didn't really care - the antiheroes like Peckinpah's Wild Bunch recently. The opening title tells us that they work for ComTeg, then supplement it with a clear tongue in the cheek. "... The idea that the CIA might use such an organization for any purpose is certainly unusual." That's the way. Wise to inform viewers that all bets are closed. <br /> <br /> Add to the traditional strong Peckinpah backup, including Burt Young, Gig Young and Peckinpah, usually Bo Hopkins in the role Alums of A madman who can't have a chance to be shot for $ 500 per day and you just want the playwright, including the famous Sterling Silliphant, to try to do something with the story rather than turning it into a platform for lazy people - liners and knockoffs. Hack-socky is not good. Efforts to inject liberal socialist opinion are resisting. "You're too busy with dirty work. You can't tell who is a bad person." Someone told Looney as if he or we needed it. Point out that <br /> <br /> Even worse is Peckinpah's clumsy direction and slow pace. We spent 40 minutes creating a movie before we got our first fight scene. Is a group of random fires that many people that we have never encountered before will see a fight at San Francisco airport Office suites <br /> <br /> At the end of this movie, the rest of the actors are fighting within the Victory Mothballed fleet, Ninjas runs out in the open to be shot while Caan throws one torpedo. Which cut off the real doubts "My layout is seven to five. I will take this little prince." Before he fought the climatic samurai between two ninja warriors - from China, which we all know is the land of the ninja. (The battle took place in San Francisco But it's not surprising that Mounties can't do things. <br /> <br /> Caan is much better in small scenes, like when Locken recovered from an offensive injury. Of his boss, played by Arthur Hill, smooth that he is "Humpty-dumped" by the beam organization refused to remain and his recovery scene, even though it was a killing force for the film, had a good performance from him and Amy Heflin, Van's daughter, as a nurse. Supporting Caan is one of the best actors in the 1970s and his short conversations with Heflin, Duvall, Hopkins and Youngs both gave the ability to watch the true "Killer Elite" <br /> <br /> But you don't see "Killer Elite". Think about it. Maps You watch it, miss the missing movie.
