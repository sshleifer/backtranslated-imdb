I watch DVD 1 only. The right program may have good data for 10 minutes; Otherwise, it will make people worse. As if director Brian Flemming recently discovered both atheism and cynicism and felt that with these tools he could make his enemies easier His films never came back on this topic. <br /> <br /> Religious people tend to reduce distrust when their objections about religion are rooted in improper parenting. The argument from the victims seems unreasonable and unreliable. <br /> <br /> Anti-religious people will need more information. We don't have to say that people are more religious than the American Jews have to say that annoying Christmas songs have been received in mid-December. <br /> <br /> In the best scene, director Fleming's age A Christian school boy faced a director about his motivation. It seems to be the most honest part of this movie and it's too short. <br /> <br /> If Fleming knows a little more himself, he may have a good story about him. (Past and present)) Relations with Christianity and inappropriate institutions that instilled in him a childhood. <br /> <br /> And maybe he may lend. "Christ never walked on earth" to a more serious documentary I didn't study Saul's writing / Paul to see that everything was so tight. But Wikipedia searches quickly show that most of these arguments are unreliable. <br /> <br /> The bonus interview is quite good. They do not support Fleming's thesis very much. Sam Harris is a good spokesperson for POV against religion and he is not interested in other non-Christian religions. Harris also has a good interview (and Google easy) on Salon.com, Amazon.com and Samharris.org.
