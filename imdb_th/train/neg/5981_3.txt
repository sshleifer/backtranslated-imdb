I just saw this movie (Mostly because Brady Corbet is in there) and I have to say I'm not satisfied. <br /> <br /> Of course, computer graphics are amazing. But the story requires a little touch In addition, I think that this movie should be much better when using curse and blood as well. If rated PG-13, <br /> <br /> that will attract more people to See it -> Teen things that will attract more teenagers (Especially teenage girls) will be a large image of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster! <br /> <br /> Although this movie will have weaknesses But I still saw it and thought it was ok!
