I have seen this movie many years ago in the Fast Forward Film Festivals tradition that we will rent out B-movies and vote for those who choose the worst. It was voted the best because of the good looks and fun of thinking. <br /> <br /> This is a ridiculous and worthless movie for watching under full understanding. However, personally, I will not recommend additional substances ... This movie will make you smile. <br /> <br /> It impressed me enough that I tried to take it. Send a copy for a couple of years. <br /> <br /> A good choice if you go out to watch a bad movie. This is fun and I remember the song ...
