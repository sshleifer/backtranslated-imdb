It's hard to say it is a word of almost all the hate I have in this movie, but I'll try: <br /> <br /> Another word is the insult. The sex scene is uncomfortable. Rampage and the overall image are beyond the norm if it is not offensive for Italian Italians. <br /> <br >> I didn't say that the performance was terrible because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito and Al were doing well. ... almost every character in the movie The machine that I can't insult because of The Bonfire of the Vanities. I don't like all the characters on the screen.
