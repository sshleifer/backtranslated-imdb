This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't care what the critics say is bad. I think the problem lies in Kundera's novel, not that it doesn't work. It is just 99% of his work. It's awesome and exaggerated. It seems that he is attracted to himself. His characters come out as a navel, stare, and his novel, in total, has a hatred for women. I have read many of his works. (Even his socialist realism poetry is really scary) - I just don't understand how the fuss is. The manner (like my own absorption) in his novel makes the reader unhappy. In the movie, everything I don't like about Kundera is enlarged. Maybe I'll miss something. But i don't think so In the side notes, I can't believe that this is a collection of DVDs. There is no way that this movie is necessary.
