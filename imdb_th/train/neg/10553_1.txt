I bought this movie for 1 euro without knowing what it was about. I thought, "Umm, the movie that has a cute guy should not be at least full of blood." It's not funny. It's annoying. Very disturbing and I do not mind to disturb the movie. But this does not mean anything except child abuse is not a good thing to do. Hmm ... The quality of the image is terrible. Performing ... There is no show, just fcked-up fcker. For more than 90 minutes, this may be the content for the severity of a very ill patient. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this thing. It's not worth your time. It's terrible. I hope I won't buy this. <br /> <br /> They should make people who do this thing corrupt.
