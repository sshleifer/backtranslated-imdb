Oh my God. Oh my god, I can't go to see this movie. It's so bad. Scary, scary! Do not even waste your money to buy in 99 bins. Don't avoid all the expenses. I warn you !!! <br /> <br /> It's the worst movie I've ever seen. In my life. In my life !! <br /> <br /> First of all, G-girl? You are kidding me Get real that sounds like a new Barbie doll .. Super Women? You are kidding me It's a fake People in the city don't seem to care about having a blonde girl flying, just zooming in and around the city. Help fire .. Oh big! <br /> <br /> Jesus, right? The movie looks nasty? I think what you have to be a superhero is a pair of D couple, flowing blonde hair, no glasses and tight leather dresses?! <br /> <br /> If it's trying to be romantic ... more .. God, I don't know. It's scary if love means taking people to see art and having sex on the bed and in the air .. more than they are totally in love. <br /> <br /> It's all pathetic. Too fast The first time that the man was single than he had been dating Ji. .. more than they broke up more than they were dating Hannah. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this movie surprised me .. They have also received this in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
