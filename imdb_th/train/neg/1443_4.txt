Starting with the good things: Many times Swayze spoke to Zulu with his friends or heard that language among the tribes. That is a huge advantage. As usual, movie viewers in America and England think that everyone in this world can speak English. (In case you are one of them: no, they can't) <br /> <br /> But that performance 'tenenkrommend' as we speak in the Netherlands (It makes your toes bent - and not a good way). I like Swayze, but this time he's scary. The muscles in his jaw work overtime and he scares the whole movie - some people have to tell him that it looks like Butch. There is no Patrick: it looks stupid and compensates for the lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) chooses to use The acting style does not match the style of her colleagues. Her performance is quite relaxed that this movie may have happened in the present day and it's not your coat as a clue. Alison <br /> <br /> The best performances come from people from Africa and Sided Onyulo is Umbopa. I like the most clear, warm, and the character. His performance is a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> General: It is entertainment, mwah on a rainy day. Will be better Director sack
