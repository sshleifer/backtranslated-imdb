I want to like this movie a lot because the bad critics <br /> <br /> (the least spoken) ... but it's terrible, really scary. <br /> Not good <br /> Acting as The poetry is without flair. The direction to send ... Watching this movie is <br /> <br /> Same as watching a car - You want to look out. /> <br /> Because you want to see how busy it is The car <br /> <br /> wrecked and no survivors On the other side, movie filming <br /> <br /> is very good, making me want to go if just to clean myself from <br /> <br /> This is not pure.
