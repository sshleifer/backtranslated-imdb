I am a fanatic of horror movies and this flick movie is terrible. I feel embarrassed not only to be an "actor" but also as a director and producer who makes his money a reality. > From the name, you expect some great killings of the story and at least the direction or dialogue. You get what looks like the three Stooges that are more violent and have sex. At least I laughed at the Three Stooges while watching this shit. I opened another TV and started watching Howard Stern until something interesting happened. <br /> <br /> Don't say that I watched Stern. br /> <br /> Look at this "movie". I know I can produce a movie with three monkeys. 2 DV cameras, $ 50 dollars in loose changes and a broken PC. This film is my inspiration for creating movies without budget. Watch this movie if you dare But received a warning ... nothing more in here But there are both very little talk and action. This makes "KaZaam" look like the movie Meryl Streep. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Germany is not banned due to having sex or violence.
