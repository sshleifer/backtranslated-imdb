I watched one episode Yes, I sit through all the miserable experiences and have to say that this brand of comedy is one of the worst things you can get. Imagine Peter Griffin from the famous Family Guy. Now imagine that Peter Griffin is a woman. (Slender and negative glasses) except that he now lacks what makes him hilarious. Peter Griffin is an idiot. But he didn't know he was an idiot Sarah has no real character, no ability to perform to pull her character out. Maybe it was a humorous joke that pulled her comedian lower than her character. Maybe it is a lack of credibility. Her sensitive and naive person may attract people who are sensitive and sensitive, unlike others who attract the same interest as Bill O'Reilly. Sarah creates annoying characters and doesn't Nice to see She lacks something that is necessary for the type of satire, leaving it alone for the world of comedy. What Sarah Silverman lacks is obvious. And when you don't believe it and specify it, it's not funny anymore
