From director Barbet Schroder (Fortune's reversal) I think I saw this little thing in my Media Studies class and I remember the lead actor, so I tried it even though it was rated by critics. In general, cool children Richard Haywood (Half Nelson's Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt of Bully) collaborate to kill random girls to challenge themselves and see if they can escape if the police can't find them. The murder investigation is Cassie's murderer 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) and Sam Kennedy, a new partner (Ben Chaplin) who feels baffled by the evidence found at the scene. Unrelated feathers It seems that the plan won't go well because Cassie and Sam have Richard or Justin as the suspects quickly. But it is a question of whether they can migrate them or not, also starring Agnes Bruckner. While Lisa Mills, Chris Penn is Ray Feathers, RD is called Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst DA Al Swanson Now I can see the same concept with Sir Alfred Hitchcock's rope that has killed for the challenge. But this film is made in a very stupid manner and is not a good cow to save from enough dullness!
