Don't understand me wrong. Jansen is a high speed skater. If there is a man who deserves his gold medal in the Olympics, Dan <br /> <br /> But how could Bill Corcoran make a bad movie about the story? Of Dan Jansen, the story of Dan Jansen is great! Especially when you watch this movie with the eyes of every athlete wrong that Matt Keeslar and other actors skate their technique. The size of the oval speedway is all wrong! <br /> <br /> Embarrassing for Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves a lot better! <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
