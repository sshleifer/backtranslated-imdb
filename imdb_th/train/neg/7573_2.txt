This film is a vehicle for Schwarzenegger-clone Alexander Nevsky, his special ability is not enough to raise the film to the level of a poor chapter. He has nothing to add to his Arnie-act. <br /> <br /> Michael York is quite poor as a diplomat who beggars. Watching him back at D'Artagnan-act Again since he was a better actor, I felt uneasy. Come, you can do better. <br /> <br /> The story is full of holes and relationships that cannot be explained. The top of this list is the informant of Vlad who looks like an American woman. But from the context that seems to work for the Russian government. <br /> <br /> Although the story is going well after the end Communist regimes, all Russian characters are still very much like Communists. In contrast to that, Vlad was allowed to drive utility vehicles to all police cars. Action scenes were shot badly, so there was no change. <br /> <br /> No need to watch movies ...
