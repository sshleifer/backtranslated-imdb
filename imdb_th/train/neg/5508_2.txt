Tim Daniels (Gary Daniels) wants to break into serious television news reports. When the job he pleaded with was eccentric, he would be fired for his beautiful but empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley), say sayonara. Lloyd) from Mars on Mars! Tim calls him Uncle Martin. Tim soon tries to help a new friend navigate the life of this world. But Martin has problems everywhere he goes from the bathroom to the laundry room and much more. Finally, Lizzie is cute. (Daryl Hannah) saw the opportunity to make time with Tim. But the path of true love is not smooth in this case as well. Soon everyone on television is stalking Tim, hoping to have a story about a real alien. What do men have to do? For those who like old TV programs with the same name as Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this movie is not suitable to tie proverbial boots. It is truly scary, undeniably without plot and relying on special techniques that should fall. Daniel is like the earth. But Lloyd is scary like an alien too, causing a storm. The remaining actors are sufficient as well as costumes, costumes and production details. Even though your children will see the cover and request this movie to convince them to choose to flick again at the video store. Rest assured that children and adults will find that this movie is huge, so choose A Night at the museum or around the world in 80 days instead.
