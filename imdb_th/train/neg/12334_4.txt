The location is ridiculous, unbelievable characters, repetitive conversations and ridiculous endings. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I'm a big fan of Kevin Kline, but watched him do Pepe Le Pew's accent for 2 hours because The French people think it's not as fun as they should be. <br /> <br> For her part, Meg Ryan is once again energetic and cute. As (your reception): dolls, kewpie, babies, puppies, children Cats, what you think are animals The most lovely thing in the world She still can't tolerate true humanity. <br /> <br /> This film makes me feel like the opportunity for Lawrence Kasdan and Kline's friends to travel to Paris and the south of France. I can't really blame them.
