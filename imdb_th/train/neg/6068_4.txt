Lemon vodka is an arminian movie that is charming but not very consistent to create satisfaction for others. Although it has been designed reasonably well But this film lacks the true "zing" based on scenes instead of many scenes that seem like a common theme for the intelligent art audience. This film has a moment of disappointing moments of the film. But they deserve to have movies that are genius Too dark to be a serious comedian and to be a serious drama. Vodka Lemmon will make many views confused and offensive in the end. You might laugh But these moments are not far from the snow-filled sea and the bus ride periodically. The noble endeavor is finally done without the lack of coordination of storytelling.
