In general, I am willing to open my mind about rom coms more than many people. But this is not a very good effort It has nothing to do with comparison to the original English manuscript - never seen and I will doubt There are many stories about the plot that is winding. There is no chemistry between Lead and the show / fierce character from the male lead actor (Jimmy Fallon). <br /> <br /> Fallon walks on the screen. Wear clothes And hairstyle of 15 years old and served less than a decade He should be the teacher you see and of course it is well known that school districts around the world love to hire people who are less mature than the children they intend to teach. The character is very disturbing and there is no reason I suspect that any actor will make him a favorite. But old trustworthy, such as John Cusack or Adam Sandler, may be able to take pictures Not Fallon that is not funny or an actor But it seems that he is both Not that you used to believe in Fallon in his role or not believe that there are ways that these two people should or will be together. Near the end of the movie, there is one scene at Barrymore. (Which is lovely as usual But can't carry this person alone - it's hard to have a single love). Tell Fallon that it ended too much and she moved on. And instead of feeling bad about that scene or apologizing to Fallon, you're She cheered vigorously. Eventually, she did what she should do several months ago. But of course, the plot of mechanics won't let that end. (The end that may actually come out of this mess) and we will see a rational career woman throw it away. This innocent idiot and encouraging delusions Of course, it means gooey and satisfaction. But actually it makes me feel more disgusting than anything else
