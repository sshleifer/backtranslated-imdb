I'm not from America and I know what 'wife swap' is. When the expression comes from that name, I am excited to see the seductive sexual moments from the list. But what I received was true stupidity I was judged wrong with the name of the name. There was no adult content, no nudity or even rude conversations. (Throwing a wide pitch at Hallmark and I think they edit / close the content to make it complete) <br /> <br /> The program that gives the image of the American / Western family status. Family sucking behavior In each episode, two wives / two mothers (more accurate) were chosen to stay in each other's homes and change the daily routine of each family with their own new rules. Sometimes it turns out to be better or worse. In the end, each mother will be brought back with her husband and try to summarize what they have done with each family in the past. It is the suction part of each program, fighting, fighting for their rights. I was sucked to see these things instead of watching sexually mature content. I mean, those who prepared this program more than those who gave the name "Wife Swap". It would be better to be called "Mom Swap". In conclusion, it destroyed all the wonderful things that the real wife swap has for! <br /> <br /> Wife Swap = the average of the actual show.
