Watching Tom Hanks as an assassin for an Irish mob is like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a rapist, which it doesn't work. I have a difficult time accepting this, no matter how I don't think Tom can't do what I can. I've been following his career since he and the monster. But for some reason this makes me flat Probably because I am a fan of graphic novels and there is a risk of causing a sound like a boyfriend boy. (The only form of life that is lower than Boy Boy's cockroach) The overall movie failed. For me, more Jude Law and removing everything made me feel a little more frustrated and frustrated. I expect to have a much bigger crime movie in Bonnie's veins and Clyde Mendes pulls out all the hearts from the story and leaves us with nothing but bare bones. There are many things like this flick. But the movie is full of beautiful screens. Paul Newman is a wonderful picture as usual, and I enjoy scoring, but Tom as the "God of Death" completely Sullivan.
