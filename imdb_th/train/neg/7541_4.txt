Great mystery But this movie is down from there The beginning of the contract with the carcass and the woman and her daughter were burned in the presence of police officer Edward. He was bruised about this and saw pills. A mysterious letter appears from the old girlfriend asking for help to find the missing daughter. Therefore, Ed traveled to the island community of most women. They don't like outsiders. Many fillers show that Ed looks around the city for girls. That makes this film too long. Finally, it will be a little better at the end when we learn about the crazy rituals that women show and the final of sinister plans for Edward. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a story written. Long <br /> <br /> Final verdict: I'll cross this thing.
