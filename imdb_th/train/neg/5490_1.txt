When I was a kid, we were often babysitting and we often rent films or watch movies at the cinema. This is one of the movies we watch. This is one of the most stupid movies I've ever seen. I think it might be Walt Disney Pictures! Mars falls on Earth, becoming human, being a human friend, and trying everything possible to go home. But he was distracted by the wonders of the world The only good comment I have given is the actor who chose to return to the future of Christopher Lloyd as a Martian, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Jeff Daniels's Dumber as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley. Brace Channing, but other than that, it is completely ridiculous. Poor!
