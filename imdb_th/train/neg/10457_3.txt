What can I say? I'm a big fan of action. 'Popular North' and horror movies Especially when it comes with a lot of humor and satire But I'm not a fan of Snake on the plane. <br /> <br /> There are three things that might happen to this movie: ?? Humor of the situation; ?? Horror; And ?? The novelty of the hundreds of snakes that belong to the plane. <br /> <br /> At first, this movie was not written as a horror or comedy, and only 1 or 2 points in the movie you would smile. To yourself If you want to experience this movie, the trailer shows true horror movies. <br /> <br /> Secondly, if you expect the movie to be full of action and shocks, you won't be disappointed. It doesn't stand out above other movies, but it always draws your attention. <br /> <br /> Third, though, the novelty of Snakes of a Plane won't deteriorate. What the fuss is, "<br /> <br /> I know that this movie has a high rating. A) Many reviews written before the movie is released and B) The user leveling is less diverse. More than usual, 77% of people rate 10/10 movies, with only 7% given. 9/10 - Why is this big gap?
