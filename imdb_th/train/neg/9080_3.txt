I just ordered this product pay-per-view at home because I was bored and needed laughter. I have to admit that I laughed a few times, but I can't remember which part of them. I don't understand why this movie happened. It claims to be a joke. But seriously, I didn't find a singing penis or a 70 year old woman naked. Very funny. This film tries to adapt to the comedies. 'Total revenue' of the previous year, such as American Pie and Road Trip, but it failed miserably It's a way to make a lot of profit and it's a joke. Why Cameron Diaz attaches her name to this movie! The only thing I like about this movie is when Dave and Angela are in the pool. I think it's sexy and fun and well done. In addition, avoid this movie 3/10.
