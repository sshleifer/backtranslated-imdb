Mary-Kate and the famous twin sister Ashley Olsen climb up to the famous sitcoms like "Two of a Kind". I have never seen them before. But I have no idea what to expect But it's much worse Essentially, sister Hunter Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome for a summer internship program. But shortly after starting their work, they will be fired immediately for the accident set. But the person who owns the company they work in is Derek Hammond (Julian Stone). Let them return to work and they gradually prove themselves as useful assets and talented (fashion) artists and help stop. Starring Leslie Dannon as Jami, Derek Lee Nixon, Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentina Mattolini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. You can tell That this movie was created Which was to go straight to video cameras that do not match perfectly, and did not help when your sights of Rome. In fact, the background is the only thing to watch. The twin sisters are the two most annoying celebrities in the round. I knew before that they would ignore me in some way. A horrifying gush of garbage movies is quite bad!
