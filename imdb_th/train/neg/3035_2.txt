We received the service - a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'll admit that since I was a white person and had no real experience in "Step Dance World" I may not be an absolute authority in this type of movie. On the other hand, I know that the animation is not good when I see <br /> <br /> And I just saw it. The boys <br /> <br /> filmed on a low budget - vision and directed by Ian Iqubal. Rashid, ("A Touch of Pink"), "How She Move" tells the story of the importance of following one's dreams - even if those dreams include hip hop music annoyed Conversations, speaking, people will not understand that he or she has international translators. <br /> <br /> I'll try to summarize the story "plot" a little. First, there are two actors who look like LL Cool J working in Car shop in Toronto (Mecca with racial diversity) but still have eight hours of dance practice a day. <br /> <br /> There are a few other people in the "this" team, including white token friends and men. That looks like Denzel Washington in "Malcolm X". There are also two women in one film, similar to Serena Williams and others. It seems Geraldine from "Flip Wilson Show", an old woman Was expelled from a private college because his parents She spent the entire tuition brother addict. Another girl, who is a member of Salt N Pepa, is no doubt a normal person. <br /> <br /> There is another guy who looks like Eddie Murphy's buckwheat while still an actor. Another person who is a Huggy Bear. These guys are dancers, step-dancers. Clearly, this activity is hard-core in 'Hood' and they are practicing the jam. "Detroit's big step monster" <br /> <br /> Because I don't understand the conversation 90 percent. (Perhaps some of the subtitles may have the same benefits as in the Bergman movie or one of the music videos by Snow). It is hard to explain what happened unless there was a lot of controversy. (Which never smiles) (from one group to another group) has many dance steps and annoying hip hop songs. <br /> <br /> It's a very interesting story. Kiki "with a terrible soundtrack" Rudy "with annoying rap music in the background" Cry Freedom "without laughter. <br /> <br /> But why the movie - which may send The enormous impact on black viewers - must have addiction, parents who have At best, and the name sounds like the young boy who first spoke the phrase. "How are you moving?" <br /> <br /> I was "moved" by this movie. Move out of the theater as soon as possible
