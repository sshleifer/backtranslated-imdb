I expect the film to be released as much as fans of Broadway. I waited and read the review for several months about the winning performance. I mean the star power of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... This movie must be at least 4 out of 4 stars, right? incorrect! I was absolutely disappointed with the finished product. This film does not match the advertising received and the only economical facilities are Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque performance helped this film when it affected it. Several lullabies and Jennifer Hudson's performances forced you to pay attention every time on the screen. Her performance "And I tell you" is the only time I feel that this ad deserves you cringed as she begs her to have no good person to let her in the group and in his life. Many reviewers said she stole movies from more experienced actors and deserved all the awards she received. For this performance, Anika Noni Rose appeared strong with great voice and funny talent. > <br /> Conversely, Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles have gone through their performances. Red Fox's acting skills for this film seem to make him perform his extraordinary "ray" and Beyonce Knowles is shooting a fashion photo or video recording. Her performance is not strong enough to make you pay attention to your character at any point in the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie dances too fast for 30 minutes and 1 song ("Heartfelt" single from Beyonce. Jamie Foxx's) too long <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver WA
