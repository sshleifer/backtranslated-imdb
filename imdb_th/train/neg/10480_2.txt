It has a great name But that's it and you won't get more than that for your money. In fact, the first 30-40 minutes of the movie, you may find it funny, something. But after that, the story changed from one side to the other. There is no specific reason and you just don't understand what happened until the action disappears. <br /> <br /> And also the producer (Roberto Angel Salcedo) calls him an actor. But I don't think he can be like that Called nothing more than spending too much time !! .... The little boy who plays as his son has no sense of acting at all, and I believe it is just the favor he has made or something. Because he didn't know what he was doing. <br /> <br /> For some reason while doing They think the selection of comedians is possible. But they can't !! And sometimes cheap humor isn't good. I don't buy. <br /> <br /> But hopefully this will be as bad as it gets. In order for people to accept those DVDs to the public in a tasteful way, they must present food which may be possible. <br /> <br /> Maka
