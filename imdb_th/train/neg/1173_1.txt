If I had one camera accidentally stuck to the ground, that movie was enough for each shot only once and then lost the whole film and had to steal coins to buy a number of digital video tapes. And forced to do A film about the French Revolution for more than 2 hours and there are no scenes and must have my 4 year old autistic son draw a background image and there is only one actor I can find is someone who doesn't. 'There was no need to audition for the TV series that year and I was forced to not use any songs in the movie either. The zoom function in the camera didn't work except once when it started zooming in and could not 'Don't stop. Oh and if I hate my audience, I might do something like this great. But hilariously wrong, wasting time for hell The background looks almost big.

The highest point in fighting the sword / laser duel. I didn't intend to make the movie broken for those who didn't watch. But that's not the way it ends The only thing I realized that wasting more time watching this movie was writing this review. Peace.
