The worst movie I've ever seen ... Someone can tell me where I should laugh. No hint or shadow of thought The three leading actors are pandemic, especially those who (I think Aldo) from Sicily that _can't_ create a Sicilian accent !!! Don't talk about inserting dreams about Dracula ... It's another way that draws from the worst cabaret tradition to make this "movie" a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do things. That can But the movie called this story is too difficult to help. I will give "0" / 10 but the lowest sign is 1/10 and so I have to evaluate it with a single mark.
