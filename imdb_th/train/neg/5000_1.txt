This may be the worst excuse for a TV program since oh I don't know what happened now? Nothing happens with this ridiculous "series", although most are shot by Britney and Kevin. You won't get any good details in their personal lives. Mostly just they do stupid, talk small and act like white trash. Look, I like Britney's music as much as the first child, but this list is just a pure filler for a country that is attached to Britney. Thank God that they broke up because they were surprisingly boring. This show is poisonous!
