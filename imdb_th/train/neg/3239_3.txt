Ah, the infamous "Guinea Pig" series ... I must say I'm totally disappointed in this whole series. ("He never died", "Mermaid in Manhole" and "Flower of Flesh and" Blood "is an exception ... and even those things are not excellent in any way ...) But" Demon Experiment "It's just a normal blow. There is nothing realistic that happens here, besides the top spot. (Or may resist the climax depending on how you see) Torture "The flower of flesh and blood" is a violent and bloody image of a fake "scent" object, but the film falls into the realism level. I applaud the Japanese who pushed the boundaries, and they have come more than 2 decades ago in the crown of creating the movie "Extremes" but "The Demon Experiment" doesn't hold Worth watching if you are dead if there is no other reason than to see what the fuss is. But I can make this movie very generous. 3/10 and that's just for looking through the scene ...
