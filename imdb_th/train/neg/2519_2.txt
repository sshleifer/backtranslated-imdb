I paid to watch this movie in the cinema. <br /> <br /> It's going to score 1, but the fight scene between the robots is ok and it's surprising Some have bigger budgets than others. I have no problem with it. Unfortunately, science fiction movies may receive the most budget for obvious reasons. But one way that this movie fails is that every piece of each scene looks charming and cheap. I mean, they can't make it "look" well. <br /> <br /> Other important reasons that this movie is scary is acting. If I watch a movie now and know what to expect For cheese factors But at that time, I was expecting to have a good movie and no clue that it was really scary. How would it end? <br /> <br /> Luckily, the experience ended only 85 minutes
