I might not make this movie shaky, fair because I can't see it all. Maybe if I saw it in the cinema in the original presentation, I might appreciate it. But it's too slow for me. <br /> <br /> I read the book 25 years ago and the details of the storyline are faded from memory. This didn't help the movie because it was less than bright and clear in the presentation of the event. <br /> <br /> This is a four-story movie that is really linked or a movie in four parts and I believe That intention Will see more than four nights in the drama presentation I found that I was fun enough. But it was something that I could do when I had to sit through Part II, which had never been traced back. Reading Tolstoy's philosophy is one thing. If you get a good translation or can read it in the manuscript, his excellent writing is worth more than any issue that may occur with the story. However, in the movie, it's hard to repeat without thinking. <br /> <br /> I have other problems with the parts of the movie that I see. It's amazing how this camera works, which draws attention from itself instead of serving to develop the story. <br /> <br /> Obviously I lack something, but I can't call that enthusiasm. Can cast part III and IV
