If this is a movie that "To be favored" by someone. They need serious help. There is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest. I have never seen the original movie. This story comes from a new creation. (Some stories in 1950) But it must be better than being bullying. <br /> <br /> The key is expelled from the army because it is An important element and stop teaching children at the ROTC school. Unfortunately, it's important that Daman Van Van ... So the children are in an annoying and humorous world. Can Wayans defeat these losers in shape? Do they make him more human? This film explodes like the movie The Wayans. Most do it in just a few minutes. William Hickey takes a minute to screen for quite a few minutes. This charming old man (Best known for me as an actor "Tales from the Crypt", best known for you as Uncle Louis from "Christmas holiday") shines every moment he is on the screen. <br /> Bam Bam Bigelow creates a biker image. I will not mind Bam Bam a little more, but I think he plays the motorcycle rider about as much as he can apply to military movies. <br /> <br /> There are teachers that attract people. Some people fall in love with Major Payne. Although he treats children badly, does not have social skills and is impossible to change to be the person you want to spend time with. She must be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I'm not sure (Although it looks "stupid" because the movie makes it clear that she leaves the house often enough) <br /> <br /> Wayans have a period of time shining: the dance sequence that he shows. A set of moves (including "very good" robots) and with the help of songs from 2 Live Crew, this scene is very fun. But almost did not create anything else that caused this dog to be wet. <br /> <br /> seriously avoid this movie If you want to watch a movie about a loser that helps a lost child become a hero to rent or buy "Ernest Goes to Camp", at least he is a cute and really funny loser. Maybe if Major Payne fought with the badgers, I would feel better. But he can't Forget to forget Wayne ... You can do much better.
