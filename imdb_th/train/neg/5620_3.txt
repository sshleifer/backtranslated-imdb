In fact, there is no reason to check this matter a lot because there are very misleading and bias messages. <br /> <br /> The perfect example is when the filmmaker claims "Saul" or Paul of Tarus claims that) there is no idea that Jesus is or is a human being. This assertion is deliberately false while he accuses others of presenting or he does not know what the "Bible" says. <br /> < br /> First Of course we can do Examining his misleading claims about Hebrew 8.4; Which he expressed words "If Jesus was on the earth, he would not be a priest." So here he set up an ignorant and illogical viewer to accept his false evidence .. Why? He did what is called the Bible. He believed that those who accused him of doing the same thing were bringing things out of context. <br /> <br /> One of Hebrews 8 is; 1 .. "Now what we say here is sum: We have a high priest who is on the right hand side of the throne of His Majesty the King in heaven." The upper context speaks clearly to Jesus. Which is on earth and ascended to heaven after his alleged resurrection. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to do with the way the filmmakers want the audience to take the Bible out of context. Here he proposed the basis that "Paul was not aware of Jesus. But the only one in the "paradise" <br /> <br /> Can you follow? <br /> <br /> Help see that the faithful filmmaker; Hebrews 7; 14 "For it is clear that our Lord appeared from Judah; What tribe does Moses say about the priesthood? <br /> <br /> The filmmakers didn't just claim that the Hebrew writer who tried to show the writer of that book had no knowledge of "Jesus Christ". It is always possible that Paul did not write the Hebrew language. But I won't go here But the filmmakers claimed that Paul did it and that was the beginning of the issue given here. <br /> <br /> It's not like the filmmakers didn't give the appropriate score in some areas. But he was involved in the blind prejudice of religion that he bashed when he participated in these strategies in my strong thoughts, he lost credibility as religion He took out and the film is no longer a documentary. But it's a personal opinion and bias of the filmmaker, nothing more, nothing less
