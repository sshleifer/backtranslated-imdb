Once again, Canadian TV beat himself and created another program that would not stand out after the show. <br /> <br /> The last time I remembered that the sitcom should make the reaction we laughed. In business dealings How funny is it to beat the prototypes of white people who think that every Muslim is a terrorist? OK, maybe it's a joke just to stick with the crowd, but not 30 minutes. It's called hitting a dead horse. Even SNL knows to give up after the break. <br /> <br /> We also have Slightly conflicting in these scripts. Will she not be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to stop fasting Ramadan? When will Ramadan begin? Oh, this is an Emmy award here. <br /> <br /> And characters! What character! They are all cardboard that has nothing interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to another. That is the point of funny situations. We need to have strong, interesting and dynamic characters so that we can be pulled into the TV continuously each week. We have to pay attention to these characters to worry about what problems they will receive next week. If I had never seen these characters, it would be too early. Fortunately, I can't remember their names. (Note to CBC - that's not a good sign.) <br /> <br /> And the performance was very polite. It has more problems in casting than in the actors. None of these people actually include the characters they play. They seem to show their role as if they were working in the film of the week. Sitcoms want actors who live and breathe with that character - causing us to fall in love with them - where they separate themselves from characters that cannot be expressed. See American sitcoms and you'll see how easily identifiable characters are. Part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as if it were a platform for bigger and better things rather than their big characters in the life they would spend 8 years on the show. Image The level of disregard for the characters and the project will be shown. But if actually speaking, considering the weak concept and scary writing, there is not much for the actor to do. But speaking their roles and trying not to bump into any furniture. As other reviewers say, this seems to be a TV movie and not a sitcom. <br /> <br /> And the director or there. Is absent! What I can say, Canada has a lot of talent. See what the Comedy channel is doing with the killing puppets and sting at Trailer Park Boys (not a movie because it makes the helium dog big). See American performances to see. Our potential as a place where many of our stars go to find the right job. <br /> <br /> Give credit to CBC. They know how to build a reputation for real events. Remember? Or "The One"? No - Do not try to learn any character names on this list because of course it is Dodo's path. <br /> <br /> We hope to have a full ACTRA attack emerging from Ceeb for a time.
