First of all, I apologize to my English. <br /> <br /> Everyone from the former Yugoslavia who is not a Serbian violent person will agree with me. This movie only shows the Serbian and Serbian sides. No Serbian crimes Fortunately, everyone saw that this movie was created by Serbian, so there is no 'professional' neutrality. All that was interviewed was not a professional. In some way, some men only read books written by Serbian who are violent. Genocide, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Even the Slovenian people accused in this film and all the war in Slovenia take a few days and Just because the Slovenians are lucky, there are not many Serbs in Slovenia and YNA can not access Croatia, Slovenia trough. (After the Croatian-Serbian war began) All Slovenians were offended because of all the allegations in this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone who saw fit Croat would agree with one thing: independence too soon. Perhaps all important conflicts can be avoided. However, the mention of World War II and some irrelevant things is a truly pathetic attempt to prove everything. Just imagine the nuclear bombing of Japan in Seattle and Washington and say that it is justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will not find evidence of YNA's soldiers strangled and murdering Serbian civilians near Vukovar, but you can find a tape with a journalist confirming that his claims about Serbian civilians near Vukovar are lies All over the internet And the director forgot to mention the entire bombing of Vukovar by YNA (now on the side of Serbia and Montenegro and 100% full of Serbs and Montenegrin) and we will not start with the movement of Chetnik At the beginning, it was just an anti-movement. But the director forgot to talk about the cooperation with the Nazis, including Ustashe, cleansing and fighting against the Yugoslav party again. There are thousands of things. But can be easily checked There are many things that are misleading in this movie. There are only a few allegations that are true. All Croatian films are provocative from this film. <br /> <br /> I believe that I do not need to talk about the rejection of the genocide of Srebrenica. Genocide is too much evidence. Imagine a movie about rejection of the Holocaust. This movie is the same. And according to the film, the Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo bombed themselves This movie, all the stories of Bosnian Muslims are destroyed. <br /> <br /> The director forgot to mention the occupation of the small Macedonian Serbs. <br /> <br /> Croatian, Slovenian, Bosnian and Masi Macedonian never entered the Serbian border. If you are not a Serbian and you start to believe something from this movie, know that Serb has some propaganda that Croats, Bosnian, Muslims and Macedonians are Serbian who made history. So ... <br /> < br /> Even 50% of Serbs say that this movie is '' little '', extreme and pro-Serbian. <br /> <br /> And the Serbian radicals are very pleased with this movie ( There are about 40% Serbs at The rating for the radicals) <br /> <br /> I think people understand my point here. In the documentary called this is very little truth, and my advice for everyone is: inform yourself before watching this movie. After that, you will laugh at all the pathetic accusations. <br /> <br /> See the real documentary about the death of Yugoslavia.
