Ok, this movie was created for one reason and the only reason for making money !! Producers apparently do not care about killing classic horror movies. I know that this movie will be sucked as soon as the pg-13 has a slashers pg-13 movie that has become a good story? Like to ask how many women on the moon? The answer is no !! Prom night 1980 no masterpiece ads But definitely deserves to be recognized as a movie that still remains true to the genre and deosnt trying to be more 3 big problems with him ..................... <br /> <br /> 1) The way he fled He was trapped in a mental institution and he escaped through the vents !! What is hell? Why do they have air conditioning in the patient room? Do they want him to be comfortable during his stay? 2) His intentions are quite uncertain, the killer wants the main victim's family and all his friends die so that he can have her for himself. He says he loves her. But in the next minute he tried to kill her She loves you or just rapes her. Normal? 3) How good is the killer? How does he develop all skills? He used to be a teacher, so in this scene he killed a young girlfriend who was the main victim while he slept on the floor and she didn't notice it as a stupidity. 2 stars out of 10 horrible attempts. Horror movie
