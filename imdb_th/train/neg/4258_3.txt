I will give this movie 5 more than 3. If it will be at least at the time ... When I see it for the first time, it's just something you can wait from a job that doesn't depend on the artistic ability of the person. Direct But in the ideal, or I want to say that the stupid habits of our government (Kazakhstan) ... It's a shame because 'Qazaqfil'm' is shooting a good movie when not honored by the name Shaken Aimanov. But actually, he ran movies such as 'Konec Atamana', 'Kyz Zhibek' or even 'Aldar Kose', but after Aimanov's death, the production of quality movies was greatly reduced in 10 years with Produce very few movies However, in the late 1980s, there was a 'Assa' shot. It was a movie about a crime group that was first established in a big country. One year later, Mr. Rashid Nugmanov filmed another movie by performing with the actor / actor Sang the same name V.Tsoy. At that time he was already a Soviet / Russian rock legend - a movie called 'Igla' (The Needle or something). It's completely new. Called at that time as a revival or a new Kazakh film. Unfortunately, today we do not have quality movies, our director filmed a film about the financial support of France and Japan, so the movie is not suitable for the public. But for professional critics, some authors use the price at foreign film festivals, but there are only a few that become business assets ... and return to our 'nomads' again. Such movies are often unpopular due to the wide aspect. The same result is with Nikita Mikhalkov's 'Sibirski Cyrilnik' about the Russian Tsarist who has been equaled with foreign partners. I think they are French or English. Nobdy likes it. Even in public, Russia will become a topic Principles of comedians and comedians like 'KVN' IMHO
