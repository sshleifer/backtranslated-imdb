This movie is about two brothers and sisters that should be the same - but don't expect to be intelligent - either as a surgeon and they can write computer codes. The genius that they want to call themselves, which sounds a lot of exaggeration. If you compare it to personal characteristics, you can recognize it from the content of the name. <br /> <br /> I don't like the style of the movie I believe that the anxiety, confusion and blues that are brought for the purpose But what I didn't get was the reason This film is cheap in the scene and tells the story in general, without a human perspective. It gives an experience like a comic book. However, it makes the audience feel puzzled. But it brought him into the blues with short conversations, monotonic scenes, cutting of music and sudden sounds. <br /> <br /> The film's story is easy. Most of the pictures come from imitation, delirium, confusion of drug use and dynamic cutting. <br /> <br /> I will openly say that this film does not match my expression slightly.
