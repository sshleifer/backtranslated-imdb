Are you kidding? <br /> <br /> But that's not the case. However, I received this movie and 3 other stories. They are all on DVD. This film starts with the movie OK, but begins to fall down from the middle of the story. <br /> <br /> And the end can be said that it is one of the climatic endings in the film history A lot of blood in the last order, and if you like this, Cole Locke is the movie for you ... <br /> <br /> 3/10
