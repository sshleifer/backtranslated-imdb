Pokémon 3 is the episode of the TV series less than three or four episodes, which are assembled without regular advertising. The story is normal for Pokemon. (Conflict, struggle and resolution that everyone is happy in the end) and there is nothing new or unusual in animation (Above the closing credits!) Without explanation and everything looks too sweet. <br /> <br /> Why have to watch on the big screen? The only reason is to be a part of your child's world. My son both enjoyed Pokémon, and when I showed my interest in what they liked, we got closer. Watching movies in the cinema is still different from watching on the tube and my son enjoys the full movie experience. I gave this movie 4 stories, mostly from my child's perspective. <br /> <br />
