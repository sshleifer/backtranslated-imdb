I have seen many horror performances over the years, such as the Nightstalker related to the legendary Wendigo, so I am looking forward to having an angry spirit causing bodily harm to add flavor to Halloween I'm misunderstood The whole film creates a feeling of an upcoming event that is scary and creepy. But then sent a story of revenge and murder that was easier than losing some property It's very scary - no! This movie has many things in common with the Cold Creek Manor. The other loser <br /> <br /> It's harder and harder to believe what Hollywood brings about scary movies. Because they rarely meet anything strange. Which fool is paying to create a fake movie? Go back to the drawing board and do useful things with the dollars you have to leave.
