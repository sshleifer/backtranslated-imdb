American filmmakers decided to create a movie that they thought was Japanese. Not all characters perform well, the actors are not Japanese, and the scenes are cheap, unreal, and of course not representative of Kyoto during the age of 20 and 30. Those who have read this book understand that the author does Has added any special value to make a difference to the movie from the script Worse, they also changed the original plot line with a few goofs. Rob Marshall used for his two main characters, two well-known Chinese actors, who had previously participated in the Tiger Hidden Dragon. Marshall may see a Chinese movie and they represent Japanese culture. Seeing both actors together again makes the movie look more ridiculous. The last scene of Quentine Tarantino in Kill Bill # 1 is ten times more Japanese than this movie.
