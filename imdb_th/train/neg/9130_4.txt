It is true that fans of Peter Sellers work may be disappointed with this, his last venture. But of course, all the fans of the seller will be satisfied with all his movies because of the great talent of humans. And the evil plans of Dr. Fu Manchu is no exception. Unfortunately, this film will prove to be the last film of the seller. (It was released after his death), but it's also good to see that the man can maintain an irreplaceable ability until he dies. And not only will we receive only one vendor. only But we still get because the seller not only But received only the inquiry position But also his poetry with Nayland Smith, an equally bizarre detective The story is incredibly different when we follow Fu's comedy show that will make the elixir challenging his age and Nayland and his colleagues try to protect him. Like all other film vendors, this film comes with impeccable performances from him, including many of his familiar co-actors - David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John. Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren are also a good thing to see Pink Panther Burt Kwouk (Cato) bouncing. Enjoy hijacking with sellers - even if they have the same role. But still good This story is quite ridiculous, as ridiculous as many of the characters involved in this story are strong films under the influence of the fool. And even though it's not the highest point of comedy comedy But there are many jokes that seem to point in the right direction The film failed to commercially in its first release due to worldwide mourning after the death of the seller. (This film has been released less than 3 weeks later) and has a melancholy idea in your heart when you see that this is a seller. The last movie It's far from great movies - it's usually too slow, too ridiculous, and sometimes jokes aren't there - but it's fun - if it's just a great performance from Peter Sellers.
