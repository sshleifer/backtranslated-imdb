Somewhere embedded in this movie is a movie that tries to come out half way. The only trace is a few early scenes in Los Angeles. (In bars and cemeteries) and then there are a few designs of production As I said very deeply One of the greatest challenges faced by movies related to supernatural is having a character responding confidently in an unbelievable situation. Annie Mcenroe's reaction to being told that her sister (should Will be Dee Wallace from the first movie) is (is?) The werewolf is if I remember along the line of; "Oh really?". Not a better answer for the challenges mentioned above. It is not a continuation as the story moves to Trannsylvania to find Stirba the (seems to appoint himself) "Queen of the Werewolves" As Stirba, Sybil Danning is the two best things in the movie. Yes, better than human wolf sex scenes, Brown Brown performances and werewolf sets that look strange. The final credit has assumed that the legendary level is inferior and is available in all their glory. (At least until the sensor will find them) on Youtube. Check them to see why and memorize the entire movie with the same meaning. If you capture this picture on television in the United States, the credit has been re-edited to replace the endlessly repeated Danning image that ripped her top with a never-ending re-shot of tearing her figure. The ridiculous story is the time when Cherry is on the top, which challenges satire.
