Overall, the picture is very disappointing. Very slow, created for the story of the basic role of Maria Schrader. Find the secret of your family's past. (It seems that all things will last forever, right? There is no rhythm in the movie.) *** Spoiler *** Her mother Ruth is assisted by the Nazis by a German woman, played by Katrina Munn All of Ruth's characters are one-dimensional. So, the protagonist. *** Spoiler ends. *** This movie cuts between the New York and Berlin era and the 40's of Berlin. When what happened Never have a clear indication of time ?? Very annoying. The worst part is the end. *** Spoiler *** All performances and gibberish about Jews who are suffering a lot just by an accident from the bureaucracy! Let me take a break. That is how the Jews left Rosenstrasse. The question of the Jewish liberation has never been answered. Who is Gobels who frees them? Lean Fischer sleeping with Goebels? In Venice, this film won the performance for Kerimann. Why? ?? I don't know. Must be a Jewish theme?
