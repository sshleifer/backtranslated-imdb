I think that if you like endless conversations that do not pass stories and flashy camera effects, such as changing scenes in the TV program _Angel_, will you enjoy my movie? All I want is a good small story and not there. Walking back and forth, the plot points were buried under the sea of ​​unnecessary conversations and there was absolutely no fear or tension. <br /> <br /> Is it narrow? Is it Wendigo? No, it's a camera technician using speed. That's not scary It doesn't just create tension or atmosphere. If you're scared of MTV, I noticed that at the end of this movie, there was a laughing laugh from the audience.
