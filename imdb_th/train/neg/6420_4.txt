OK, I will admit, it started very satisfying and good. But then it fell. I didn't believe Sarah Michelle Gellar might have read the script after about 5 minutes in the movie. The only reason I sat around. Movies. I want to see the thread that Ned and surprised me. Okay, I can't tell you if there is or not, because the ending just makes you confused. This is not appropriate for running in the theater. I'm sorry. But it doesn't mean it's just awesome. The only reaso I give 4 is because it has a few scary parts ... That's it! You can see, I can't tell you. Hey, you might like it or even love it! But if you hate it, don't say I didn't warn you!
