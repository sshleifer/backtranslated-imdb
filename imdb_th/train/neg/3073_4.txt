The back of the DVD box says that Ellen Page has starred in this movie. She didn't even appear until two thirds of the movie finished and had a minor role. I don't think it has a supporting role, but as a "bit" part, the plot has many unexplained elements Some examples: Why does the main character reject her eldest son? Why is her younger son heading to the train? He said that it was "suck" gambling which didn't explain anything. Obviously, the author of the script does not know the meaning of suck betting. This movie is not worth the rental price in my opinion. Save your money and watch for free on TV if you think you have to see
