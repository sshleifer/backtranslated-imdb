It has been talked about this movie and I hate when writing reviews that others have already said about what to say. But this thing is that I watched the movie zillions and I'm writing a review of all the movies I've seen. So I have to write something. <br /> <br /> The performance is stupid. It's really stupid that the announcer expresses her sadness towards the plane. The nuns are good and professional assistants who come to take care of children. The three main killings in the movie are so weak that you wonder how the creator of this movie is stupid. They don't know that even being stolen is still scary. We do not see how Krapa was killed. The dentist and his assistant made me feel that they were worthy of death. You just disagree with them. And Uncle Tony in the garage died in a better way We just heard him scream and we didn't see anything!
