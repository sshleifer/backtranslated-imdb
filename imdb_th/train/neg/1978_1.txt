Poor is the word Pathetic plays, bad conversations and hip-hop and fashion ... What happened to it? The director of this movie behaved badly, like the movie he created. If someone takes time and effort to do something entirely, there may be opportunities. Betting the studio is still trying to find a way to make it worse. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is Stacey Dash ... Asian chicks are not bad. These women also carried the entire movie. If not for them, I will destroy the copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> If there are people who haven't seen it yet and have ideas to do, don't waste your time ... you'll regret it later
