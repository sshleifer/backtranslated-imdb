Leave it to Paul "Sex in the brain" Verhoeven to create an unseen, lazy and innocent story of INVISIBLE MAN. If he wants to direct the Pok√©mon film, I'm sure he will turn it into a big strange story. I don't care about sex or even make it sluggish. (Check out my other reviews) In the movie, but frankly, it is obvious that the director has a mind that follows only and he cannot see the interesting aspects of the human story that is invisible. It's a shame because it might be good if this film doesn't take much time with Kevin Bacon's invisible woman. <br /> <br /> Actors from the game do what they can. For Script notes But I feel bad for some of them, including William Devane, who is completely lost. <br /> <br /> But what I expected from director SHOWGIRLS, which btw is more entertaining than a haughty movie And this is not good
