This may be the worst movie I can see if I can live 100 or not. I think the first group of elementary students may have a better storyline as a class project. I am very stupid to watch it and God has mercy on the spirit paid for making this movie. <br /> <br /> And after I finally closed it, I wanted to vomit. Who has a clue about photography when doing this? No one has a clue about the performance. Nobody knows anything about it. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that F / X will show this shit on occasion. The only time I saw it was one of Starz! Channels - not even the main list And it was around 03:00 am at
