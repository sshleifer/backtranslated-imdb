The plot of the story about a female nurse named Anna stuck in the midst of chaos around the world while the carnivorous zombies began to rise and occupy the world She fled the streets and was rescued by a black police officer. Until now, very good! I always enjoy horror movies. But this movie is not worthy of being called a horror movie It's not even exciting, even ridiculous. "Flintstones" or "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" will make you more excited. It's like watching a group of bloodthirsty drunken people who are unable to enter the department store to drink more alcohol. The hero who locked himself into the mall to avoid being kidnapped outside is not better as well. Although it seems that they are not drunk But they feel that the mind is disabled Save money instead of spending on this!
