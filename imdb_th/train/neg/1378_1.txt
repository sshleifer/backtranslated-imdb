It's like a bad 80 television program that came out and tried to become a softcore porn movie. Oh my god it's not good The plot of each character is slightly relevant. The plot itself doesn't say anything. I guess something about the drafts He finally shot himself? It's not really clear. In any way, there are volleyball-related games. And the main character (Randy) sleeps all over The only reason my friend rented this movie is because Casper Van Dien is in there and they want to go fast forward with the scene in him which is almost impossible to see. Thank God that I didn't spend any money on it, but I wanted that hour in my life.
