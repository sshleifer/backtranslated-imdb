The championship game is only a few days away, but things in New Orleans are not what it should be. From players who have problems with marriage to overdose to gambling problems to loose killers, life will be what should be a memorable and wonderful moment. Will be brought back into order and the killer stops before the big game is destroyed? <br /> <br /> Even if you think when you first read about the Superdome, this is not a football movie. In fact, football is nothing more than a plot device, and after thinking, but Superdome is another movie, a television drama created to watch a TV full of Hollywood people, with viewers and people who will never be like. that The sleepwalker walks through things that no one really looks good. The best example (Or worst) is Van Johnson in a very small role that is generally lost as to why he was there. The plot is boring, uninteresting and unbelievable. Donna Mills as the "best man"? Yeah right! It's about faith as well as the relationship she has with alcohol. This film still lacks any rhythm, trying to bring all four or five stories into the space of the film, no matter what kind of super dome there is. No drama or suspicion of seeing the Super Dome became a poor example of a 70's movie produced for TV. The only outstanding thing for me was the voice acting from Charlie Jones at the end of the sports broadcast that I didn't listen to. The way he used to speak eloquently and exaggerated the atmosphere in New Orleans was the best pure cheese. <br /> <br /> Like everyone else who had seen the Superdome, I also received courtesy. The Mystery Science Theater 3000 may be one of KTMA's public access episodes, but it is one of the best examples of starting shows. So even if I give only 2/10 Superdome, I will give you 3/5 at my MST3K rating.
