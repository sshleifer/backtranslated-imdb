I bought this movie in Blu-ray format because it promised to provide excellent pictures and music. I am also a big fan of the same movie ... Baraka. This movie is very stylish after Baraka. The wide angle image is very similar to the camera set to take a long time in each shot. Even some scenes are the same. (Road with traffic) While Baraka recounts the great story, nature, planning, man-made environment, spirit and the horrors of the world with intense fashion and great music, this movie just jumped from Shot to shock ... POOF It's finished! I think there must be some mistakes! History of the world? Half the movie is Egypt and the landscape (Looks like Arizona But I don't care to check.) Seriously, this person is scary. Rent if you want, but don't buy. The filmmakers should be ashamed of doing this.
