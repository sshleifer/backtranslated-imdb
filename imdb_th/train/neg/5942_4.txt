If this would be a black experience for me to go out to the front door or back, <br /> <br /> One day, my mother saw a hat over two leaves and then went down all the hills for him. Bassett, who is one of the movies that shines, is nicknamed the pious mother. Even though her anger would be like his life changed But in the middle of the picture, she really decided to accept this She allowed his friends to come in and suddenly it was good to use vulgarity as long as it wasn't in front of my children. <br /> <br /> This is a sad situation of punishing the criminals. You know where this movie is going. <br /> <br /> I laughed loudly at the end when Basset came with her son to bury. He became a man, a human being. He was a convicted criminal. Write the most ruthless rap with profanity and insulting society. That scene in the classroom where he told the teacher that as a sanitation worker, he would receive more than a teacher, a perfect example of what happened in our school. The lack of complete and complete respect for teachers. <br /> <br /> The East Coast, the rapper competition, the West Coast never fully explained. What we see is a blazing gun. <br /> <br /> The frightening images do nothing to prevent the violence of the gang. What is a terrifying example is rap singers and music that is not polite. The African American community should show dissatisfaction. Who is this classless dirty fat that shows Biggie? He makes Rerun from an old TV show, look some by comparison. I know it's a street of Bedford Stuyvesant that turns this fat boy into a rude monster. It's a sad situation when this thing is called entertainment in the form of movies.
