<br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie last night when Cinemax, I was shocked that it was created. In my opinion, Cruel Intentions is one of the best teen-themed movies in recent years. This prequel has something that doesn't correspond to the original. (Sebastian's father marries riches and why is he a wealthy aunt on Long Island?) <br /> <br /> Then I found out that it was not intended to be a new movie. But as a TV drama, Manchester prepared After hearing this, it was reasonable for me that it was not the same as the movie Buffy the Vampire Slayer differs in the form of a TV. <br /> <br /> I think Roger Cumbert tends to increase The ending that this film has after the Fox series was not selected. It seems that something will happen too soon. (Sebastian became a male version of Katharyn) and I don't know if they will go to the next episode because it will not lead to the 1999 film (which is newer. <br /> <br /> One thing I don't like is that it introduces Sebastian and his father's marriage to wealth, which generally doesn't look good in the New York area. And Katharine Sine's mother is just her adult model. It seems that there is nothing that a woman in her position will do to marry a man who is not her social class. But I'm interested in seeing where this story is missing in the series.
