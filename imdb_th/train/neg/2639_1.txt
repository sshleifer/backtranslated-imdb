Let's start this review with the fact that I just registered to write a review and warn people to save their money !! <br /> <br /> This is one of the bad junk parts. The most I've ever seen since The Hulk. The story is the most predictable garbage that you might think of. If you expect 24, but on the big screen, clear that expectation in the bathroom immediately with the money you will use as a ticket .. You may get more enjoyment. The performance is terrible. The plot is completely unrealistic. (Along with the so-called "twist" in the end, I have to say this .. The ending surprised me. I didn't mean twisting the map, surprised me, but instead of the easy way they collected what was regarded as The only scene of the action that was quite good in the entire movie, they quickly ended so quickly that I didn't realize that it was over until I saw the credit rolling and at that point I thought Conventional roll if I can find a way into the cinema <br /> <br /> Casting is terrible for some reason, they must first change the character assigned by chance. Because Michael Douglas plays the play that should be played clearly. Keifer Sutherland while Douglas is sneaking around the agent, touching the phone line, hacking into the system and pulling the person who is pursuing him Emotional advertising, even when things aren't that bad for him He plays a cute agent. There is nothing like our type of Jack Bauer that 24 fans love. <br /> <br /> I promise you that this movie will disappoint all sides. It may be best compared to the remake of "refugees" / "in the power line" but written by people with mental disabilities.
