Posing and placing medicine when the stones in the kidney move through the scarred urinary tract without anything better than allowing painkillers to become obsessed I do not want anyone to think that I pay to watch in the cinema or rent or Protect heaven! ?? I watch it straight away. <br /> <br /> Have a terrifying video game and wander in the room that has to face the terrifying path of The House, fighting Chariot (Type 27), The Hanged Man (Type 041 ) And others that are not possible, curious of me, puzzled that the game will be transferred to the movie screen. <br /> <br /> It can't be <br /> <br /> Repeat plot Revolve around the group "Crazy Boy" ?? a la Scooby Doo ?? Join a remote island to "fanatical" shake the world or not? Whatever is (Today you are a child with a hula hoop and your short skirt and patne ??) After bribing the captain of the ship in thousands to cash to cross there. (Madness, which is a network of rhetoric), they found "frantic" "deserted. <br /> <br /> Is the mention made from" home "? Assuming it is the home of death? But most of the actions that take place in the fake outdoor outfits and other places that are divorced from the appearance of any haunted house. <br /> <br /> The reduced video camera acts as a filler. Backward showing the island in the headache of? Person ?! What is it? Oh, what is "frantic". This is just a "party", right? In the great tradition of re-euphemizing "Used cars" are "pre-owned" or "shock shock" as "post-traumatic stress disorder". The term "party" is now too for you who are addicted to silicone-implanted, jagoffs. metrosexual? <br /> <br /> Know that the party is destroyed by rampant zombies. The clever idea stops here. <br /> <br /> I don't think the pins that call themselves writers and directors understand the mythos behind the zombies. Zombies can't die ?? They didn't die. They have no bleeding, they are not painful. If their bodies are completely destroyed, they will continue to move. At least that's what my Jamaican witch priest told me <br /> <br /> which means. 45 shot into their "heart" will not stop them And a shotgun blasting to the chest will not cause bleeding At least in the logic of the video game, the gun fires a large amount of ammunition in each monster that it completely collapses, leaving the unseen porridge. <br /> <br /> But each actor gets a model. During the time when their circle matrix cameras killed zombies on all sides with a single bullet and karate chops to the sternum Seriously, these zombies are no more effective than the Stormtroopers from "Return Of The Jedi" that was knocked out when Ewoks traveled. <br /> <br /> I think the writer of this movie is Al Bert Altman-Shabby "independent organization" felt compelled to insert a reference to Captain Kirk in the manner of Jurgen Prochnow, who had to use milk money very much to surrender to the presence of fragrant manure. this There is also a reference to the Primo role of Prochnow in the beautiful "Das Boot" when one of the B actors who are not trained said that he "Looks like Captain U-Boat" ". I suspect that the number of target audiences of this movie from Square-Eyed Swine has picked up any movies that refer to other films, such as when Prochnow proclaimed" Say hello to a little friend me "To tell the time his machine gun /> <br /> aimed at people who do not want to understand the uselessness of video game concept. (For example, the game ends when you die, you can't win.) This is just a movie that doesn't require consciousness. And don't care about the mind, so everyone will certainly die except the attractive white couple. <br /> <br /> Better use for the budget used in this film. The school, although Ona Grauer's left breast did well as well as her right breast and those slomo scenes were priceless. I liked the final scene, especially with Ona who tried to act like being stabbed. But it looks like she is eating ice Cream too quickly <br /> <br /> Try to make things more wrong. Structured with my time, I drew digital, digitally restored, 35th anniversary, special edition, DVD, Anamorphic, Widescreen of "Manos: The Hands Of Fate" Ah, yes! ?? The drug is a brain that is numbly appropriately. Now here, there are quality movies created. <br /> <br /> (Movie Maniacs visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)
