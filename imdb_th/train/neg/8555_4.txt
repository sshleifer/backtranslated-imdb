This is a very old and cheap movie - a typical low-cost B-Western. In many ways, Gary Cooper has not been a star and this film is reminiscent of John Wayne's early films created for Studio. O! "The row of poverty", both actors, both familiar styles and personalities, have not happened completely. The advent of Gary Cooper seems to be unlike Cooper in the next few years. (He speaks faster in this film faster than other things.) <br /> <br /> However, unlike the typical B movies of that era, there are at least a few interesting elements that make this film unlike. Who (if not good) If you want to see a woman who is married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lily Damita is a cute female actor and this is a very strange selection option because she has a strong accent. (She is French) and not close to "Beautiful movie star" In addition, she is married to director Michael Curtiz. <br /> <br /> But for me, the most memorable and bizarre aspect of this movie is the gay plan that seems to be like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. From the 30s (and we thought this was a new idea), Gary Cooper's characters were raised by two men who hated women and did everything they could through movies to get Cooper out of women. The hatred of this woman was not very meaningful. But there are many clues throughout the movie that indicate that the filmmakers tried to portray them as real gay couples. Especially at the end, when one person was killed, another was shot with an arrow and carried dead long enough to crawl to the body of a failed friend and fall - with his arms wrapped around him! This is something that is quite frustrating for some time and I think this will make this movie boring today! As far as Cooper and the plot goes, this movie is quite frustrating and skippable. If you don't want to know about Damita or the homosexual, please act as a favorite and find a better Western person.
