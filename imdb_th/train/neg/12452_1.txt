This movie is so bad that I can't explain it. What happened to writers, producers and directors? How do they receive funding for this disgusting thing on this planet? That story is ridiculous, the worst performance, the story ... what about. The first fight in this movie is ok. But it still repeats until you want to close. <br /> <br /> I think I am the greatest loser to not close this movie after the first minute. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I saw this movie just because Scott Adkins was in there ... and he was in it ... for 30 seconds .. <br / > <br /> I give 1 in 10 because it is the lowest grade that IMDb offers. <br /> <br /> Do what you like: Watch Uwe Boll instead ... twice ... It's worth it. Lower your time more.
