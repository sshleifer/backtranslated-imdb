Since its launch in 1983, "A Christmas Story", the story of Jean Shepherd that tells the story of Ralphie has become a true classic. However, "My Summer Story" still has shepherds as narrators. But there is absolutely no charm, and the characters are not as close to the original movie's ability. <br /> <br /> "My Summer Story" is a simple matter of ordinary and not very interesting, including neighbors. Hillbilly and top fighter Charles Groin, which I normally like, is very different in my father's role. (Darren McCaw, in a more traditional way) and his characters never seem to be anything but forcing Kiernan Culkin to be a poor representative of Ralphie and the little brother forgot all. Only the mother seems to be worth it here, and probably because of her nuts, managing the movie theater with a gravy boat when he pushes his luck too much with an angry housewife in "free dish return" <br /> <br /> Stories in this story Most do not matter and stretch some paper. May attract a lot of attention But as a sequel to "A Christmas Story", it is terrible and not worth the time of most people 2 of 10
