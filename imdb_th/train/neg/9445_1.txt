Shame Shame on UA ​​/ DW for what you do! <br /> <br /> I'm shocked. <br /> <br /> Don't take the kids to watch this movie. Humor is not particularly suitable for children - they are bored and disappointed. Of course, all of us have read Theo's wonderful children's books and of course we have expectations ... but this is a pure trash. Dr. Seuss will feel ashamed and of course never give up. "His hard work to take advantage of the classic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Take your money with the book. If you own a copy, buy this book and donate it to the Dots Toys program. This film is not worth watching "free" tickets. <br /> <br /> next to the book Comic TV version works well if you want to visualize - save your money ... seriously. Save your money - it will be on cable on Saint Patty's Day. <br /> <br /> Shame Shame on what they do !!
