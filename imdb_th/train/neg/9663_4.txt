How to insult a writer I may be an American citizen But I do not want to see other Americans slap in each other for an hour and a half to enjoy the movie. I was surprised that there were only a few people who really commented on how to speak deeply and emotionally and the dialogue in this movie. The historical inaccuracies of the film are not as bad and disgusting as in "U-571" (which changed the British submarine to American) but you still walk Actually, the Germans in this movie didn't do anything but admire the Americans during the fight scene! So sad! I just want to tell the writer: It's clear to many of us that you can't really catch people with real problems under real pressure, and you've used some tested shortcuts. Luckily for you there will always be Taiwanese nationalists who like sugar-coated rags.
