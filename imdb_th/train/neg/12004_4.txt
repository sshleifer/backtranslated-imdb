Reinforcing for three hours and twenty minutes "Salaam-e-Ishq" is a comedy, a joke. But superficial from India that gives us six other romantic love stories (Which at least four stories are too much in my assessment) <br /> <br /> filmed between the music video MTV and Super Bowl beer advertising. This movie is an exotic backdrop in the scene Exotic, spectacular colors, sexy sexy actors Dream sequence numbers and imaginations, helping the flashing characters, repetitive conversations, and overly funny performances - every issue that comes out is very common when talking about Bollywood that happens today. It is a tiring job, just trying to keep all the characters straight as they dance, chant, and walk through the story that is difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of viewers who will celebrate their eyes Here - not at all. The beautiful young women all have to fall down - but he needs Job's patience to get him through.
