There is nothing to redeem this movie for sure. They took an unbelievable story to catch the wrong, writing it wrong. It's wrong. It has bad conversations in winding and ridiculous stories. <br /> <br /> Not as good as it failed as art. Who will be the target market for this matter? What age group What interest groups <br /> <br /> People should make movies about how and why they created this movie. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of bad movies and this rank comes from "Sailor Who Fell from Grace" and "Manos" ... my choice as Worst Movies i've seen Everyone involved should be forced to chat with VanDamme forever I can't think of one way
