This film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the forest. A friend caught a horrible flesh-eating virus. Suddenly, friends face each other with great efforts to prevent the disease itself. <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is a horror movie. For one, it tries to be many types at once. Should it be a show of respect, slasher, black comedy, or a horrible movie with unintentional comedy? No one can tell There are serious scenes at first and the second turns into a joke. When the movie tries to be funny, humor is quite polite, except the ending. I like a lot of endings. <br /> <br /> But besides the ending, I'm quite disappointed and tired. Violence is worth watching out of the screen rather than being afraid. The tone changes in each scene, funny, sometimes scary and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see a woman who is doing karate in a slow motion. What should we get from that? This same woman will bite one of the characters. Is that supposed to be a joke? <br /> <br /> <br /> Some performances are good and many people are quite skilled. I don't care about most characters. I like the plot But the execution was horrible As a horror movie, I don't know what it is. I didn't find it funny, stressful or scary. In the end, you don't think that "What have I just passed?" Unfortunately, you will never know the answer to that question.
