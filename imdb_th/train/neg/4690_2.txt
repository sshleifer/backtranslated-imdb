This British film is really scary and it's hard to believe that Glenn Ford is there, even though he is sleepwalking along the way. The idea of ​​bombing on a train sounds good ... but it turns out that this train ended up being parked with most movies! No movement, no movement, just a stationary train. The train parking area was evacuated, so it was not as if there was any danger to everyone. In fact, this film can be used in film classes to show ways to not make movies that are suspicious. The real suspicion arose from letting the audience know what the characters couldn't do. Spoiler: Actually, the train had two bombs. But we believe that there is only one After the first explosion was resolved, it felt as though there was no reason to watch the movie anymore. But at the last minute, the villain without clear motivation for his actions reveals that there are two things. We are not sure when the bomb will be closed, so we do not even have the traditional "ticking" tension 10 minutes or more. Take a look at Glennford's French wife who thinks of leaving him and Wondering where he is She is an annoying character that we don't care about whether she will reconcile with him or not, so when she does nothing about it, most of the other characters are quite personality and don't have any problems or problems. Only 72 minutes, but gives a long feeling because of being bored and boring. Don't waste time.
