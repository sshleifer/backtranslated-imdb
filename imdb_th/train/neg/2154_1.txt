I confess, I found this video used and bought because Guttenberg looked sexy in his underwear on the jacket. But inside is another matter In addition to the fact that this movie is a parody of special effects, "Invisible Man" (a highly visible string and other devices like that), the script has no chance to lose. Insulting everyone who focuses on the person in the script may be homophobic or racist or both. It starts to make you feel anxious with shaky sounds, straightforward style photography of the camera and beautiful stories. However, the end is quite surprising. But by the time you go, you won't be interested. Unfortunately it may be a fairly good movie.
