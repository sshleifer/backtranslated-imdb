The idea behind this film is a good concept. Too bad it was written badly. The selection of Sidney Poitier as a representative of the FBI is a good idea and he has done a great job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, knows only one emotion in most of his films: anger The character is excellent and still shows only one possibility. But the writer made us disappointed by making her most of the female characters useless. This is not consistent with the very independent character she should be. I don't care about Alley's performance. This movie should end up about fifteen minutes faster than I did. The director milked the cow to dry before reaching the unbelievable final step. I will keep this in my collection as an example of Poitiers' performances.
