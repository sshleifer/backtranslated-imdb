I do not understand why so many people appreciate this performance. Twin Peaks is one of the most boring names I have ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Now I have seen all 1 episodes and watched. Season 2, Episode 1 Just I can't show this item anymore. <br /> <br /> 1) Where is the proper orientation for criminal investigation? <br /> <br /> In the season No.1 There is a scene in which a representative of Cooper throws a stone in a bottle. Can you guess why he did that? He just wanted to identify the murderer by making 'jokes' while talking about the supernatural abilities gained from Tibetan dreams. <br /> <br /> 2) There are too many scenes that are not needed in this performance. > <br /> For example, Season 2 starts with a 'funny' scene in which the old man silently cooperates with a cup of milk while Cooper is lying on the floor. (He took the gun to his stomach.) This old man didn't do anything. That is all. <br /> <br /> This scene is really boring and takes a long time (3 minutes, 30 seconds .... it's like hell) <br /> <br /> I will read more comic books. This item anymore
