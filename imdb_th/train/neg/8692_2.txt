I think Elisabeth Rohm even though she tried hard But not good at all I guess that's because the budget she may be the only person they will get at that price. I watched it primarily for the performances of Myron Natwick, which is a work I know very well. <br /> <br /> He is the most reliable person When he was not on the screen, what was dead This is filming in Vancouver. He gave me creeps. But rest assured that in real life he is kind and compassionate He also said that accepting this role gave him creeps. <br /> <br /> What do I see with him there? She is exciting like lint, laws and regulations. May be a very good person But no actors
