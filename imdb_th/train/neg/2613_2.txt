This sequel has unevenness, discontinuity, and travel in "Story" (if really) and trying to curse too hard to be modern (Nonsense from the age and 21st century style music characters) There are jokes about animals that have been produced too. Actors in his films are second only to children and youth Even Glenn Close (And she's usually very good) swept through this film, mocking himself as De Ville, the original and leader from Sunset Boulevard! It's a movie that doesn't look good. This is a very good example of a bad and ridiculous sequel. Even Basic Instinct 2 has an acceptable plot and show style. This thing is not. It's not good.
