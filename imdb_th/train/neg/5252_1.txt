I read reviews on the internet about this movie, such as "... more difficult then the hostel ...", "The camera never has a screen when it's really cruel ..." but none of them are true The camera has never been screened because nothing is screened. The same scene repeated hundreds of times again The woman lay on the killer table, raped a few women, the killer cut the women in pieces (you never saw this during the whole movie!) The police arrested him. Joke Killer, Jury Show more movies In Germany, we will say: "Viel LÃ¤rm um Nichts" In conclusion, it is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Certainly not recommended
