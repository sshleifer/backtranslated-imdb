According to the advice of my wife's friend and I invited another couple into this movie I'm really sorry - 4 of us hate and spend all the time watching our watches waiting for the movie to end. Half of the short articles are strange, with very little entertainment value. There are some scenes in Paris - for example, I am looking forward to seeing some pictures of the Latin Quarter, but I can't remember anything. Most scenes are in the bar. No one in the theater laughs or reacts in any way. If you like strange movies, pretend to be intellectual, don't miss this thing. If you come down to earth like me, you will regret that you saw it.
