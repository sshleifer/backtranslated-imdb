Really horror movies ?? I don't want to believe how bad this movie is. What is the point of this movie ?? The movie is almost 1 hour and 30 minutes and its first 70 minutes is just Lena walking around with this stupid face after she had an accident .... Not much to say, even all the actions .. I Must say that the department stores 20 minuets. Finally, there is a little action .. and still stupid ....... and finally, oh my God, I don't know where to start where it ends with this Look stupid on Lena Feng's face The other .. do not get me wrong, I love Lena Headey I think she's a wonderful actress. But I don't know what is in you to do this movie .. don't waste time and watch It's because this movie has no stories, no shows .. and no issues ... Don't have to mention how slow this movie is and feel like you've watched it forever.
