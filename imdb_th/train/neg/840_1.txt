I agree with the last reviewer. This is probably the worst movie ever created. I have to move forward quickly through most movies. Michael Madsen must do this movie as a gift to someone. There will be a little grain throughout and a little plot is stupid. I give this movie 1 in 10 if I give a lower score. I won't waste time on the movie. This, or you'll be sorry
