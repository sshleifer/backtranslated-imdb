Robert DeNiro is one of the smartest illiterates of all time. This film has a very wasteful ability. It's truly disgusting. Unbelievable script Unbelievable dialog box Jane Fonda's character is a parody of himself, not a joke. The movie moves in the rhythm of the snail, taking pictures in an inappropriate manner and cannot be taught. It also plugs in all the bored words in the Swoozie Kurtz book, which is excellent in supporting roles. But then <br /> <br /> equally annoying is this new IMDB rule that requires ten lines for every chapter When this film is worthless, it doesn't need to have ten lines of text so that other readers know it's a waste of time and tape. Avoid this film
