I found that it was a real job to watch this movie. Audio tracks are not the best and some accents make it difficult to understand what is said. There is a small plot shift and often the action stops and there is a long conversation that doesn't seem to be related to the movie. These conversations switch between family groups and discarded observers. Try to do together in the general thread that connects them together. It's hard for me to rate this movie low and do it in this case because the whole viewing experience makes me think. "How?" And "Why am I wasting my time watching this?"
