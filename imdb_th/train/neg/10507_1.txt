OK, my friend and I rented this thing a few days ago because we like to follow the movie b because we do it ourselves. However, the cover has blood and a strange looking girl with fangs and objects ... and Tom Savini! There is no way that this movie will fail! right? incorrect!! It looks like it's garbage! There is no real story. The conversation is terrible. (Does anyone have x 1,000 !!!) The character .. well, they don't have any personality ... The effect is terrible .. The long art image of people who are scared of running around. Without doing anything .. by looking closely and things We are sitting watching movies, both waiting for something ... nothing happens ... but not ... "Oh, this big tree! Great! Oh .. they're kissing ... again ... and now for violence! OK ... nothing actually happens ... again ... Oh, now they run around ... and close eyes ... again ... Oh her, Tom Savini! Oh ... He's dead ... Yes ... Okay. Maybe now something interesting or interesting will happen .. No .. Oh! Great to be cut! The ending ... Oh shit .. "And finally because I'm full of myself .. I'll tell you this! Give me a van with six actors, a strange looking house, Tom Savini, two naked girls with fangs and a blood tank, and I can create the coolest movie you've ever seen ... I made a movie with a budget center. In two days with better effects, better performances and better chapters ... What is Johannes' man doing ?? Creating cool movies is easy. It's great ... I'm really sorry !!
