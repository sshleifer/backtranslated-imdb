I would like to believe in this movie after having the only comedy movie that this country recognizes as a slap and a pattern. <br /> <br /> Of course it is the perfect way. On the other side there is a little performance. I bet that One Small Seed goes crazy like this. I know that SL has been done. <br /> <br /> There are no main characters with funny jokes to pull out. Even Danny K still has a better rhythm. Actually I am a serious person. Every time they introduce a little character that I think "Darn, this person should be the leader!" <br /> <br /> Free does not mean that the camera must work horribly. Black and white didn't do anything for this movie - in fact, with simple conversations, it hurts even more by bringing boredom back to alleviate sharpness. Black and white is not clear. The composition is very scary. The use of music is awesome. When I watch Little Miss Sunshine after this film and the wonderful elements - maybe that's why the flaws in this movie stand out in my mind. <br /> <br /> I think Corne (more fun than the leader Before he said anything) was talking to this film, not David - then you will understand. I bet that people who organize Oppikoppi are discouraged. Who would have thought that nothing happened there? I felt that it might have been filmed in someone's backyard. I know the general guy who has a fun and witty dialogue than these "cartoons". The friends they stick to the end are ok, but <br /> <br /> Guess SA comedians will be in the Stone Age again. next They work well.
