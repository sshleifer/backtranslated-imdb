Okay, as everyone points out that this movie is a complete dog. To a certain extent, this is because it is a movie full of blood. sexploitation Excerpted content (Or darkened down to near invisibility) to escape the rating of the X-Checker; But this film has many other shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Start with the screenwriter, there seems to be werewolves and his vampires mingled with baddies in this furry movie and don't like money, but in Other terms, they behave like vampires. Now you can't do that with a crappy type of flick. You must adhere to the rules of the genre or the fans. Confused and frustrated by suppressing the unbelief of the wrong things. In fact, the plot (Confused and poorly presented) is something that has already been done for vampires But without any reason in the werewolf movie <br /> <br /> Secondly, the werewolf costume is a scary thing for you. Have seen before Everyone in the werewolf movie business should know that werewolf costumes and transformations are things that fans evaluate critically, but some of these werewolves are just plain stupid. <br /> <br /> There is a good bit. A few little things I quite like the score. Other people talk about Sybil Danning's nipples and ... <br /> <br /> (*** Spoiler *** If there is such a thing) <br /> <br /> I like the plan to attack the stronghold of the werewolf. There are many horror movies that rely on characters that are foolish. But in this case, they get an arsenal of powerful and powerful werewolves and kill monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver bullets and we have some powerful firearms today. Shouldn't be too difficult to gather two and two. But in general, this film has superiority and adds other funny and funny weapons.
