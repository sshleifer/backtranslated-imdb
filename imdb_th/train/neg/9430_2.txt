I was also packaged as well. I fell in love with blood-filled packaging and a DVD box that claimed "sad fans, because every edition was pulled out of the shelf" even though it was not expensive ($ 6.99) but not worth it. Really - there is no fear and limited blood. The ending is wonderful and does not send fleas as they should. I didn't even know that it became How much "nasty video" with tame The story is a character that is clearly an amateur actor ... It doesn't go as promised. DVD bonus feature ("The interview") is very strange because the director appears inconsistent and not all. The lead actor spoke like she appeared in Shakespeare's production. It's a great laugh.
