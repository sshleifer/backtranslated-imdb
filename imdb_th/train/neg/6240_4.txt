A hint that I think may be collected from various comments on this topic. <br /> <br /> I'm very surprised by the number of people who like this movie that wants to make it "compulsory" or "compulsory. "<br /> <br /> I think this gives us a little deeper understanding of the reasons for this film and the fundamental problems that cause polarization. <br /> <br /> Global issues Hot, attracting many people to the In order to force others to "do it right". It attracts the attention of people who are leaning more "free" because they do not have to do anything with morals in the bedroom, which is often conservative things that want to force you to "go" br /> <br /> And that's a movie problem Al Gore is a politician. And was very successful at that time He can't help himself to attract people who want to force others to do what he wants. The political appeal is too great. <br /> <br /> And we have a scientific issue that may be extremely important, a political issue that appeals to those in the political body. "Do it right." <br /> <br /> Another interesting question is how can environmental movements get those people hijacked?
