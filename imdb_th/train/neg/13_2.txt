Weak story, predictable violence, semi-interesting characters only Like a writer (Still one of the stars?) Is writing his screw story and adding incredible fantasies of drugs and murder to "hot" from predictable rap music and the soundhouse until Family conflict, it acts badly, stereotypical and boring. Even the name that had been done before - IMDb shows five movies of the same name in the year 2007-2008. <br /> <br /> Note: See in Showtime, which shows a summary of one movie Halfway through before I realized that no one was a uniform police officer. Even other things will make it interesting if it happens.
