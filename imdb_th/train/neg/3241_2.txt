This movie has potential. But what really makes it worse is the performance of Lindsay Crouse. I have never seen her before in other matters and may have other Crouse fans who like her in other ways. But her performance in this movie is not good. <br /> <br /> Her submission is a robot. When she sent her chapter, it seemed like she was trying to make sure she had the correct line and was just reading the item in her head. So her voice changed slightly. I can't believe that there are people who are not good at acting. She must know someone in this story. <br /> <br /> Now I hate to talk about you. Br /> <br /> However, I like the place where the story is going, so I watch next The first part of the script has a good movie creation. But ultimately disappointing as well Maybe if your performance improves, I will like it.
