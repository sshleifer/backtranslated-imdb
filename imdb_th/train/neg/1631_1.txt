Please laugh me if you will be one minute while I read you behind the box. ALLEY CAT VHS It says: <br /> <br /> In this part of the city, every road is the end of life - every corner. There is nothing to buy - every way alley, another way to die - to survive, you must be the best - just like Alley Cat Alley Cat- This woman owns the night. On the road where even the hunter became a victim, she knew how to survive - skip her and you, unfortunately, Alley Cat - this animal woke up. <br /> <br /> Now that's not a curse. The most pathetic you have heard in your life, right? Anyone who writes that will lose consciousness if they think that such horrible explanations might tempt us to watch the video. Unfortunately, any faceless person responsible for the use of English in tragedy is working too well .. The movies in the small plastic boxes are terrible as they listen and some people <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Karin Mani plays as a character and in general, the script will tell you in every scene given a) Pout like a goldfish b) Kick the bottom of the man or c) Show the features of her woman No complaints about the latter But in terms of the other two .. suppose that she is not an actor and is less confident as a martial arts expert But even Meryl Streep and Cynthia Rock's body (a scary thought) cannot record this movie. The plot is too boring to believe, as we receive an improper fight sequence after that. Only the court temporarily shenanigans and the love scene that is gagged by Robert Torti's scene is interesting. The camera runs along the path of Similar shame with too many short-term errors and unnecessary continuity. <br /> <br /> Where is the part that I think is the sum of this movie? Our heroine was sexually assaulted and found herself as a witness before a corrupt judge while the rapist of her rich child looked at her from the box. He not only freed him from nonsense, despite the overwhelming evidence of him. But she was imprisoned because of the courage to protest the verdict in front of his honor. Behind the bars, she had a lesbian bath, a cat and a volleyball game full of sweat before being released to bail for the fight. This ten minute section does not involve the rest of the movie and the screenplay will stop to include. I can only imagine that the producers want to add a little more T&A and come with a sub-plan that is not necessary to achieve that goal. <br /> <br /> What kind of questions are Is this a movie that is useful or serious? It's not my response to that thing .. It's not too lazy or camping enough to attract fans of Troma-style cinemas. And of course, it doesn't make the score a survey of a woman's fight against the system. .. purely because It's horrible. So who in this world would want to see it? Lunatics, I guess .. or IMDb inspectors who stay until 3 pm and see the old junk in the box while trying to go to bed. Sadly, I occasionally failed and the horrors would stay with me for a while. Don't make the same mistakes as I do. Have hot milk or something .. 1/10
