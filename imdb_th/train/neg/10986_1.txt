When I saw that Mary Louis Parker was involved in this epic film change, I was amazed. As a book fan, I think she will play as Tony Ross or Charis. But more than that, I was amazed to see how they would change this novel. Movies that are accessible for those who do not read novels and at least satisfying for those who have This book is a complex reflection of the society of women and modern life, and I am interested in seeing how they use three stories that lead to the story unfolding in the movie. What they actually do is crime. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem and confusion is: Why Oxygen, the network that advertises for women, uses books that are amazing about complex women. Scary. And scary Is and can be and transforms the protagonist from 3 women into a stupid former police who has no real motivation to participate in this story? It seems that anyone who modifies it uses a simple method using this person to ask Roz, Tony and Charis about the way they know Zenia. And in doing so, they rush through a lot of books. In doing this, though, they will make the story messy and cut off all the wonderful things about that character in addition to creating it. In this film, women are not people. But as a character, <br /> <br /> In the book Zenia mimics her death. But this book discusses this point, while the movie is losing 30-45 minutes, focusing on the former police, running around and not doing anything. They tried to make this complex book an episode of Law and Order or CSI. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Mary Louise Parker played Zenia, which is very unusual. Zenia is Catherine Zeta-Jones, Angelina Jolie, or it may be a genre. Scarlett Johnasson She is a man, a woman who cannot love and women that women are interested in and threatened, but in a way "makes your enemies close" and when you approach her, it seems to be genuine and completely reliable even if Cut off The generous than ever She is a type of woman who, despite losing her, wins: she's always beautiful, still rich, and there are always people who don't know her game. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Zenia didn't take it. Charis's men (golden Dodgers, blondes that use Charis before) but instead use August and try to become her legal guardian. (And seems to be returning to her lesbian lover Kissing at the coffee shop) and Zenia killed the chicken before leaving in August. But it has no meaning since all the structures that have been eradicated As if anyone who wrote the screenplay was holding a straw to satisfy us who read the book But I think that if I didn't read the book, I would spend the whole movie confused. If I care to stick to it all, <br /> <br /> Roz's husband died before Zenia came into the picture. (Which is strange because Zenia brought Roz's business and home life into the book, which is why Roz hates her so much) and she and Zia have conspired to kill Roz's husband many years ago And from the movie Tony and West all together forever ... even at the party at Zenia and West (in the book) painted black, and they made Tony look like this too (And evil) people who are always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popularity Tony's character is very wrong in this movie ... She seems to be a little psychopath and like the mastermind behind the conspiracy to go down, which is different from the inertial teacher. In general, this film is a smart, wicked woman, a beautiful woman, a demon, a powerful woman, an evil woman and a woman who teaches yoga, all of whom are rockers. <br /> <br /> They try Make it true so Zenia doesn't have to be Scary while she was in the book and eventually the three women convince the former police (Of course, in this research process, meet with Zenia and have a relationship with her, which should end up moving. To Barbados or something ridiculous, of course, that Zenia bails on) to hide the body of Zenia (where they find stains at the hotel she is staying in But this film shows that one in three women pushed her to the balcony to do it ...) Then Zenia took all of Roz's money. At the end of the movie, I only paid half the attention. During the ad b / c, it circled in the area far away from what it could and should have been. <br /> <br /> If you are not confused with this Film erosion. Maybe you want it because I have read books and watch movies and from movies alone. I'm ridiculously confused. It's terrible. I have been making movies from that book quite a job. But if you do a mission, you should start by determining what is not necessary in this book, instead of creating useless characters into our Alice in a magical land. <br /> <br /> There are no books. Is it ridiculous that oxygen can create a good television movie at least half the story?
