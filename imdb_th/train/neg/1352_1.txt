Eytan Fox, while generally leaning on the apology of politics, Israel has created many interesting films in the past, such as "Walk on Water" and the only great movie "Yossi & Jagger". However, in "The Bubble" he uses This unreasonable and unjust to the utmost. <br /> <br /> Far from making this film a shout. I went quietly, smoke with anger in one laughing film, which means self-preservation as a racist class and racist intimidation. (And terrorism) which exploded the righteous anger Which implies that the Arabs were evil Israelites, doing so by anger towards the unilateral Israeli invasion of them, and therefore they should not be responsible for their actions. <Br / > <br This movie is not worth the money I paid for the ticket (actually I thought to claim a refund) and basically was a popular Israeli party. Information in the Palestinian film "Paradise Now" against Israel if you want, you should see this movie because it shows a belief system. The fact that this film was created by Israeli director and Israeli director who has such a talent, even worse is the crying shame. Of course, Israel would be surprised how it was regarded as the state of the perpetrator when Israel made anti-Israel propaganda. Begging to believe <br /> <br /> It's a small movie.
