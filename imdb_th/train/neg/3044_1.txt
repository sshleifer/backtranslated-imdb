This is a strange movie where Santa Claus lives on clouds in space and fights against Satan and his minions ... but it's still fun All will be intended, it is certainly debatable. This movie is not good. But I can say that I enjoy watching it. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie. "Santa Claus conquers the Martians", "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow or "The Santa Clause" with Tim Allen.
