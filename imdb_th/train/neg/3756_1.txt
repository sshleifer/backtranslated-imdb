It's a really bad movie. My friend rented it because he was an idiot. But then again, I must be an idiot as well because I watched all the cursed things! The actors are similar to the high school drama that they think will happen. The only place that they will go is to go back and wait for the table at Luby. All I can think of while I watch this "jewel" is what it actually does. I mean "script writer". Some people think that the place This place is fresh and profitable. Then some people with money believed in the script so much that he decided to split the cash with the innocent misunderstanding that he was going to return. The actors were chosen to be ridiculed by the make-up artists, hired computer animation cartoons from the graphic design school Al Collins to be brought in and this chaos began to form. What I hate about this movement But one thing that makes me the most crazy is music too. Every minute of this flick gets points. No break music And sometimes it mixes more than conversation, not that it makes you miss important points or anything. <br /> <br /> After it ends It's like driving a VW diesel in 1980. Then switch to the BMW 740il. You can't get two opposite movies in terms of quality.
