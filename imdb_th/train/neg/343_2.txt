The truly terrifying German-German co-producer Rosanna Arquette plays as an actor whose teenage daughter defines the term "child problem" - a few uears before "acting". Children kill her father and mother. Fall to the offspring Now she moved to the northwest of the United States to start a new one. But her children still have problems in the matter that she is devoted to her mother So she kills everyone who may be seen as a threat to her bond. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mandy Schaffer (As a daughter) Killing more people than people - She gives terrible performances as well. This film, although the continuation of the script, has no direction and scary music. (Examining the saxophone for the first time that she performed bikinis wearing her bikini) didn't help anything. We should find her sexy and scary. But she failed both counts Almost unreliable and not bad enough to be amused (Not to mention the fact that Arquette and Schaffer didn't believe as a mother and daughter), expressing condolences for Miss Arquette and Jane Keren. This and both people (Especially Rosanna) is the only reason for everyone to join this Fargo event. <br /> <br /> One of the film production companies, Quality International Films, is not a three-hour love.
