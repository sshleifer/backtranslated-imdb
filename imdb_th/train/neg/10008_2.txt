This movie is not good. There is no other way to speak. The story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I don't think most people know what "walker" is, or really care about it. I feel as though watching movies from the 70s. This story is unbelievable for 2007, even in DC. I think this sound is really loud for everyone who looks at it too, because the applause is low and fast at the end. Most are not on the question and answer as well. <br /> <br /> I don't think Schrader thinks this movie will go out. Many scenes seem to be cut short as if they were not finished or he didn't know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to another and you had to try and figure out or guess what happened. I do not have a personal life or a fan. Woody (Carter) as well. What are male slavery and torture images? (From the Iraqi prison) What about? What is he thinking I think it's a bad effort for him to try to create a dark, sub-cultural life for the characters of Woody (Car). It doesn't work. It doesn't seem reasonable. The only good thing about this movie is Woody Harrelson. He plays his character (car) flawlessly. You get a wonderful feeling of what "Walker" might be like. (Speaking twenty years ago) He is a great person and is most likely not to be accepted by it. <br /> <br /> For Lauren Lily and Christine ... Boring <br /> <br /> Don't see! It's painful! Unless you're a Harrelson fan
