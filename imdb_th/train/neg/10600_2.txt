I will be honest The only reason I watched this program on TV is in the top 100 of IMDb. And now I'm wondering if my half-life is worthwhile to "check" again in the same list?> <br /> Van Damme Is Luc Deveraux who finds himself fighting hard with Universal Soldiers after the main computer pulls 'HAL' to protect himself. And yes, after the explosion occurred, shooting and chasing him was the last person standing When combined with terrible performances and boring settings, make sure that it's on the shameful list, just <br /> <br /> For the crazy people like me who want to see all the programs. 2 / 10
