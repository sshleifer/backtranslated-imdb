DR SEUSS 'CHRISTMAS GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS / (2000) ** (from four stories) <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal seasons and create original legends Of Dr. Seuss doesn't see "Dr. Seuss' how Grinch stole Christmas." If you are old enough to read this review, you may be too old to enjoy the movie. It has many colors, creative design and imaginative costumes, and the creation of costumes, loud sounds, and the characters were created to look like the native people of Whoville Village. Unfortunately, the positive elements of the movie ended. The rest of the production is not just an excuse for Jim Carrey to figure out on the screen while giving an evil smile while performing through a very wide screenplay and nothing to do. <br /> <br / > Many people know this The Grinch stole Christmas from Whoville, so I won't waste time writing a detailed summary for you to read. However, I would say that the story of the movie was executed in three main actions. The development of the Grinch and the Whoville festival setting and the vision of Dr. Seuss of people who steal the average of their Christmas There are many familiar names within the credit here. But no familiar faces Just like in "Battlefield Earth", I don't see why manufacturers will hire expensive actors just to protect their identity with cosmetics and costumes that no one can remember. Regardless of SNL's Molly Shannon as Betty Lou, Bill Irwin's wife after playing Lulu, Cindy Lou's father, played by Taylor Momsen, Jeffrey Tambor is Mayor Whoville, Anthony Hopkins lends his voice for the film's narrator and Christine Baranski is Grinch's only lost lover. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers try to bring the initiative to the story by adding a subplot. Not needed And focus on the little Cindy Lou. Screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, it just felt that it was everywhere in the movie landscape. There is little if director Ron Howard gives any importance and the screenplay can be predicted too widely and is planned. The only character that gives any difference here is the Grinch. All other characters are puppets of the plot. And the dialogue is beyond the truth and is too repetitive to be anything but a pathetic example - Grinch: Oh, the courage of mankind! <br /> <br /> The film's redemption factor came out to the designer of the production, Michael Coren Blith, Rita Ryack's costume designer and the extensive makeup department. "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a very good production. The scenes and atmosphere that the filmmakers created were detailed and imaginative. It is like the audience is visiting the dream world. People in Whoville are plastered with makeup to the point that we can't tell the actors to recite a humorous chapter. Even though it is sparkling But I was unable to give credit to the show because they were considered because of the expensive technical department being replaced. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey is an actor that I can say. His performance is almost destroying his own movie. He is too selfish as Grinch. Exaggerated and too funny to make the story as close to what is known as Seuss's work. Surprisingly, Even though there were a few funny moments because of the clever scenes But without laughter from Jim Carrie's madness It's almost like a movie written specifically for Carry to overcome his part. This factor makes this movie a joke. But ridiculous, which is just a pale shadow of the traditional classic Christmas "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" <br /> <br /> After this film, historians should check the coffin of The author of the late Dr. Seuss may roll in his grave. <br /> <br />
