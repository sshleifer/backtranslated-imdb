Slaughter, the story of a high revenge by a fool who is the victim of the coolest and coolest jokes in movie history. Unfortunately after the contract opened, flicked straight to hell. Boring and repetitive clutter with moderate tapping and the last half hour that absorbs to a whole new level of absorption The man who played the fool was actually killed himself shortly after the flick was released. If you want to rent, flick, stop it after prank and remember to choose life.
