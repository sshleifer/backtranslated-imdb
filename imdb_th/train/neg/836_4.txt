One fan dedicated to the TLK movie, the first is a major event and the second is probably the best sequel that Disney has created with this movie ... Now I don't argue with Animation Do not exceed the Timon / Pumbaa thread in the TLK atmosphere, although it is not bad. But didn't add anything Essentially, this movie is a great joke ... and that's all about recording. Create a real TLK3 of Disney! That potential is there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
