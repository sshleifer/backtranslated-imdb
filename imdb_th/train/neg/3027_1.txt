If the smell is like garbage and if it seems that garbage must be garbage This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen all my life. Tony Scott's bad governance style caused shame for the unattractive and untrue story of Domino Harvey's life as a bounty hunter. The story is not continuous, complete and confusing to watch. Some aspects of the plot are ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It seems that every action scene is tangled tightly with poor points and terrifying performances. Although Keira Knightley is completely naked in this game. That was the only one that turned upside down in this film. If you want to see her naked, just forward the movie quickly until about an hour and a half in it and you'll catch a lot of nipples. I highly recommend that no one sees this movie! </ 3
