Of course, I like short cartoons, but I don't like this game. By nature, children will love it, but again I am no longer a child. (Although I still think of myself as a child) <br /> <br /> I won't tell you anything about this because of the simple reason that doesn't matter. How is this comic dragon nominated for an Oscar ?! Hmm ... I guess it's because people in the 30s are happier now. In the present time we live, everything must happen quickly. Watch movies today and you'll get the same conclusion: We live in a society that doesn't allow men to do slowly. That is really a shame. I hope I live in the 30s because it seems calm. But every time there are ups and downs, I guess ... <br /> <br /> To conclude: If you like music (and frogs), you have to see this cartoon. Otherwise, don't make your time with it.
