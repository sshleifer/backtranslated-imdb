It is almost impossible to understand for me that this movie will be true. But I was certainly disappointed. After being a connoisseur of the Pekinpah cinema for many years, I found that this DVD has fallen considerably for sale and thinks it's worth it to shoot. Opening a few credits, which is a symbol for Pekinpah fans, has been cut between humans and animals. But here we have noisy ambient noise, which does not cause children to play in the school while there is a bomb. Then, when perps, Caan and Duval travel to their next mission, Duval sets a bomb at Cann, saying that the day he returned, there was an STD by spying through her bag while Cann was close to her. The following laughs were excellent and showed clear respect for Brian Depalma's Brian K "to Kill", with the short-term cost of Angle Dickenson. The Killer Elite's problem was that after opening the movie credits, it would Flat, even Alfredo Garcia's leader, Meir, has a higher production value, a brave claim for anyone who knows what I'm talking about. I use Pekinpah's credit as supplementary lecture documents. But when finished, close The Killer Elite
