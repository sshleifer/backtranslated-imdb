This flick is a blow to me. I guess the little girl desires to be something more than a model of a swimsuit, a home builder or a beloved, since that seems to be something they will be painting as well It is very sad to see the work and life of the artist misinterpret. Incredible (Or it may be possible to expect) all the characters of Artemisia and everything she has stood for has been transformed into a standard female Hollywood character; A pathetic and selfless little creature is unable to show the character that has made her a place in history that is being destroyed here. It is also sad to see that most audiences receive bad education in the area to understand the incredible gap between the message in the film and reality. To show that the artist is a person who loves rape in her real life, someone she is accused of raping her in reality, even when tortured, just makes me angry If the director has nothing more important to say that she should refrain from telling her story to a real person
