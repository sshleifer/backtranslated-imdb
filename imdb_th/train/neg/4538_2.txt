Actually, I went to see this movie in the cinema. But it wastes money and time! The performance is not good. I'm sorry to say that it doesn't help to enjoy a rather tough screenplay. <br /> <br /> Some friends told me to watch this movie since James Redfield, who had written this book. are Very involved in the screenplay. They are really happy with this book, so the movie must be perfect. Maybe I have a little higher hope. But I absolutely hate this movie! It is something that is predictable, too sweet, to the point that I have gone away. I have to vomit and the worst is that there will be a sequel! Make the world a favorite and stop this nasty crusade.
