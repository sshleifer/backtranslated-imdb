I don't like this movie very much. It wasn't really funny and in some cases it was downright stupid. Rob Schneider was an extremely talented person indeed, and while his performance was good in this regard, it seems like a real waste for him to show in me. Means there are some that are okay About it. The only thing that really attracted my attention during all the tests of the top jokes is that there are women that look very good and I'm not the only one who can watch movies alone because of that, but in this case In the case of the least redemption case Overall, it is a pair of notches below the average of the movie. <br /> <br /> Last question: <br /> <br /> Cinema: Very glad that I didn't spend too much money on this matter. < br /> <br /> Buy a DVD: Umm, let me think .... No! <br /> <br /> Rent: If you have a sense of humor before history, why?
