I stopped in five minutes when Beowulf received two automatic crossbow shots with crossbows scenery, not only with outstanding sights, but Beowulf also conquered Grendel in his hand-to-hand combat. Eternal wooden performances and darkness that makes Sci-Fi original movies do not help anything. Only a few minutes before I felt better and decided to watch. I love Lucy, running again instead. That's all I have to say. But you may realize that it's a movie created for the TV and crossing it there. <br /> <br /> Imitation
