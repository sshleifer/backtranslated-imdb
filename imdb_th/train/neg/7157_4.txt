1st See 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): A strange story about a druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting the body of her niece. At least I thought that was a relationship. Creepy quality is held throughout this film, unlike Stephen King's Shining. The difference is that there is a camp in Nicholson's performance that is not in this movie. All of this was very serious until near the end when there was one lame person and trying to make the mood worse. The show is not a problem here. But it's a story It seems that everything will not come together smoothly and the audience still has a lot of information and there is no real understanding of what happened in the movie. There was a small performance by Christopher Walken as the granddaughter's uncle, which certainly made him have high sales in trying to sell this movie. Don't buy in this mechanism and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
