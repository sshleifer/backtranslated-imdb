- When the local sheriff was killed, his wife came to look after and clean the city. However, not everyone in the city is happy with what she does. When the sheriff ordered a curfew in the city, the local saloon owner (Including a woman) hired a killer to take care of the sheriff There is no way that the car owner knows that the sheriff and the murderer will fall in love. <br /> <br /> - Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have an interesting idea. There are good movies here, somewhere trying to go out. In a more capable hand or with a larger budget, Gunslinger may enjoy the role of women in the Old West as it is. Gunslinger is a mess of movies. <br /> <br /> - There are many things wrong. With movies: supporting actors without the ability to express vulgar and unnatural conversations like sets, but the biggest offender is editing I was surprised that there were times when the scene began with the actors. (And the horse for that matter) waited for Corman to shout "Action" clearly. The best thing was the scene of two riders on horseback standing next to the building. Suddenly they went out to race around the corner like they were riding hard for many miles. Or use examples of people who seem to be able to transport themselves across the city We saw a man coming into the building and a few seconds came out across the city to ride a horse. <br /> <br /> - Not that Corman didn't have a good actor to work with. While there are no stars, Beverly Garland, John Ireland and Allison Hayes all can perform well, but in Gunslinger, they don't have much work. <br /> <br / > - Now I have seen both MST3K movies and not MST3K. I suggest going to the MST3K route.
