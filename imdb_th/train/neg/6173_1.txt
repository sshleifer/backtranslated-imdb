This film is an obvious attempt from the left wing in Hollywood to demonstrate Reagan's administration as incompetent There may be some errors occurring during the crisis. But I'm not sure if there will be no presentation in this movie My first reaction to this film was to be directed by Oliver Stone, but I was wrong now. Obviously there are many others.
