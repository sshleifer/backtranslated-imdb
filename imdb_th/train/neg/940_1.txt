Okay, we know why we watch movies like "The Invisible Maniac" (just looking at the cover of men!) T and A all over (there are more T's) but ... shouldn't have anything to go with /> <br /> "C'mon" I heard you say - "This is just a naked woman! ?! "<br /> <br /> If this was called" The NAKED Maniacs ", I wouldn't have a problem. But because these people were undressed from "Invisible men", so they have to have a little story about here. Do you know to keep your mind busy? <br /> <br /> However, what they can do is The mad doctor created an invisible serum and when he cracked it, used it to spy on a naked woman and ended up killing a lot of teenagers. And when you see a teenager who looks drunk, he will follow you. Thank you. <br /> <br /> One star for T and A, but there are fans who eat you too much. With care <br /> <br /> TIDBIT - yes, that's Savannah
