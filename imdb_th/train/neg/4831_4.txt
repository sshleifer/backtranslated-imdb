I rented this movie on Netflix after receiving all the Oscars to see if it's really good or not. <br /> <br /> Hurt Locker is a very realistic picture (mostly) of a rotating military group in Iraq. This film is centered around Will James, a careless soldier who has been corrected by the risk of explosions and bombs. <br /> <br /> Where this movie seems to be lacking in my opinion this This film has a story that is not as clear as other movies, such as Black Hawk Down. What this film tries to do is focus on their characters and their different attitudes about the war. Bigelow is very focused on the character. But there are many points in the movie that the dialogue seems to drag. Hurt Locker has a length of 131 minutes, but it feels like a 3-hour movie. <br /> <br /> One scene in a particularly scary movie and destroy the credibility of The perfect movie is a scene cut through halfway. It's unrealistic and very long. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this movie is ok. But the reason I gave it is 6 instead of 7 because it's important for winning the Best Picture at the Oscars. I felt that this movie would be better if considering Saving Private Ryan, losing Best Picture but much better than this movie. Another notable issue is Black Hawk Down, which has won only 2 awards. I don't really know how this image is the best. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a war full of fighting, rent Black Hawk Down. This film will be forgotten in one or two years.
