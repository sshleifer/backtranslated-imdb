I watched this movie because I noticed that it had Kari Wuhrer in the show. I have a theory about you for a long time that she is a talented actor. But seems to have never proved because she is always in the low budget B movies like this She is still beautiful and she is still trying to do the unfortunate thing that I have seen you all. It is no different. This film is often ugly and annoying. But that didn't make George Wendt play with the genre, and that trembled until he was accepted for his role. More notes about Ms. Wuhrer. Her breasts seem to shrink noticeably since I last saw you. May reduce surgery or remove implants This is not a bad thing. She still looks good. I want to see you in a better movie.
