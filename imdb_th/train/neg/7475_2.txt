To be honest, I know what to expect before I watch this movie and I have to say it's the worst show I've ever seen. It has a lot of time and it's funny. It's fun. But I fear that it will not be scary and foolishness is brought to a new level. There are many unnecessary blood and plots that are everywhere. I don't know why aliens are evil and why are they coming to Wales now? (I mean, who's going to be there?) But I'm not interested in that point because I enjoy dressing and CGI is not good. Praised for filmmakers because they may know what they are doing These movies are probably longer .....
