"Fly Me To The Moon" must be the worst animated movie I've ever seen in a long time. That is to say something since I brought my son to watch all the animated films in the last 4 years. The story is generous ... repetitive. The voice acting is cruel, too cute. Humor is the variety of Romper rooms. The animation can be used with Nickolodeon cartoons, but will be released on a large screen, not cable TV. <br /> <br /> It will get 2 because it is a picture 3 Some scenes have slightly inspiring images. But we have seen much better past. I also asked about the filmmakers' insistence that let the characters fly away from the screen instead of entering the scene. While interesting at first, it was boring after the 3rd or 4th time. It seemed like I wouldn't care about the creator's part. <br /> <br /> I'll say this even though it has a soundtrack. Great track And for recording my son was not too crazy about it Bad movie
