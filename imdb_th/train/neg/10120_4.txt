This movie Hitchcock has a slight similarity to his later suspicious movies and seems to be a very old moral story. Young couples get the inheritance they believe will make them happy. They spend money traveling the world and living a very happy life. However, after a while, the excitement began to fade and both became dissipated and pointless in their existence. However, nowhere is it when they are on a luxury cruise ship that sinks and loses everything - and ultimately is happier in the end because they now appreciate life! It's a strange, ridiculous movie and preach! Personally, I want to receive all that money and see if it makes me happy. <br /> <br /> The production cost is quite poor compared to the later production. Quite skillfully acting
