There is a great movie about Steve Biko. Sadly it's not. Denzel Washington - never the most resilient of actors - can not completely convey the charm that Biko has Attenborough's huge crowd scene is ridiculous. The Soweto massacre was not like this. Three neat children. (Some people are doing the scroll wheel!) Happily walking into the military's gun. When Biko Dead dies, this movie falls into a joke quickly. If the fight against apartheid is anything, it is the battle of blacks. In any way, we should all be arrested by the escape of white people and their families. I'm sure Donald Woods is a good person and he will be the first to say that Biko is important as he can't. Penelope Wilton's accent is actually Hampshire, and she seems unaware that she is in South Africa at all. Wood's family of dogs received more stripes than black maids. While the family made them escape, a woman I saw this movie as well - by chance, one of a dozen blacks in a large theater full of whispering sounds. "This is the sound of the song" She has one point And in fact, South Africa wants a white-skinned liberal that is like the hole in the head
