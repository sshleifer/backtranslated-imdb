(In a different mood!) Both amazingly rented and watched, even if that's all you watch You will agree. I'm sure <br /> <br /> Everything about the manuscript is great. It's not necessary to create a new one. Sorry! Jason and Vanessa give admirable performances as well as Tyne and Chynna.

It is a trivial matter to find yourself comparing both mentally as you try to appreciate the remake and it is shortened without mistakes from the actors.
