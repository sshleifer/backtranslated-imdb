It's like what Dracula has always done. Dracula's movie counterparts are on the side of Dracula, which makes me disappointed at the end. Regardless of whether the person wants to be a vampire or not, I want to see something in the first movie that the boss fights with her boss. It's very interesting (Because you can guess what the story will be) more than just a priest or D. win this game (we need a surprise plan!)
