The follow-up of William Lustig's "Maniac" clearly proves that Tom Savini's incredible impact and Spinell's convincing performance "Maniac" will not become a cult "Vigilante" is a bad chapter. With a simple chapter that can spell everything for you and can be predicted in every way, including extraordinary performances by every actor Considering the feeling of "deja vu", this movie made me Lustig watch "Death Wish" too many times before doing this!
