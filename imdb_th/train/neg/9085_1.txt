One of the worst movies I've ever seen The performance is terrible both for children and adults. Most characters do not have little or no emotion. The light was terrible and there was too much about the time of the day that the film was shot. (In the river scene, they just destroyed their ship. There were 4 shots: the sheriff and father in the evening on their boat. Jillian and Molly in the pool, evenings, children left in the daytime * when it should be in the evening * at the river bank and Doctor Beatrice and Simon Ton at night The best performances in the movie may come from Sheriff Cappy (although there are characters that are slippery when the pulse detector * does not matter what happens when a person dies, it beeps * Suggests Cappy died, heard a beep, and while the nurse examined his pulse manually, more it would show the pulse again and eventually he died) I thought it would be incomplete It's an independent film. But it is still better Unbelievably unsightly, even children may see good things like The Lion King or Toy Story. If you see everything you remember
