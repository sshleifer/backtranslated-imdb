I bought this thing (it's only 3 dollars, right?) Under the name "Gray Matter". The novelty of seeing Sherriff Roscoe in the non-Dukes role of Harkard makes me intrigued. Other reviewers warned that it was a tedious tale of the government's top-secret experiment. <br /> <br /> And yes, there are a lot of pictures created, especially houses with pools in front. Some characters and interiors look ridiculous. I guess the filmmakers are worried that we might forget who they are, so they wait to tip us by showing outside the building. It's really funny after a moment. Shooting water felt like a station station logo reminds us that we are watching. "Gray matter" <br /> <br /> I still have double happiness of calling the name. At one point, an angry test made someone in charge by calling her "Scientific b * tch!". It was an insult that was not enough. Many of the subsequent scenes, different styles, are released, coughing by muttering about "science b ** tard!" It sounds strange to me. <br /> <br /> Someday this movie will disappear. Forever Ten years from now it may be impossible to find a copy of it. Almost like never happened. <br /> <br />
