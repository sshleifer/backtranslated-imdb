I don't like Sean Penn's director very much and the early works of Indian runners are no exception. This film has no essence. It is a color that has narrow-minded views against dictatorship. In the most honest manner of Penn's work, his latest work is even more than before. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, a lot. Will produce products that are fundamentally obvious in some devotion to honesty. If Hallmash branded cards develop the greeting of Hell's Angels and make me want to stay in the moment For the release of a good movie, Viggo Mortensen's performance is more convincing than the ridiculous Eastern story he had done with Cronenberg and that is about it. This film is meaningless, dead, and seems to be a series of techniques rather than a story. The glory for Charles Bronson, however, proves that he can do it. And I want Sandy Dennis's character more punch. 3 out of 10 for this Indian Runner game.
