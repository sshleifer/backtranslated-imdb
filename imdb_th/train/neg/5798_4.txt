This movie is a combination of music, romance, drama and crime together with noir movies. In general, it is one of the various types of disorganized piles that no one can work out as it should be. <br /> <br /> This movie is Mickey Rooney's attempt to Serious about becoming an actor more He is a former child actor who has starred in comedy and music with pleasure during the beginning of his career. In this film, he chose a different method. (Although the music still appears in the movie), but his role is quite ridiculous in the movie. I mean Micky Rooney as a strong player? He is a guy who looks very small. Actually, he was in the age of 30 at the time of this film. But he seemed more serious, like 16 years old. Hearing him said that it was innocent to women and hearing the fiercely talked about 3 times larger than the hooligans. He didn't look and felt right. He doesn't believe in his role. <br /> <br /> Because the film combines a lot of different genres, the story also makes a messy feeling. Some of them have crime plot and some of them are romantic plot and another story about living the life of your dreams. But there is nothing that can really be accomplished because of all the messy and manipulative methods It's not an interesting or interesting movie to watch. László Kardos is also a director who has made only 10 movies during his lifetime, despite the fact that his career will be between 1935 and 1957. Directors struggling with hard time working in the industry While getting fewer scripts to work His movies are all unknown and generally not too high quality. <br /> <br /> We don't forget that this is the movie '50's, but still feels like a movie of the 40s or more. the '30's, of course, mostly because of the fact that the film was shot in black and white In general, talking about black and white movies from the 50s often has an insulting feeling and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> It's a strange story when seeing Mickey Rooney and Louie. Armstrong and his band Together in order It's not the only film that Armstrong has appeared, and he often appears in this type of movie as often as himself. I think jazz enthusiasts will still enjoy watching this movie because of the amount of music in this film. This film received an Oscar nomination for the best original song. <br /> <br /> Little movie and outing from Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> 4/10
