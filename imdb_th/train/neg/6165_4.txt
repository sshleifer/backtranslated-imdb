Allen traveled to the country (Some places he hates to go in real life) and have a weekend with his friends, which is a type of normal success in the white middle-class locality that has in many movies. /> I often find something amusing in Woody Allen's comedies. But here he really fell on his face Even the torpedoes seemed to leave him. In fact, there is no plot. (Bar, bits and pieces of Shakespeare's lure) - Allen seems to use the place to make the semi-mysterious air that just makes things even more intelligent and half baked. Work at all levels and are just a giant drill The best thing about this movie (In addition to the end credits that are about to happen) is a bad opinion, seems to make him wake up and realize that throwing a slashdash script and throwing your friends together.
