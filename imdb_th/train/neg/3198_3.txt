In the short term, this film has a slightly weak first set, with some compulsive performances and a rather disjointed rhythm and punctuation that is the second appropriate action that can create tension and intrigue. Actors and Acts 3 ... No action 3 Any <br /> <br /> About the 3rd show, this movie ends abruptly. There is no resolution and no way down from the peak of Scene 2, so there are no scenes in which 3 very bad people die and that is; End credits There is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and supporting characters. The audience should leave the theater after the movie. Ask "Yes". Declining. <br /> <br /> The music composed by David Bell, which works enough to provide most movies. But there is nothing outstanding, of course, it works but can do this by being just ordinary and derivative In addition, it is clear that the score is a very day by using synthetic drums for some percussion. What impressed me the least about the score was the moment of tension, the music that sounded like it seemed that they were torn from James Horner from "48 HRS" and "Commando", especially brass. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film has potential because the basic story is good. But the execution is boring with moderate direction, weak performances and inconsistent rhythm. Br / <br /> There is almost no third action to finish the story and this omission is important and cannot forgive because It doesn't allow the movie to end satisfactorily. This may be a screenplay, or it may be that the producer has to cut the filming or edit the 3rd scene in the finished movie due to budget constraints (but I guess why there is no third scene) either. For whatever reason, the sudden end will make the movie overall painful. <br /> <br /> This is a good view if you are curious and you can get the movie at a cheap price as well as to study. The reason why you have 3 actions (beginning, middle, end) if you write a movie and create a movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you may not want to waste time unless you get the MST3K model. A little laughed out.
