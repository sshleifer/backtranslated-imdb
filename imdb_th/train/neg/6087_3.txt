This movie is not as boring as I expected. There are a few seconds of ingenuity in the hardcore UFO game that is quite silly. Most performances are moderate. But in general, it's a 70s style style that is full of break. Photographers and models witnessed some strange behavior in the forest and soon became victims of this same behavior. The UFO is seen by many people - but is it an alien or a top secret group of our own government? Soon, the journalist and "UFOlogist" (apparently the writer-director's character) would be pulled into the failure and become the target of a secret-secret secret agent that is horrifying and unlikely trust Then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The anticipated movie makes sense of the average conspiracy theory of UFOs. The camera works well for movies with low budget. Pacing is quite good. The script is ridiculous and ridiculous and there are continuous problems that are fun to look for. I'm talking about just a few seconds of brightness. Honestly, I can't say much to you without having to write a spoiler. When you can say that the end of this movie is at least worth it to be forwarded quickly if you can't be neutral.
