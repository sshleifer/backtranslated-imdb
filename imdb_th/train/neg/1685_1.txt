Every child between the ages of 14-16 years wants to see this movie. (Although you are only allowed to be 18 years old) they have heard that it is a very scary movie and they feel cool when watching I feel that the children are very sad that they can't see good movies and what bad movies are. This is one of the worst movies I saw in months. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie. And finally It's an open ending ... Why? Because it is impossible to think of such stupid stories This movie was created to make you scared and if you are smart and know about music, you will know when you are scared. <br /> <br /> When the film is finished and I turn to my friends and tell (A little noisy) Let him know that this is a waste of money. Today I can create an Oscar with my goldfish home video if I use proper marketing.
