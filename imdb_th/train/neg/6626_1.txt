I saw this movie and was drunk because the film was stupid and boring. I think gopal varma ram would adjust his work. Unfortunately he failed and the film was rotten. Actors and teams are not good. The whole movie theater, while watching some movies, ran away in the middle of the performance of amithab bachan. Poor. I think this movie will be very popular in the year. No one gives justice to their work, including Ajay devagan. This movie doesn't deserve the audience. I bet that this movie will fail. <br /> <br /> "Finally, this movie finally."
