Some people wonder why there is no longer a Murphy movie after this story. Will be because this film blows all the snot Disney is not the right studio to create this movie. May Bay Touchstone (Well, they are Disney owners But it would be more mature.) The film is too young because the book series can't be All casting selection is wrong for the character. The characters did not do as they did in the book. And why did Tucker change to a man He is a girl in a laughing book! Is this an action that makes the movie appeal to children? Sheesh and Pewter Where is the gray cat? One of the most funny characters in this book disappeared from the filth. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer. But letting Disney explode her work is wrong. The animated feature film, perhaps in Don Bluth's art, should be better suited to the Murphy movie. Overall, I gave this to 2 because at least Disney had created a movie from an unpopular book series. But I hope they do better Either way, I still have my books for my enjoyment.
