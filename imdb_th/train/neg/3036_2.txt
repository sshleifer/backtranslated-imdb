This movie is really scary! I can't realize how this film produced production. Nothing compared to the actors of the movie. Of course, this is the fault of the writing team. You bring the old average plot to dance, from being poor and poor, or in this case. But this one lacks the appearance of the actual plot - or at least one that anyone would be interested in. With actors who speak Canadian in what should be the American scene - this movie is rather flat In a positive light, the director is quite good and the movie is also quite good. It seems that the production budget is very good as well. The only thing I would like is this team, let alone writing and go to find a true screenwriter to help them use the word in the movie. Net effect - how do you move?
