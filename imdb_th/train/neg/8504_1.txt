Semana Santa is not good, jaw drops It's very wrong in many ways that I shouldn't start. Let's see ... Mira Sorvino, the judge's husband, was shot while protecting her from Madrid to Seville for a police position. During the Holy Week (Semana santa, see? ... Everyone starts to sleep .. Saying it is terrible at many points from the beginning). The killer killed his victim like a bull in a bullfighting field. She works with Olivier Martinez, the pig, the chauvinist and Feodor Atkine. Soon she discovers that she will be the next target of the murderer. (Who wore a red robe) Why? Oh, but why? <br /> Why ...? That is the question in my head. The whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ask: Why go see A: Because I love Mira Sorvino (I'm also sorry for you with obscenity from the first sight) <br /> <br /> Q: Why do we have only 8 people in the theater this Saturday at the end of the first week of release? A: Ah-ah-ah, the spider man came back on the same day. But it is true that this movie has horrific reviews. <br /> <br /> Q: Why does this movie happen? A: The money I guess, but the boys do. Mira wants money. <br /> <br /> Then ... Why ????????????? First of all, there is something wrong with co-production in Europe. Here you have been producing French, English, German, Italian, Spanish, Danish, yi-ha. <br /> <br /> Then it needs to be played on playgroung as well as US thrillers / slashers / whodunit / puzzles / anything. Even though Valentin, though not necessary and has unnecessary script and shots, the better is the suspense and fun. <br /> <br /> Then, to give credit to the story. Wrong: Made in a flashback for shooting images The traffic is the most interesting thing in the film. May be stuck in it, no need to watch the whole movie straight to Guillermo del Tros, better than the DEVIL'S (El espinazo del diablo) for clever fun. <br /> <br /> Then fearing the target! The first victim was S&M drug addicted gay twins who were stabbed to death. Annoying Olivier Martinez went to a dating agency organized by a heavy fat homo and a platinum wig. Calling the character of Mira Sorvino as a large barrage at all times Do we need this type of thing? Nah, just the words that are inappropriate, as well as ol'times. <br /> <br /> Then Yipee has no clear motivation. The first murder was a normal illusion, because they represent the famous paintings, but none. And the revelation of the murderers. (Of course, the horrific fascism) can be done from the beginning when he appeared at the end of this movie. I guess it's time for the director to say that The movie is crazy. Let's see who is the murderer and why he killed. "<br /> <br /> Then the director thought he was the wrong director: no doubt, no sense of directing the actor. The knowledge of the change of the giant tempo of the Holy Week is not necessary. (May be a co-production rule saying: Okay, shoot in Sevilla. But showing the credit of this beautiful and historic city by celebrating Easter, we are: a mysterious movie for tourists!) /> <br /> Then all the wrong actors Mira Sorvino pierced herself until death: she couldn't. Do nothing but be stabbed in the right hand Everything you do best (The reserve agent, the great Aphrodite ...) is like they never existed. Olivier Martinez ... Hello everyone here? When the manufacturer learns that he is not an actor But is a model that does not have the ability to speak or feel? Feodor Atkine is gentle and transparent. We only give great respect to Alida Valli, one of the greatest actors of this century. (And I hope to play an additional role in this role.) She is the main attraction here because she is the only person who gives life to her bad lines. I will not talk about other actors because they are only one character, not interesting and shallow. <br /> <br /> The inconsistent direction, inconsistent actors and non-plot. Believing Idiocy happened. <br /> <br /> Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
