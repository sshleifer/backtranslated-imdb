I saw this film in Tolkien's temporary class during the second year of college. I'm unlucky, the seat is close to the screen, and my teacher chose me to serve as a hit-boy. Everyone laughed, but they weren't in the sight. <br /> <br /> Take it out. Out of the way: Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' is owed something for Bakshi in Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring. The scene in which Black Riders attack an empty bed is almost a copy. Complete carbon of the scene Bakshi's film shot by shot. You can call this imitation or reverence based on your agenda. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that the similarities don't stop there. I will not do any research to find what they are because that will mean that I have a respect for the film. I'm sure other people have summarized the similarities - look around. <br /> <br /> This film is the perfect train wreck in every aspect of the metaphor and many people die from the accident. I decided to write a list of things that I can remember in more or less chronological events - if I didn't do anything that offended me, because I was overwhelmed and faced with many failures. Ordinary people <br /> <br /> * Due to the heavy use of rotoscoping, Gandalf is no longer a gentle and wise wizard. But the blasphemous blasphemer) <br /> <br /> * Sometimes Saruman the White is sometimes called 'Aruman' during the movie without explanation. He wore purple and red for some mysterious reason. <br /> <br /> * Sam looks ugly. The depiction of his friendship with Frodo was innocent and unpleasant. Yes, the hobbit is as small as a child. But not children. <br /> <br /> * Never recommend Merry and Pippin - they will appear during the scene change with one sentence. This movie is full of sloppy changes like this. <br /> <br /> * Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry sing cheerfully as they cross the road. One of the hobbits produced at least twice the harp from his back, which had never been seen before, and began to walk in a typical fantasy fashion poet when they broke into "la-la-la". br /> <br /> * Aragorn is clearly a Native American in a fantasy fantasy costume. (Without pants) with a large pilgrimage buckle He is the worst swordsman in this movie. Often he is thrown at the shaking before being banned on his ass. <br /> <br /> * Black horse riders seem more leper than threatening tools. evil They walked everywhere in a painful slow speed. This creates confusion. <br /> <br /> * The scene before Black Riders tried to cross the Ford of Bruinen (which they stared at Frodo, which is on the other side of the horse) continues forever during the time the driver Behind their horses in an ambiguous manner and ... not doing anything. This scene may show the hallucinations of Frodo as he suffers his wounds. It seems to be a lot harder than anything else. <br /> <br /> * Gimli, the dwarf, is as high as Legolas Elf. He is a dwarf There is no excuse for that. In addition, he also looks like a damned David. It is a rough and precise explanation. <br /> <br /> * Boromir looks like Elmer Fudd's golden Viking armor from Bugs Bunny when he looks ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * Despite the similarities With the image of Tolkien, but Balrog is the catastrophe and the least threatening villain in this movie. It looks like someone wearing a pink bedroom slippers and it is almost higher than Gandalf. "Purists" might like this Balrog, but I'll take Jackson's version every day. <br /> <br /> * That fight scene. Uncomfortable and embarrassing Almost none of the characters show any level of ability with their weapons. I didn't ask for scenes like the scenes in Jackson's movie. But they should fight. <br /> <br /> * Treebeard appeared very short and I regret that he had to appear at all. Watching movies. You see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Now, it's a good part of the movie. <br /> <br /> * Some sound performances are quite good. It's not that Aragorn is bad. He just looks like Jolly Green Giant. <br /> <br /> * Galadriel is quite interesting in this description. Like Tom Bombadil, she doesn't seem to be influenced by the temptations of the ring and her voice is not scary. <br /> <br /> * Boromir's death is not. Attractive heart like Jackson's painting But it is still remarkably appropriate (And actually more with his death in the book, although I do not believe Jackson made a mistake in shooting the way he did) <br /> <br /> * As my teacher pointed out ( During the whispering threat), evil spirits (most of which Helm's Deep, if I'm right) resemble the remains of soldiers destroyed by war, which is a political order that works well if you know you're trying <br /> <br /> * Although this is not used Positive issues about the movie, but Bakshi can't be blamed for most failures in this film, or so I was told - this project is in a limited budget and delayed production. He lost control like Creative to the higher (Which I'm sure didn't read the book) <br /> <br /> Keep me clear: I respect Bakshi even trying sometimes. Hinges of this size I just had a hard time believing that he was happy with the final product. <br /> <br /> Overall, I couldn't recommend the classic Tolkien trilogy, even laughing. Any way, unless you have read the book and have your own pictures, characters, places and events, I'm sure that some people will choose a copy of this story with confusion. If you do that, open your heart and gather the good things you can do.
