Now I hire this movie because Brad Drew has been there. He is a great actor. BRILLIANT in everything ... except this movie. And I think that's just because he knows how stupid the movie is and isn't busy with good performance This movie is an unintended comedy. Some lines broke me. And they have some lines that are meaningless, and it seems that Tobe Hooper just threw the line without thinking of the plot Oh! But it's one of the movies that is TAHT BAD, which looks really scary. I recommend this to Big Brad Dourif fans or other fans of the actors because of the pathetic plot.
