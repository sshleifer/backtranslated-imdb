... at least in the first half If it started with three friends in the navy and focused on the action scenes of the navy, it would be a better and more tight movie. The second half of this movie is worthwhile, especially the action scenes and close-ups of the ship in the early 20th century, but it's like a boring toothache. In addition, do not watch this movie just because Ginger Rogers is there. She plays an important role. But it's a small matter. <br /> <br /> The film begins with three New York City friends working on tourism and is also a good match for Sally (Ginger Rogers) hands. Road The First World War split, the three friends seemed to be indifferent to the fight. But went into the navy One-third of the industry as small as civilians (Bill Boyd, while in Baltimore) wind up two other superiors (Robert Armstrong as Dutch To make matters more complicated, Sally fell in love with one of the three. But there is no chance to tell him before the three go to war. <br /> <br /> This film is slightly more interesting. On the ship, mostly because of the close range shot we had with the ship itself and because the chemistry among the three friends was reliable. However, James Gleason at the age of 49 seemed to be a bit boring, especially when the office marks The soldier said that you must be between the ages of 17 and 35 to qualify. <br /> <br /> One of the real, obvious flaws in movies that makes me believe everything Users outside of the ship is supplemented with caution minimum is to design costumes or should I say lack of it. In the scene in New York before the First World War, we had everyone dressed in the fashion of 1931 and every driver of the year 1931 - no attempt to bring this movie for a period of time. <br /> <br /> In summary If you watch a few scenes with Ginger Rogers and the last 45 minutes associated with the Navy's suicide mission, you see everything here worthwhile. The rest is the internal space.
