I grew up (b. 1965). See and love Thunderbird. All my friends at school watched us play "Thunderbird" before going to school during the lunch break and after school. We all want to be Virgil or Scott. No one wants to be Alan. Counting down from 5 becomes an art form. I take my children to watch movies. Hopefully they will see what I love since I was young. So disappointing The only high point is to customize the theme quickly. Can not compare with the original score of Thunderbird Fortunately, early in the morning, Saturday morning, there was one television station that still replayed the set of Gerry Anderson and his wife. Jonatha Frakes should send the chair of the director's version of him completely hopeless. Garbage from the garbage film CGI remake may be acceptable, but instead of marionettes with Homo sapiens subsp sapiens is a huge mistake of judgment.
