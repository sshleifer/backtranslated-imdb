"Hak Hap" or "Black Mask" (English) is a disappointment. I was told that it was "Japanese version of the matrix". Imagine my disappointment. The movie was dubbed "bad" or the movie soundtrack didn't match well. In other words, the conversation is terrible. There are very few ideas that are put in the English version of this film and it attracts specific interest It's not a movie I want to watch again.
