I watched this movie just because I was impressed by Olivier Martinez in SWAT. But this is not a SWAT. The SWAT has a story and characters that are favorite and realistic. > <br /> I should realize that it may not be good after all the terrible pain like Michelle Forbes has always had a role. <br /> <br /> One poster here called. movie Incoherent Another story calls it the worst movie ever. Both gave too much movie credits. I'm glad I received it from the library for free. But I still feel torn. <br /> <br /> IMDb must have "0" to vote "Rate this movie" for one such movie.
