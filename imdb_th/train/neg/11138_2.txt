Let me start by saying that I have read a number of reviews before renting this movie and know what to expect. Even though I was just surprised that it was not good. <br /> <br /> I'm a big werewolf fan and are very familiar with forgiveness when watching. Most have sub-effects, poor performances and weak storylines. Up until now, with the possible exception of the "Howling" series of movies, some of which are the worst in the story. <br /> <br /> The first episode, the story There have been many reviews on this website, so I won't be specific. However, it is clear that the author is not often associated with lycanthropic monsters that occur when horror films are given to writers who think of themselves "above" the fare. They try to create a new spin on it. Thor, Wolf's Mythos is okay, but fans who are not horror movies that try to do this generally don't care about the intelligence and complexity of the horror audience and end up. If a write down to them. The plot feels like a parody of the werewolf movie, and the events that appear are louder, so I feel that my intelligence is seriously insulted. For example, television news images never get away from journalists to silence someone in the crowd behind them. Give credit to the characters and viewers to see the villains in the scene without using flashing neon lights. And that's just a small part of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> For the effect, I have never seen a reliable little werewolf. I'm happy with Lonnie Jr. in my crepe. The animals they use seem very much ... well, like those dressed in cheap rubber outfits that are stuck in hair and have really awesome animation animation. And I know that many people are criticizing CG, but my God is terrible. One scene has women changing and starting with a completely nude CG actress. But for some reason without nipples My first thought was "Hey, why is one of the characters from 'ReBoot' becoming a stupid werewolf? <br /> <br /> Anyway, I like to look for positive things in any movie and there are few movies shot through. (This film was filmed with all digital systems which were interesting) and some performances were not scary. It's interesting to see Tippi Hedron as the best homeless woman in the world and Kane Hodder is a bad guy. Moreover, the Yellow Power Ranger grows and ... uh .. and if you are looking for skin, there are interesting examples. This ends in the male pig from reviews. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you want a good werewolf movie, try "An American Werewolf in London", the original "The Howling", "Dog Soldiers" or even "The Wolfen" (even if there are more wolves) If you are the most complete lycanthrope, look at it. Otherwise, miss this
