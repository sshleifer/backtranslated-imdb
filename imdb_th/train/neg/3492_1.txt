I didn't buy kung fu movies for the synopsis. I bought it for the fight scene. A bad plot can be forgiven for a great fight scene. But not the other way There are about 3 or 4 common fighting scenes, which are only a few minutes apart. The last battle took a little longer. But when I was very bored, I didn't care.
