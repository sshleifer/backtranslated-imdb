Michael Keaton has never been a good actor before. In Tim Burton's movie, he often falls into the shadows of his great villain. Here he acted as a husband, a widow who received radio waves that seemed like a dead person trying to communicate with life ... <br /> <br /> Well, this should be a shocking thriller. It misses every point that scares you. Because there are too many things that cannot be explained, discovered and not interesting So the shocking excitement when everything happened to a bad movie at first when WHITE NOISE made itself out A truly bad performance and a horrible edit. This movie has nothing to see Michael Keaton trying to get back to thriller. But ended up missing more goals than ever before
