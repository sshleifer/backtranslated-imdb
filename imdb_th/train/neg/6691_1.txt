My eyes! In the name of God and sacred things made me feel this movie! What drugs are you taking! This may be the worst movie! I felt like I was traveling acid bad all the time. I had to call a therapist to help me deal with injuries from this great disaster. From the beginning to the end, the glowing rope is a masterpiece that is not holy of Satan. When I thought of watching this movie with my best friend, Jew and his family, we thought "Hey, this might be funny! It may not be good But still a little funny "How much we went wrong Movies may be All of my friends line up to get Loomodia as soon as the film ends, and while this movie, one of my friends tries to hang the belt by themselves. I hope I will watch the video from The Ring instead of the way the pain and suffering will disappear in just seven days. For everyone who wants to watch this movie, you're not prepared! You may think that you are "strong" by renting this thing. But this movie will make you crack, push you down to the ground and urinate at you
