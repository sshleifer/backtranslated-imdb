When reading comments on the website, I felt compelled to write for the first time. It seems that this movie is similar to Marmite and makes the audience separate. I must say that while I accept movies, there is no need to make fun (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE). They also have to share with your character. Now, while I was absorbed by a lesbian in the murder of Lynch's novel, I must say that I cannot talk about Mr Green or other cardboard gangsters living in this world. <br /> <br /> In addition, while many people seem to try and say that you are not fun because you do not receive it, I must not agree - I do not have fun because I'm bored. I want the movie to end and listen to those words repeatedly, not helping anything. Call it clever. If you will - I think it's repetitive. <br /> <br /> However, my main reason for writing is to ask questions. All other investigators - no credit. I see. Just listening to the music above black. Do I watch the insulting print or evidence of GR's cockyness? Or that everyone involved in the movie looks harsh and has to delete their names ???
