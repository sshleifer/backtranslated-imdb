A few months ago, I participated in a discussion with another IMDb poster (Hey Kmadden) about this movie. The poster confirmed that if I gave the opportunity 'Flushed Away' I would like it. I agree to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> 'Flushed Away' has good intentions. (At least in the part of Aardman) but lacking the strength to pull it together The best asset is the head of the drainer / shipman Rita (played by Kate Winselt), which IMO should be the main character of the movie instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cool and interesting while Roddy spends most of the time. In shaking the screen, <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothered me the most about 'FA' is to repeat the jokes that aren't funny when Roddy is attacked by a crouch. This movie makes sure. That he will be attacked again once again "My name is shocking," said Rita's brother, who used electric. Roddy spoke at least three times. My patience for cheap gags associated with pain is low all the time. <br /> <br /> I won't waste time on the kleptomaniac tendencies of Katzenberg's per Pixar, but I'll say I'm disappointed in Aardman. They can do it. (And already done) much better. Try again next time
