The only word I can think of to describe this film is: Ordinary <br /> <br /> Plot story line about Gary Cine's character who tried to commit suicide is a ridiculous evidence and c 'mon .. In the hut that is driving the golf ball into the ocean because he can't handle the life of a wealthy professional golfer? Crying river I hope these are my problems. I enjoy Dylan Baker and Sinise, but this movie is a bad choice or is paid for Sinise. The scene where Timmy Price was attacked by other club members in front of his father during the tournament ended with That I'm embarrassed to see
