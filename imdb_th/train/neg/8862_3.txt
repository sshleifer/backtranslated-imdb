From the moment Christopher Lee wears a punk sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club, you know you have a bad smell in your hands! This movie has potential. Under all sludge, there are fragments of things that may be created as good movies, if not interesting. However, the final product is really messy. In addition to free nude pictures and very attractive women, Howling II is also a ridiculous excuse for horror movies. Christopher Lee gives credibility But even though he can't raise the level above the shit, <br /> <br /> Never seen any other movies in this series. The value is the true continuation of the event in the first part. We started at a funeral for a character from a real character and within the first ten minutes we found ourselves in Transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to fight witches, werewolves. This movie is quite good and there are not many dead spots. The action is there; It's just a bad shot. One of the bright spots is the music of the punk band Babel. Although their songs are often played But it was quite an ear. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with this movie. First of all, the performance is worse than poor. Christopher Lee is good enough But it is over Both lead to Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe is lacking everything you need for that character. Writing is an assertive story, redundant corrections and expert directions. There are some special effects effects that are good. But the wonderful one weighed a lot. Sybil Danning looked good, but her performance was less than satisfactory. Judd Omen watched the role he played. But his voice and acting are unbelievable to say the least Most conversations are incomprehensible language which may or may not be Latin. <br /> <br /> I like the general idea for the story. I often enjoy the stories of true believers, go out and fight the forces of evil that seem invincible. One scene where a group of good people are trekking in the dark forest and shooting a group of werewolves is exciting, kind of maybe a bigger budget or a better director might make the rest of the movie more interesting Slightly 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound <br /> <br /> Note: From this writing, the censorship at youtube.com has not cut credit. Many times while The song was played at Babel! Catch it while you can!
