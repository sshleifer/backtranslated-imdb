This is the motivation for me from the local video store. Don't make the same mistakes as I do. This movie is boring, inconsistent and boring. The conversation between the young priest and his uncle was written and delivered badly. I cringed every scene that they shared. Dennis Hopper appeared a little and was a normal character. His role is not clear for him. And even if this film is put in Puerto Rico But it feels like a lot of Hollywood movies All the main characters are white people and many people often speak English with a pseudo-Irish accent. However, when you see this store on the shelves of your local video store, continue to walk.
