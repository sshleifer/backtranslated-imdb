I'm not a big fan of the festival 2005, hit "hostel" and most of these stupid stupid people are bad or worse - but "live feeds" manage to keep me entertained quite about the first 30 days. Beginning with sexual intercourse and uncomfortable settings, followed by a good death scene related to the Chinese Organized Crime Squad and a 7-foot-butcher-cutting board ... what made me out of the movie This is Guns and frustration in saving the whole day ... I would call this movie the best because of the evidence associated with nasty young people who were killed in a horrible porn theater twice as a hideout. mafia If torture is prolonged enough to be thoroughly effective, my ratings will vary greatly. Unfortunately, most of the horror was combined in one scene, causing the rest of the movie to conclude that it was a revenge situation. So in general, it's just a "cheap" hostel that has been dragged by the use of ransom sex for almost the first half of the movie ... Overall, I would say that you don't have to worry about this.
