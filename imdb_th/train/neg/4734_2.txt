Do you like beautiful women? Yes, I too. Is there anything good to say about women / beautiful women? Why do I just give this movie 2 stars out of 5 even though it has "talent" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /> <br /> If I want to see really beautiful people, I'll watch MTV or what is Cause This is an action movie called Movie. So by definition, it doesn't have to have a plot, right? I disagree 100% but suppose yes What does it need? 20-minute video from episode 1 (I might have exaggerated a little But it feels like more than 20 minutes ...) ?! That will be "No", but then you don't know again. People who watch part may not know what they eat for breakfast at this time, so we remind them that ... they might warn them twice? Just to make sure that they won't forget ... At least until the credit is rolling! <br /> <br /> So forget the story about character development about true emotions about " Performances "(and no, I don't think women in walking skirts and / or fighting are responsible for acting! ... What is it? Yes, action scenes The action scenes are not bad and that is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1! I gave this movie a chance. But it's a waste of time ... you have something to do / look better. Believe me ...
