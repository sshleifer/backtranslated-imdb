I didn't get this movie ... Is it a stage drama? No .. but with choreography and dancing in it ... <br /> <br /> It's a serious drama .... No Not good enough for that story This vamp Messages about apartheid and "tribute" to students who died during student uprisings But because of the entertainment, it's terrible, and as a documentary, it's worse. <br /> <br /> See yourself, but in fairness I hate it.
