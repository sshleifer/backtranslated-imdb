The follow-up of the 1973 drama Walking Walking continues in real life around the Sheriff Buford Pusser from Tennessee. But this sector plays like a TV movie Bose Swanson plays the role of Joe Don Baker. But he is too gentle for this chapter He came out like a country singer who hid his bat instead of a guitar. Good supporting actors such as Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui end up with very few things to do. I will give this film with one good intention by celebrities. But the screenplay is a transparent and lazy story of a regular opus and production is Jack Jack. The price was followed in 1977 by "Final Chapter-Walking Tall" and in 1978 by the TV movie "A Real American Hero "
