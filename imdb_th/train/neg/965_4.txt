First of all, I like that movie. For me it's a good joke with stupid moments. Costume designer Albert Wolsky do our best !!! Like a great set decorator, Robert R. Benton - this guy has a really good taste !!! But the script writer made me very disappointed. The best end is the scene on the stairs. But instead of that, they decided that their father and daughter should be together, not like the ending. The father became a fan of his own daughter and the ex-wife knew this and found it okay. It would be ok if the script writer would say that there are now different spirits in the body. But they didn't do it, he only remembered his memory. The actors are good. They are really funny. Cybill Shepherd is charming. Robert Downey Jr. is very funny in the dance scene :))) ... but sometimes even losing the impression of a good performance Such as Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after the death of her husband, waiting for him for 23 years (for a long time!). But he and when she met him and was only About creating love for him after the incident with her friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal). She easily betrayed the man she longed for years !!! It will be a good movie, if not the end, and some people think of psychology.
