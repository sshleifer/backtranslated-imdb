This horror semi-horror film follows a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on Shikoku Island to sell her family home and meet old friends. She found that one of the priests' daughters in the village drowned many years ago. She and Fumiko (Another childhood friend) then learned that Sayori's mother tried to make her come back to life again with black magic. The relationship between the dead and the living became weaker. Friends and villagers saw ghosts. Nothing special or great about this movie. Unlike the J-horror movie that is the protagonist, the suspense is not created. Actually, the result doesn't seem too intimidating and the end of nonsense. with So long that it was weak Sometimes you can buy it at a poor Asian restaurant or cook your own white rice for too long. You end up eating it because you want it with a meal because what is Chinese or Japanese food without rice? But it almost destroyed food because of the stickyness of everything. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
