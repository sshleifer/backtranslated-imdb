Serious Home Alone / KARATE KID surprised the characters in a way that was not good enough to sue the author and was shot. You can see the stunt usage of celebrities in almost every scene. Oh and the performance is also bad. Although I have to say that the line: "Sorry, my friend had to take a big break."
