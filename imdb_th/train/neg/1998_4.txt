My roommate received No, No, Nanette. The soundtrack was dubbed on the tape and she listened to it. Don't stop. After that, finally brainwashing me to give up, I found that irresistible music, especially loud, I wanted to be happy. But I am not happy ... but from a rough song, I don't know what the film is like. About The day before I saw a copy of it at a video store and I rented things that should be a long-lost version of the movie. I think it will be amazing because the soundtrack is very cute. Unfortunately, most of the songs I love are not found in the videos I see. Now I have never seen a musical version in 1930, but this version is sadly disappointing because there is very little singing and almost no dancing and in addition to the bad sound, you really don't understand what people are saying a lot when highlighting The only thing about this movie is the outrageous fashion of the 1940s. Nanette wore this crazy hat that had two hairs protruding like a rabbit's ears and Kansas Kitty had a strange goose feather that she kept The arm ahead of her. The same dance sequence is a little strange, like Nanette doing this strange ballet with a pin-up image over her. In fact, the other bright spot of this film is Guillespe, an artist who dreams of being a good artist. But now has been condemned for drawing high-income young women I like the way Guillespe kept the old school and quit Nanette when his masterpiece that would make his career be sold by Nanette for $ 5250. Did you know that that piece is his immortality? Silly Rabbit / girl with a bunny ears on your hat When will you study Why did he not use the pencil in the cigarette before the advertising man took the job?
