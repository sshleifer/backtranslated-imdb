I intend to watch this movie in the cinema. It's sold out I went to see Solaris instead, which was actually the worst movie to be released in 2002. <br /> <br /> Victor Rosa (John Leku Samo), a 'female pharmacist', a strong and strange street The boy was shot, so he decided to clean and invest all the money with Jack. (Peter Sarsard) Everything seems to be quite good until Jack crosses the city with his girlfriend Trish. (Denise Richards) This happened very slowly in the movie, so if they didn't reveal this in the example, it might be interesting. But they did that. It wasn't. <br /> <br /> Actually, there's nothing interesting about this movie. Everything is given in the example. If you see a preview even once, you'll see the whole movie, so you might think it's hard to fill the gap. Go to the sample download site, save yourself $ 3.99. No surprises or twists in the entire movie, in addition to the bad soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I hope anyone who is responsible for writing the soundtrack will. Was fired twice. Most songs are songs, if the only song that is allowed to be released is Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan duets and (I may destroy the structure of the continuum. There is a concept that makes the mind dizzy like this) with less talent and musical ability. <br /> <br /> The worst performance is a crime against humanity and Denise Richards is a good foam. 67% and 33% zipper bag. Did you know that the bad thing when John Leguizamo (he is in The Pest!) Makes the rest of the actors more capable of his acting?
