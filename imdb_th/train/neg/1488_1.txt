I have to register for IMDb to post a comment about how scary the movie is ... Cat and string children have a better story. Not the worst show I have ever seen But when you wash almost all of the movie within 5 minutes, it should be desired There was not a single moment that was 'scared' in the movie, except when they watched the movie 'Halloween' on TV. It seemed to be a good story. Turn the credit and say Chasey Lain was there. She didn't say that, 'Yes, she's there.' I'm glad I saw this in the hotel and didn't pay because I was actually paid if I paid to see this. Usually I like or can find the redemption factor in the movie. But this is an exception. It's very bad that it's not fun like this. It's terrible. It's bad. It's normal.
