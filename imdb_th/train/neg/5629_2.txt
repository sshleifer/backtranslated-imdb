I just rented (yes! I paid to watch!) This movie, Oh God. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As another critic mentioned, Ms. Colagrande left his favorite movie! Please don't create or appear in another movie! The charming woman of cantaloupe No, that is not fair to cantaloupe, which may have more possibilities. She didn't know how to do it. She affects the image that is disgusting all the time. (Reminds me of the nasty sisters from Europe always) She's not charming. She's not pretty. There's no real story and editing! Nothing I saw! It's quite bad when you watch a movie and when you want to go through it, you can press "forward forward" on your remote and nothing happens! I mean! ..... I scream unintentionally "Cut! Cut!" What are they thinking? Obviously they think they will create a movie together and get money to create love on the screen! Good deals for them Beautiful raw handling for the audience! I think I'll throw up now ....
