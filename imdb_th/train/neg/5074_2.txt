I saw this film two weeks ago at "Festival des nouvelles images du Japon" in Paris, although I didn't expect much from it. But I must say that I was disappointed like many people in the audience ... If I want to summarize my feelings, princess mononoke and nausicaa from beginning to end, of course, it's stupid, but I can't help. The story is very different. But the image in the world is very similar. And from this point of view, "tree of palme" cannot be compared with Miyazaki's masterpiece. Although it is technically quite good But boredom is still ... In the end, the lack of creativity makes me not recommend you to watch me score 2 out of 10 (quite serious, I think it deserves 3 or 4)
