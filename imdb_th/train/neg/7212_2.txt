Why do all horror movie directors want to imitate "The Exorcist" as a complete puzzle for me? Because William Friedkin's "classic" is a movie that is very exaggerated and in my opinion is not all tension or shocking. And this is another clean scam in Spain this time, which repeats the story of a girl who is possessed by pure evil and distracts her own family, Paul Naschy (which I have to admit to look rather hot. The strength here) plays the honorable priest who has been contacted by John Gibson because of his sister's behavior. Leila has changed a lot since she met her new boyfriend.At first, the priests did not believe. But when John's body was discovered by twisting the neck of Ley's demonic behavior, it became more apparent ... "Exorcism" is not only a matter of traditional tribes. Here, Naschy and the director Juan Bosch has a wide open opportunity to seek religious interests full of shock and gore. But the result is a clean and bloodless drama that almost makes you sleep! Twenty minutes ago, there were moments in the atmosphere, though very stupid, and there were many nude and sleek images of women. The lack of a true budget is not a real excuse since Paul Nashchi had previously proved that he had enough imagination to compensate for financial shortages. This is just a film about other European horrors. "The Excorcist" Ripping is "The Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door" and they suck as well!
