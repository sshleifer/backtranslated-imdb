96 minutes of this thing is cruel .. and I love Munster's old body. What is the matter? Yes, that line is repeated. But anyone who is at the helm is not a fan. There is a lot of 'trickery' (and I use that word with a good pause) that I suspect is the old Starsky & Hutch episode. That makeup is not near the neck Refused to admit that whenever he passed by the mid-60s (laughable), the producers just replaced Marilyn and Eddie with the younger actors. Why not let them grow and age? Addam's new family reunification doesn't add to the interest of Halloween Party. <br /> <br /> Grandpa & Herman flew to Transylvania and came back in a few hours. The most unbelievable character (I include a bad robot) because he speaks disrespectfully and speaks Yiddish. But claimed to be an ancient Arab ruler And yes it seems that laughter will disappear In fact, there are many spots that are deadly air, as if laughter is inserted later. The actors seem to wait for the audience to be deceived. It's not laughing. It's sad. Oh and the best part! Yvonne De Carlo has a line that will show you what writers and producers are. Marilyn says: "Uncle Herman and grandfather are where? They may have an accident, they may be hit by a car ... or a train! "Lily said that he responded with something like:" Uncle Herman will come here if he has to drag himself out of the train. "The amazing thing about this story is: Yvonne's husband, DeCarlo, was a stuntman in the early 1960s and lost his leg and almost killed in a train talent show. He never recovered and destroyed her family financially. (Check the review of the life and career of a great biography) This line may be easier to change to be sensitive to you. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Munster, you have to rent this mess. Saw that there was something better left alone Despite the original character (almost), this story is almost as bad as trying to create a program a few years ago.
