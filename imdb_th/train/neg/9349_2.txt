This movie is terrible. I received 2 points as much as I saw. Worst, but very few. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the beginning of the movie at the beginning and back to the beginning at the end. This film uses everything in the box of the trick used to create a movie for the benefit of it, like a child with too many toys. There are endless lectures, monotonous, boring, slow motion, freezing frames, events and combined images and more - nothing makes a boring movie better. <br /> <br /> It's cheap. Called "16 years of alcohol" but with a little alcohol or drunkenness and no withdrawal from the film by jumping around the place without a connection The story was written badly and acted strongly and the direction was not the same as well, and it is a shame that people have put more money for additional movies. Mr Jobson previously knew that being in the garbage group and on the TV made it feel Like this Movies can be done. <br /> <br /> I find it a big struggle to see this thing to the end. But in the hope that it will improve, I will continue in bitterness. But it is really a waste of time, better not to disturb
