As a person who is reading novels and watching movies, I have different opinions as to why this movie failed. First of all, the comparison between novels and movies is completely superficial. They are two different animals. <br /> <br /> This novel is intended to be a word. But it came to an end between tragedy and controversy instead. Humorous elements, such as the elements that later created the stylistic style of the movie, are just the coincidences that the author mocked regularly. And fearing that the white suit that is everywhere of the composers deceives you to think that this is another one. Mark Twain thinks again An example of a smarter literature is the demon of Ambrose Bierce in the hat and tail. Tom Wolfe is the same clown and hacker who is more famous than the author, always looking for a new mill for the mill he is always obsessed with /> <br /> So it's not surprising that the production skills and the great direction in creating this movie will end from the beginning. Different from the true words that are very well interpreted in this film, violent arguments are not in the observation that can be reached internationally in some form or behavior of other humans, but in attacking one person by specifically Anyhow, given the wrath of the writer, any attempt to create a successful story from filming or storytelling from the beginning must have a clean start without the influence or intervention of the writer. <br /> <br /> I have to say that not only is incompetent, such as Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith that cannot be measured. But the real ability, like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham and Morgan Freeman, is wasted. Br> There is only enough material here for the true movie satire. But it wasn't close
