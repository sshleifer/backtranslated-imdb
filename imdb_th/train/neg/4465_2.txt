After the overwhelming success of Amenabar and Balaguero, the Spanish horror film spreads like a terrible disease in the increasingly tragic horror film world. The result is all in movies like El Segundo nombre, which is a work of creation Bad television But writing and directing is worse I didn't read Ramsey Campbell's book. But I'm sure the author of The Doll Who Ate Mother didn't share with this horrible production. Avoid any costs unless you are searching for a quiet night in a new movie theater. 2/10
