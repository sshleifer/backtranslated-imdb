This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is no exact story. The gags are only for slowing and nothing else will make this movie worth it. In all movies, Fredi (Oh ​​my God, funny name, haha). Don't ask myself if he came from a plane to the middle world. There are many stupid and unsightly characters whose names should sound funny, such as: Gandalf called Almghandi, Sam called Pupsi ... and so on. I didn't smile even once throughout the movie. The porch looks like they were created by someone who has a negative IQ if you laugh when someone's cloak is stuck at the door. (Happens about 5 times) This movie may be right for you Another funny scene: They try to guess the code for closed doors. (Don't ask why - don't ask "Why" in this movie) and the code is (ha): Mun. So if you laugh with this example, you might like this movie. For others: Go to Youtube and watch "Lord of the Weed": It's a lot more fun.
