Yes, MTV really has a way to market Daria. What started out as a smart teenager - "commenting on everything that sucks and makes the viewer feel better about boring teenage life". Com now becomes "How you should deal with your problem" I've watched Daria all the time and really like it. Now sitting here after watching the "movie" called, I'm just wondering what all these issues are. Damamok, how can we bring life to the university? Sorry? The issues that Daria did not do every time that what you like to do are ok, as long as it's okay to yourself, no matter what the sad world is left to think about. All this reminds me of the scene in "Reality Bites". The movie channel shows the documentary for the first time.
