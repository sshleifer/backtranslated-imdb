"Phantasm" in 1979 is a horror horror and original horror film in the atmosphere and in a single word cult. The first sequel of 1988 is full of witty, witty, action packed with entertainment. However, after the first sequel, the creator of Don Coscarelli seems to have no new idea. "Phantasm III - Lord Of The Dead" in 1994 was not a complete failure. But it is quite fun But there is no new initiative and efforts to bring new things into tedious things Disappointing compared to previous models <br /> <br /> - spoiler - <br /> <br /> quite a lot At first, we were introduced to the secret behind the scout sphere Mysterious (Money balls that fly with the brain) are not revealed So many new, unnecessary and annoying characters (such as Tim, "Home Alone" - a little boy style that is great in filming rocky, chick, black, blackjack, blackjack, cactus, strong and super cool) Recommended This film has the same qualities - Reggie Bannister is great while playing Reggie's ponytail guitar. Angus Scrimm is also quite creepy like a tall man. But the fact that the tall man spoke more about it in this film caused him to release the fear of Mike's character, played by A. Michael Baldwin again (he was replaced by James LeGros in episode 2) in which My thoughts didn't make a lot of difference. Blood also makes the movie interesting enough to watch. But it is still disappointing, especially because of the effort to quickly compensate for annoying thoughts. <br /> <br /> Everything that thinks "Phantasm III" is an acceptable time. But it was very disappointing compared to the previous generation of fans of "Phantasm". The first two films can be viewed. But I do not recommend setting your expectations too high.
