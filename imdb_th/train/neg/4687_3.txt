He makes people psychopaths, even sympathetic and disappearing in the characters. - There is no small talent for the famous actors. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is left. Supporting performances (and actors) will not look out of place in the soft core (It does not help every character, but Sy is made from 100% cardboard) Sometimes the director seems to try to destroy the suspicion: We know from the first moment.

But in itself is not enough to make this film work In the end, the lack of work from everyone involved, except Robin Williams, made this thing worse. 3 out of 10
