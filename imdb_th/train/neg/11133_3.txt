Except for acting skills that are better than the average of both leads, this movie is really bad. Cheap production value does not help anything. Of course, you won't notice that the production value is cheap. If they don't try to convince you that they have initial production costs, even if it's a B-movie genre that is crazy about yourself, this movie is really interesting
