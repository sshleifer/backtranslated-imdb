Why is any legitimate actor reading this part involved in this nonsense? My God is really embarrassing to watch it. I can't imagine the shame that these people have to feel part of. Obviously there is a dispute about whether the Phoenix River has a cameo in the movie. He was not checked But the list of his roles here (IMDB) gives him credit. BTW ... Rain is his sister for someone who had asked before. This film is a proof that no matter how big you have "name", the ears of the sows do not make silk bags. I love Lorraine Bracco. But this is sad, sad. This It doesn't have features that are fun, entertaining, or even funny when compared to anything else that isn't good.
