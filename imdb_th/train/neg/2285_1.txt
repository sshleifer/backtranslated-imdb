That is 90 minutes in my life. I will not come back. This film makes the teenage TV program "California Dreams" seem "almost famous". The show is horrible and the story is unrealistic. Don't even let me start with the real band in the front row of this story, lame music, etc. You have to believe that they are one of the hottest bands in the country and there is not enough irony. The world will accept that The guitarist was seen as a heroin user, not that I blamed him if I was near a foul-smelling band with old songs and wooden performances. Music from a distance, seriously avoiding this in every way
