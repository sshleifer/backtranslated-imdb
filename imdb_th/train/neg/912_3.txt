... For one of the worst Swedish movies ever ... forgive me boring <br /> <br /> First of all, I didn't watch the first movie. (I'm bored, that's the reason I watched episode 2 before day 1). I hope the first one is better. It's full of strange scenes and strange changes for people who have seen this and think that 4/10 is high (believe me), but it makes me laugh a couple of times because it's so bizarre and I'm still laughing with the punk ideas that come up with this idea. The sequel that is not From a novel or a book does not become a great story often, and this is a perfect example. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'll be honest with you: I laugh a little. There are a few good jokes and humor. But don't buy for rent Just let other idiots do or download <br /> <br /> 4/10 This movie will be remembered and the director should laugh ...
