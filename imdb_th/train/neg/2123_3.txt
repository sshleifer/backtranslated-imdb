I went to UCSB and attended with producer Alison Anders. She is a great teacher and director. Everything you put in your name, I think, must be very good. This film is an option at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It seems to be a good choice. <br /> <br /> While the film has beautiful pictures and filming movies in order to achieve My main problem is that this movie is the first story of someone and you can tell clearly. Bad performances and even worse screenplay stop the film from falling off the floor. The soundtrack has a good song that gives the feeling of the main character fighting to cope with the sadness that led to his departure and now comes back to where he grew up. I must say that even though there are some better crafts But lacking stories and performances, making them unable to perform well
