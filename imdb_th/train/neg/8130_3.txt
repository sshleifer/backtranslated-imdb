While exploring some caves with his wife, the doctor was bitten by a bat which caused the terrible side effects ... <br /> <br /> The occasional creepy atmosphere and makeup effects. Good B, a horror flick from the sub-story of a human being, a Bat creature, also known as Lives By Night, suffered from an unconscious story that was improperly planned and lacking And Increases transparency in pacing. The plot doesn't seem to go anywhere, and the movie never gives an explanation of what happened or even a satisfactory conclusion for every story. Actors are quite common in their performances. <br /> <br /> I still give some films for haunting music and good filming locations. The late Stan Winston's makeup work is also quite good. But not many exhibitions here <br /> <br /> One of the creatures created here. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 from ****
