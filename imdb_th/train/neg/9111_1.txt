Cruel Intentions 2 Terrible. I mean uber-bad. Words can't explain how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The plot of Cruel Intentions 2 is very similar to the first movie. Sebastian (Robin Dunn) was expelled from a private school and forced. Moved to New York There he decided to start a new one and just live a normal life and settle down. Unfortunately he had to deal with his sister Kathryn. (Amy Adams) who wants to drag him down Sebastian began to fall in love with Daniel. (Sarah Thompson) The innocent daughter of the school principal Kathryn wanted Sebastian to sleep with the whole school, which was described as 'House of Prostitutes' Kathryn also wants revenge with Cherie (Keri Lynn Pratt), which makes her embarrassed during the school meeting. Kathryn wants to make the new sister become the biggest slut in the school which is A sub plot similar to the first movie. <br /> <br /> Cruel Intentions 2 is a canceled TV program that becomes a prequel. There are many problems with movies. It's badly written, bad and not good. Fortunately for Amy Adams, the show never took off because she is now a relatively large actor. While the cruel intentions are realistic and can be seen in the real world. Cruel Intentions 2 is located in the sitcom region and as described on amazon.co.uk 'the version recorded by the bell' There are dark issues about using sex and drugs in the first film, but in Cruel Intentions 2 trying to make it funny and some ideas in the movie shouldn't be like Kathryn, who has a relationship with the professor. Like the secret society that all popular children meet to talk about the fall of other students, the film has a big problem about sex, ages 15/16. I know that teens have sex. Sometimes But when done in movies or television, being treated seriously One of the most famous feelings was when Daneille encouraged Cherie (which was in the 14/15 period in the movie) to simulate sex on the back of the horse to the point that she had an orgasm. The idea of ​​changing girls around the age of 14/15 to become a slut is very wrong with me and should not be a joke. The jokes in this movie are flattering, whether they are oral or verbal. 'She's wet every time when you see you' is the mouth that Sebastian pushes Kathryn to face the mud first. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of mistakes with this movie, which I don't have time to go. But I said that I should avoid just watching Cruel Intentions while not classic movies. But still a good movie and focus on this story. <br /> <br /> This film is just a drenched dream of having many school students in a sex school.
