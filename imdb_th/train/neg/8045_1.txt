I am very confused about this movie about anything in the world? What is the killer's motivation? It seems that he is angry. But I still do not know why Nothing in this movie is reasonable. It has zero depth. Or less than zero deep Which I think it will make him or is a pile of shit. The performance is terrible When I searched for some actors in this movie, they did something I heard and that was not surprising. I can't decide whether to feel sorry for them because of the embarrassment of being in this movie, bad or feeling that they should not offer a performance again. (Refer to the file file) Actually, don't waste time on this matter. There is little content that has nothing to make fun. This is one of the worst flick movies - no. One of the worst movies I've ever seen in bad luck and I've seen a few times.
