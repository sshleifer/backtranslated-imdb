I'm a big fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shalhoub. I like Stephen King a little less. But I like his work. <br /> <br /> This thing says I should love 1408 <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoiler after this POINT **** <br /> <br /> I walk enthusiastically. I walked out and disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is not the fault of the actors. Both Shalhoub and Jackson play very little roles because the location of the movie makes Cusack in the situation "Men in locked rooms" <br /> <br /> This is not a BAD movie, but I can't call it.

We have never seen the evil that is defeated, even though we can understand that it may be defeated. <br /> <br /> And the ending is just a shaking, "What! For a moment, <br /> <br /> Wait for the line to come. I will not mind to pay for it as a matin√©e. But I feel quite short to pay for the opening price for it
