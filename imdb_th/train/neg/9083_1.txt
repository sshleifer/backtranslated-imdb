It's terrible. It's not fun to watch. Even the scene in which the girl uses a vibrator, although it is not fun to watch in this movie. I say again, the scene in which a woman is thinking about a vibrator is not fun to watch. Or maybe if that's just part of the movie you watch, you're just a girl on the sofa using a vibrator Maybe they should have just released at one scene in the cinema. Maybe the movie might be fun to some degree. My advice, fast forward to that point, look back, watch the movie again, go back, repeat. Maybe you enjoy yourself for 2 hours. This film is beside me, spitting on your grave and creating Doom in the worst movie genre I've ever seen
