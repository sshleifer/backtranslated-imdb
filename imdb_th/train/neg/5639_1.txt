I watched this movie at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing crazy reviews. But I guess the critics are going to be soulful with Willem Defoe and his wife (director) at the festival. It's the slowest movie I've ever seen flawlessly with many ridiculous scenes. In addition to Defoe, who is a good person, the performance of two and a half people in this movie, Defoe's wife said that including Giada, a ridiculously ridiculous person This film is somewhat less plot with lame attempts to be abstract and off the wall. The only scene that stirs up any reaction in the crowd is rude and comes from nowhere, as if adding some shocking value to the dullness of this film. Sorry But actually this movie wastes time and money I appreciate a good indie movie theater. But this movie is not suitable for the time of the movie audience
