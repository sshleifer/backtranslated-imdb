Repressed housewives (Angie Dickinson, the annoying figure of the two figures, shocking us with her extreme close-up shots) is a sexually disgusted husband and decides to separate the branch.

If you're going to see De De Palma, cut off (sorry I "worship") Hitchcock. See "Sisters" instead of this. "Dressed to Kill" While full of style and technical ability is one of the most exciting things I have ever felt dissatisfied with sitting. Nonsense and tired story It has surprisingly powerful jumping jumps and murder scenes. An offensive graphic that should appease all horror fans as long as they can pass through ridiculous stories that have to be dated even in 1980.
