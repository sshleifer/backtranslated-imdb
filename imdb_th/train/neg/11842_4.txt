Kirsten Dunst is an overly enthusiastic actor. You can always tell that you are just "acting". I like Izzard. The plot is very boring. The audience does not really connect with the characters, never knowing who will sympathize with anyone or what they care about. The movie is slow and boring with laughs. But there is little and not funny at all The plot does not involve or doubt in the least. You can see each turn that is approaching. What should this movie be? Joke? Drama? Who cares? You will not finish this movie.
