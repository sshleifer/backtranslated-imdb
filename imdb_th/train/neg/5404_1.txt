Have you ever received that car, just killing an hour or two at home and watching a terrible movie? Is it challenging for a reason? Now, renting a movie on weekends, I saw a box for this person and watched T-Rex knowing that the dinosaurs on the package were T-Rex from Jurassic Park. I know I have to rent here because I'm in the mood. <br /> <br /> I'm not disappointed. At least <br /> <br /> The secret formula scientist, the company is worried about fortune and shareholders rather than life. And of course, the T-Rex socks with big motion that doesn't move well. Am I a movie that has been cut through our scenes from other movies? Not to mention the hunger of the Rex that was never satisfied ... Ever the way he was hungry over me because he had no neck (actually if you insulted when he roared, it was hard ... like a toy or something) Now I'm I like to watch B-Movies that are not incredibly good at all times because it reminds me of how much better blockbuster movies are. This is hilarious. I'm not even sure that this should be a thriller or a thriller. Funny because there is a scene that doesn't have to do wrong. You will laugh. <br /> <br /> I'll blame the budget of the movie ... Yes, but the performance doesn't help as well. In fact, Tony Tod Is quite good for some female roles ... when you cry, shouldn't "tears" out? Meh I won't be angry with this movie, I know where I am going, and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, this is what I recommend: watch this movie and see Jurassic Park and then Went astray back to the world You will write a thank you letter to Spielberg the next day.
