Henry Sala's "Nightmare Weekend" is a rotten sediment from Troma. The film is a low-budget horror film, funny and stupid about some teenage girls who spent the weekend at the mansion. In order to experiment with the horrific use of implants, she transformed the victims and their days into zombies. "Nightmare Weekend" is a complete piece of nudity and terrifying blood. It's a scary story, and the script is not very consistent. Why are the pieces of shit like that so prevalent so I avoid it like an epidemic? 1 of 10
