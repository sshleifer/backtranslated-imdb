I mainly have Mirror Mirror because Yvonne Dekalo is in there. (I think she's good at American Gothic) But sadly, she doesn't have a big role in this movie. It started with a good deal of rhythm and movement ... but eventually it became boring and boring. Not saying that this is a boring movie But it is very common and nothing exciting I do not like the "posession" aspect of it and there is no proper gore scene. Including the 'core' story that causes confusion and the ending is not reasonable However, I like the stories around the disciples and how you will take revenge on your torture
