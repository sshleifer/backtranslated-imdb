Sometimes I enjoy movies that are very lousy ... those who happen occasionally when people (Even talented people) gather together with good intentions in making movies, and for whatever reason it becomes disastrous. Movies like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes", "Plan 9 from Outer Space", "Manos-Hands of Fate" and "Heavens Gate" etc. <br /> <br /> So when I hear that this movie, "Room Under the roof of Rachel "has been praised by many people as being the worst movie in the past decade. Naturally, I just want to watch it. <br /> <br /> My child will regret the decision. That time? This movie is worse ... it's terrible that it's not as fun as a normal movie. Performing, filming, scripting, etc. is worse than porn. Low price: bad sound. And at least money, porn movies have pornography to destroy boredom, while this nonsense nightmare has men squeezing the rotten apples and the tea party "Crazy Hacking of" <br /> <br / > Light doesn't exist .. " "Many things happen in the dark or semi-complete, which may be the same," the author-director "(I use loose words). David Tibor tried to make a strange scene with the slave ... but the results Laughing if they are not pathetic Have some nudity But it has such profound qualities that it actually acts as a sexual inhibitor I can go on forever and unjustly with the horrors and flaws of this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> For the love of God, avoid the wreck of this train. I know that despite (Or possibly because of) my negative comments. You may also be tempted to see if this trash is really bad or not, as I claimed to be .... but believe me in this matter .... More than I have said, and you will certainly regret it positively. (And expenses if you lose money to buy or rent)
