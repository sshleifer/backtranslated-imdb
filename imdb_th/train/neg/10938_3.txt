I didn't expect much about this. But still disappointed This is the least favorite Halestorm production I've ever seen. I think it should be a joke. But I just laughed in 3 or 4 jokes. Is it funny to see fat people eating donuts and falling down? What happened to the janitor in the heavenly scene? Fred Willard enjoys the collaboration of Christopher Guest But it didn't work They have to use the entire budget to make the actor "know" to appear in this story because there is no budget for lighting. It seems to be filmed with video cameras and most scenes are very dark. It takes a lot of film to show someone to actually see and shoot and make a basket instead of cutting out and fixing the swinging ball through the basket. I try not to criticize low-budget comedies. But if you want to see something funny with the real basketball game of the church instead of this movie
