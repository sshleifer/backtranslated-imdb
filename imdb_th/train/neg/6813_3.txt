Jean Rollin is ridiculous about the art of vampires, aliens and the pursuit of immortality. <br /> <br /> Women are beautiful and taking beautiful pictures. The dialog is inactive. It's a laughing story. Excellent to watch But is the appearance of a horror movie or any horror thriller that is purely scary I try to figure out whether we should be afraid or not. At the same time, will it enter? It is a strange combination of movies, art and horror movies that never get along well, and while it looks good, it never "means" anything, and it's not scary even if it has a shot or sequence Pretend to be a whip Something to leave in the background is a living wall paper for those who like naked women.
