... in order to not live in Montana and especially to not be there at the end of the 19th century From the movie standpoint Great scenery. Redford works well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story isn't good. (If there is a whole story) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the narrator / author who is who. The character is barren and narrow-minded, like his father, a preacher. Being pushed, not driving his own life, he was left to see his brother, who was imprisoned in the environment of a small town, also died The author never came close to the inspiration of his brother. But at least realized that he lacked love / a little fun All there is is a fly fishing which he followed even when the old man was the style of his father. <br /> <br /> The end is not surprising. No (3/10) <br /> <br />
