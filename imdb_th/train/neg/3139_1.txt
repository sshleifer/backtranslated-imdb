First of all, as a long-time student of the Titanic disaster and a member of many Titanic clubs, I feel privileged to comment on this film. I'm not really interested in receiving many awards and receiving this film award. But for me, it's still a very scary movie. Cameron has the resources to create a semi-appropriate 'documentary' film of disasters, but unfortunately chose to turn it into a romantic rice ball. The fact that there are many people around the world is falling because it shows only in my heart the sad conditions of tastes and common sense that film critics and audiences are today Anyone who says that every movie should have a hero and heroine fall in love. In fact, most of the actual events are nothing but romance and catastrophes from Titanic. I feel that it requires better screenplay and director with the least semi-documentary and artistic license. I almost threw the last order that the "dead" lovers met among passengers and crew who lost applause. Is this a genius movie? Ask yourself.
