The spirit of the ancient mummy was transferred to one of his followers so he would punish everyone involved in destroying his tomb. Changing the spirit makes the young man very aggressive until he resembles a mummy. One by one, the blood will be drained from the people involved in the excavation. <br /> <br /> To be as short as possible, the curse of Pharaoh is quite boring. While the film presents a few good original ideas (Mummy blood sucking, spirit change, make-up, interesting effects, arm tear scenes, etc.) and a few atmospheric moments, directions and rhythms are definitions. To make matters worse, the first 15 minutes of this movie, 66 minutes, the runtime is quite nothing more than an extension. I often go to see the slow moving mummies, but Pharaoh's curse also tests my patients. The actors helped very little. There is only one exception (Ziva Rodann is the only lone bright spot that requires the film to focus on her more mysterious characters). Finally, I do not know who has the idea of ​​having a servant who looks like a mummy in what appears to be a pajama. But it is a ridiculous and ridiculous story for a creature that should instill fear into the audience. <br /> Although my opinion is negative to Pharaoh's curse But I will give 4/10 points, not a good score to make sure But generous to all the problems I have with the movie
