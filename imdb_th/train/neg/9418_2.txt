This is a weak movie with a history of wounds and repeated names. It doesn't work at all. Firstly, the play is totally wrong. It moved very slowly at first, then rushed and was not satisfied until the end, but there was (and probably related to the wound) the movement between the songs that were uncomfortable. It starts with being a thriller that must be performed according to the face value. The ending may be funny, but it is blunt until I almost feel it insulting my intelligence (so little). So the movie tries to be everything. But without success at all levels You can see that in developing an unstable character, you almost get the impression. Connery has more than three roles.
