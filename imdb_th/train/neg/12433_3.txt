I like to give a short and simple comment, but it can be summed up quite well. You can't beat the two manuscripts for a number of reasons, including the ability to direct Chris Columbous. <br /> <br /> The film has a very bad governance. I can't believe that these people are actors. <br /> <br /> Painfully have to sit and watch. The story is a complete joke about the secret chip and the Russian terrorists in pursuit of trying to get it back. Awesome to rent the original trailer and enjoy yourself! <br /> <br /> This film was not arranged during Christmas as the original Home Alone was changed from a family comedy movie to Christmas time to a humorous joke or plot!
