I expect to have a French musical, B-Movie. In the end, Dhéry, Blanche, DeFunès is a low-cost French movie star at that time And it's color! But I have hallucinations in ordinary people 30 hours that are unbelievable like this The musical numbers are terrible and the comedies are boring and silly. What song? What song is just a continuation of bad numbers one by one? The only thing that is very rare about that is the nakedness of women. At that time it was not familiar. In fact, there were numbers there to show us women who had no upper part. It adds plainness! And try to find Michel Serrault, a great actor in the future of the French film in the musician's section. Good luck!
