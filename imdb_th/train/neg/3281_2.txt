I wonder if this movie is not good. I'm a Duke fan. On the way back, there are three years of TV series on the DVD. I was right, taking the family to watch. I want to see the general jump again and the chase scene of the scene is very good. But in summary, this film is a TV program with a very bad version. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson is poor. While I can honestly say that the original daisy dress is clearly revealed But Daisy Jessica Simpson's interpretation about Daisy is terrible. Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle have to roll in the grave as well. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money. If you are an old Duke fan and are really like me and my three children, you will be very disappointed.
