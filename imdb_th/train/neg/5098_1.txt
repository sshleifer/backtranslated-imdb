This must be one of the most exaggerated anime scores ever. And yes i still show "The End of Evangelion" and that also makes me hate more Not to mention the countless times of this show. <br /> <br /> I don't mind the psychology and philosophy that is not smooth, but Evangelion dragged it out in the mud like never before! Not many characters seem to be very interesting. The only thing that seems interesting is Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. In addition, most of all others are shy, losers. They have to go to the psyciatric center, not a giant robot pilot and an alien called "angel". <br /> <br /> Even the battle of mecha and aliens didn't help anything like this: <br /> <br /> "Well, there are these robots and it's really cool because they fall (!) when they get hurt. But they are not really mecha But was captured by angels, so sometimes They are crazy and don't do what the pilots want under the age of need and they have to be better controlled ... blah blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm very sorry but I can't recommend. Give Evangelion to anyone, otakus anime or not. For those who love this series very much, you are entitled to that opinion. I respect you. But for those who have obsession "Out of thought" to think that everyone will like this series. You are more selfish. <br /> <br /> I like "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run-Dim" and " Robot Taekwon V "by yourself
