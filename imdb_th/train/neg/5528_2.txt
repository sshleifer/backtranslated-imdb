With this movie taking 61 minutes and nothing good on TV, I decided to put the Revolt of the Zombies on the DVD to pass the time. Even while realizing the coming era, I was very disappointed. It starts with the strange quality of the opening score (what - no lamentation?). Then, the opening sequence is rather slow. Gosh, I think movies about zombies - even in the 1930s - will have some chills (White Zombie and Bela Lugosi). But this thing is not zero. (Except for a moment with a burning eye on the film to indicate someone's passionate affection), as well as the blunt King of the Zombies. But nothing more
