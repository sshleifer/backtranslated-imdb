How is it possible that there are no journalists or critics warning us of the similarities with Flemish films that are better than others? "Congo Express (1986)"? In addition, there are some characters in the Congo Express gathered together without any real relationship: Jean (De Congo), two taxi drivers. Of course, Tom Barman is a star, but Luc Gubbels isn't there. It should not be a reason to forgive the flaws in the script. (If there is a script) of the wind blowing. However, the joke (only one story!) At the refrigerator ice party brought from the great Flemish movie "De Witte (1934)" at De Witte with salt Too much on the potato Some accidents occurred in the movie. But there is no explanation. After that, Tom Barman sent us a movie here, which is more like watching television than movies for cinemas. Another opportunity to miss out for the Flemish cinema.
