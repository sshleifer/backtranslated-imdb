I'm not sure that the HK movie that other reviewers are watching, but Enter the Eagles is nowhere near the peak of HK's actions. Michael "Fitz" Wong would be glad he was able to work in Hong Kong because he couldn't. Can leave the wet paper bag in English Shannon Lee looks good and is a great fighter. (Even better than a leg fight than her father) But her acting skills are less common. In fact, all English dialogue boxes (90% of movies - more than Gen-Y police) were so bad that I switched to the Mandarin Chinese sound system to spare the misery of delivering bad conversations. Subordinates, of course, have the right gunfights (but nothing we have never seen before) and good movies. But the magical visual effects make the action worse. <br /> <br /> Saying it is worth the price. Watch Shannon and Benny "Jet" Urquidez go. It's amazing and almost worth watching other movies. <br /> <br /> Finally, you may notice some scenes that seem "familiar" for You, especially the firing point at the outdoor market (think of Matrix) and Fitz's diving from a helicopter wearing a black dress (think MI: 2) guess that someone thinks that at least something in this flick has ripping off.
