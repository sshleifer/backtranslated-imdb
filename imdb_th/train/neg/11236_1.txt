As a former resident of Kalamazoo who is fond of this city, I look forward to watching this movie. But very disappointing! Although performances and production costs are not bad But the script is scary. The plot is unrealistic and the theme is disturbing. <br /> <br /> The main message of this movie is that women are not children. I can hardly believe that it is in view. Of women back Is the writer under the rock? <br /> <br /> Although I enjoy seeing my beloved city on the big screen But I don't want to recommend this movie to anyone. It's scary. It's a shame for a city named after
