I don't know why it has fans to do, and I don't know why I even give my scores. This is unusual. There are many giallo that have to stop unbelief. Let the picture roll up before it is raving and some poor police officers have to explain what we have finally seen. But this is a very rare occurrence and there are too many sequences that have nothing to do with nothing and nothing to do with it, while we have to listen to the soundtrack repeatedly even in Italian standards, not Giallo. The perfect horror presented by Klaus Kinski in his most famous 'phoned in' performance. I think he came back to work a day and went out of Mr D'Amato to let others fill Ewa. But not enough and finally we saw her appear too much After we lost interest in this unconscious twaddle Maybe I'm not in the right mood!
