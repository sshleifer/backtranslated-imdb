The film version of Sandra Bernhard's solo off-Broadway performance is a pretentious example of gasp Sandra spoofs, acting lounge and superstar. But her sarcastic feeling is interesting and funny. Her fans will say that she is honest, disgusting and that may be true. But she still shrill with the undaunted bravado on your face that is not suitable for movies of this type. She doesn't want to make it good - and she doesn't go out to find friends - and that will ruin many people in the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway, her content here still lacks. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as the producer and although not directed by him Bernhardt co-wrote the script with director John Boskovich; Their most bizarre touch is to make the audience in Sandra's house look completely disgusted - the feeling that many viewers often share * 1/2 from ****
