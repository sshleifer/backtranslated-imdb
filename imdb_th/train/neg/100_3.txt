OK, it's not the best movie I've ever seen. But at the same time I can sit and watch twice !!! The story is terrible and in the first part of the first story, I wonder what the hell I'm watching. But at the same time it was terrible. I like it. Price is always laughing. <br /> <br /> Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this film, the only thing that disappointed him half way. He stopped calling his foolish name. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is quite perfect. Saw it in the pound land following it
