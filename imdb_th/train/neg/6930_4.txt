Dr Tarr's Torture Dungeon is about journalists traveling to a crazy hospital to write about the new techniques they use with patients. However, the reporter soon found that things are not what they seem to be and the hospital is being operated by the patient and the doctor in the cage. First of all, some parts of this movie are boring and make you want to fall asleep and the interesting part is interesting because of the wrong reason. (The person who thinks he is a chicken) I have to admit that this is really good, but the movie exploded. The music of this movie is really strange and like what you will hear in a crazy and funny movie, there is a scene about a guy dancing a chicken which makes me want to close the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Rate: R for violence and nudity
