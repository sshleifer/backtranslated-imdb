The real irony is: Joe Basser is a leading comedian in other situations. Away from the Stooges, he has a definite history that is very funny and clever. Moe and Larry and Shemp really know him or at least for many years and Like his job And what happened when he joined forces as "The third stooge" clearly has nothing. In these "Stooge" era shorts, most of them are usually not boys, are dealing with other people or Joe and the other two, and this is not the etiquette of the precise stooge. "The only one for everyone, for everyone, for everyone." One of the great comedians is Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, The Marx Brothers. Whether they try to take advantage of each other or slap each other when the real chips are down. Come to help each other There is nothing happening here. It's almost like watching a dog fight while others try to cheat others or be cruel and don't like jokes too. Some people may think that there is something behind it that happens here. Art imitates life. It may be why Besser didn't stay with Moe and Larry for a long time. Just look at the history of the other team and tell me I'm wrong.
