While we all know that Hollywood enjoys changing the historical activities for our entertainment and 44 minutes is one of Hollywood movies. For example, bank robbers never returned to the bank when they started filming at LAPD, but in the movies we saw them back in twice! Another example is the number of LAPD officers shot near the end of the film, far from the truth! But of course, Hollywood must have a good end to bloodshed, so they add more blood and internal organs. There are some events and many leading actors playing, but this is what Hollywood has done. Why should you complain? I guess the only sad part is that I watched a documentary about North Hollywood shooting in TLC that is much better.
