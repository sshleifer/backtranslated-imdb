This terrible bad trash looks like a racist racist class, insulting and incriminating at one time while pretending to be chic and sophisticated. Brutal performances, playful screenplays and boring directions make this film clear. The two scenes were particularly disgusting - the scene where Schaech scratched his tongue after being kissed by another man. (It can be really bad) and the scene in which Eastwood is kissed by Schaech's best friend who pretends to be Russia. After he left the room, she begged "f ** foreign king"! So much for you as an artist who has a dream to live in Paris!?! <br /> <br /> Jonathon Schaech can be a cute actor on the screen and looks amazingly good. It is a shame that he did not learn more from working with modern gay director Gregg Araki in the previous film and trying to salvage the film from the descent to the gay pattern that is gay
