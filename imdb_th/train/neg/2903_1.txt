Oh dear, this movie may have sub-topics. "When the writer hit!" What a pain. I have a very high hope for this. After reading IMDb's reviews, which makes me wonder about the entire IMDb rating system, but that's a separate story. Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, Office and so on. So I expect great things. To say that I am disappointed is to say the least of the year. There are many things that are unusual in this movie, but I will limit myself to (a) the unbelief of any family that behaves like these people (Large aerobic exercise? Please be a murderer of love please) and the fact that Dan's character is disgusting. You find yourself wondering what the woman sees in him that makes her fall in love with him? This movie is full of conversations that are full of creaking creations, ridiculous scenes, and it is slow, slow and slow. We will walk out after half an hour if we are not with my parents who do not go out and don't want to lose money. Which is different from the creator of this film, which is better to throw all the money used to make this movie into a fire If you like movies, avoid this like a plague.
