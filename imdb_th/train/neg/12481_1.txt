This sword is the magical story of the horrifying and terrifying "hero" that defeats the evil king, worthless, almost every detail. The performance was very scary from bringing to a supporting role. The sparkling and sparkling vocals which the director showed that the blood of the hero's blood was extremely disgusting. And was not redeemed by any justice for his cause because he was not as good as the people he fought The editing of the movie Z has many, including the scenes in which the characters "die" from the blazing swords of the sword. <br /> <br /> The film is clear about the charm of actress Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, mostly naked round parades throughout the film As a 20 man, I will not pretend that the meat on the screen does not attract me. But the treatment of their characters is so degraded and the sex scene looks casual and unhappy that I can't even enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is mostly in this era. Little exchange With a light feeling that is comfortable on the cheek tongue (The sequel is better in this regard) But DEATHSTALKER seems to be serious about the heroes' imagination completely. No way! Avoid all costs! <br /> <br /> Score: 1/2 from ****
