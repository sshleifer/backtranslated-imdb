Wow - this one, I will summarize as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Count the 4 innocent invitations back to his castle. A bunch of nothing happened for a long time. Some softcore sex scenes are weak and not erotic. Some girls are beheaded (off the screen) - end <br /> <br /> The only thing that will happen to this set is the dress and the clothes that look good. That was unintentionally funny and a few short shots and convinced me - those things were not enough to exchange for the 90-minute boringness that the film was In fact - the best part is to start from a distributor with cool goth chicks that are full of blood and show their nipples - and again - this is not worth the admission fee for this garbage. As others have noted - the title of this film is completely ridiculous - because there is no absolute blood sucking and no dance in the movie at all. It may be called 'The Goat-Raper Leads the Circle-Jerk' - and at least it should have a better name related to anything in the movie. The correct name is probably the '90 minutes of torture '- another charming story that is at least true ... for honest audiences - examples on the disc show all the best parts. (And I use the word 'best' ... very much), so I suggest watching that instead I can't imagine anyone who likes the destruction of this movie. Please get my advice and leave it on the shelf 2/10.
