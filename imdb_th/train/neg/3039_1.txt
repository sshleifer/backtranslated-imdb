I can always tell when something is going to be attacked. I see or hear it and feel good. I do not feel good to see an example. I am not enthusiastic about this movie, and I am not surprised that this film will be ranked as one of the 100 worst movies. In fact, I proved it. <br /> <br /> The first thing that disappointed me is the name Not that I have problems with ebonics (I'm a black person) but for movies, they may use better names and this time use names that don't have bad grammar. I hear the dialogue, see the show, and all I can do is do it together. <br /> <br /> I still think that the dance theme movie is too little. Even the accompanying song didn't excite me.
