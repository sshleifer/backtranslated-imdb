I watched this movie for 2 reasons - I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor people were forced to make beautiful dumb movies. I like the idea that Dracula is the spirit of Judas Iscariot, who was reincarnated because it describes every contempt of Christian things. But there are many camps that this idea is not very aware of I see that this movie is the way Gerard Butler has the ability to pay his fees before being truly accepted and the way that Christopher Plummer In legend to warn the public I enjoy the special features on the DVD rather than the movie itself.
