** Spoiler packed ** <br /> <br /> I heard from many sources that this movie is a contentious issue and the ending of the story is very scary. What I didn't expect was a complete change in the transition. It took about twenty minutes. What started out as a cowboy / western India, in general, suddenly entered the 'funny', boring romance about Honus (Soldier Blue in the role played by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen), who escaped. From the attack of the cavalry Most of the movies focus on two people that are not compatible, so it is a romantic comedy. Donald Pleasance shows up and kidnaps them both without really clear reasons. They then escape. Came out and they separated (separated) at the base of the cavalry on the day before the base attack. As Cresta had married one of the Cheyenne's chiefs, she escaped the cavalry base and joined them. As usual Then the ending After an hour of poor performances, they would not be together in the story. Then the movie changed to being the most exploited in the execution and the child shot in the head. The similarities can be drawn with Wild Bunch at this point of the movie, but Wild Bunch keeps the same sound throughout and doesn't use violence deeply in some ways. Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry, my last summer. I did not hate Soldier Blue and did not find the end that was particularly disturbing. But just found it very boring and the ending was unnecessarily violent If you want to watch movies that are incredibly innocent, I recommend Elem Klimov's Come and See.
