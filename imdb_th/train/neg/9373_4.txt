Martin Caulk's special talents bring confidence to his character towards the frustrated artist. He imitated his conversation with a strange feeling of realism, making the sculptor Marcel a reliable person. The character can be a real person and not a villain. General B movie <br /> <br /> The story is not about writing at home and there are many boring scenes. What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as Creeper. Kosleck's talkative philosophical style is different from Hatton's low-priority monosyllabic method. Creeper's characters do not develop beyond The basic monster level, but Hatton introduces the possibility of not developing and makes you wonder about his back story. <br /> <br /> This movie is in Shock Theater a lot when I was So children, I have some nostalgic love for it. For those who like horror movies of the Forties
