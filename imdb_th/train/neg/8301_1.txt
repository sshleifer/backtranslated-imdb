Really bad. Why do everyone think this is a good movie that is funny only is the true mystery. I like comedies as much as the next man and I love "A Christmas Story". The fact that it has the same director and depends on the memory of the same writer makes me completely puzzled why. This film was completely failed at all levels. Charles Grodin was a cunning person as the father of the beginning. Again, it seems that it doesn't have the same rhythm. But it didn't flow well It seems that everything is tired and forced. The joy of life that permeates the first part of this film is gone - you just want the movie to end. I don't even want to recommend this movie to those who are curious about being happy with "A Christmas Story". It's terrible. 1/10
