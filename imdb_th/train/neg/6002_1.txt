"Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat" is rubbish. The acting is terrible, the atmosphere doesn't exist, and the characters are not interesting. The only thing that is scary about this piece is that most IMDb users give. No doubt, there is no violence. Bruce Bell ("The Evil Dead", "Intruder") is completely wasted. Supporting actors are terrible. Yes, some people may like this image, especially the main society, but fans. Difficult horror or b I don't hate fun with this nonsense story. I often hate horror comedies. I like watching horror horror movies like "Cannibal Holocaust" or "Last House on the Left". Indeed, it should be scary, bloody, and too disturbing without having stupid humor, which often destroys all ideas. This thing is not scary, not scary, not funny, not funny. Don't waste your valuable time.
