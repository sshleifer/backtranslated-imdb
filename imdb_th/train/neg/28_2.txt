This movie is terrible. You do not need to read this review further. If you plan to watch it, it's enough to say - don't (unless you're studying ways to not make good movies) <br /> <br /> The show is awesome ... Amateur hours at serious Throughout the movie, I thought it was interesting that they met someone who spoke and it looks like Michael Madsen just to find it really him! New low for him !! <br /> <br /> Terrible story. Those who claim to be original or good may have never seen a good movie before. Even according to the standards of Hollywood action movies, this movie is scary. <br /> <br /> Don't watch !!! Go on a trot instead - at least you won't feel suicidal.
