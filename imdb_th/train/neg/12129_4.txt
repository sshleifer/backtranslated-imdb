Before this film, I watched two movies only by director Andrea Bianchi: the reckless film of the zombie Le Notti del Terrore (1981), which is famous among the horror fans for an unforgettable performance from Peter Man Bark and Giallo. A fun Strip Nude for your killer. Both movies are not particularly beautiful movies. But both of them enjoyed their own special style. (And the fact that they focus on having wounds and nudity does not cause pain). However, the massacre is boring, boring, even splashed and has strange spots of naked flesh. <br /> < br /> Stories about many ongoing murders in hotels, actors and teams The horror movies that were filmed during their filming were confusing and oh-boring: when the blood didn't flow and the skin didn't appear, this movie was a really tough battle in the ride (I spent four attempts on Ending) With the endless scenes of different characters quarreling among themselves and taking notes very little. <br /> <br /> The only interesting thing about this movie is Lucio Fulci, the creator of the film. The movie uses many death scenes to Preparing to release his big movie, Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare concert), and if you have ever watched that movie, there is very little reason for you to be massacred.
