I think this movie is a drop. I expect it to be much better. I'm glad I didn't pay to watch this movie and I didn't sit in the cinema for this. How to start with this movie, acting on this movie, on average, bad humor and the overall story of this movie is not special. I think this movie should be a good story. But it's not just a magic story I think acting in this movie is terrible. There are no actors in this movie. There is chemistry. But it wasn't there I think if we have other actors playing Kirk than Jay Baruchel, it might be better. But all the time I watched this movie, he looked tall and I didn't feel that he wasn't acting in this movie. Now Alice Eve works very well as an actor. But there is no chemical reaction between her and Jay All actors in this movie have no names and have very little impact on this movie. The humor in this movie is not funny. There are a few torpedoes in this movie that are ok. But there is nothing to say to your friends that they will understand. I think Jim Field Smith had a difficult time with this because he couldn't decide whether he wanted to love or be funny. I honestly think that he wants to adhere to Burger King ads. I think this movie should be better if the writer goes to another director. The story of this movie is like every other hot girl. Just agreeing a boring love story. I think it would be better if it has more originality. I will not advise anyone to see this movie honestly. I think you will get more entertainment from the dentist in this movie. So help yourself to escape from pain and not see.
