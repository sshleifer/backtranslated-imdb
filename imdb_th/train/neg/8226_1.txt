Knife Baboons, mentally handicapped people will have better choices than them and will scream less while doing so. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that have a grainy image, the amateur camera is intended. Work (my 92 year old grandmother used a camcorder that gave better results). The sound is not very good and there is no separate story / storytelling. So this is your ideal movie. Also, please note that you should enjoy the following: women scream without reason In fact, reason and logic do not appear much in this film. For example: "We have to go to Stephanie." "Yes, I can't believe I'm talking to you like last night." "She called you last night." "Yes, you want to talk about. One day she asked, "" What, she came, didn't tell me "? While our friend was chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and a terrifying weapon But I have a problem with the fact that she didn't tell me that she was dating. <br /> <br /> Okay, low budget. That doesn't mean that you have to make it look like there is half the cost of the budget. The 'score' is interesting since all - except for one song written and performed by the writer / director of the film itself. In fact, it appears that all budgets have been blown in the follow-up sampling by The Duskfall, the metal metal band from Sweden. <br /> <br /> The most worrying thing of all in this movie is the episode. Finished We have possibilities for the sequel.
