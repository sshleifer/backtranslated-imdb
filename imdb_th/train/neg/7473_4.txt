My husband and I are intrigued by this phenomenon - a committed Southern woman with a busy private life helping to fix crime for LAPD. The first season is something to watch TV for us. Unfortunately, the story of her personal life in the second season became boring and unworthy for the strong character that we stopped. <br /> <br /> My husband and I felt embarrassed when trying Hide from you Mother, the fact that she was handcuffed But the destroyer is when she hides the pregnancy from her boyfriend. But told her boss Why would a strong middle-aged woman do these things? The answer is that she won't. In addition, my husband and I chose the bad guys with almost perfect precision. It is usually male or female white, introduced in a pendant in a scene or in a quiet family. Can script writers not do original things from time to time? As already mentioned, we are no longer the audience. We like to show that do not betray the character and insult our intelligence.
