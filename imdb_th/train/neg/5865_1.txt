I said nothing bad about the wreck of this train. It was one of the few movies that I was tempted to walk away. It is a bad evidence to start with the first pregnant person. But then they tried to make it a fake What are they forging all real pregnant women? This is the worst movie I've ever seen. If it has enough points, it will be at the lowest level of IMDB 100, if possible to be zero
