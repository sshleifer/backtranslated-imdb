This film was created badly from every angle except technology. I stood up and watched everyone walking out of the theater. Their faces disappeared like their lives flashed in front of them - the eyes that walked to their neighbors wondering whether it was just them or not. I mean, how does this movie be bad? No one will accept it as the classic case of The Emperor Wears No Clothes. "Who am I to question the movie with a man stopping a jet flight?" But the truth remains the members of every audience. People are thinking of what I'm writing now. I actually mimicked their faces. <br /> <br /> Clearly, Lois was motivated by the power alone. She wouldn't drink coffee with Superman with glasses that didn't stop the jet. Could not look into his eyes for the depths of his soul or that kind of thing in the old Supermans. She had a certain level of relationship with him. But it strengthens her character, saying that she "lacks". I bet that Henry Kissinger will win this Lois before Clark Ken. <br /> <br /> And Now it is official. Kryptonite has done with Superman in what eating at McDonald's is doing on average. <br /> <br /> Superman "One" He lost his father from Then found that his true father, the story is attracting every step He is a human. He relates to people and he feels love for others. He is related to high school students. He deals with people who feel different. He related The Superman Returns. It seems that Superman Returns is only related to Superpeople and it seems that he only "works" when he saves the lives of people. <br /> <br /> There is something about Clark that Lois likes. She really loves him Accept it and when he comes into the picture as a superman, it will cast love on the rocks Without Superman, she will fall in love with Clark. (At least that's what the movie will point out, whether it's intentional or not) Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and Superman. Clark is like a pony horse to Lois. Indeed, <br /> <br /> Superman two, I just watched it again. When I was a child, I thought, "I enjoy acting. But now I know that it's a story that makes me the same. If I see Superman Returns as a child, I will hate it too. I think <br /> <br /> have minds and spirits and many magical powers that will Walking in this movie, Superman surrenders his power for love while the world plot is running and at the same time means Lex Luther has something amazing on his sleeve. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN THREE now has The title, about the love between the three. And Clark has only humanity that wins and Clark's inner nature overcomes Superman's power, because when his supernatural nature is gone and he is SuperHUMAN (who does human things with superpowers), she sees that it is not power. Of Superman that she falls in love with SUPERpowerman but SUPERMORTAL, the person you love - and who is really awesome And when she told Clark that she "liked" him for Superman, he was happy, he connected with humans again He wants to be recognized as who he is, not just the ability to bend steel. This is the type of missing thing from Superman's return. <br /> <br /> Clark sneezes the most to help children get attacked - humanity again. It also takes advantage of the special power of interest. He not only uses brute force. <br /> <br /> He crushed coal into diamonds for his women because she had to sell her. Love is the only thing that makes He uses his power in addition to saving lives. <br /> <br /> It seems that there is nothing to win in Superman Returns. Even in Superman Three, we see the damage caused by the plan to rule the world. Nemesis .. We see We see how it affects the Pryor and others and how the people in the middle of it do not have any damage. Emotions from Lex's plan to sink the US We saw a crystal being thrown into space .. Superman must have a lot of creativity in the three superman to stop the plan with him. He not only "accesses" his superpowers. At first he had to stop two missiles that would go in different directions and then destroy the universal documents and erase the history to save Lois's life ... (This is thirty years ago !! " ) In the second second he must Smarter than the three men he is more powerful But when combined with the genius of Lex and the immoral tactics of the villain, Superman's fight is not enough, he has to work with others and defeat them ... in the Superman III. Enough to win .. He must be smarter than a computer that calculates everything he sees. He cannot use aggression on the computer because it is calculated in advance, so he must use gentle acid. Users will Became dangerous to the computer after the computer responded to the invasion and he found that acid earlier when he was unable to use his special powers to blow the fire because it was a chemical so he had to use his superbrains - He couldn't hold the water, so he froze the lake and left it on fire. Now, in Superman Returns, he just hurls the island into the outerspace like the temperature. UPS did not need to bring back for what he had just used. His "strong power" and Lex Luther's brilliance showed the level of contemplation of the junkies that had just been rubbish. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the truth. That he threw that island into the outer space In the bloodstream and sticking to the spores of kryptonite dropping on his face But he faces his nose and eyes as if it were not Poupon Gray that he looked at
