What a wonderful thing: movies about the Berlin Airlift. It should have everything. Tragedy. Suspense, friendship. Competitors Berliner Frauleins and strong US pilots. Love and tears What we get is a movie that is not mentioned above. Heino Ferch tries to imitate John Wayne or more. But he failed miserably He serves the wood, so at any time he should be broken. He tries to play as a strong man instead of a strong man! Why does Bettina Zimmermann's character fall in love with him? Because they threw stones in the lake? Because he brought her bricks? SFX is doing well Too much though Hundreds of aircraft on Berlin. Looks like a fleet of troops instead of a systematic airline? actually Interestingly, the Kremlin White House and the General Office of Lucius D. Clays seem to be the same set of dark and dusty scenes. Notice the same curtain hanging down the window as if protected from a nuclear explosion. Why almost every scene in the dark and dusty? In general, LUCIUS D. CLAY came in a short period of time, unstable. The generals who trusted in his noble thoughts He is very contrary So you blend each mistake together and the result is a movie that creates passion, no doubt and without precision in the past. Sadly, it started to be very promising?
