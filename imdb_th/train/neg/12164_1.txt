This movie is not good, the first one almost sucks. But there is no real ending to make it worth watching this movie. There is also zero fear, tension or suspicion. This is not the most horror movie. Don't show anything. There's nothing to say about this. It's almost a TV, except for scandals and violence. The performance isn't good and doesn't make me start. The conversation for the ending was surprising. No one thought it might be worse, even though I didn't see it. However, again, it is less than 80 minutes, so I guess it's good. It feels a lot longer. Obviously this is a cut version of the movie. I find it very cheap. But it's not worth it. If you want a more uncut graphics version, look at any edition of Anchor Bay edition. This version of the Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers gets big fat from me. 1/10 psif you watch this movie, you may Will be a boring and unhappy camper. If you are a real fan, you may want to get Anchor Bay's Sleepaway Camp (with survival kit) that has the first three discs with the first three movies. special feature
