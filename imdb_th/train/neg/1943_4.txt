It's such a bad thing! This started with interesting mysteries and interesting characters. Admitted that it was moving according to the speed of the snail But I still catch and watch. David Morrissey is always worthwhile and he is a good leader. The Muslim side is very interesting. We were tempted by the connection of possible terrorists. <br /> <br /> But Morrissey's character was killed and the air dropped the balloon. The last episode is boring, boring, boring. The whole thing turned out to be a very small beer and the decoration was unbelievably unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Five hours of my life My advice: Look at the dry colors instead.
