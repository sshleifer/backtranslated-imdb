I have no real expectations in this movie and I am glad. Although I expect it to be bad, I would be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where to start? First of all, I think that 15% of this movie consists of a stock of scarecrows still standing in a dark pasture. I understand that there is a scarecrow. I think the name "Scarecrow" is enough. <br /> <br /> Two things that have never been explained about scarecrow and paranormal events. There are too many times that I will leave WTF? <br /> <br /> Thirdly, this movie is very serious. I'm all for the movie B with a bloody tank screaming for women and unconscious violence that results from simple bugs or ancient curse. But those movies often know that they are B movies and even waving it like Dead Snow (Scandinavian, Scandinavian, Hilarious) or Evil Dead 2, but this movie seems to be forgotten by the bad. Bad Should be more blood and / or nude Yes i say If you have horror movie shit done with killing And if you have one semi-hot woman and one semi-hot woman, you must show at least a cowardly <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, skip "Scarecrows" and just poke your eyes. You will thank me
