I have high expectations for this indie that has read the reviews that thumbed up .... <br /> <br /> Here are my additional 'two cents' to the reviews posted. Already excellent 'Lost in translation' Location: Morgan is stuck in a small dusty town where he meets Scarlet, a cute person who works in a local supermarket. Can Morgan help raise a cute red color from her trash life? <br /> <br /> Realistic dialogs? No. How about shopping in goals First, Freeman looked at Target's interior as if he was walking into Harrods. He then stunned the t-shirt rack to confirm that he had never been to any lovely shop. With Scarlet Morgan being separated. Out of all aspects of Scarlet's reality and showing the joy of ignorance of everyone and everything in the life of Scarlet. <br /> <br /> One reviewer liked it. Red scene In this case, she wants to attack her old body. Freeman ran away to get her protection .... No ... He faltered with disbelief and couldn't handle her blunt story very real and very sad in life. <br /> < br /> Freeman's character believes that car washes and fitting shirts reveal a new key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS is 'endless talk on stage'. Freeman's every aspect Scarlet's reality is reduced to one or more levels related to Freeman's experience. <br /> <br /> Freeman has the right to emphasize that Scarlet is a child in the future ahead of her and then Looked over the brick wall that she saw comfortably: no education, no skills or experience, white collar, support and a lifetime of low self-esteem. Scarlet learned life lessons from Freeman when: Bang Kho Paid $ 100 for T-shirts and revealing it may open the door to a lack of education and skills, her white collar. In the end, Freeman presented Scarlet a little more than a strange diversion with the 'star', despite not paying the gas for the death of Scarlet, returning to her unaltered life in the city of Freeman. Don't care
