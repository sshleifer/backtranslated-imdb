I often comment on the most horrible movies on the market and the tragic White Noise serves only to reduce my belief that the film industry is still trying. I was surprised to find myself getting more and more tired when the plot was wearing and my constant induced headaches increased. I found that White Noise was nasty beyond our best efforts. To suppress unbelief Even after seeing Michael Keaton's painful test that had been tortured, I was undaunted by his death. Until the credit that I waited diligently for something - of substance to connect me with the story of the character But such relief never happened Of course, there are times when the heart stops occasionally. But just because of the loud noise, usually doing so with the sleeping audience. <br /> <br /> While the performance is weak, Michael Keaton may show his oldest role to date. Perhaps the only ransom quality at the White Noise is to capture the dramatic images in both the Keaton abode. Overall, the white noise left the insidiously depressed concept that the dead were trapped in the world That is protected from three dangerous shadows
