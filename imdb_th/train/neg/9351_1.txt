This is just the second time I stopped the video / DVD. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to have the film benefit from the initial doubt, though it is both shallow and repetitive. ่า .. and ruthless, plodding and pretending <br /> <br /> It's like After School Special directed by a strange ninth grade kid who thinks no one understands him ... creepy and sad Only the most deceitful teenagers will consider poetry ... and sing some parts and ... not really. The suffering of poor children ... <br /> <br /> Enough, clumsy and insulting Clockwork Orange ripoff and I'm talking about singing? <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen. But of course I felt compelled to sit and watch. I do not recommend anyone
