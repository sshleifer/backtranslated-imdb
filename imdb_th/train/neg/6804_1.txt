This will be one of the 5 worst movies ever created. The plot looks interesting like Passenger 57, but with the movie behind it works much better. The plot is handled in the worst possible way. Just a few terrible moments in the movie, the flight attendants stood at the door of the 747 plane and tried to close the door without being sucked 250 miles per hour. After that, the plane landed from a few miles, starting at 8000 feet, which is impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. When on the runway (Frankly, of course) She was ordered to pull the female penis out. HUH !! Come to the flaps to make sure the lift at low speed when on the runway, you use the engine's reverse thrust and give you maximum power! I can make a few mistakes and mostly about movies. But then my answer will become the size of the English dictionary This is a movie that you want to miss. Take my words!
