This movie has a lovely debut. I truly believe that I am one of the best romantic comedies I have seen in a certain period of time ... There is something "foreign" about how Movie and mysterious settings, but then the story became more unrealistic to say that the ending was CORNY and PREDICTABLE, almost the end of the speech ... the most romantic ending that everything went together. the Good for all the "cute" characters. The scene in which the main character realizes that he made mistakes and chases. "The woman of his dreams" just to confess her love for her in front of the crowd who sympathized in the end, winning the 'good man', 'bad guy' loose ... You get a picture of waste from the movie. interesting
