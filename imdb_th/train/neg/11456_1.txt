This is one of the movies that made you think: Hulk will "the real American" Hogan do the same? To be honest, I didn't think so and he was right. I am Italian. I cannot be proud of my country for many reasons. But I will not be able to paddle for another team (For example, France) because I love Juliette Binoche, besides the protagonist, do not fall in love with the English girl at the end of the movie. But with women friends in the countryside, so why have to row with Yale? As far as there is concern about acting, every player is doing very badly. And you know that I hate the atmosphere of "Dead Poets Society". In fact, it's another movie I hate.
