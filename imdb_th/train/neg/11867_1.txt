I don't think it's possible But I found the film worse than 'Body Melt'. This movie is really bad! And what makes it worse is other Australian movies. <br /> <br /> Shoot what looks like a VHS and with a terrifying 80s soundtrack. It's even worse, which is hard to Believe When seeing how bad the starting point (White man hung on top in white tomato sauce, spraying anyone) <br /> <br /> And why are their accents changing? From the word New York, not good to English, as hypocritical and pure Aussie! And it happened to all the actors! <br /> <br /> The film also claims to have won some film festivals on the cover. (I believe that it is the Utah Film Festival). This would be a lie because no one in their right mind would name this for anything (Maybe a golden raspberry But I think it's too bad for that) <br /> <br /> Come with them! This film must have the number 1 at the bottom 100 !!! It will be ten times worse than that in those movies. <br /> <br /> Well done for the creators of this movie "Trash" to prove that there is no reason to watch movies ..... 0/10
