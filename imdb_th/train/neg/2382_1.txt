There are movies like "Plan 9" that are terrible. They have a charm about them. There are some things like "Waterworld" that has a drawing that cannot be explained as well as a car accident. Accept that you love cowgirls. There are no redemption of these. The actors that are gathered are capable enough to make almost every point of watching and from what I have been told this book is very fun. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad. how Beginning with it, it seems that the director collects various names without binding anything other than what will be brought in 20 days. Then tell them to imitate Kevin Costner for the best. Open the book randomly and start shooting what is on the page to make sure that the vast area of ​​America is not interesting in any way. Finally, give a job to fix your sister-in-law because the meat packing plant has just terminated him. He has twenty years of cutting experience. <br /> <br /> Now, this movie is the basement for me. It's terrible. It's not good for being a bad person.
