I don't think it would be possible for a horror comedy that failed both aspects ... really scary. The fact that it wasn't serious. (Usually a good story) working with it primarily because the actors are very woody. You will swear that they are reading the queue card in the end ..... MST3K version, as always, has a little laugh ....
