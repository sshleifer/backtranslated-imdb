I just saw this at the Venice Film Festival and couldn't decide. We were never allowed to approach enough characters to pay attention to them. Maybe that's the issue that we all are in our own "bubble", but these people don't force me to worry about them or be shocked by the fate. In just one hour of work, the characters are not well developed. There is plenty of time to shoot factory equipment (forklifts, conveyor belts, shovels); And baby dolls that look a little creepy with surprisingly realistic eyes that most characters that make a living are more interesting than ordinary people Interesting experiment But never came together ever
