First of all, I want to tell you that I am a cartoon, anime, animation and other things. It is true that everyone has their own preferences. But you can trust me in this movie I will be the target To begin with the story - it's okay to follow the story of the comic book as far as I'm familiar with, but the animation ... uh, it's not really bad. But it is cheap and moderate It would be much better if they didn't try to imitate the anime style and stick to the original drawings of comic books. If we pretend not to see rare sloppy effects such as lights and lightning, you can tell that this movie was created about 10 years ago and more. Looked a bit like the Vampire Hunter D from 1985. Let's look at the Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 - 4 years ago. They created movies that looked much better! In addition, the sound ability does not do anything outstanding. The music is nothing special. So overall - it lacks atmosphere. I watched it, but I can't tell if I really enjoyed it. It doesn't catch you There are many blood and violence. But that didn't impress me. It can be a shocking thing for people who have never watched more mature animations and saw cartoon blood for the first time. (Is there anyone?) But I don't think this is the audience of this movie. So they can add a little nude and spice around the chicks. Lucifer is quite tasty and hell. We have Lady Death by ourselves! Has a little sexy look But not enough Instead of Bill Brown's song, I think it will look better for the hard track / heavy metal sound. Conclusion - This movie isn't that bad. But if you want something better, use the original Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 metal, Ralph Bakshi Fire and Ice or maybe some wizard and of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
