More sad than downs. The story is quite good. I mean nothing unusual. But it has a different story from other modern horror movies. I'm not saying that the performance is good because it's not but all actors / actors are hot and charming First minute or more The rest is quite boring. (Or you might consider that it increases if you want) is too many nude pictures. The 4 girls are naked for a few minutes and everyone shows their butt for a long time Not that I am against nudity. But this is a horror movie, not 'The Dreamers' Or are you a big fan of Debbie Rochon more than this movie for you But if you are looking for a good horror movie away
