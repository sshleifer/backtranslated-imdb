So start with beautiful old houses in the country. You have a group of people who are asked to come to this house and (not surprisingly) the caretaker locks the door every night at night without a clear reason. Anywhoo, people laughing, jokes, etc. This Dr. tells a terrifying story of women This person and some children They were afraid they started to feel things. Oh no, women saw ghosts. Some people say more, this big ghost came in, etc. This woman knows that this ghost killed a small child. She did it. But oh no, she died as she did. And go to heaven while this evil demon goes to hell Two people survive and escape from the house. The script is terrible because there is a man cut off the head and Elanor (the person who died to save the children) said "not true". The performance is a wooden effect is nonsense and the scene is a double room that is used repeatedly. Then again In general, if you like to laugh at movies that do not look good But if you're looking for fear, then definitely make this movie miss. I'm very disappointed when I watch this thing. Very large reduction, my sister (those who have been holy easily) get bored in this film. It's scary.
