One more insult and slap in every man's face The comedian's weak effort is nothing to suggest. Once again, we have an attractive 'straight' hero that shouldn't make a woman interested in him. And we also presented with gay friends 'Sympathetic and attractive' that is actually a bald, obese man who seems to be the leader Although I didn't find him that attracted attention and I was an ugly gay (But not bald)! No matter what the ability to perform, here may be left in a bad chapter and there is a truly horrible direction. Mr. Sneecker should be banned from the movie. But then he is no different from other hackers working in Holly Weed.
