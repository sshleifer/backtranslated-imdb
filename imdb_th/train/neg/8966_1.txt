The original "Cube" is an excellent B movie that is full of paranoia, characters with superior texture and performance. It's creepy, mysterious and cool. And it stands perfectly perfectly on its own without having a foolish sequel like "Cube Zero". <br /> <br /> The third movie (!) In this Cube series has been Part of the new casting (Most of the traps in the hospital will be sadly recycled) which is partly anomaly. Must use the courageous steps to explain that the cube is something that was never revealed in the first film - but because of the impolite explanations that I wanted to keep secret There is an interesting reference to the society that exists outside the cube. But they never developed except for advice about political dictatorship, religion So a little social opinion that feels smooth and pointless. <br /> <br /> How does it work? Performances are purely amateur hours, slow pacing (This film consists of two interested people watching the screen) and gore effects while the rebels fail to persuade. In short, "Cube Zero" reminds me of the "Cube" fan club, which is a clone that is messy and complex of good movies that do not need the sequel.
