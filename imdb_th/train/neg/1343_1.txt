We bought this movie from a shop called Poundland. We are looking for more inspiration when we previously bought a new movie "No Big Deal" to do a new test. <br /> <br /> We expect this movie to be very inspiring However, this is shocking. Boredom is the keyword that comes to mind. Bad characteristics and not enough scripts to make you look. It seems that the main woman's body will be criticized at the right time in a pathetic effort to keep the audience interested. However, it just makes you wonder if they made her budget to take off her clothes? If so, I will request a refund! It looks like a homemade movie, inconsistent images and camera work as an amateur. It makes our bad movies look professional. I can't believe that this thing is being sold as a marketable product. <br /> <br /> It's boring and pleasant to see. The actors are not good and do not have professional skills about this. There is no word that explains how scary it is.
