My opinion is not related to the political feelings found in the movie. In fact, they are quite consistent with my What makes me the fact that in terms of movies, it's silly and without any form of story, motivation or dialogue. Perhaps some people should tell O'Neill that the replacement of the lyrics of the songs that failed to inspire those outside the audience is less like creating a motivating character to speak. The stupid narrative remains like this, despite the symbolic heritage of Neal Young. The most innocent scene is the scene where the demon dances into a slip tonic bar with an unsuspecting hero who finds his way to the dance floor. A young song with a heroine who doesn't know what is happening either. They both dream of a project that they will go up on the west coast in search. Sorry, Neal is stuck with the song and let the movie create with Steven Stills.
