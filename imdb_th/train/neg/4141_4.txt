Well ... This movie looks fun. The main problem of this film is the fact that it conflicts with everything that most vampire legends follow. Like a vampire walking in the sun Although there are some parts that make you enjoy the way the society creates movies. The scene where the vampires were stabbed and screamed "Oh, this hurts ... It's really stuck." It seems that there may be missing scenes But you get used to it for a while And have a continuous dream that does not help the plot Think about it. There is nothing reasonable. But I just had many friends and watched it twice to get full results. Think about it. The fighting scene is horrible and the zombies look fun. Slowly when I write more, I like this movie more. But you know all that you can't expect Schindler's list. But it is a fun clock
