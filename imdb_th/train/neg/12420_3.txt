There is not enough here. With a little funny point But not enough I'm very disappointed because I love stupid movies. I expect that this will be a hidden gem. It's not. It's a hidden uproar. <br /> <br /> All the time I watched it, I was thinking "Geez, I can do better than that and I am. Stupid people "Don't believe some good opinions. I got them suck I don't have laughter at all Maybe this is funny or cutting-edge in 1987, but for men it decreases every day This movie has a contract. But it didn't deliver it Maybe if they write a few more times I can't blame the actor. They are not the best. But they didn't do much work This film failed because the writing was flaky. SORELY was disappointed.
