Sarah Silverman is a cartoon "Taste of the Month". Actually, is she now worth all the ads? Yes and no. Sometimes she is fun and hilarious. (Sometimes she is quite interesting Sometimes you feel that the media is being cheated because there are too many people. She is one of the really cute comedians that men flock to, especially saying that they dig her intellect and wisdom. But if you make a corner for them, most people will admit that they just want to sleep with you and that's why they watch her. She reminded me of why many men flocked to Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, although both of them are not really "hot" in terms of popularity. Sarah does not drink or smoke (at least cigs), so she should be hot when she is 60, so her boyfriend (Especially men) can rejoice. <br /> <br /> For this program, it is very much like her jokes. When it works, it is hilarious. When not so, it was boring and full of boredom. When AIDS is the best here It's funny and constantly has some good words in it. The character of Brian Poeshn has an unhealthy passion for Tab at the same time, and it's hilarious when he sees him in a T-shirt, but they never go anywhere. Also, and finally, it is not happy. Sarah's character in the series is quite annoying. The gay couple (Brian Poeshn and the other guys) seem to be arrested and have never done anything for the overall performance and the players. Support Looks like you) will be ok when the jokes affect When they did, they were scary and I mean really scary. In addition, there is a fascination with coprophilia here (poop jokes) which seems to change the true wisdom and intelligence in the joke today. So should you watch this show? If you love Sarah, try it. You can stare at her and pretend that you are yours. For her performance, it has from good to absolute zero.
