So Steve Irwin You have to admire a man who not only But willing to throw himself into the river, apparently filled with crocs, snakes, lizards, poop tons from such reptiles and mud, not just every day He never made ME want to do it, but he tried to bring his wife closer. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't fall into my parallel universe in the movie category - movies for people who just have. Their teeth are pierced, have migraines or have no experience with movies, so it's like a quiet normal person. (Currently there are many Disney movies) It's too loud. Steve is too noisy. He is happy all the time and will cut through the blas adolescent (I heard now: "The movie is very stupid") or Tylenol and Codeine. But if so, I would have a room full of snakes and that still didn't happen. I agree. They are beautiful people. But I'm still not raising animals. <br /> <br /> The plot is definitely predictable. The bad guy is one minute. I think I bought something at an electronics store. But this movie is full of animals and Steve and Terry, which is why I watched it. That plot (If you call it), there is more reason to throw another crocodile in the truck. My expectations are low and still like that. <br /> <br /> I hope there will be a small sequel that Steve and Terri (acting in acting skills) have movies with. The real story and other animals that have hair, I still do not believe that we will not see Steve anymore. I hope Terri and the children will continue to participate in the Australian zoo and at least the discovery channel. I can't imagine seeing a crocodile without the members of the Irwin family. Some people tell me actively how great it is. Crikey!
