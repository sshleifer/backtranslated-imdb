OK, I recorded this program on TV and missed the very beginning. This movie has a title for about 10 seconds, so if anything happened before I missed it. <br /> <br /> A lot of people say that Mark Hamille is in this story. I don't see him at all. I know Clive Barker, John Landis and it is obvious that Stephen King acts very badly as a cemetery keeper. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige looks cute apart from the scene where she has a cat-up face. <Br / > <br /> Despite the launch title But never clearly explained what a sleepwalker is or where it came from From the title sequence, I think they are two bipedal creatures that live by pulling life energy from humans. I think they have lived for a long time, and especially these 2 may be their last one. <br /> <br /> Raise the incest for sex. (Yes! I think it's a suspect.) Cat, killer and invisible, and you have a sleepwalker. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible story that has no real explanation behind the two main characters. And hijack too much to try and distract from the simple truth that is not enough Explain to the audience. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
