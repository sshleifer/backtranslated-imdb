Things that were boring at the beginning of this story in jazz science fiction written and directed by Spike Lee <br /> <br /> Bleek Gilliam (Denzell Washington) is a jazz trumpeter born at Below, the underdog, his problems, including the incompetent manager, saxophonist who walked on stage and the two girlfriends he played with the couch The true love of his life is his trumpet and music. The band's manager Giants had a dangerous gambling problem and proved to be an ineffective negotiator with greedy club owners and probably the best juggler, but Bleek remained loyal for as long as possible. It will prove his cancellation as an artist. But supporting his growth as a man. <br /> <br /> As Bleek, Denzell Washington is wrong as an ambitious trumpeter with each baby. He is too cute to be the person who has the center of his own art, paying patience and loving the people near him. In a far away place, he lacks the power. Anderson, who plays the saxophone, should be more suitable for this chapter. But even though he had to speak softly, leaving Lee's busy conversation As a giant, Lee met Tripira with a great performance to match his writing and direction. A loose effort to reflect the terrible Ratso Rizzo But sympathetic to Joe Buck of Bleek. He used limp and even moments "I'm walking here" from the Midnight Cowboy. In this case, you want the taxi to run to him and complete it. <br /> <br /> Lee's script is a hot argument, heavy ribs and The insulting scene between the backstage members and the rehearsal, without sparks and striking in grief by Bleek, a giant dialogue with advertisements and circles. To accomplish this imitation is Lee's pretentious image style. Tracking the zoom and pan image is wasteful and doesn't matter to the scene. They roam <br /> <br /> The blues are Lee's love letter to jazz. (Implied by the mountains of memories all over the scene) and it is a trap that claps that are sensitive and lacking love. Jazz music on the film served by Tavernier's "Round Midnight" and Eastwood's "Bird" beneath the surface, revealing the other side of the pain pattern in the back, in addition to presenting excellent performances. At the end, Gordon Spike Lee Joint does not offer even a little buzz. It is a fairly poor folk.
