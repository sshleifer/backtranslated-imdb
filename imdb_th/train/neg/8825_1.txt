The only reason for making this movie, even being the only star, is the ending that makes me laugh. I have high hopes because I tend to like horror movies during the bad holidays. But this is not qualified In fact, it is a bad attempt to slide the character slowly into insanity, which is not a bad plot. But not doing well here, there are some scenes (such as the ending) which are not intended to be funny But actually made me laugh out loud. There were a couple of times when I thought that this movie would go in a really interesting direction but never fill what should and should be. In my opinion, if you are looking for a dab of Christmas, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
