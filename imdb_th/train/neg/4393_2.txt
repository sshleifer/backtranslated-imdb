I don't like Frosty coming back and this one Both films are ridiculous with badly written characters and bad sounds. The sound can be done, but Frosty rewards are worse than this because the snowman they are incompatible. Frosty's warm winter land is great and is a warm drama. The only good thing about this film is that Frosty, a snowman, is like a 60s classic and a joke like when they are talking about things that are not true. he does Written badly and moved poorly and I barely got the plot. I saw a DVD at the library about 2 or 3 years ago and the artwork looked crappy, so I didn't pick it up this year because the back image looks impressive. But i play this movie It's a character, a bad art, as well as a DVD, and it's a scary story about what happened. I watched it at night and found it boring that I slept in everything. (Wait, I always do that when I watch something while I go to sleep), but this movie is boring. Overall, <br /> <br /> Overall rating: -C level <br /> < br /> This is another special holiday that is not good in returning to superficial in the ice and this. This is the 4th sequel, not as good as home alone. 4 Good. I think the movie is ok. But only one house 3 is great, but it's like a bad house, only 3 and 4 people who hate this way My sister didn't look so much because when she came into my room to see 2 and a half minutes, she walked away like "I hate animation!" I agree with her, just like Frosty, 3rd time. Scary, ordinary!
