Another Priyadarshan / Vohra flicked another movie that was seen for TP more than the actual demand. The only reason I saw this movie was the fact that the regulars were not in this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others) but didn't need to. Say me There is low expectation from this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm happy with the casting process in general, except for Rajpal Yadav that makes me annoyed again without limits, but he breaks out some laughs. In fact, this movie is like playing dhol. I mean, it's hardly any ability to make loud sounds or even play strange good rhythms on a dhol for a short time ?? It is only those who can carry different strokes in a long, continuous manner that is considered excellent. <br /> <br /> Which leads us to other musical instruments. Dumroo hardly needs any talent. And it might be fun while dancing monkeys (Well, it sounds like Rajpal Yadav, a good comparison) but it's not a tool that will entertain you for a long time or even let you dance like Dhol does. <br /> <br /> This movie is Like dhol and dumroo that are playing. Sometimes Dhol plays as a dumroo, sometimes both together But mostly at Dumroo playing alone and dancing monkeys And just like those who are 24 years old, faster than I will be bored. <br /> <br /> This movie has a good time (good) Dhol, but soon after that I heard the annoying Dumroo (fun in First) Large, regular parts ensure that this movie is mostly good for funny clips in "MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (If you haven't watched it in Filmy, it comes in the evening and is quite funny. ) <br /> <br /> This movie has a period of time. Show works well except Rajpal Yadav (who can show I've ever seen in Main Meri Patni ??) annoying than entertaining. I've spoken many times and I will say it again. I think Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a good career before them. In many celebrity comedies, <br /> <br /> Some funny scenes. Really Like an attempt to cancel in order to impress the girl's father, Zany tries to find a woman and take her away. <br /> <br /> But after this, ended there af. One of the more mysterious ways to make this movie, which means that when the girl comes in 45-60 minutes later, this is becoming more and more tormented. The top spot is "SO BAD ITS BEST." I mean things. At he Think that if you have to stress until the end, at least try to make it delicious. <br /> <br /> This movie is very difficult to predict. There are scenes that you can't predict and you won't blow the sound. Natural laugh Here it is like you saw it and almost started to laugh before closing the mouth. <br /> <br /> The film follows a gradual decline throughout the movie, except for a strange collision up or down and then falling. Fast once <br /> <br /> One of the worst scenes, the story ends with the movie trying to be more than a comedy-themed movie, and reeked of the latest 10-15 WAS redundancy. Only DISTATEFULL and COMPLETE this SPOILS. MOVIE. <br /> <br /> I didn't find Tanushree Datta as the siren that she played and her acting ability was in serious question, especially in her view. Not tempting if you can't It's hot and can't show how long you can survive. <br /> <br /> Technically, this film is weak, with constant gazing at women and dim light, and the camera works. <br /> <br /> The song, except for the title song, is not good as well. When the song played in the second half, I can feel gaping from the audience. <br /> <br /> In every movie that Is common only because actors and <br /> <br /> Avoid it. It's not a good idea. <br /> <br /> And if it has to be watched on TV for free or at a very cheap price or have something. at If you pay the full multiplex rate, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> - Many jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, last 45 minutes and last 15 minutes, especially technically, bad music. <br /> <br /> +/- Try more than that. Is not a regular actor (I'm more than happy) Tanushree Datta <br /> <br /> + Good scenes for the beginning of the title song, good performances and actors except RY. <br /> Total 4.5 / 10 (I try to be a target here. I don't like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie fulfills my expectations very low, so I benefit all the doubts in The exact vocabulary, this movie is not more than 4)
