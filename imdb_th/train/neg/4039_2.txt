There are two types of characters in SHIELD: those who try to do the best that they can and do the right thing and those who pursue their own interests unceasingly and commit everything they can in While telling yourself The heroes and the only hope of everyone More than other programs, The Shield is about hypocrisy and self-deception. Unfortunately, the hypocrites and self-deceivers are heroes in the show and have an immunity that is unlikely to be overcome or captured and they come out over and over again. <br /> <br /> This item has a great camera. Leadership and fading are always excellent. It is a work of art that must be viewed. Unfortunately, the story is a situation full of humor, violence, rape and lies. <br /> <br /> Every hero who dragged down with him in the plan that failed after the plan failed. Comic characters often escape and make fun of Elmer fudds (everyone who does not support him in his lie and crime) attracts good-looking women who automatically support the characters into the show. And always scraping your ears for reasons that torture your self. If another police detects something wrong with what he has done and someone is injured due to his actions, he often blames the suspicious police, regardless of the fact that his plans and complicated lies. And the plans that are always on the agenda at all times. <br /> <br /> Just like 24, this program is based on countless plans and delays to drag the story out each season. Unbelievable long-term stories will be sent into the story in each season to place a skeleton that will hang blood, meat in the wrong way, which is a corrupt act of character and inevitable concealment. <br /> <br /> Although the most frustrating is the writer's hubris when they try to change the audience's sympathy, causing the characters to become As that Sometimes they want us to see Shane as an enemy. Sometimes they want us to see that he is a poor misunderstanding. Sometimes they want us to see Vic as a dangerous sex generator. Sometimes they want us to see him as a poor man with a gold heart. Sometimes they want us to see the devil as evil and evil. Then they thought that if they showed her and sat with Shane, she would find that she was sympathetic and tragedy. <br /> <br /> This arrangement is not enough to get sympathy at They want. When they show that these characters destroy the lives of others by themselves. It's ridiculous to try to turn back and forth. But then it was ridiculous to produce seven seasons of these erroneous clowns that draw every super model that has on their bed and run an instant criminal organization from the police station under the nose of every. person
