Wow, probably a good movie, starting with Brittany Daniels. I think I'm cool. We're going back in time. But nothing This movie should be better if not for acting. I mean the performance is the most scary .. even though there are poor actors that have to deal with me, I think they do the best they can .. still really destroying my movie .. twins Is the only one that looks like Some acting skills .. This movie is so long to the startling conclusion .. All I saw in a movie about a low budget is worse. But considering this is an exaggeration with 8 movies that have to die because I'm very disappointed .. Some critics say that there are blood and things. I watched the same movie .. This is 4 out of 8 and until now there is only one good story ..
