Amazing. That's what you say if you watch this movie. Simple and amazing It's really amazing that everyone is stupid enough to spend money to surprise you that you can't believe what you see. That is my friend is truly scary about this movie. Some people think that it's a good idea to do it. <br /> <br /> Okay, this is another strange story: high school students. (Sometimes it looks like a college or not?) Is a prostitute for mothers living in a trailer park and a "mocking" artist who is ridiculed for him. "Different" Of course, this poor boy was killed. Finally, and this is the first part. His spirit has a scarecrow. (Which he was killed by the latest John of the lazy mother) then he walked around with killing the general who attacked him. Awww. <br /> <br /> Here is the details: < br /> <br /> Pros: <br /> <br /> - Amazing comedy movies? Although it is not something that filmmakers want to get drunk clearly. <br /> <br /> - Is this and the sequel on one disc in the Wal-Mart trash $ 5.00? So it's a little too expensive. <Br /> <br /> Didn't hurt it. Didn 't help: <br /> <br /> - Violence and blood are subcategories. One person was stabbed with corn cobs. <br /> <br /> - Sounds like they are trying to listen to music. But it is not really suitable for the movie and not as good as this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Bad and terrifying performance <br /> <br /> - Attack Again with sexy women, no one took off their clothes When it stopped as the main slashers of low eyebrows. <br /> <br /> - Ugly stories. <br /> <br /> - Scarecrows vomit one ocean to make Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger. Red face <br /> <br /> - The love story that is hidden in the standard, nowhere, and can not do well. <br /> <br /> - Some of the people who are killed seem to be randomly chosen? You never know who it is and then they are killed. And you just think they have to arrive. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The average slasher fare is very high, just a scarecrow killing instead of ?? Well, other shit <br /> <br /> - There is no place to be as interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky or even Angela from the "Sleepaway Camp" series, all of which is better. This cruelty <br /> - The worst conversation I've ever heard in my life. The script is burdened with the level of delay that I never thought would exist. I'm serious here. It's a step that is too bad. Don't understand me wrong, even if it's funny like hell. But I never heard anyone say much, even in "Slumber Party Massacre III". This movie made "Jason X" look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> - A man who killed a boy who became a scarecrow: Vic The worst ever The conversation for the pairing <br /> <br /> Memorable scenes: <br /> <br /> - The scene in which elementary school students debated witty: "Hey, go find small animals to torture. Huh huh. "<br /> <br /> Performances: 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Movies: 1/10 Character development: 2/10 Special effects / Makeup: 5 / 10 nudity / sex: 1/10 (no nudity, mother is a hooker, women do not wear bras) violence / blood flow: 5/10 (low quality, medium number) Conversation: 0/10 (very ridiculous, loud, exaggerated and painful) Very funny. It's terrible. My first score for any dialogue in the movie!) Song: 5/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> < br>> Cheesiness: 10/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Another one for people like me who like pure shit. Or who makes it perfect. Slasher movies are not a good movie at all. The laughing dialogue and the characters are not boring. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
