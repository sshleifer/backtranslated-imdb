I watched the entire movie, realizing the involvement of William Hurt, Natascha McElhone and Desiree Nosbusch. I'm glad I didn't have the idea of ​​Peter Weller's existence. At the end of the movie, I said "That is Peter Weller?" Would like to admire Mr. Weller for his outstanding work. Weller plays as the main character and his performance is the kind that I don't remember him. <br /> <br /> Overall, the plot is not good, being subpar, the scenery and the atmosphere is interesting and the whalers are amazing. <br /> <br /> 4 stars are possible 10
