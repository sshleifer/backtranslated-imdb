How do you get Disney? A wealthy Preppy girl behaves like a fool. Buy a bunch and get a lesson. Does Disney try to send a lesson to himself? Maybe while buying everything, should it be human? No matter what the mental analysis is, this movie sucks <br /> <br /> Girls want a rich party for a rich life. But the money disappeared and they had to use the riches to get the milk (yes milk) to hire workers. And the man who started, who seemed to be the person who spent money But the ending was dumb Webcam in the Cayman Islands huh? Not worth my time. <br /> <br /> But it's better than Howl's "D-" mobile castle.
