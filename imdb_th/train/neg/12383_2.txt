While some good performances - Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau and two Italian girlfriends think of it - this is a lame story. Unlike real people I found myself frustrated, uncomfortable, many times that it should be a joke. I hardly understood why the local newspaper in SF said that this is a good movie and wondering who posted an interesting review here on IMDb. Very disappointed in this movie and really crazy. I went to the theater to see. According to the wrong connection to Garden State, which is a funny, fun, creative and touching movie than this movie I must mention the emotional climax in the church, which is wood and numbers, which I almost left and some viewers in reality. Followed by a stupid climax at the cemetery, which I saw 10 minutes before it happened I don't like spending money useless.
