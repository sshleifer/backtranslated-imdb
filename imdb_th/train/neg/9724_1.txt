Poor Tobe jumped. He directed horror classic movies all the time. "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre" Since then, everything he has done is horrible. This may be the worst thing ... and that is very talkative. It's about a man (Brad Doriff) who has the ability to do things (and people), flare ... or something like that. Almost the original idea (Everyone remembers "Firestarter"?) It's a real mess ... Truly everything will be wrong! Pathetic performances (even Dourif!), Asinine scripts, loust production values, crappy special effects ... everything is terrible !!!!! Must not miss ... can't do with laughter
