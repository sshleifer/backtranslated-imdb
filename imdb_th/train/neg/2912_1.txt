"Meatball Machine" must be one of the scariest sci-fi movies that are ridiculous, scary and exaggerated beyond the expectations I have encountered. It's about the goodness of evil and the upcoming story, with the aim to entertain with a blood-filled context. Because violence is not terrifying and it doesn't make you struggling But the unreasonable bleeding and nudity is performed independently. The performance by Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka is the worst thing I have ever seen. If it's not enough, it's directed by a director who has never heard of Yudai. Yamaguchi This movie has everything. It's not good for bones !, A must see for everyone who is crazy about movies b !!! !!! ... Just: A fun and rare jewel.
