*** There may be spoilers *** <br /> <br /> If spending time in Tokyo is a brave experiment in which real-life actors receive movie pieces with the condition that they must be used. Powerful anti-anxiety medication Antidepressant drugs and antipsychotics (This is a classic psychiatric ward combo that allows patients to become salivating zombies). During the filming of this film is more interesting. Or if film production is another form of experiment in which all the actors are deprived of both before and during the filming, it is easier to explain Tokyo. <br /> <br /> This film is full. Actors who are lifeless and without energy In the scene in which a new husband is sitting on the stairs talking to his sister, he appears to have trouble opening his eyes. In almost every scene, he talks about his role in every part of the body. From the beginning to the end, his facial expressions were best described as "close to sleep". <br /> <br /> Don't worry about the actors who talk to others because these players can hardly say anything. Can come out Everyone spoke with a single voice, not laughing, not shouting, no strength. No one has enough energy to smile. The result is complete and complete boredom. <br /> <br /> And it doesn't help that the direction is easy and unskilled. <br /> <br /> Avoid this lifeless movie with value. All spending Better to see GREENCARD, which has a similar and charming plot and energy. Or for the story of the exotic love of Japan, see THE LONG VACATION, which has everything enough to get from life in Tokyo.
