Do not watch this movie if you value the mind. At the end of my overall viewing, my friends and I estimated that we all lost 5% of the brain during the course. The only person involved in the creation that is not crazy in the clinic is the designer. <br /> <br /> Most movies have bad taste in your mouth. Now I know that instead of feeling disgusted, this film has created hatred within me. I hate this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Some people may say that this movie is not intended for serious consideration, if only it doesn't act seriously. But it is like that The story is a warm, cosmopolitan Blade Blade-esque that merges with a cheap rubber band that is prevalent in a poor dinosaur movie. The conversation is not only ridiculous, but ridiculous but often painful. Whoopee Goldberg doesn't even try but George Newbern as the voice of Theodore Rex, like nails in the soul. And whether it is Juliet Landua by speaking English accent again or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as a Blustering Commissioner, you will sink into the incredible and growing disillusionment. <br /> <br /> Only for everyone Who desires to see the depth of ignorance that man may fall
