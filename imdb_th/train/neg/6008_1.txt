If you make a mistake in watching a movie before reading the book, please do not give up on the series. I bought my first book in May of this year, and I was almost finished. At Volume 10, I dare say that this movie is a junk that didn't make the series even justice while "Left Behind : the movie "Just follow the story of" Left Behind "(book), but the characters are not close to the correctness. <br /> <br /> Some examples: Rayford never made his feelings towards him. Hattie (He was about to go when he was informed of the disappearance); Buck Williams is a blonde hair, a magazine writer, not a TV reporter. Chloe is in Stanford and has many details in the book. Rayford wondered whether she survived or not. Buck and Chloe didn't meet until later in the New York meeting. Irene and Ray have never been 'In the book' but in the backward thinking of Rayford The road is full of shipwrecks, according to the joy of Rayford and Hattie, having to take the helicopter back to the suburbs ... etc and so on etc ... They are going to launch the third Please, even if you don't like movies, give this book a chance.
