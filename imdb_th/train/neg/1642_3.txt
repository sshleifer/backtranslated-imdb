For several months before the launch of this film that you see advertised in all types of publications, so I waited for the video to be patiently published to see what all the ads are related to After that I have to apologize to my roommate to occupy the VCR in the last half hour to watch the horror movie. It essentially failed because it was a movie with characters about characters that could not be redeemed. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (which only the quality that can be exchanged is she is Amanda Peet) you can't stand. This film is based on its dialogue, which is complex, delicate and rough. The only slightly amusing character is Eric, who is the only member of a group of friends who are already dead. The final rotation is designed to make you laugh with the three main characters. But to be inspired by the original Pete. Summarize the rental only if you are desperate or have a sense of humor.
