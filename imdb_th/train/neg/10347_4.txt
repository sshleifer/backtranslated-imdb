I just saw Adam having four sons for the first time and what makes me feel bad is that I believe the model used is Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons. They are close to four boys in this film. Warner Baxter, in the image of Adam Stoddard, talks about the family values ​​and traditions that you will hear from our 26th president, who does not have a formidable character in the characters of More TR <br /> <br /> Like TR, all of Stoddard's sons served in the First World War in this case, even though the youngest person would lose his eyes instead of being killed. <br /> <br /> But if the women come in All this man's house and interrupt things? That is Susan Hayward's work here. In one of her most prominent roles, Hayward is a morally young woman who flirts with a son, has a relationship with one another, and starts playing the third chapter. It was a pioneer in the beginning of the part that later brought Oscar to her in I Want to Live. <br /> <br /> I think with a powerful decoration style like Theodore Roosevelt. West and Warner Baxter Afraid to tell his father what happened Son and also their parents, Ingrid Bergman This is the point that gets a little silly. Bergman was introduced to us as a parent hired by Baxter and Fay Wray, a wife for their children. Wray died and Baxter experienced financial problems in the business. Bergman had to be released. She returned to France and many years later returned to the family when the child grew up. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can't believe that children need help at this time. Hayward was quite right when she confronted her that it was not a child who brought her back. At regular times, Bergman will live with her life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous examiners said that one-third of the movies that I have fixed. May be the cause of the plot hole that we have. <br /> <br /> It's terrible that Ingrid and Susan can't make other films together in the fifties. When Hayward is at her height and Bergman just Making a comeback <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason to see Adam having four sons. And I am willing to believe that there are many remaining grids on the cutting room floor
