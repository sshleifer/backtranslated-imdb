Don't watch this movie until you try to commit suicide. I think this movie could cause severe brain damage. The main character is Kevin, who is not a playful hero, not a hypocrite. Conservative, conservative, Kyle Dord, in a red shorts that likes to play sex on the phone. Daphne, a frightening young woman. The feeling of dressing and nick her boyfriend who is busy recruiting an army that can cause friction from anything. No, I'm not a bad habit. That's how this movie is done. This film is a movie that snatches too much of the Gremlins in 1986. Only you will not find traces of the gizmo anywhere. These Hobgoblins are released by Wimpy Man (I'm sorry Kevin). Make someone's dream come true. Come up and kill the victim. Yes, you guess it. - Finally, they end up in a striptease club where Amy's biggest dream is revealed - she wants to be a dancer! Watch me watch this flick through MST3K and even with Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot that create laughter from the train's wreckage. This movie and it caused me to fall from both eyes is not true but I hope I have I do not give you a plot anymore because it encourages me to drive through my brain. In addition, it is not like having a plot worth mentioning. They should put a general warning of the surgeon in this film.
