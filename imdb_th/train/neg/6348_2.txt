The most ridiculous nonsense The content is boring, boring, boring, and most actors will not make music in Allen's previous film. And in order to hear Will Ferrell that is not worth watching, imitating his Woody Allen pattern makes me hate the second rate (Even though it is mysteriously popular) Ferrell is even more. It seems that Allen, who is 70 years old, must fall when the clock rings in the new century. <br /> <br /> I try to take part. Really participating in the movie But it is impossible My snippet cannot be fired slowly. So instead of sleeping in and killing the afternoon, sleeping in a position where I got up, leaving my wife and daughter in the theater and going out to the car, I had a really good book to read again (George Bailey was excellent 30 years ago. "German") That day came out well, thanks to Woody.
