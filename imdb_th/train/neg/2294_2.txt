Paul Mercurio is bad after linking to the role of Scott Hastings in the Strictly Ballroom, which is the best movie in history. He found himself doing a lot of garbage. There are no characters in this film that are disgusting or hateful. The leading actors of Mercurio are those that you like to overlook and cannot be completely revealed. Big mistake in costume design
