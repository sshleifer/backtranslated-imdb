A list that is well collected in the serial killer category, unfortunately being trapped in their self-esteem in order to be truly satisfied. Willem Dafoe is great as a NYC detective who tries to track what looks like Mimicked by using art-killing techniques related to the Renaissance art, the same way that was used in the murders that he had modified many years ago. Dafoe's gear and they have great chemistry. (At least for a while) Other characters appear to bind two cases together easily. Clea Duval is a friend of the previous victim and Peter Stormare is an art broker / consultant to Dafoe ... that It is difficult to understand even though Stormare is not boring. The ending of this movie is especially disappointing. A quick look for Deborah Harry as little more than a neighbor of David Farr.
