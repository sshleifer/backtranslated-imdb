For me, the only reason for watching this remake is to see how bad and funny it is. No doubt it's funny and bad because I've seen "Voyna i mir" (1968). Will we start here? We go ... <br /> Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Pierre Bezukhov - Friends A little that lacks the depth of the original. Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Natasha Rostova - Scarecrow. Her image may not sleep. Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Andrej Bolkonsky (Compared to above) lacking Russian spirits and "Internal Fight" Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Napoleon is a rather impressive leader br /> The remaining characters are not better. <br /> <br /> Actors' movements and methods They look and speak often bad. They behave like modern EU citizens, dressed to wear a mask one day. Everything is cheap and has never approached the standards of our Russian men and women in the early 19th century. <br /> <br /> Great entertainment to scrutinize and entertain. We have a giggle in our office when remembering the modern products that were shown the night before on our TV. <br /> <br /> "User rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes) "- I guess many young people never watch our movies (" Voyna i mir "1968) or have strange feelings about the quality of "Tarantino-Spielberg" remembers the scene when our scout helped his friend turn back and shot the bridge to boom? Looks like the CGI explosion. <br /> <br /> There is no sense or no skill to create a better version of the novel that has been chosen correctly in our country. But I was happy to see the Russian remake of "Lost with the Wind". Hey, the director woke up and was busy with that instead of destroying our classics. <br /> <br /> Now back to common sense. The other thing I mentioned above is nothing new, even if it is exaggerated to die. <br /> <br /> To make foreign actors try to pass on to the Russians. time and time again. Of course, it resulted in a lot of laughter, especially Clemence Poesy, ridiculous and her dancing and singing made the Russian audience think: "It's so bad that it's funny!") <br /> <br /> To say something New. I want to talk about the pace of the movie. In my mind, this new model is very patchy. The lectures and scenes do not flow naturally - they stagger and pop up like in modern videos. Again, I have to remember our "Voyna i mir", which is very natural and the lecture is very easy, you just sit down and enjoy "go with the stream" <br /> <br /> I think Maybe the battle of Borodino is excellent. (To revive many shortcomings) but it turned out that it was not suitable for the war scenes that were filmed in 1968. <br /> <br /> There should be something good in this movie and there are actors seem to be trying Hard to complete all the tasks They didn't have a chance from the beginning. But they still join the "losing team" plus 1 vote for that negligence It makes the Russian audience feel uncomfortable - some scenes look ridiculous and ridiculous, even if they intend to have tremendous power and the actors try their best. Everything provokes compassion and sometimes - suitable for laughter. <br /> <br /> What I still like about this series is the last part of it. It clearly shows that everyone gets How is his or her salary and tax? In addition, judging from movie trailers, I think this movie will have adult sex scenes that will definitely kill the entire project. But fortunately it doesn't have such garbage And that is one of the advantages. <br /> <br /> "Voyna i Mir" is not "Harry Potter" and today even we here in Russia in modern times do not have enough crafts to be filmed correctly. I must say that the quality of our moral life is greatly deteriorated or not? Fortunately, there was a proper film screening during our Soviet era. The American version of the 1950s has been proven sufficient - we still don't have identity. There are situations that have been resolved. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (1 point from the beginning, 1 point for negligence and 2 points for the last part of the series. Thank you for your interest.
