My original opinion about this movie is just the words that sh * t wrote 2,000 times, although this is a very accurate review. But I feel that my criticism should have a little more meaning. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the lead actor. Her facial expressions do not change once in this film. She does not show fear, happiness or depression. Her body language skills came down enough to push her eyes to the left and right, and it seemed that she didn't know Jack. She is an angry person that I think has too much Botox. The lack of her facial expression in this film is beyond reality. But with a love affair with a leading actor who seems to be free from anywhere and makes them go out to the beach and fall in love within a couple of hours. My leading actor needs more attention than I have ever done, is the most mediocre and never makes me feel like he is in danger. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes the most ugly acting is directing. Stories and inaccuracies in the plot I used to see advertising tampons that are more structured than this movie. No character development, they seem to say and do things that I never believed to be real Snake on the plane But it was trying hard to flick the action seriously until I couldn't laugh. I believe that I now have a brain tumor from watching this movie and think of all the different ways I can use the budget and the cg team to create something superior. If I bought this DVD, I would smash the DVD in pieces and burn it to dissolve in hydrochloric acid for good measurement. Don't watch this movie!
