Just watching me and my better half couldn't believe it was scary and acting badly as it was. If everyone else thinks good, you have to be happy easily. In fact, I quit the night to see this thing. Completed earlier. But at least it doesn't make you cringe with bad performances and lacks the same old stories. Hatch hatches. I read a lot about this movie. Someone said it was good! Not scary, scary or back in disgust Your average "scary movie" must say, please don't worry about this movie. Get mary poppins. Now it's scary! Now I go out to watch a movie and see something more scary.
