I can't say that this is the worst movie of all time. But just because there are still some movies that I haven't seen yet! This must be the most deceptive attempt to create a movie forever! The director had the same problem with "There Will Be Blood" (although he wasn't that bad in that movie). The whole film felt like you were watching a guy trying to impress him. It seemed like he was sitting in his little director's chair and thought "How does the great filmmaker deal with this scene?" He just doesn't have it in him. I don't know if this movie will be recorded by a great filmmaker or not. Of course, the great nuggets that have been refined But nothing was ripe. Every scene that the characters were singing was the worst time in movie history. One on one, when we saw the characters singing and I sat in my seat. I continue to say that "Please, please, there are no people who are singing of death too!" Of course, a very big failure!
