Savage Island (2003) is a lame movie. It's like shooting a home video with very low light and scary acting. Not only the story and the script are pathetic I don't know why this movie happened. I saw the flicks at the time and what I really hate is the movie that makes me angry. This makes my blood boil. The situation is not as good as it should be. If I do a movie like this, it would be really short because "idjits" of those backwoods would not be in the picture. <br /> <br /> Don't be deceived by the shelter on D.V.D. I'm an avid movie watcher. But this movie cannot be viewed I'm not interested in filming movies in D.V, but if you do it, make the movie fun. Don't be bored with the great horror movie (sans Wrong Turn). <br /> <br /> I must not recommend this disc. If you find this in the rental shop, go through <br /> <br /> movies that make you really angry. Get automatic. 1
