Until this new season, I was a big fan of the 'little mosque'. However, the new season has been destroyed It's about being together to overcome prejudice. The new ruins, which are locations and show Christians in bad terms. <br /> <br /> I'm not either Christian or Muslim. But love to watch the show no longer. <br /> <br /> Just cancel and finish. It's not worth watching anymore. <br /> <br /> It may be recorded. But many changes must be made. <br /> <br /> Bring the old style back.
