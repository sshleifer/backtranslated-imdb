I don't know where to start. Obviously this is a television movie created, so my expectations are low. I was amazed by the overall direction of the second hour. But nothing happened before or after that seemed to be the color of the movie. <br /> <br /> And talking about the bad chemistry between the detective, the little parrot .. <br /> > I will go deeper. But this movie doesn't really deserve. Grade: D + (IMDB score 3/10)
