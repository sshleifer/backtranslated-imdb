Not that I want to be heartless. But this movie really surprised me During the whole movie, I was like ... uh ... what about this movie? I didn't get the animation at all. Probably this movie will be suitable for those who belong to the 1980s. After many movies say To be honest, I can't believe that this movie received the Best Children's Film Award. If you are thinking of watching this movie, I suggest you don't do it. You will regret. I'm not kidding. You will find that you are wasting both time and money as you go and watch it.
