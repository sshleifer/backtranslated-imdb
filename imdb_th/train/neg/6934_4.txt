OK, so obviously, ppl thinks this is a good movie in 1955. <br /> <br /> I pity the fool who still thinks that ... It's a complete garbage. <br /> <br /> The story is just ridiculous. The character is a ridiculous caricature - but this movie doesn't mean satire. I'm sure it will be a serious drama. <br /> <br /> Dean and people Others are too old for their role. Someone said Dean in this movie and maybe he could share with him. His character has a meaning of 16 or 17 or more. But Dean is a 24 year old man when he created this movie Saw him suffer and throw a little offense like a 4 year old boy ... it's pathetic <br /> <br /> Natalie Wood is very beautiful, but the first scene at the police station she Crying and lamenting unbelievable It creates a bad example for the movie ... and for the rest of it, you feel like cringing every time one of these bad-tempered scenes happens. <br /> <br /> It may be. It's good for time, but actually it floats. <br /> <br /> It's probably about Dean's death that makes the film's reputation too high.
