I will go to see the movie in a matter of minutes. First of all, people want to "prove" about Clinton's comments at Georgetown, which he claims the United States deserves a 9-11 attack. This is what Clinton said: <br /> <br /> "In the first crusade when Christian soldiers seized Jerusalem, they burned the church for the first time with 300 Jews there and killed all women and children who were Muslims on the Temple Mount. I can tell you. That the story still D have been told today in the Middle East, and we're still paying for it "<br /> <br /> We're still paying for? Whaddya means "we", pale, right? The Marines didn't invade the Temple Mountains. <br /> <br /> But in truth, Clinton never really came out and said that we deserve "9-11" as well as all the words of He, during his presidency, implies that we deserve 9-11. Just point out "truth" A, B, C and maybe D and let the audience assume that they must be combined to summarize. X. In fact Clinton's "facts" are mostly included in the guacamole. <br /> <br >> But that's the point. We're here to talk about movies, not politics. Unfortunately, Oliver "Captain Conspiracy" Stone made a movie. You can't escape his warlike politics. It was only a matter of time before he focused his paranoia and bitterness in the Reagan era and what better time when the dream of rock was almost true on the day that Reagan almost bought the farm. Unable to find any evil plans or plans in Hinckley's assassination attempt, he invented one thing with Al Hague. From a simple misunderstanding about the chain of constitutional power, The Hague transformed from a civil servant who should be resolved to be a crazy citizen. You almost expect Hague to rub his hands together like Montgomery Burns and tell Cap Weinberger that "Release the Hounds". Stone also accepts the most horrible person in Hollywood to take the position. Former Foreign Minister Richard Dreyfuss People you like to hate. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is ok. Moderate hovering below average Do not bother to rent or buy. Try to catch it with a cable 4 of 10
