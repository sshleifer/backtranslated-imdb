I watched "The Evening" because the actors I went to watch "Norman's room" for that reason - this movie was presented to Diane Keaton, Leonardo de Caprio and, Ariel Streep - and love every minute of it, like "The Notebook", even though it's a light chicks. And my feeling is that the performances offered by Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close, at least I find that sometimes, even the greatest actors cannot overcome things that are boring and easy at one time - a truly offensive content. <br /> <br /> Now I have no problem with the way. The structure of the movie. Actually, I enjoy movies that cut back in time to tell stories ... as long as one era shines on other things, but while Vanessa's character is on Sleeping on her and recalling the past events she felt "An error" is sometimes sensational. The part that shows that "Past mistakes" did nothing. In fact, it makes it seem meaningless in "The girl met with a boy, a girl, a young girl, lost a child." Fashion and in the most unbelievable, old-fashioned way, the wrong way. <br /> <br /> And from here it is Spoiler, so remember that you should continue reading. <br /> <br /> First of all, Claire Dennes is merciless. Not only will she not start similar to Vanessa Redke. Straffen as a young woman, she did not participate in the show at all. Don't understand me wrong. She's good at the right role - not just this, and Patrick Wilson has a wrong idea, even though he has the skill to pull it out almost. He should be more suitable when playing with Hugh Dancy - WASP, very confusing - and not the goal of sex appeal for everyone. He is quite WASP-y for that matter. Hugh Daisy? One note - "I'm a drunken man and wait until you find out why" and "Why" (I'm a wardrobe in a world that is sexually tolerant, so I have to drink too much and make my own fool in front of everyone. Which I know) is disgusting for me and the manner in which he died (As you know he will be because that is the only thing that can happen to the puppets in the fifties). So laughing, wrong and wrong. I almost threw my candy at the screen. <br /> <br /> For the modern part between Toni Collette and her sister, fear of her determination, her jealousy "Perfect life". Her sister wondered if she chose the right way to conceive her and the perfect boyfriend. (Which may be more interesting And meaning if played by Patrick Wilson and Ebon Moss-Bachrach seems to be Harris more interesting because of his dreamy eyes) - however, all these things were hacked in the 70's and 80's and in depth More than We have to show it again and all as if it were fresh and important. <br /> <br /> And above all, Meryl Streep doesn't even appear in the last ten minutes of the movie. All in the make-up of an old woman who hides many of her facial expressions. She is still good, but just because she is Meryl and Meryl can find a way to pull out even the silliest conversations under the heaviest makeup. <br /> < br /> So to make it easy, this movie has a clich√© in all Movie book "Really meaningful messages" and it adds something that doesn't have a truncated business again. With two hours and full of music "Lifelong, weekly film" that guarantees to make you feel raw. It is a complete failure in terms of "meaning" and "filmmaking." I give "3" just because Meryl and Van Massa <br /> <br /> Now, if everything you want from your movie is twadd le, then please set my opinion about "evening" and spend your life. But if you want to experience With The truly meant by actors and filmmakers inspired to know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all that nonsense place to rent. "Norman's room"
