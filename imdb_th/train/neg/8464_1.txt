I was following a terrible sci-fi / horror movie. I watched them since I was 4 or 5 years old, so I saw really bad things. But i deal with it I've watched a lot of SciFi Channel movies, so I didn't expect much. The movie that promised to finish it. Hope comes forever. I guess - or the victory of hope is more than the experience they say. Unfortunately this is a dog from the beginning and I know But like a butterfly and a flame, I think something interesting will happen. It's not.

Can breed with a man who knows that she is the queen of the worm and loves her for herself ... Oh, must I go? Please, I beg you, don't waste your two hours watching this thing ... Everything will be better ... Think of the worst, least fun way you can spend two hours ... it's better.
