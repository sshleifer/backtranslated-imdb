The cowboy's sympathy for the fate of nearby Indian tribes was wrongly accused of raping and killing the chief's daughter, leading to hatred and violence. <br /> <br /> This feature is fun to watch. It is impossible to thoroughly protect at any artistic level, horrible costumes and the fact that all Indians have white skin, obviously making it look like a live action cartoon rather than serious production. The media claimed that it was true. <br /> <br /> In short, rich nudity. (The real reason for this viewing) is good. Everything else is not There are better examples of both types. <br /> <br /> More interesting is The Ramrodder, filmed at the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and features not one. But two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who might be able to kill at this time, the color soda screen of the Pussycat Theater!
