This movie sucks The act was sucked, the characters were sucked, and the film as a whole was sucked. There are two threads in the movie that have not been developed and the audience has to work to think of what happened. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that it must be spelled out, but suddenly you find things. Happened and was said as if you had the slightest clue as to what they were. Example: <br /> <br /> The negative comments of the heroine about the hero The audience never showed what she knew about this man and how he tied to the death of her fianc√©. The audience is at the risk of the death of the least man. <br /> <br /> Suddenly there was a scene where many men were loading up and the machine gun that entered into other scenes. There is no explanation about the gun and the people who are with them. <br /> <br /> We give 3 because we don't feel that we need our time back. It's fun to talk badly while watching movies, so at least it will entertain us ;-)
