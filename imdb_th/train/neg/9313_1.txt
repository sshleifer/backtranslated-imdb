This is the lowest price horror movie I've ever seen. I am a generous person and I always love good horror movies. In fact, when I rent a movie, I look for a good horror movie. They are always good for laughing. Believe that I know. I have seen many people. But this movie is so scary. I'm considering closing it in the first five minutes ... which I should have There's nothing good about it. First of all, the introductory 3D camera A Aero crew is silly like the ending The performances and special techniques are terrible. Please, I beg you, don't watch this movie. You will definitely hate it.
