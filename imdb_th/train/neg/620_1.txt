I saw this recently and I must say: This movie is terrible. I watch crappy movies for fun. Scarecreow is not fun. Scarecrow is stupid. You have a very amazing villain who enjoys playing a terrible pin while he kills his victim. (Worse than that contained in this sentence) He has a story of the misfortune that he used to demonstrate his killing. "Everyone chooses me, I'm the only woman who thinks I'm not a trash trailer like a man who chooses me. I want to kill everyone. Wah." OK, I'm exaggerating. But the evidence of this film alone is enough to be placed near the bottom of the crappy movie list. <br /> <br /> In addition to what I have said, the mother of the child is diverse. He and Her current girlfriend received it. The mother's girlfriend told him to go out. The boy refused to insist that he would not leave his own home. The boyfriend chases the child to the corn farm. He killed a child in front of his mother. She shouted with fear. His girlfriend was like "OMG! I didn't intend! "Then he told his mother not to say anything to the police about it. Although the child was killed under the scarecrow Like any child who was murdered under a scarecrow, he returned as a killer, a scarecrow with a vengeance. His victims "Never had been stalked like this before ..." (Scarecrow's official tag line) <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this movie was filmed in 8 days, valid for 8 days. I will give this movie 2 because even though it has itself, it has one or two redemption moments. (They are spoilers, so I won't lose you if you want to see this shit). I may be forgiven for bad actions, terrifying special effects, abysmal scripts and bad cameras. But I didn't respect that effort. <br /> <br /> This film isn't as good as I can make it possible. If you want to see an example of how to make a movie or if you like watching movies that are not as good as I do, you should take risks yourself. Others should stay away from this film safely at all times.
