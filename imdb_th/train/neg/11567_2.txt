I decided to watch this series after seeing endless advertisements for the BBC the week before it started. I watched it even though I didn't like the falsity that Alan Hollinghurst wrote (apologizing to his fans, but I think we had the case of the Emperor's new series with the work of this author). It was shot out beautifully, and I gave it reasonably entertaining - however - I found that the story was very thin and after watching all three episodes, I was dissatisfied with the shooting that was quite empty. Las Vegas gay sex 'clear' the media about it on TV before - many times - so I am afraid that nothing very startling. Full score for production value But low for the story / content I'm afraid
