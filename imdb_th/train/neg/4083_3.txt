I saw this movie when it was released and my dissatisfaction with it was stuck with me over the years. <br /> <br /> This is the reason: <br /> <br /> Goal Greenaway seems to be shooting every picture in Tempest and making it a character. If the character must say "My heart is flying." We will show the true human heart, along with the wings of the pigeon stuck around the screen. <br /> <br /> This process is done for a lush tableaux but eventually The exercises are simple and it is very boring. <br /> <br /> I'm not happy that other viewers found in this movie.
