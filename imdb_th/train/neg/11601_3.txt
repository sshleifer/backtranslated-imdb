A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth installment in Nightmare on Elm Street series and the worst sequel ever in this series, worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I'm lucky to get Nightmare on. Elm Street set the DVD box for my birthday and I watch all sequels. The children of the dream were undoubtedly the worst. I was also surprised because they did very well in the next two seasons. But I think they lost charm. The story is just a mockery and I'm not happy with where it went. Alice became more annoying. She wasn't Nancy or Kirsten, so she held the movie for herself. It didn't work for me. Freddy also lost his fear. This is just an idiot. <br /> <br /> Alice is back and she is carrying her child. She is not happy with her life. But Freddie returned and he wouldn't be too light for her because she easily beat him in the fourth movie. However, he needs her child and will be born again in the world. Have you ever wondered whether Freddy has a parent? That's what A Nightmare is on the street. Elm: The Dream Child Seeks and soon Alice finds out what Freddy's childhood is and that it may be one thing that defeats him. <br /> <br /> A Nightmare on Elm Street: Dream Child is just a movie that is not good and is an insult to the series. I don't think anyone will be happy with this sequel. Just really stupid. I mean, it might work. But again, it just proceeds in the wrong way I know that if you are looking for the sequel to Nightmare in the Elm Street series, you should watch it, but I don't really recommend it. It's not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> 3 / 10
