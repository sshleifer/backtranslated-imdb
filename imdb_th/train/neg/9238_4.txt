Comedy movie, a synopsis that may make feminist teeth modern in modern times. The department store clerk, Betsy Drake, fell in love with the idea of ​​a baby and marriage by pinning her hopes into a woman's magazine until she spied on the victim in the form of Cary Grant. The rest of the film is one of the tricks to continue as a non-stop duck. Seek her mines. I guess the word "energetic" is just about the sum of Drake approaching the role. She has a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of remembering her dentures, I started taking overdose. Grant's role is secondary and erases his normal abilities. However, there is one scene that almost salvaged this slender exercise. Drake asked Grant, who was unlucky after his lecture to many noble women. Here, she is energetic, refreshing, really amazing and has no production, rubbing our nose in an upbeat smile for 90 minutes. The movie may have a greater amount than the dream of a girls' camp around 1948.
