Another Friday the 13th ripping, despite some of the songs! A group of young people gather to gather at a small high school and start killing Jason Warhees. Is it possible that they had been tortured in the school? <br /> <br /> A slash phase is a fun game for fans of the genre and has a normal T&A quota for movies. The ending is somewhat more imaginative than your standard slasher. <br /> <br /> MPAA: Earn points for violence / blood, language, sex, nudity and the content of certain drugs.
