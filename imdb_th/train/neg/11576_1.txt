Saw the UCSB festival of celebrities and shocked who won the Golden Reel. I'm not the only one considering that the audience reacted to this piece. I think there are many other flicks that are better. But then I learned that the judges were heavily rooted in the areas of film theory and other vocals, while filming and editing were similar to many other shorts. Storytelling Is not more than the average student It seems that the movies of "serious" students need to combine one of these categories: sex, intellectual struggle and finally suicide - Nick and Kate come out and combine all three stories together. Please be more original. <br /> <br /> Oh and it may be my outsider's opinion. But the guy from the montecito sounds fake. Does anyone else like that?
