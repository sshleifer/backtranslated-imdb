"Gone With The Wind" is one of the most popular movies in history. It is a movie that is loved by mothers, grandmothers, grandmothers and close friends who watch movies every five years. Like a zombie movie, it explodes. There are no shambling bodies in the eyes and it's very light in the gore department. On the other hand, "Zombie 3" is large in the corpse and has blood - so it's better than "Gone With the Wind" Not overestimated Most investigators do not get lost as garbage. However, it's not a boring garbage. After the terrorists stole the virus, he dropped it while being tracked by helicopters and chemicals leaked into the ground. Terrorists, who have been exposed to a nasty mix, hide in the hotel room, where they gradually transform into carnivorous zombies. One of his first victims was a cleaning lady. When she was bitten, Lucio Fulci's hell brand came out as usual. For Fulci's flick, the show was brutal. The story was filled with holes, the plot and the blood were plentiful. It appears that the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, so it describes the nature of schizophrenia. It was shot badly, poorly fixed, and the sound design was quite flat. Even so, it still survived the adherence to horrific murders and impatient walking. Definitely worth it if you are an incomplete person or don't like "Gone With The Wind". No doubt the worst zombie movie of all time.
