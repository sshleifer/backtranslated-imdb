Yes, in the 35 years of filming, I finally watched the stinker more than any other film I've ever seen. Defeat 'Good Will Hunting' Baise Moi 'and' Flirt 'for true horrors This is a terrible harbinger of the first order ... even if not a pretentious ship. Cheap and worse effects - pointless. <br /> <br /> The script seems to be written by the first year film student who didn't go out much. But want to appear full of meaning! The performance was terrible - Tilda Swinton created a career filled with empty woodess along with acting that changed the nervous direction between the isthmus and the ridiculous violence. Obviously there are some stupid people that allow the director of this movie to make another ... be warned.
