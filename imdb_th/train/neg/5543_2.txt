Seriously, I love these old movies and their simplicity. But I just watched this story for the first time last night and it slotted myself into my bottom five all the time. This story should be about love stories or zombies, right? This movie was so bad that after it ended with mercy, everything I could do was laugh that it was really bad. Luckily I closed the movie without seeing everything or I couldn't talk about it in the ride! I like to think that positive things can be said about anything in life, so in order to follow the theory that I will accept the best asset of this film, it is very short for a full-length movie.
