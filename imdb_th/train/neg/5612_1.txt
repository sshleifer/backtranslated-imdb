As a ghost and non-Christian believer I think I am going to hold on to my faith. But what i saw I think this movie will have a good argument. But there is only one view from those who are not agnostic and Jewish ??? And who are these street people that he interviewed, who didn't know the back arm from the head Where are the proper theologians and priests and the things he will receive from the argument? Not a retiree who wrote books and graduated in 1970. Personally, this DVD is a waste of time and is not worth my time to check whether facts are right or wrong, or if I should. Not finding God because his own ego and demons are better than him No, I will not say that this film is amazing to help those who do not believe in God who read this, feel better about themselves. But if you want to show the world that you care about us, who have bad spirits who believe in Jesus, then attract us to your values, not drumming.
