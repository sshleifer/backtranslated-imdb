I will keep this story as short as possible, because this piece of shit is hardly mentioned. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst movies ever created - there are other horrible zombies. Of Schnaas - ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3) These movies are so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be shot. I manage (hardly ...) in the ride. ZOMBIE DOOM - but ZOMBIE 90 is horribly ineffective. Will compare with other Schnaas horror movies that I have to go through everything in the first 10 minutes. Center showing improper work skills, camera work in a horrible video camera style, ridiculous reproduction ... It is constant. I can't find the only thing about this waste exchange - and I often find that redeeming rewards in any movie. This is one of the worst movies ever created - you were warned ... 1/10
