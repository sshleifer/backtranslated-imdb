Let me start by saying that I didn't watch this movie at first with high expectations. I suggested by a friend with a moderate taste in the movie and "MTV" was put on the cover so I didn't expect much. What I expect is the extreme tearing. But at least it is effective. <br /> <br /> I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me start where I have never read a book. And didn't watch other movies in other versions. <br /> <br /> The performance is my main subject in this movie. By God, it was great. This young woman is quite normal. But compared to the remaining actors, she is Maryl Streep. "The main hero" Heath is just plain scary. He can sing a clich√©d that sounds good. But it's about it His performance undermined the 'sad' moments with a very poor score that I became laughter. The woman Isabel is also a cute person, and the elder brother is just a flat character, played by an actor who can't express any emotions and when he tries it, he fails miserably Neil Patrick Harris is the only famous actor who plays Edward, although it is obvious that the direction is bad because he is not with what I see him do. Oh, and my father wasn't a bit bad for my memory. But he has been in this movie for a long time. I can not remember for a long time. <br /> <br /> My story is not good. You can imagine more. Predictable stories (Until the end, which I almost do not understand) the ultimate, one-sided character that has no real depth for them ... Overall, it's not interesting or interesting. So much and nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> The ending will be a scam. It does nothing The ending was not created at all, it almost felt like later. In fact, I had to ask my friends why the actual ending, which when they explained to me, I had to see my face. "Wait, when did they say that?" Never a good sign. The correction may be the worst thing I have ever seen, even though I understand that it has faded away because this thing was created for TV. But now there is no excuse. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is just garbage. I am a sensitive person. I cry in two episodes of The Simpsons. I never cried during this shit even off. Actually, this movie is not worth your time. If you want to see a scam, look elsewhere.
