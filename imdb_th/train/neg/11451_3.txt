Okay, my friends, heavy movies that are expected to watch all kinds of movies are not good, including good stuff and this movie made me get tested. I will not chop words This movie is not good. Bad stories, poor performances, Sissy Spacek, always excellent, not doing anything to make this movie better. Of course, I asked myself why I was bothered to see this vicious junk movie? Why am I wasting my time and money on things I suspect are not good? The answer is, of course, that I'm a movie watcher, so I can't avoid things that should be avoided. I will not waste time explaining what is wrong with this movie. But said that the quality of the show is to make it polite. The serious buffalo subpaar may want to be responsible for watching this movie. Otherwise, stay at home. Don't waste time reading books, doing housework or making good sandwiches.
