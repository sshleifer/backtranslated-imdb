It's not a joke when the average life of a pathetic life has a miracle happening to him, turning his life upside down and making him learn valuable lessons on the way. The formula is not old, right? It's a sure way to create a classic movie! Just watching popular songs like Liar Liar and Big! ... This must be Rob Schneider's concept when he created Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo. Followed by The Animal because I followed the plot through my satire. Draw it further: Schneider plays the police, a loser who is involved in a tragic accident. But was rescued from surgery ... by many veterinarians carrying him with animal parts Causing him to have horse-like symptoms at an inappropriate time, running like a cheetah, etc. This movie is more pleasing than Schneider's other little flicks (such as the original plot plot, follow-up "The Hot Chick", but almost felt like they wanted the audience to hate by selecting a reality television star as a romantic lead actor (Colleen Haskell from "Survivor") and wearing a pendant by Norm MacDonald, my favorite scene .. Not None exist Sorry, nothing is remembered except the production cost. I just want to finish this review by saying that a little reference to other movies in the movie may not be alright. But when it comes to the line that has the same exact delivery ("You can do it!") There is the word - "milking." In fact, this is another word - "right".
