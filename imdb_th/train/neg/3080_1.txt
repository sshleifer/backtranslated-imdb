Hehehehe. This movie is so bad that it doesn't try to hide the fact that it sucks. I remember the day I saw this thing for the first time in MST. It looks like the sun is bright. Then I saw Rick Sloane's product, which consisted of a terrifying doll doll that had wreaked havoc in the 80s land. Kevin, wussy extraordire tried to impress his girlfriend, manage the security assistant who fought with rakes. And many other things in this series, making images that are not very good Don't want a plot or story Obviously, there is no need to have performances because of the proof film. His army men and sexually crazy women will make you want to jump off a cliff and a cowardly friend who kicks him out of phone sex will make you say "He has good red shorts." In addition, I hate the old security staff and hope that he will have an accident in his supermarket trolley. When you think it's over, wait until the Club Scum scene asks Road Rash. <br /> <br /> I suggest that after watching this movie is a good month to regain feelings and consciousness. And if you see Rick Sloane letting him kick the groin to show that we are grateful to the dice player named Hobgoblins
