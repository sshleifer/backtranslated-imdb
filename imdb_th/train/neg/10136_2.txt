No one would like this movie to make merit. But if you have a sense of humor and enjoy the quality of their MST3 schlock movies, then this is for you.

Segal returned to work for the general public, which only a few minutes earlier had taken care of "wiping the mind" that Segal Segal ran out of ammunition and resort knives to kill soldiers By nature, all the guards placed guns and fought with knives too! A grenade is a bomb. But the explosion anyway A small stealth fighter can fly all the way from California to Afghans without fueling. Seagull then flew back to California - a long way, that is, Europe - even though there was a provider that provided air support to him in the Arabian Sea for 20 minutes. 2 flat screens and pictures, gauges and maps on the wall What a horn!
