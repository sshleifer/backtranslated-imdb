I love westerners I can watch all day "Goodness, badness and ugliness" is my favorite thing. I always watch "Silverado" for the 8th time. It may be just another day because it was screened in CMT. No doubt that the worst west I have ever seen The performance was very bad. They didn't explain anything at the end of what looked like a mysterious compass. The only good thing I can think of is the beautiful Kanto girl. The obvious long-term stoppage between conversations seems to be intended to allow time to create films that are acceptable. This film is not worth the new rent I paid for our local movie rental shop. I feel like being robbed and deserving a rental refund if there is something there. The only reason I finished it was because I hate to not watch movies until the end. I closed it half way because it was terrible. For the director, please work better if you decide to do something new. This is a movie that has the potential to make people turn west.
