'Succubus', a modified version of 'Necronomicon GeträumteSünden' is a struggle to sit through even 76 minutes. Another lot of Euro horror tripe that is boring and hypocrisy and I may creep into a coma. Jess Franco delivers another truly awesome 60s trash. Times which appear by actors The crew departed from their heads in Class A hallucinations because it was not one second of this mess. Obviously this is one of his best films, more than 180 films ?? It's hard to believe that there is a worse effort. <br /> <br /> The story is not understandable about Franco's violence and lesbianism, and uses S&M in good measure. In order to maintain boredom, <br /> <br /> I might have left it for a while before entering the world of Euro-horror, which is hiding again ?? Life is too short to spend time watching this boat.
