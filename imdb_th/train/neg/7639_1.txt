I saw this film at the NY Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and thought it was quite bad. The first thing and the most distracting thing is the way it was shot. That is a very slow motion and too close-up photography that seems to have no point - intelligent or aesthetics - apart from showing the skills of the filmmaker. This movie seems to be something that movie students will come to do with cocky, leading actors (Sam Levine) very cute, but they are the best actors. As for the remaining actors, so bad. Most of the stories are annoying. I have to admit that most viewers seem to enjoy movies; Laughing and sighing all the time But i don't like it very much
