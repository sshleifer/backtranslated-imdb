ALIEN LOVE (because this film is known in the UK) is a very strange movie I don't mean it's a mysterious home movie in the form of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman. I mean, it's a TVM that has sworn some fuck. A really good deal. A bad script. You can imagine that someone like John Hughes directed this story ten years ago. But of course he would have to cut T&A. <br /> <br /> Go back to a bad chapter. One of the problems is a few characters. Any kind of motivation, especially Amanda Why did you get Connie at the bar? Just so she can meet the aliens? Do you see what I mean about retro? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT and many other movies in the mid-1980s with this type of plot, most of which are more determined and persuasive than they have been seen here. The story continues to follow a path that is unreliable and unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Saying that I found ALIEN LOVE watching and not only showing T&A terms and conditions as a person Sex comedy shows sci-fi better than FLESH GORDON and EARTH GIRLS.
