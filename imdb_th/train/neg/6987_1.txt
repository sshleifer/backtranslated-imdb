I have all thought to be the epic of the American Revolutionary War. It's not like that. (And for that matter, not Emmerich / Devlin / Gibson THE PATRIOT, but I'm talking about it) <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in the movie screening at the old MGM Studios (now Sony) earlier. The audience had high expectations for this expensive period, written by veteran Robert Dillon, directed by Hugh Hudson, who was honored (from CHARIOTS OF FIRE FAME) and starring Al Pacino. <br /> <br /> Long time for people to start to jump in their seats. He whispered misconceptions about Pacino's accent - he should be the American frontier of the Scots family (!) - and that Nastassja Kinski, who had just emigrated from England (!!). Started and everything went down quickly. <br /> <br /> Inspiration was messy. The conversation was brutal. Something that has a plot swooping forward in absurd absurdity; By the second or third time, accusing the lovers of Pacino and Kinski stumbling together, it became a bad joke Donald Sutherland gave the English as a British officer / pederast. His accent was also on the map. I guess there are no British actors. <br /> <br /> There are many people left. Those who tried to stifle giggling and openly revealed me jammed - I thought that at least the fighting scene might be good. I was wrong. Hudson chose to shoot them with a mobile camera, not even a Steadicam. The jerk that makes the credibility of the wrong news film makes the audience feel bad. <br /> <br /> There are semi-famous television critics in A few spectators in front of me: (Wired) Gary Franklin from the news of the Channel 7 incident. I can say that he was angry because of the rest of our behavior. And the next day on his TV section, the next day he gave the movie '10' in his 'Franklin Scale of 1 to 10' while speaking casually about louts that would stop the show last night. Before Don't know the art when they see What is the story? <br /> <br /> After this disaster, Pacino was not shown in another movie for almost 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career never recovered. You can't say that I didn't warn you.
