This is the worst single movie I've ever seen. I can't tell how bad it is. I want to commit suicide many times through this bad experience just to end the pain. I suggest instead of watching this movie, you bathe in acid, at least you know that little pain without scars. <br /> <br /> I have very high expectations when I read the DVD. In the case and at the beginning, it added that Jesus was following them. I was very excited ... then, at the end, I wanted to kill myself. I mean, introducing the most annoying characters in the history of cinema, twenty-three minutes ... just painful! Monkeys do better in fixing this trash. At least they will throw stools and blur some garbage. Would be better if I didn't see the horror. <br /> <br /> It's not that I didn't get a joke. But they are not just not funny. They do not repeat themselves like twenty times. Clearly there is something that is not a joke unless you see a million times. <br /> <br /> Don't be under any circumstances. To see this People voted 'Manos the Hands of Fate' as the worst movie in the world. I saw as well and accepted that it wasn't good ... but still the second worst. 'Fatty Drives the Bus' is worse. <br /> <br /> This thing deserves language. All brutal But I can't write it here
