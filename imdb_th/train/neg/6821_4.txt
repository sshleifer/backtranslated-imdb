It is good But rarely told I like the theme and the main story, which is not as clear as it should be. May happen too much and lack the ability to reign. The performance is ok to be wonderful. Some are stronger than others. I spent a couple of months to pass the whole movie because it didn't make me. Interest and current are not good. I just finished watching it and I'm glad I did it because eventually the movie was moving and there was continuation at the end. Another story is good. But sub delivery Would recommend for this and maybe a little eye food and I mean a little
