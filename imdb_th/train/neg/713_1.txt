Can I say first of all that I feel strongly about this movie that I subscribe to IMDb in particular to check it? And my review? This is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Synopsis of the movie sounds interesting - Nazi occult, time travel, etc. But the movie plot failed to incorporate these elements. together Remember the episodes of South Park that educated manatees who wrote the Family Guy using 'idea balls'? Are these manatees written with Unholy? It's like a writer who wants to combine these different ideas. But do not know how to connect them all together and to make things feel less, including Donnie Darko's time travel theme. <br /> <br /> I can tell from Early that this is a bad movie. Special effects have a low budget for everything that is better. Go straight to the DVD. The performance isn't good, but in fairness I see it worse. I will praise the Nazi paintings. They are creepy. But the evil Nazi butcher is just a cartoon. <br /> <br /> I have no spite against this movie or anything. Not even a horror genre But this movie cannot be described as a thriller or drama If this story was told well, it would be a good movie. But it is beyond the truth. Waaaaay is more hyped
