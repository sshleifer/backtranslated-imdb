I think I will never find a horror movie that is not as good as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", but this movie competes with it. <br /> <br /> I'm not the one who sleeps when watching movies, but I Do 15 minutes after the trance starts I woke up and began to see it sick. Why do I deserve that? Every movie is a torture story. I have to use fast forwarding to see if it's complete. <br /> <br /> I can't stand why my favorite actor forever (MR. WALKEN) can do things. this I have to think that he makes the director satisfied or he needs money because of the movie after the movie he is doing. He is destroying himself and very quickly ... <br /> <br /> What about this movie? It's not scary. The plot is stupid. The characters are terrible. (But I like the ones played by Jared Harris) Terrible effects, lack of death & blood, etc; In three words, what is it And i mean it Can't stand how the director will create this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> However, when I was more disappointed when I saw on the video cover that this film was presented by "Stephen King" I Think he can't show this shit, right? (I rented in Argentina) I don't recommend in one million years. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie with 2 out of 10 (as I said in my review "Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre". Will always be worse That movie is why it is not deserved. 1 out of 10)
