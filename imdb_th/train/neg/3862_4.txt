I just watched it laugh a few times. But nothing to write to the house. Jason Lee looks like he's having fun. The longitudinal DVD truss consists of uncontrollable laughter. Selma Blair seems to punch the time clock. But then again, her character should be stuck in the mud, so "Well done" I guess? Jim Brolin surprisingly funny. (Marriage with Babs is not a picnic). The soundtrack is a popular song. Larry Miller, who plays Julia's father's style (laughs), in the top 10 stories I hate about you is also funny. He's great, but the best aspect of this movie is the selection of Julia Stiles I can take two hours to watch her folded laundry and I feel like I just do.
