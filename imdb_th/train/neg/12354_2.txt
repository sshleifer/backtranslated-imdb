By nature, I didn't watch 'GI Jane'. I was forced to watch this movie more or less in my ex's house. <br /> <br /> GI Jane immediately lost credibility by trying to convince people. Watching that it is a real situation, of course, that it is true, not the result of this story. The story is automatically limited by the amount of humor (without) or action scenes that are entertaining and in no way. God, it becomes too serious. This movie is so boring and difficult to guess. 'GI Jane' failed when other action movies were successful, mostly because of movies such as James Bond, Dirty Harry and many others that were larger. Life Otherwise They are fleeing and having fun. 'GI Jane' tries to be true and failed. <br /> <br /> This is a very frustrating movie from Ridley Scott that has an unreliable story, extraordinary performances and The only reason I gave 2/10 instead of 1/10 for some technical work
