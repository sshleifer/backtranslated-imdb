I might be one of the few people who really read Stephen King's book. This movie is based on After reading this great work, I can't wait to see the movie version of it. After watching the movie, I was totally disappointed. The only thing that this movie has with the book is the name and name of the character. In the book, the characters of Schwarzenegger were placed in the game show. The main object is survival. But he was not in the scene He started to loose in the city and had to escape from the game list. (I guess you call them) villians, which are not similar to the characters in the movie. This evidence created a lot of tension and suspension and ended up very much with Climax. This movie is definitely rubbish. There is no movie quality at all. I respect Arnold Schwarzenegger. Completely as an actor But he was confused about this
