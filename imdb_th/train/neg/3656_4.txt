I have to admit that I am a sucker to measure the samurai since I can remember. I used to look quite unintelligible, whether it's "the elite", working like The Seven Samurai, or bloody comic books such as Lone Wolf and Cub. I also like US- / Japanese "Crossovers" such as The Bushido Blade and of course everything that has Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada and I watched every samurai at least twice, but not Kabuto. <br /> <br /> In 1993, I watched Kabuto for the first time in the video that even the samurai movie was boring. At first I was looking forward to Mayeda going to Europe and the encounter that would come from there. But when he arrived in Spain, I actually didn't pay much attention to the movie anymore. <br /> <br /> It's this movie that doesn't call justice "bad". Technically it is a clean program in category But never quiet enough. Sho Kosugi has limited skills as a director and actor, and only a handful of people are attracted to the Japanese actors mentioned above. And the speech of the son Sho Kosugis Kane, which appeared in almost all the films of Sho Kosugi as a son. Shos: He inherited only a limited acting skill from his father. Adding a negative point is the lack of blood and blood that is the trademark of all samurai films. Obviously it is intended for younger audiences in the United States / Europe. <br /> <br /> Say that it's a fairly good movie for the action-adventure fans on average. But it is boring for fans of the samurai cinema. Fans who participate in "Samurai meet ??" - genre should go to see Red Sun (1971) with Charles Bronson as a cowboy who must join the team. With the samurai Toshiro Mifime to pull the samurai sword from Alan Delon. It is a very accurate way and that Kabuto made a mistake. <br /> <br /> So even though this movie takes only 100 minutes, it looks like That will be a longer movie. <br /> <br /> The point that I have honored the 4/10 instead of 3/10: The first time I saw this film I have seen it in the synchronous version of the German Nice. In this model, you can actually understand Kosovo. I must admit that his 'Engrish' is sometimes funny. But boring after about 30 minutes
