Dolph Lundgren is a Templar star who came to New York when there was a key to the resistance of Christ found by archaeologists. Of course, the devils were only a few miles from Dolph. Of course, Lundgren came from his composition and the film was not completely viewable. I agree that Dolph Lundgren is a fan like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme. I try to watch his movies every time they are on TV. I caught the Minion and the boy. I've been disappointed. This movie is the most scary. With action scenes that are badly staged and badly edited, you hardly make sense in the fighting arena. The worst thing is Lundgren, who doesn't believe in being a strong priest (!). All of this makes it worse that this movie is a scene that fell out of Fallen and ended. This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen from Dolph Lundgren. It's terrible and is the lowest point in Lundgren's career. And I saw Cover-Up, The Last Warrior and the Masters of the Universe <br /> <br /> 1/2 * from 4 (terrible)
