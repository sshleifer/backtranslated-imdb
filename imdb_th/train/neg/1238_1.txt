Tim Burton remake from "Planet of the Apes", originally from 1968 (and starring Charlton Heston), a way that is far from the quality and plot of the original. <br /> <br /> F. Special effects have been updated since 1968 but have not been written yet. The characters are boring and the conversation is terrible. I watched this movie with a friend. (For rent only) and understand why before Christmas, all "Planet of the Apes" toys at Target are in the trash. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My advice to Tim Burton : Do not use this to apply for a job. <br /> <br /> My advice to others: Watch the movie "Planet of the Apes" in 1968.
