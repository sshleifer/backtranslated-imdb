After Life is a miracle. I didn't expect much. It's hard to believe that these movies were created by the same people as Do You Remember Dolly Bell. Zavet is a two-hour comedian without a story. Underground's rude and naive humor seems to deteriorate into a pitiful buffer. Here, it seems that Kusturica is constantly falling down since he started creating comedies that started with Black Cat, White Cat, which I thought. That is great I really like his first movie, and this is the reason why it is very disappointing to see something like this. Hope that his next person will be excellent
