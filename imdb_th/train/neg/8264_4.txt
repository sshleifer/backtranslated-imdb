This movie is a movie that every actor is good, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a movie in which three couples, each pair, meet in a situation that feels like being cute. In other words, it feels like they were creating a movie scene, unlike real life. Although women who work at the store peek outside with one of their customers, it doesn't look as realistic as written in this movie. In addition, when one of the characters meets an overweight woman in this film, it feels like the way they look at each other after the argument. Again, all the actors are good and the time of this movie is good. But overall, there are other indies that may use rewriting before starting production.
