I always care about Bigfoot, so when I look around to find movies to rent It's the worst thing at $ 4.50 I've ever spent and I need a refund! Please do not waste money on this matter !! This is one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. This film is incredibly boring and I found myself rolling my eyes a lot and I didn't watch it all the time. I just got bored with it The show was awesome. The horrible effect, everything was terrible and without taste. It combined into a movie that was terrible, boring and wasted all time and money. I hope that one day they will make a good movie about Sasquatch. But before that I had to sit and watch countless cheap clothes like this to find a true masterpiece
