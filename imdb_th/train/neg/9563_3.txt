This is based on the original 80s concept. It is in the present day when we see the base in Afghanistan destroyed by the UAV at first. <br /> <br /> And that's what the UAV shark jump weapon does. He may be But i don't think it will ever actually try We went to see a computer that controlled this operation, called RIPLEY. We were introduced to "hacker" Will Farmer (he was good at chemistry and electronics, which didn't make him a computer hacker) and Love his interest, Annie) and the first attempt of hacking is not just a total failure. Log in and Annie guess who it is. In addition, we met with a testament mother who worked for a chemical company. <br /> <br /> Willing to receive money from his neighbor's bank account (Mr Massude), not hacking (he helped him set up an account). We will get Nodded back to the original movie that they decided not to play. Global Thermonuclear War & They played The Dead Code. Tracking RIPLEY office is working, not on Will, but on Massude's PC. So all the evidence they collected was useless. With Will <br /> <br /> Of course, why RIPLEY turns off the machine will not work (He only played online games?) And why it felt necessary to close all the electricity on all the blocks he lived in as well Why does the Anti-Terrorist Agency see this as a highly suspicious target? RIPLEY activates his mobile phone? I don't think it's not connected to the PC, and the message won't play until he actually answers the phone, so there's a "hacking" science that is even worse. <br /> <br /> Agent RIPLEY arrives at Massude's house took him & will receive an envelope that contains a lot of money. Will search for a license plate that brings Massude, not "hacking" because you never saw him break into the DMV computer. RIPLEY agent who seized Dennis in the airport while he was looking for Wil has no power to arrest or detain he Wil's mother can't. "Stealing chemical and biological substances" as well, and even though she has no right to arrest or detain Dennis The Patriot Act? <br /> <br /> I don't know why Will is concerned about being arrested for crimes in Canada because it's a completely different country with different laws to the United States. <Br <br /> <br /> The computer is cheating and all actions done with Will, his mother and Dennis, are not punished by the phreak government agency. The phone we see Will do is the first show of Any hacking activity in the movie. We have also been hacked into RIPLEY, which seems too easy for this powerful system. <br /> <br /> "Man" that runs in Annie at the airport & Watching them on the road, nothing is related to RIPLEY & the ridiculous idea that RIPLEY is able to track mobile phones while the underground is stupid like the idea that computers read lips. <br /> <br /> Reference to the movie When they spoke of Stephen Falken as the designer of the RIPLEY system instead of Joshua Project, we discovered that "people" who ran into Annie were Falken (not acted by tragic traditional actors) who faked death. <br /> <br /> We also saw WOPR as "what to help". They beat RIPLEY and they kept the original sound used. Falken & WOPR was destroyed too quickly after almost every use. (The same explosion should destroy Will, Annie & Russian. In addition, it is unlikely that they will create a built-in computer system capable of eliminating chemical weapons. That country is gone. <br /> <br /> The plot of "contamination" is totally unbelievable. That type of order must go through the chairman or the chief officer. More convincing. The idea. <br /> <br /> IP hacking with RIPLEY is not done by Will. He just contacted one of his friends who suggested and used the idea to use it. Too much laughing. Get into Just increasing the operation of RIPLEY. The temperature with Joshua as a backdoor into RIPLEY (especially after it was blown into debris) is an incredible solution and screaming. Of the many hopeless writers who don't have the idea to leave and want to make this movie. <br /> There are advantages at RIPLE Y playing Dead Code and we see the countdown (say 17 minutes) from That RIPLEY says "Decontamination 30 min: "How shit is when they can not stop on their own? Philip's attack on Philadelphia and his mission stopped (In my opinion, too easy) and decided to attack Joshua in its internal circuit and change the missile path aimed at Philly to Washington, where RIPLEY stationed the concept of nuclear exchange so RIPLEY knew that What she did was ineffective. (Of course, you already know that she has Joshua inside or not because he has learned this lesson in the original movie.) Original movies <br /> <br /> Their elimination with RIPLEY Repeating Joshua's original words at the end of the original movie will go to show that the original idea that they can't find is> <br /> If you want to point out bad thoughts and be stolen, the person who will accuse is Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner The scary movie and best avoided.
