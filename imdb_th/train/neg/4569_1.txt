I can't believe that Muncie is hard to pay attention that they are humiliated by allowing this program there. This performance is like a slap in the face of a truly hard-working law enforcement officer. I've never seen anything stupid in my life before. If they charge, it is funny to be one thing. But to say that it is true, nothing lies I saw only once and was shocked by what I saw. I want to see a little guy being chased with bad guys. Is a joke to get Nothing in the list that is close to the real world. Muncie, the police chief and all officers should hang their heads in shame and should not accept that they come from that city. No wonder it's not on TV.
