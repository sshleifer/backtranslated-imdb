Never before has a movie that drives me to write reviews. But this is just a bad thing. I'm stuck with it, trying to find out what it is about this movie that makes spying a choice. It was his first serious role, making good books, but it didn't work for I, as a movie, I find it unbelievable, lacking atmosphere, and I find that there are many hidden scenes as a stage actor that he may be. But serious actors by Dylan mcdermott and Rose Byrne are acceptable, but not enough to make a weak plot with weak conversations. Maybe I missed all the points. But for me, it does not match any type. It does not cause any sympathy with the characters and it does not create any doubt. In fact, I found myself praying to the end. Wish to slap all three main characters!
