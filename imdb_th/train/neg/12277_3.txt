I found the "plan of the Arabs" in the trash, negotiated and thought that I had discovered the lost treasure. People have a reason why you don't hear much about this movie. The plot is full of mud. Slow pacing. Cornelia Sharp is as lively as ordinary cold tofu, not even Sean Connery that can record this.
