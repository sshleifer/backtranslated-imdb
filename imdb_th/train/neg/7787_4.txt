This is one of the movies that are more interesting to watch from an academic perspective than from an entertainment perspective. I rate according to the number of movies that I like or entertain, so I give 4 points if I rate it as an academic film, even if I get 10. <br /> <br >> It was taken in a manner Very interested in such a quiet movie that has elements of sound effects and reality. It means conveying disjointed memories and fragmentation of the mind and it is interesting in this sense. <br /> <br /> However, this film has many disgusting elements. They are mostly disturbing. It has interesting images as well and some interesting ideas. But the relationship of some characters (Especially between mother and son) is quite annoying. <br /> <br /> In every story, this movie will attract you or it won't be for me. It's interesting from an academic perspective. But it's not a good watch and I probably won't go back to it a second time. <br /> <br /> 4/10 If you're looking for For entertainment 10/10 from an academic perspective
