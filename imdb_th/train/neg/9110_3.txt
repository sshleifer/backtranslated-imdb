I watched this movie at 3 o'clock in the morning. The time when I was usually open when it came to movies. But I still think it's not good. This movie is not good at all. The reasons why there are so many <br /> <br /> The performance is not good and every time there is a situation that makes me think of the Chevy Chase comedy in the 90s. Poker among servants ... This movie is based on the very first person and that is ok. But if I didn't see the first person before seeing this, it would be worse. Like the ending, it came suddenly and I felt like I didn't close anything ... Sebastian changed suddenly and this movie looks like it was created to explain only 1, used to do other things. Good The same score for the first time and it doesn't feel like a movie ... <br /> <br /> They should handle the situation with more style and class. But they can't And so this movie became bad ...
