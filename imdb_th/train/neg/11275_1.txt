This is a deep clone of `LOCK STOCK 'that has stellar actors and scary scripts. I do not know why many of the leading British actors are registered with this garbage. They must be bribed. The story of the story will continue forever and forever, and if I don't pay for it, I will close it after 10 minutes, not the worst movie I have ever seen. That is a great honor. Using the truly pitiful bogroll of the movie (I use this word loosely) `GUMMO '(I feel like suing the so-called director" for the lost hour. Half of my life) but this trash is almost there too Of course, it is one of the 5 worst films I've ever seen. Things like this make Hollywood warn that they don't have a monopoly in truly scary movies.
