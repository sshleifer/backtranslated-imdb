This movie is not good. This movie is very scary. The performance is not good. The setting is unrealistic. A nonsense story: a comet that appeared once in the Era is set to appear one night. The majority of the world's population decides to watch this comet. Then everyone the next morning But only a few people turned to use dust from the comet's rays People 's clothes are still intact. There are trees that are still alive. But people turned into dust No bones, nothing. That is ridiculous. How can radiation burn people? But leaving the clothes and other biological substances as before Their makeup will not look scary for the newborn. The Insane Clown Posse makes me more scared ... and they should look stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there are survivors. People surrounded by steel when the comet passed away escaped from zombies and death. How can steel block the radiation of comets that burn people in their music? <br /> <br /> Equally insulting is the 60's horror song that plays in the background through some parts of the movie. Movies and make you want to shoot your television. <br /> <br /> The most stupid part of the movie is the characters that focus on: Valley Girls and Chakotay. Two people from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters are unrealistic. real Who will rob the day after the revelation by eating mutant flesh running everywhere? There are four minutes of horror scenes in the entire film and most of them are dreams. During these scenes, the conversation is not complicated, which makes South Park look smart. The silence during the initial conversation is painful I can make a better movie with four monkeys and the Cheetos bag doesn't see this movie at all.
