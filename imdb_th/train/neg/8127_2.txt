Currently, this movie is named in IMDb because it is the 42nd worst movie ever made, which is the reason I rented it from NetFlix. However, I am sorry to report that this movie, while not good, has no place now. Good enough to make merit in the top 100 movies ever made. I used to watch this movie at least 100 stories, worse than this. But it's still not as scary as it should be included in this embarrassing list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on the delayed honeymoon of they They are married in real life as well). He is a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists that they go to nearby caves. When they arrived there, they behaved very stupidly. (The highlight of the movie is not good) and is bitten by a bat shortly. According to this film, bats love to attack people and have vampires in the United States - both of which are not true. <br /> <br /> Oddly after being bitten, people won't bother going to the hospital !! The first thing in everyone's mind (Especially doctors) is to get medical help immediately But not this fool He soon had a seizure. But he is still not interested in asking for help! You always think that this must be the most stupid couple in movie history !! <br /> <br /> Soon after, he went to see a doctor and was sent to the hospital. But then it was too late and his attacks began to intensify and he started killing people to suck their blood When everyone clearly saw that the man was a mad killing machine, his wife (Which, like her husband, has a grapefruit as a brain) refuses to believe that he is dangerous - even after he attacks people, steals an ambulance and runs The police car closes the road !! <br /> <br /> Now, most of Moss's time will pass through these episodes, his eyes go back and he looks like a normal person. However, as strange as a couple of times he developed hands like a bat and eventually they used some good prosthetics with him so he looked quite like a bat. If this is really a wonderful thing, this movie will be rewarded. 1. <br /> <br /> In the end, the twists are almost without any reason. The wife becomes a crazy bat woman and has The bats killed the evil sheriff. This sort of thing is a mystery, like the beliefs of Moss and Mac Andrew, how this movie will help their career - even if they both have a long career in TV role since 1974 <br /> <br /> Overall, very stupid. The plot is stupid and unreasonable and requires people who are stupid to be true. Not a good movie at all <br /> <br /> Note: For some reason, IMDb displays three DVD graphics for IT'S ALIVE and is two sequels. The web page for THE BAT PEOPLE while THE BAT PEOPLE is seen as "It's Alive". Two movies are not relevant at all. It's easy to understand the mistakes - especially when they both came out in 1974, but the movies I just reviewed Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew starred and other films starred John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
