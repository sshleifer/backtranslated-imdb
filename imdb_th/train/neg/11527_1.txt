<br /> <br /> The movie starts with a typical cartoon movie. It's about a boy who has no parents and falls in love with a girl. # 1 In school, there is nothing surprising in the movie. There's nothing you can't guess from the movie. Being a good actor or not having an actor in the world that can record this kind of script, maybe a ten year old boy can enjoy this movie. But it is the violence for the youngest children You can't escape from thinking of movies like X-men, Batman and Spawn. All those names are better. I almost walked out of the last 20 minutes! One thing that may do well But it is computer image creation But it's not something to put in a Christmas tree! So my advice: Don't watch this movie even if you get paid!
