Then, rather long, the sequence of the dance and the close distance of the characters that made this movie better - this movie should help explain the story and inspiration of the characters better. <br /> <br /> The edge of Nu Bo, Minister, aunt, mother - and the diminishing of dynamic and important competition between Hatsumo and Mameha and Hatsumo and Sayuri make this film lack any true depth. If you don't read the book, you Sayuri will not understand why we love the president and why Mameha had become her mentor <br /> <br /> This film looks visually stunning - and the actors all do best. They give the script a C rate, but that's all good about this movie.
