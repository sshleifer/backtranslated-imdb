First of all, I want to say that this movie is worth more than four stars that I rate. I gave four stars because for this 86 minute movie for me, it looks like 2 and a half hours and not interesting enough to sit and watch it all. However, "The Big Alligator River" (my DVD title is called) is better than your average nature. To bounce the movie. <br /> <br /> The Southeast Asia's wild tourist resort has just opened and hired local people. While trying to manage the wild animals around the pursuit of nature's revenge in the form of a giant crocodile god Kroona, life is not the only thing that tourists and the main characters. (The photographer and the resort staff) have to worry about the natives being rubbed in the wrong way as well. <br /> <br /> This movie is Adventure / horror stories that do quite well with scores and directions for playing good music. But the crocodile itself, which is the main attraction of this movie, seems to be a fake. The close-up photography of the jaw is good. But that's what we have to see Some underwater images that make it clear that what we are facing are squeaky crocodile toys. You can go to the zoo's souvenir shop. But the native people can believe it if it is not true. <br /> <br /> May not be a movie that will make you unceasingly excited. But taken and produced well enough to be mentioned well And like many living movies, this story ends with a very high amount of content There are also many beautiful forest scenery. Show below standard But who would expect it to be better? <br /> <br /> Much better than "Primeival" in America. But nothing compares to "Jaws", but remember that it may not be involved at some point
