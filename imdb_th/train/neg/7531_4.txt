This is a movie about grief. Therefore, should move the audience and make them sympathize with the fate of the main character. However, the annoying postmodern style makes it almost impossible to understand. The camera will switch from one scene to another, continuously from one personal crisis to another, resulting in changing effects. Most characters seem to have a pointless life, unstructured lives held together by professional commitment. (It also extends credibility that men who have just received what is equal to the death sentence should be fun to run sex with the woman he just met). Overall, the overall effect is quite disappointing. Even though it is a good show But some scenes are quite powerful
