My brother loves this show. I agree with people who say that it is copied from Dexter's lab and a rather strange parents. <br /> <br /> I never like parents who are quite strange. I mean some things make me laugh. But mostly it's annoying and not cute at all This is the same way that I feel about Johnny Test except what makes me laugh at acting. Very funny and ridiculous and will tell you the truth. Maybe it's just me, but the kids don't dress like that! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is great, but c'Mon! <br /> <br /> And Dexter's Lab used to be one of my favorites and I didn't mind watching it. Which makes me feel bored and ashamed by Johnny Test that makes the absolute JOKE come out of a great performance! <br /> <br /> Another thing, dog. So. Annoying. He's more loud and more disgusting than Johnny! And gay accents? Fudge! I hate dogs until they die and I hope they die because that would be better for children to see than listen and see the nasty shit that happened in that list. If you don't want your eyes to burn as an amazing flame and your brain fries from this list, don't watch!
