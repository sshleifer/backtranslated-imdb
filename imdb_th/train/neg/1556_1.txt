I am Chinese in this movie I chose the screen name Sheeba Alahani because I was a model in Italy and they couldn't correctly pronounce my real name. So I chose Sheeba and then added Alahani because it is similar to Alohalani. <br /> <br /> <br /> Never shown before (And showed) but it's fun to shoot. They give me "acting lessons" every morning (which is obviously useless). They dubbed my voice. (Thank God) <br /> <br /> David and Peter burst into a scene full of humor and good jokes. This movie is not intended to be serious. It is a tax cut out by the inside. <br /> <br /> I give 1 because I have a sense of humor but 10 for the fun that I have "acting" in there.
