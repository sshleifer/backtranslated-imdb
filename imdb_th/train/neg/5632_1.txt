I watched the DVD (BLACK WIDOW in the US) and after that felt it was a really scary movie. But they have to cut a lot of original movies or I miss a lot. The sex scenes are very rude and have no nudity. (Not breast) but I have read many other comments on IMDb.com about vulgarity I didn't see anything like that, just a boring and boring movie with a nasty character and a boring and complex plot. Giada Colagrande is paralyzed from the mouth up or Botox and gums and expressions Touch her face And her name reminds me of a big drink at Taco Bell: "I'll get Cola Grande!" It's really fun. It's terrible. Dafoe's skin is too big for his face. It's like stupid plaster!
