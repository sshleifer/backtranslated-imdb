This movie is the worst movie. But it is very high for me It is the way that slasher movies should be. It happens on a university with only a few students. The teacher is stupid than the hammer sack. It is filled with Catholic priests with sexual repression humor. I'm not good. Bad clothes. The conversation is cliched. It's hard to believe that I can predict lines in quotes. Slash marks are creative and seem to rotate around, stabbing people in the penis. The lack of continuity in the soundtrack and the characters that deserve to die because it's terrible. Get cheap beer and friends to watch and laugh.
