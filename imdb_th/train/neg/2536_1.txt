My wife and I just watched BÃ»su AKA The Booth. She fell asleep between parts of the movie. I wish I could take a nap with her. But the truth is that the main character's voice is so loud and scary that it's impossible for me to sleep. When our protagonist spoke, it made me want to hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner sing karaoke. He has no redeeming qualifications. I hope he gets the bus into the movie for five minutes. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me wrong. I like Asian horror movies, but The Booth is extremely annoying. There is no meaning at all. If you want a good Asian cinema, take a look at A Tale of Two Sisters or Into The Mirror. Avoid the booth like an epidemic, especially if you are a migraine frequently
