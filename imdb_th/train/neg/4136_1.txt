I read the reviews before I watched this movie and I didn't believe it. I love shit movies and I expect this to be average. It's not this movie. It makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look very good. Makes me very bored until I close Even nudity is junk! Do they have a budget for this movie? I don't think they do You can tell whether you like this movie or not. In the first 5 minutes, if you want a movie that is full of magic, look to detoxify 4 or even a blood camp Avoid this trash - I watched it on the TV and felt that it had been torn away, so don't use anything with it. The best part is probably the end.
