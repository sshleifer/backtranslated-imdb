I still have to endure hundreds of children's movies in the past. Consider this as the worst thing I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1) I am not happy today and age to explain to my children. Hears that Russia is not "bad people". In addition, ridiculous Russian names such as "Poopchev" are not appropriate. <br /> <br /> 2) Grandfather's birthday party scene has a semi-female joke which he says Men drink beer and women speak. By phone The other two flies use the word "shit" twice unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> 3) Most of the movies hit the stereotypes and propaganda of the 1950s that I think we are proud of growing up. Come to br /> <br /> In all, it's just crude oil, bad animation, worse writing, and not worth the time to watch.
