Okay, maybe 13 years old, like me, it's a bit old for this movie. It's about this rat that lives in the palace. Then drain the toilet, flushing him into the toilet! He ended up in this rat city and met this girl with a jewel that the greedy frog wanted. He will do everything for this gem. He sends the entire army. After these two mice, he plans to bring the gems and the city of overwhelming rats! The cool part about this movie is slugs. They make all sound effects. They sing, make a scary and funny sound. OK, the bottom line. It is aimed at 7 years old. Clever, great movie that brings younger family members to watch. I do not think animation is a true dream art, such as WAllace and Gromit. I think they are slightly slack in there. This movie is good But not worth spending $ 9.50 for sorry
