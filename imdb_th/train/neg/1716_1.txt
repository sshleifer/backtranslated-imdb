Although this is a production made for TV But without any excuse for the excellent results of the finished product This film has a budget and an casting selection department, so if you're going to make a movie about real life stories and put "True story" in the name. Actually, no effort should be applied. Try and capture realism? First of all, this movie was created unreasonably. These actors were on television soap during the day or in a movie channel throughout life that was ridiculous and not in the story of a gangster / criminal in real life. Everything about them, from their look to their attitude, just screaming at the 90's. Shopping Mall - Al-Rock - Listen to the rock. What about the script? Two words explained - stupid and insulting, and again is a way too 90ish sounding. I don't think the real Clyde Barrow would say "I'm here." It's like having "New Kids on the Block" fans gather and decide to do "kewl flick" about Bonnie and Clyde. Do you know? This sticker is not in a great position. Everything is wrong with all kinds of movies. Wrong here, from casting to editing and music. All things are wrong wrongly .... and it makes them angry that the party responsible for this brutal turkey has the courage to put "true stories" in the title. Of course, it's not true. But even worse, even if not being entertained from a distance as a unconscious popcorn flick that accepts their own conditions Just as I said in my topic, it was too scary to describe every level as possible. Trust me on this issue or see your own risk.
