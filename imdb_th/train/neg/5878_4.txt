As the cover says "The village of our time for our time" <br /> <br /> I have to study this filming version of the small village directly after watching Keneth Branagh's version and it's a truly disappointing experience. This model uses a different approach in various aspects of play, including one sex story. Osric is very much homosexual and has an interesting interaction between the small village and Ophelia. 60) This is the version of Hamlet, performed very well. But can't compare to the complete version of Branagh. <br /> <br /> Just know ... I found a video in my local video store (in Australia) and actually I'm looking for Keneth Branagh DVD to Buy if that thing exists If anyone knows anything please tell me
