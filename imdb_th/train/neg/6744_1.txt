As you know, JIGSAW didn't go to Blackbuster because Devin Hamilton's staff member, Full Moon Devin, was the seller for the entire video group. He just released the movie BLEED, which he sold to Black Busters at the same time as JIGSAW. He convinced buyers of Blackbuster not to accept any JIGSAW and doubled the BLEED. And BLEED seems to be popular The main problem of this story is that BLEED is one of the worst movies ever, and as we know, JIGSAW is gold. I urge all of you to go to the BLEED page on the internet and vote for JIGSAW wrong movies and all your abilities. Similarly, you should go to the JIGSAW page and vote high for it. (If you haven't already), we need to make JIGSAW worth at least 8 or 8.5 and make it to be reduced to about 2 (so put it in the 100 worst movie listings on the internet). Try to convince friends and The family does the same. <br /> <br /> Hope you all do well. - Matt
