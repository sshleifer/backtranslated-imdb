It's interesting to everyone. (Until now) It seems that this movie will not have expectations - I think that is a trick. In contrast to them, I have good expectations and that is a mistake. As soon as I saw how the camera's face was close, I knew that we were in the hands of a great amateur director - that was their clear sign. They thought it was art or powerful or concentrated in Holding the camera About two inches from the actor Although the actors in this film only have one facial expression, <br /> <br /> If the camera is not enough to close, the lack of light in this movie can kill. This movie seems to be filming all in the dark. So now we know that filming is the number one amateur as well. "Oh, wow, we will set fire in the set with a flashlight!" No, that makes it seem impossible to see. <br /> <br /> On top of the serious technical flaws, there is no matter except the hint that there is almost no idea that never developed at all and nothing new about. This relationship is illuminated (perhaps this is a new film for Germany). But in Los Angeles, you have to forget) <br /> <br /> The fact that the film won two film festivals does not indicate the quality of This movie But with the quality of these unique festivals I can assure you that this movie will not win anything in the festival that I have seen. In fact, twice in this movie, it seems that eventually it ended and people began to rise. (This is one of the side effects of the technique. But when the film was shaky instead of the voice of the audience And when the movie finally ended, DID became clear that it didn't matter that it would end at either point before either. The previous ending will help viewers from the tiring scenes in the house (leaflets, cut vegetables, spread honey on bread). Yes, we understand. The life of a lonely old man is boring - but we think the first person Beginning <br /> <br /> I recommend that viewers miss this. Complex movie viewers
