If you want to watch a movie that has a strange shot illuminating the strange stories of these men (And one woman) who enjoys hitting the shit out of each other, if you want to enjoy this unrelated story One of the boxers and other gay men, you should watch this movie. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I almost felt that I was bruised and bruised like a film director (the movie). Go from me. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is not intended for planning or a great performance. This is a movie that is looking at horror and wonder. Much like watching a plane crash or train wreck. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch great movies, good movies, "B" movies, or even ordinary movies, this movie isn't true. <br /> <br /> Warning for anyone who looks at this movie, please do not eat in advance. You may want to puke at the end of the movie.
