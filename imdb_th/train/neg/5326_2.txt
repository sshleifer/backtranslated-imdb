"Smithereens" is a worthless flick that just goes out in the cable channel that uses a lot of space like a little novel in a public library. The worthless thing and the first attempt of director Seidelman. This film is full of bad performances, bad sound, poor camera performance and poor quality in all aspects of the movie. Many better movies have never been released to the market, and why the junk slaps like this and does not seem to disappear as one of the great mysteries of life.
