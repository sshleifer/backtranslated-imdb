Ye Lou's purple butterfly film is a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against the Japanese army in the war in Shanghai, lacking Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura). Her former lover finds herself on the opposite side of the conflict. After the opportunity to meet, <br /> <br /> I agree with the examiner from Paris. This film represents a complex and semi-historical conflict for the story, without giving the only reason for the audience to care about their character or cause. The sudden change doesn't help because it seems unreasonable and pointless. Normally I don't care about dark movies. But without light, camera shake and poor movie making techniques in general, making this movie difficult to see and pay attention to, I agree with the audience as well. From Georgia that this movie "There is a busy editing style and a nasty movie." But I don't think it will help this movie. The backdrop of the movie is one of the most powerful events of the 20th century, and I don't believe you can do it fairly by fixing it as if it were Michael Bay's movie. Too many beautiful moments didn't add to the ability. In watching, <br /> <br /> Every actor has proper grief. Zhang Zi Yi once again showed that she had a very limited performance because she spent the whole movie in doing what seemed to be her best in her movie. However, at least she added variety to this chapter by mimicking and participating in the worst love scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. <br /> <br /> All of this is a movie. Very disappointing especially Saw that it came from the director of Suzhou He 2/10
