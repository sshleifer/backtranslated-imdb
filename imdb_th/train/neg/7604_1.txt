Sure it happened in the west But the name makes it look like it is western style But a movie of a female sheriff Don't make mistakes even if this is a bad movie about a female sheriff. She became a sheriff when her husband was shot. She's just a bit upset from this story. Her main goal is to follow the female villains as well. But the villain hired someone to kill her So this is what happened. The hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. The most stupid that everyone was killed in this movie is the new sheriff who will thank you. She is more likely to kill the killer behind the bar. But I think because she likes him, she won't do it. The killer also follows the mayor of the city for personal reasons that are quite stupid. This movie is very boring and not worth looking at ... it's not the best episode of MST3000 that they do. I can't imagine anyone seeing this thing without them because that will cause more pain. Corman is a low budget director. But even then he should know better than to let people come in one place.
