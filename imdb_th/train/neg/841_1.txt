I just watched this movie 15 minutes ago and I still don't know what I just watched. For the most part, I think it is a movie about the internet. S&M "Stars" of CD-ROMs that are realistic like online flash cartoons. She was killed by someone who caused the sister and the cracking team of two FBI officers to investigate her death. The murder department in the major cities of the United States is investigating, although most of his work comes from the CD-ROM method, which is claimed to be true. "Like the real thing," I know. Wow. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is the only person in the movie with the credit behind. He is in the movie for about 15 minutes and half is that he struggles with the main woman because it doesn't seem clear. I will not explain even the ending, because frankly I can't explain myself. But before the final scene, we will edit every movie in 3 or 4 minutes. In fact, they can run in the final scene and it will look like the effect on the direction of the cross eye and so on. <br /> <br /> All in every scene I get because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I can spend 80 minutes with other things and get more satisfaction. For example, playing that game with a knife that you repeatedly poke your hand for 80 minutes will be more fun.
