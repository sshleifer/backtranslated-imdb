Sondrach has a bad smell in this movie. But then she was a terrifying 'actor'. Unfortunately, she dragged others (including fans = real life Clint Eastwood to go with her, but what was Clint Eastwood thinking when he agreed to act on the subject? This one person reading one chapter should tell him that it is a true snorer. It is a particularly weak story. In general, there is no story or plot to add to the boring and poor performances, even from the usual good Eastwood. These perform any argument except a couple of times. This film is ranked in the top of the natural sleep supplement. Wow! Could the movie be more boring than this? I think watching dry or grass-growing colors may be more fun than the real smells.
