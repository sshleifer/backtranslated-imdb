It is incredible that it has succeeded in being a bad person on many levels. Scripts, acting, directing and selection of actors are awesome. The costume, dress and medieval language were completely scary. In a strange way, I really enjoyed this movie when I admitted that it would not be better. It seems to be a shame that people will spend a lot of time and effort in creating something terrible when they can do good things out of their location. (Although not very convincing! The story of dragons and knights that lack any charm to be found in other fantasy films. We just hope that the Lord of the Rings will be a little better! Oh and David's haircut, Tulip makes him look like He-Man. It's done!
