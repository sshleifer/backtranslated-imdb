It seems that the United States calls the United Kingdom police running around the teeth and you know that the Special Branch is changed when they stop working and go down to the pub! This film must be one of the unrealistic movies that have the worst "real" British police image that has never been seen before in the public eye. I can see that Mr Snipes may need money to pay back taxes. But what a good actor like Charles Dance is doing is a mystery. <br /> <br /> Worse than the low budget, the worse "B" movie of the 50s and half hours of suicide. And when I will not come back <br /> <br /> avoid it like a real epidemic
