The first problem that was clearly seen about this film was the slow selection of actors. Ann Nelson plays the grandmother here. Three years later, she will perform in "Airplane!" While a woman hangs herself while listening to Robert Hays. See Julie Hagerty. I can't pull that image out of my head. <br /> <br / > Matt Boston is fifteen years old with problems He has a headache. His mother had a nervous breakdown. His grandfather had a heart attack. The psychiatrist smokes, deciding what the devil is going on with this family. First of all, she hypnotized Grandma Nelson. Nelson recounts the full story in the first half of the movie. <br /> <br /> She and Grandpa bought a cheap RV and drove around the tourist traps in the California RV desert. Soon there was an idea. Of himself going out of the road and so Then a large stone began to enter. Elderly couples have appropriate fear. <br /> <br /> Finally, the grandfather had a heart attack after being trapped on the roof of the RV when he had not planned elsewhere. <br /> <br / > Boston's mother began to talk to some Native American mummies that she lay around the house. She dreamed of herself as a writer and made many notes about the stale corpse. Psychiatrists read detailed notes and use her imagination to fill in the gaps. We saw Ma flipping half. But her mental symptoms occurred outside the screen, similar to the heart attack of the Gramps. <br /> <br /> Finally, the patient with a little anti-Matt. Matt falls under a gun, hypnotizes and tells his own story. He thought the mother was coming out. (This was done in 1977). Obviously, the mother was creating a figure like a mummy of a Native American flying in the air. One meeting with Matt like a bee hits the windshield and Matt begins to act crazy. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist takes Grandma and Matt into the desert. Matt explains mysteriously in a wheelchair and now the trio confront the invisible forces. (And can't explain) <br /> <br /> Flocker doesn't have the feeling of creating a scene. One pro here involves RV stuck in the salt flats in the desert. In the distance, both of them noticed a stone rolling towards the RV. This was a small, creepy scene and was eventually overlooked. When the rock began to jump towards the special effects vehicle, it was clear. <br /> <br /> The scene where the RV ran out of the highway, then back again, used forever. The scene where Grandpa was trapped on the RV roof because it slipped down the dirt road forever Mother's conversation and mother use forever The experience outside of Matt's body will last forever. This movie takes forever. <br /> <br /> I was tempted to press at least a dozen fast forward buttons. When the scene is dragged, it is obvious that Flocker is expanding, reducing the fat here and this will have a clock in one hour. Do they live in an RV? The filmmakers never talk about the fact that bad spirits in the way of murder, they never kill anyone! <br /> <br /> When I miss Nelson in "Airplane!" I also think of other movies. Anything that prevents me from falling asleep during this time. Boston is scary as a child who plays as a fifteen-year-old boy as a lovely ten-year-old boy who has a clever alecky line for these adults who fall in love. <br /> <br /> Finally, Flocker writes And directing chaos The name is just the beginning of this exercise that makes the audience feel uneasy. This is not scary and spooky. You can still walk ... away from this tape at the video store. <br /> <br /> This thing is not rated and has a slight physical violence and vulgarity.
