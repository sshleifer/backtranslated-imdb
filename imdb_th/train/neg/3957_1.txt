The original Boogeyman is a silly but fun flick. It's not a great movie. But fun in the right mindset The third episode in this series Return of the Boogeyman. On the contrary, it's very cruel. Consists of two things First, the new image is cheap and lifeless. Secondly, load the recycled bits from the first film. The new material has incredible expertise. But not in an incredibly boring amusing mistake This image has a clear and fast collision without any effort. It acts as a framework for endless clips from the first movie. (And maybe the second time) and boys, they milked those clips from the previous movie? Sometimes the order is used again and again. New things added to these parts are sounds that are pointlessly explained that what we see with our own eyes. The whole experience of this viewing is something that makes the mind uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Boogeyman's return is an example of the worst exploitation. Type that takes advantage of the audience with a very cynical method I want the criticism to be short and to the point, because this film doesn't deserve more. Nothing here is worth it. This thing is worthless
