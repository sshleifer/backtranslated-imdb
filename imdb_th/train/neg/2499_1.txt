The actors of this film have better performers of New Zealander, some of whom I've seen in great roles. But this film gave me a deep shame to come from the same country as them The fake American accent is the first clue that things are going wrong beautifully. As another comment, rather notice the luxury cruise ship, in fact, is an old car ferry decorated with many colored flags that were stolen from second-hand cars Most actors seem to come from the excellent New Zealand short soap route. As if this movie was a dream at the Shortland Street Christmas party, which was a result of overeating and possibly a little Salmonella. You and directed by autism and you will get ideas. <br /> <br /> If you are an actor, I suggest you watch this movie. To learn how to destroy your caregiver
