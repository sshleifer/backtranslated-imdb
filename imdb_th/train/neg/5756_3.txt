This should be a great movie ... Meryl Streep and actor Jack Nicholson together as two newspaper writers Mike Nichols, director Eh. Pointless and predictable! Slow and not interested at all. <br /> <br /> It's a boy cutters who meet girls, boys, married men, women, boys, have relationships. Now there is a traditional concept! After hurling through two hours (Is it just two or not, it feels like six) I'm not sure if it's a romantic comedy, a tragedy, or a TV drama. forget I hope that damage to Streep et al's reputation is starting to heal, and the boss's emulsion begins to fade away. Not that it's a bad image. It's just a bad thing.
