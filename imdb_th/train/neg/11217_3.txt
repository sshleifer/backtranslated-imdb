So my wife and I had just finished, despite the threat from both of us to close it. For most boredom, the worst part of this movie is only a bit of excitement. The performance was brutal until the point that we laughed many times in the worse scene. (For example, a woman in the church) The dead sister who is using the paranormal means contacting her still alive twins, even if sending useful information. But she tried to focus on hell from her instead, which looks like a ring Then the police were involved - which I was confident that the ear plugs she found would have DNA above her - she planned to make the person who concealed her sister unintentionally dead I called it a scary plan because in the end she allowed him to kill her as well, which the film faded to black. Bad conversations, bad performances, bad ending
