From the beginning, the film had a slight flaw. The main character, played by Hayden Christensen, is a wealthy young godfather who inherits the wealth and power of his father, and he struggles to fill both his father's shoes and cut the straps. stain In addition, he had problems with having a heart condition and waiting in the limb that is the registry of the organ donor. There is also a little story that your first instinct is to ignore the important things later, such as his friendship with the surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his love for middle-class girls.

One is an impressive gesture by Lang, which comes from not important because of poor writing. Another story is a secret about the family's past, which seems to be pinned to the point of being unattainable. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the drama about the sense of good tea that was lost in the conspiracy. Badly written There was a last attempt to bring it back, which made the film flat.
