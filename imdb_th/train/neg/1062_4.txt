Ouch! This one is so painful to sit and watch. It has lovely and amusing evidence. But it was hell. From there, Matthew Modine was always a pedestrian and annoying, and he didn't disappoint this time. Deborah Kara, Unger and John Neville turned out to be surprising. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly play as a high-level team. I know that it's a way to write parts, and it's hard to blame the actors when the script and director directs them to make a lock. If you have an outrageous character, that's ok. But you must have good content to make it available It's not here Escape from the screams of this movie if possible.
