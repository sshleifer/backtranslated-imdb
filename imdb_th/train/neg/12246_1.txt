*** Spoiler *** *** Spoiler *** If there is a movie review based on location only, you may think that you are looking at the average animal, a horror flick. The story is as follows. A group of documentary filmmakers headed to the island to film a documentary about shark surfing or blood surfing. (I live in South Africa, so it was released as "Blood Surf"). It is accepted that this is an interesting concept, which if further exploration However, this is not the case with the blood of the film being the least due to the fact that their documentary was interrupted by a rather large saltwater crocodile. <br /> <br /> The script is very scary. A good example of this is that whenever a person is eaten by a crocodile, which is a frequent occurrence in this movie, no one seems to condemn. Most people who do in this movie are bashing the victim in a scene that is intended to be painful. But ended up laughing because of the fact that the dialogue in this movie looks very suspicious Another really frustrating thing about this movie is the fact that they have introduced the extravagant characters to this film completely. They introduced a pirate group that could see that it would add another 10 minutes in a short, merciless movie. <br /> <br /> The performance can be said to be a normal matter It may be more impressive if they do not have such scary scripts. In conclusion, there is no one person that has a profound impact on me. Everyone seems to be a caricature of water, and in this way, no actor has any effect on me. <br /> <br /> The crocodile is 31 feet tall and the feeling of this size. Clearly demonstrated from the forge of crocodiles that are obvious that they have prepared for us in the movie The death of the crocodile at the end of this movie is ridiculous and forged until the stomach changes. With the courage of the brave heroes of the movie, announcing that he had plans to fall down the hill and take the crocodile to lock himself in with a lucky pin at the bottom of this hill.> <br /> All I want to say that this movie is a movie that you have to believe how bad it is. Things that may seem like a good idea at that time have been suffering from a terrible chapter and the overwhelming sense of low budget, all of which make a truly scary movie.
