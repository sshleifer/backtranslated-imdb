Grand Central Murder (1942) Dir: S. Sylvan Simon <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> The 'B' medium mystery is one of the five films released in By 1942, Simon was the director. Of course he would probably get another Red Skelton movie or two on his schedule! However, Grand Central Murder is an unscrupulous film that is mercilessly minus the wit, charm and chemistry of the leading actor. We were treated in a thin paper plot that was hardly supported. 73 minutes. Bad performances and jokes. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin and Virginia Gray played with Nick and Nora Char-er. , Rocky and Butch Custer. He is a PI and she is his wife and a great partner. They participate in teasing "humor" each other. See? It's completely different. Heflin is the only person here that hints at even greater and better things, even though he is close to jerking in this matter. Virginia Gray is in another skinny man. But let me stress this movie like no other doctor. And in the event that we start to think that this movie is nothing like another movie (say THE THIN MAN), we like Sam Samene appearing as a dimly lead detective and having Van Heflin bring him thoroughly. All the important leaders. <br /> <br /> Fast. 'Murder' is the plan of the infamous Mida King who likes to exchange rich people until she finds more rich people. She was portrayed by Patricia Dane, who was Hedy Lamarr, version C until she opened her mouth and changed to F. There are many strange suspects with their own motives that want Mida to die. , Thugs, former lovers and impresario, shady theaters (Tom Conway, here bear the name of a character that is not likely to be 'Frankie Ciro') Maybe k Done before Millard Mitchell played the stupid police who ran non-stop, unable to stop thinking about the donkey that he had been waiting for when the case ended. (That is Millard Mitchell, the swordsman) In the end, with a complete storytelling method, things that we have never seen before, all the suspects gather in one place, where they tell their stories. he (In the incident) with a detective while Rocky takes a mental note The guilty person is forced to confess a lot. <br /> <br /> At the top of the real picture is a fool. I think innocently that there will be a true picture of the 1942 era. Middle, but alas, there is not only one first shot that starts. Thank you so much for nothing. Grand Central Murder. So to conclude that it's a wee bit formula. But Heflin is ok. <br /> <br /> * Â½ from 4
