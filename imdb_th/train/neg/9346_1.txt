This movie is a yawning story, from the title to the credit. It's boring to the point of boring and the performance is made of wood and arrogant! Admittedly, this is the director Richard Jobson who directed the debut. But who in the green world, a script that has been developed as badly as this? It seems that other funds have gone into government relief projects. (Scott's screen gave credit to surprise surprise) I almost slept three times and my opinion would have to be more inhibited. Please, please, Jobs, Johnson, do what you've done before directing this movie and return to watch it!
