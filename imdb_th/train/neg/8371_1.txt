I think it is quite safe to say that this is the worst movie ever made when I see an example on TV. I know from the 1st moment that it will be a piece of **** and it's best to avoid Avoid, but I was dragged into this thing by some friends. I walked into the theater with low expectations. But I hope that there will be a few cheap laughs to wake me up in the movie. "Comedy", called in this film, cringe the faces. Look strange and act like a lively gangster and the general jokes that we see often. In the current junk comedies This film is clear and the story is not only impossible to believe. But still predictable and boring The characters are very annoying and very dead. I never wanted to see this movie again. I would take a bullet to the foot rather than touching this piece again. If anyone I see says that they like it, I will physically punch in front of them.
