OK, so after watching an invigorating movie and wasting an hour and several minutes of my life here is a basic conclusion: Genie comes out of the ghetto ghetto sound box, making this boy have hairy hair. He shaq suck rap and I guess it. <br /> <br /> So most of the time, I laughed. I cried ...... but mostly I laughed at the jokes that came from the great acting skills of NBA Player / Rapper and Hairy Boy <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this film for college kids who are drinking beer with their close friends and want to laugh. Well, <br /> <br /> I will give 3 out of 10 only b / c Movies created from 3 wondrous wishes <br /> <br /> If I have 3 wishes, we will delete this horrible movie. And for everyone who pretends like Hollywood, don't waste money on doing this
