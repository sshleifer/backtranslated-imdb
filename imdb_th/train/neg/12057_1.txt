Charles Bronson continued his 80th slump against what could be the worst film of his decade if never In that he played as a detective who tried to find a pimp that kidnaps Asian girls and is selling her to the highest bidder. It is a shameful effort and the lowest movie ever created. Many people think that Death Wish's sequel is Bronson's worst movie. Death Wish's sequel is not a great movie. But most often do it well and see a lot. However, Kinjite is a fully boring thriller that is separated by lively racism and child abuse. It is a movie that really reflects and everything is getting worse because of the fact that it tries to preach about it. "Law and justice" that is too much to say In fact, this movie started with underage sex interrupted by Bronson and raped a pedophile with a theater dildo in Chicago, where I watched this gape with the awkwardness of this scene just to gasp at The embarrassment of pimps raping women in this movie It doesn't have any other issues except to take advantage of it. Actually, this movie is not well written enough to rise above the level of exploitation and deliver something that will work. Bronson seems to be a lot more things, but obviously This is too nasty to help. I want to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor ever. The order of operations is not good as well. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * from 4 (terrible)
