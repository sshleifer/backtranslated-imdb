Anyone who has been a fan of the original series or has a clue about the story should be embarrassed by this series. Borg doesn't come until Q takes the company to the Gamma group, the Klingons never see until Kirk will find them. 1701 is the first ship to use the name of the company .... Have to go to Berman and Pilliar to create ridicule from the creation of Gene Roddenberry after he died. They saw $$$$ and went their own way. It is not surprising that Majel Barrett is on the journey of Star Trek every episode to this series. I don't blame her for not involving this matter. Bad Baku. He's a great actor like all the actors. I like them all But the story is tragic and ignores all of the things mentioned in the original series. Just check the rank I think a lot of people watch Deep Space 9 (which was canceled prematurely).
