This is a scary movie. In general, Jane Marsh was half of the North Korean spy that Kim Jong-il sent to do horrible things for the American army in South Korea. She became a housekeeper for the American military family. They looked at her as a Korean, even though she looked white. (I believe that the actors may be 1/4 or 1/8 Southeast Asian people, not Korean.) The household starts to hate her and ends up sleeping with her. The way in which Korea and the US military in Korea are used like crazy Of course, the screenwriter and director is a white man who has never spent a day in Korea before in this film and has no intention to show true understanding of life in Korea, either Korean or American. Their pity, regardless of whether it is unbelievable, will make this movie perfect. Everyone who has been to Korea will know that this is the most garbage. In the end, the spy girl honhyol, North Korea, is killed clearly. "Atonement", a terrible movie that gives a feeling on TV.
