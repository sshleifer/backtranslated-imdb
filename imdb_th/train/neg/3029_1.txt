From the first moment, "this thing" is just a terrifying sequence of very short blurred camera cuts, while the overall plot has all the potential for a thriller. The story is terrible that says I can't. Can buy From the middle of the movie, the character's actions are not reasonable for me. Stop reading now to avoid spoilers. <br /> <br /> For example, Ed's idea that Edna made coffee for them after being shot in the arms of her son was lower than the experience he was right in. charge It's just a very stupid idea. Domino does not ask questions that she received from Claremont Williams from connecting the phone that had just gone. Shouldn't she wonder how long Williams will change them in? Those FBI agents do not seem to appear in their minds with a single helicopter with what they have for every reason to consider shooting mafia. In addition, what they do with withholding and leakage of information to Cigliutti is provoking a murder. It seems that I have to bid farewell to the justice system. If, as the FBI investigates, in reality, they will be too confused to repair if they do this. We have seen car accidents, which are usually seriously injured, at least if not killing most passengers. But made them miraculously injured by a few bruises The accident was immediately followed by the domino showing love for Choco, which came from the domino perspective without ever having an earlier incident. <br /> <br /> The whole scene starts with Claremont Williams's phone. It seems to me like curiosity. When combined with the frightening and uncomfortable camera work, I was reluctant to call the movie. I apologize for the wasted effort of a talented main actor, not a problem.
