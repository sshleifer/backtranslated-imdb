OK - I love this movie ... I'll give this movie credit - only - to make me a horror fanatic that is hard to die. I never watched this movie alone. I also heard many stories about the effects that were first released at the cinema to the audience. Incredible masterpieces .... Scary things and psychology make my pants scared of me. Oh, booing their hearts. Anyone who created this great movie, I love it. This movie is very scary - this is the most horrible movie I've ever seen in my life! Not what happens in the movie and the idea of ​​this movie is not scary. But what makes me always - is Brendan's great performance. The best horror movie ever. There is nothing that can be scary again. Halloween looks evil.
