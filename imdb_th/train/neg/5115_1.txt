This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I'm 64 years old and a football fan. I expect to watch a football movie in about 10 minutes. I start to wonder if the movie is not good like this. (Especially the show) how to enter the cinema About half way I whispered to my husband that it was terrible and he explained the facts behind the movie to me. Although I felt a bit offended (And can see that some people may be very angry if they are not Christians) who were preached in the cinema However, it is a big thing to get predictions and unrealistic behavior and above all is the quality of the performance. It is a suitable movie for the church's outing. But will be displayed in the church auditorium and not in the theater Do I go to church? Yes. I want to go to church when I go to see a movie? No, do I recommend this movie? Absolutely not !!!
