First of all, there is nothing wrong with education, Daniel Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah, and other prophecies. There is also nothing wrong with creating such a movie to try to present the gospel Therefore, my confidence in this film is not in sincerity or inspiration. As a Christian, even though it is amillenialist I believe that there will be many hardships and I believe that Christ will return again when he speaks. So even though I disagree with this film about the ecstasy that is not the reason I rate this movie very low. <br /> <br /> Not what makes me rate this movie very low, not Sincere or its message Quite lacking in the production of scary scripts, poor performances, and poor FX. This film was there with the most wonderful scifi of the 1950s. No, the film was there too. This failed to be a good age and probably dated the time they did. <br /> <br /> Apocalypse movie makers can learn how to not make movies The title ends But they failed. The series Behind the Apocalypse and Omega Code all failed to learn from this story because they were talking about FX issues and problems with outdated looks. But their script is still bad. Br> There are great Christian movies with a very low budget. But this movie is not one of them I was amazed that the MST3K crew never had this taunting.
