This film walks in a circle and the audience doesn't know where they are. At first I thought .. Hmmm might be a cool movie like this, but it just keeps doing, and eventually you don't know what happened. The female lead is a good actress and plays her role well and Psycho fella is creepy, but after a while you don't care what happens because this movie just dragged away. This shame is really much better. <br /> <br /> Say that women who are leaders and psychosis will have a good career ahead of them. But they will remember this movie to make them Know or be a movie that they regret that they used to do
