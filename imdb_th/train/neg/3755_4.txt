I love this movie. I will accept it. This will be the best video movie (straight to) that I've seen ... I and my friends decided to giggle and we will rent this movie. We know what to expect and we get what we expect and many more. When the red neck hits the tree by Sasquatch, we actually see that part about three to four times. It's a very amazing story. And why? Oh, the main character, why should that roll so much? Honestly, we know that you are in danger, rolling that thing doesn't help much. But actually, if this film is in you, a local video store to rent it It's worth the money lost and not bad as it is bad. But it's not incredibly bad Overall, the amazing integrity will be in store for you if you rent this movie.
