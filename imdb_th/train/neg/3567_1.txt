Families with Father Dale Midkiff, Mother Rachel (Denise Crosby), Eileen, 10 years old (Blaise Farah and Gage, about 3 years old, moved to the house This beautiful place in Maine Go down the freeway in front of their home every 90 seconds. The neighbors on the opposite side (Fred Gwynne are excellent) make them feel at home ... and show them pet cemeteries that children bury pets. their Is a sacred area that can bring death back to life ... but death comes back with a nasty mood. <br /> <br /> "" DEFINITE SPOILERS ** Stephen King's novel is a good person - it is Long but it develops characters and situations that make you interested in what happened. This movie makes everyone develop characters and play with violence and violence. Animals are killed in the camera. (I know it's pretending But was disgusting) The little boy was struck by a half and his coffin appeared during the funeral (In the seriously ill scene) He comes back to life and attacks and kills people, including his mother. (I wonder if 3 years old can hang her); Scary runners (don't ask) trying to help the family without a reason ... This film is used for audiences to get rid of death or horrible violence on your face. It's just off the path to scare you. ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The show doesn't have any help. Midkiff is awesome, like a father-in-law and a buffalo. But completely empty. Crosby is not very good. The two children are annoying. Only one Gwynne can record this picture with his good performance easily. <br /> <br /> This picture shows the utter disdain for the audience. Reasonable leap and having the character do incredibly stupid things (especially Midkiff at the end). (Unexplainable) A popular box office hit in 1989 that led to an even worse sequel in 1992. I saw it in theaters at that time and was disturbed by those. Watch also cheer the violence. Nasty horror movie 1 all the way. <br /> <br /> When you think it's finished and not worse, Ramones sings the song !!!!!! ("I do not want to be buried in a pet cemetery") beyond true belief
