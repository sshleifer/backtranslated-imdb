I was able to enjoy the happiness of the lynching. But this is just not good And not bad in the way that you might enjoy seeing MST3K. Enjoy it. It's a disgusting story like you can't find anything fun about it, no matter how much you try. I am very sorry to lose my precious life for 2 hours with this shit. You can tell by seeing that no one is asking to do it and everyone in that knows that this movie will only embed their career. Obviously, "Walking Tall" has collected enough income that someone decides that they can make their investment. If it's not the worst movie I have ever seen, it's terrible that it overrides the worse movie from my memory.
