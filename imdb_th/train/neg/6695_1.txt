I have something for this chick Kari for a while and as long as she looks in this movie, there is no blame. But after catching it last night with high resolution, I'm sure: that is the only thing in the movie that is not standard. The script is terrible. The acting is terrible. The direction is terrible. I saw in other comments that someone commented that the sex scene is great ... what? Not at all. When this movie is terrible, you may turn to porn softcore. But I will see white friends, blocking me from seeing the body and the scene of Wuhrer that doesn't give anything except tease. They should go to the cinema to make the film not a waste of time, but without this terrifying script, they should benefit from Wuhrer's look, because that is a solitary 2/10 movie just because she looks hot
