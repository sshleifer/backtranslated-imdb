Who used to write two or three shining reviews to participate in the creation of this film, words that are loosely or rolling around, and if this is the case, I want to get seven dollars back! The actors once again use loosely frightening words. Actually, almost none of them do anything, which is a relief. The scenery and everything about this scream, we have 7 dollars for work and one day of filming, this is filming in the backyard, right? Everything about this project says that the budget is low. The best performer is D list. Don't waste time unless you want to bring it back and try to rent it back. The bad guy brings it looks like a punk from a 70s performance that ended in marriage to Grandmother Moore Moore. The blockbuster video store in my area shows this as a return movie with the most sad comments attached. Even when renting 99 cents, this flick also collects dust. Some people really have to be indebted. This is a very bad smell and I gave 10 turds.
