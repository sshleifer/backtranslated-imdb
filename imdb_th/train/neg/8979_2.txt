It was Jon Pertwee who said "It is very difficult to be funny. But it's easy to be stupid. "If so, PASTY FACES is" very easy. "David Baker (as a director / screenwriter) and his actors seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing. Scenes and styles from a superior company such as LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING Using a completely underdeveloped script, very loud, Alan McCaffrey, especially having to suffer from this type of OTT performance, but not enough to destroy this film because there are not enough movies to destroy. <br /> < br /> Face PASTY is terrible in all aspects, especially the script. I can't understand why it ended up like it was done, it just stopped suddenly and stupid. Oh, and the other obvious mistake is that you need a visa to travel to the United States and a green card to work there - this movie will make you believe that you can board the plane and start a new life in America without it. Any permission - still receive money to donate blood in America - People I know in America and blood donors tell me that donations stopped years ago - You can buy any kind of weapon from a gun shop. As far as I know, gun laws in America differ from one state to another. But there is no gun shop selling anti-tank guns across the counter So we get the very wrong view of America from movies that are unrealistic. Perhaps this is a revenge for Braveheart in the perspective of the Scotsman. Perhaps, but this doesn't stop at the face of being a shit actor.
