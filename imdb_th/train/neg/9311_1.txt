The cover on the DVD and the disc is very scary. You would think that they made a movie about a sweet tooth from a black twisted metal, which is still a really good idea. But the film's actors are the worst. Ben's performances in Pearl Harbor And better performers I will buy a DVD. But fortunately I rented it before the plot and the script was terrible, nothing seemed to go together, so this movie was not reasonable. A bad attempt to scare you with the backward scenes is worse than what was used in the sitcom drama in the 80s and eventually it would make you want to slap your head against your home wall.
