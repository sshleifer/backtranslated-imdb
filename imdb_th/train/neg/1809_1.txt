There is nothing I hate more than congratulating myself. Kevin Smith deserves to be hung by his toenails to inspire all mid-level white gourmets to make movies about why they can't. Posed I am not interested in inexperience and low budget production. But really when I wrote it clear and cloying it really burned my potatoes. The money put into this may be possible for a truly struggling filmmaker who has a chance like John Gulager. If you look at Project Greenlight, you will know who has the vision and ability to fight the system immediately Everyone can grab a camera and create a talkative image that can't be said at all. When will we be saved from Smithon and the Whedonettes of the world? The revolution cannot come soon enough. Go to see the first attempt by buying Desperado or searching for Friends With Benefits. Thank you and wish you a good day.
