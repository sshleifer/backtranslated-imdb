Clearly, a lot of people really like this, but I find it a sensible baby and codswallop that is reasonably disliked by being helped by being forgotten by Jane Russell and a number of memorable musical numbers. Especially those who open I'm not with Monroe - you should play a silly blonde girl who isn't a fool. But she just came to be dumb Russell couldn't convince when she claimed to have never been in the gym before. Men are not as dramatic as planned. By a method that is not brutal But if it is classic, God helps us all.
