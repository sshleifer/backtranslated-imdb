The Lady in Cement is a true course in social anthropology in the late 60s. Writing is not a performance in the middle of the stage. I say - pure camp! Prepare to be offended if you are a woman or gay. Wide and ridiculous, as standard words and gay temptations and bashing were presented for what they were on that day. Most of the plays were thrown out, although there were excellent performances from a few outstanding actor actors. The action scene looks normal. But it's fun to see Dan Blocker playing as a tough guy and hard to beat and Lanie Kazan and Racquel Welsh are at the top of their career. Surprisingly, knowing that they are 28 years old and Mr. Sinatra, age 53, music score. You will get a point of view with friends who want a good laugh. It's full of them
