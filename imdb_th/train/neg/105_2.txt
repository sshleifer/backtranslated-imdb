There are many good-looking women in this movie. But alas, this movie is free from nudity. Grrrrrrrrrr One Strike <br /> <br /> Ahem, one story in this movie, happened in 1971, why the hell is the main character in driving Kia Sportage. Hello? <br /> <br /> As you may know, this movie has been published in a three-dimensional, three-dimensional format. And it's the most ugly effect I've ever seen I'm not sure if this work is not successful, but there is no 3D at all. I do not have the same problem with other 3D movies of this company. HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD Of course, 3D in those people also suck. But with them, I can see the appearance of the three-dimensional effect. <br /> <br /> This is a great child. Nothing. <br /> <br /> A woman who plays as a daughter. Thao eats ears, yum! I want to see you more In the movie as well, it seems Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
