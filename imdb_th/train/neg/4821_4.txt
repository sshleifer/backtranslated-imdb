Fiction movie (Shows the story, even if there is a credit "saved by") about a group of scientists entering the Canadian forest to try to find Bigfoot (they want to capture one and attach the device tracking). Science is mixed in what is a boring film of a group of people wandering in the wilderness. There are some attempts to create tension and fear. But in order to be completely honest, there is nothing here worthwhile to see besides the beautiful forest image This is the perfect definition of a film about exploitation. It promises you a lot. Look at Bigfoot. But in reality it delivered very little Recommended for insomnia only
