This is just a yahoo response that says that this movie is more realistic than the classic genre given to MASTERPIECE, Jaws. Yes, white brains (and other species of sharks, black bulls, oceans, tigers) are known. Good to fill the area where the victim is easy to find. Humans don't often make it on the menu. But sharks in this movie repeatedly point out that they show unusual behavior. Not that it never happened The odds of killer whales destroy almost the entire city, discriminating the human deeds, sinking several dozen thick ships that sink the North Atlantic ship and know that when some of the friends of "Nemesis" are near the water The access is slim and ludicrous. Like the jaws splashing a lot, the great white shark is known to often chew on boats, protect underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards, because they look like seals from below. The shark is the size of Bruce. (If you don't know, try it.) More than sinking the ship like The Orca (Hey! That is the name of the scam we're talking about!) It will weigh more than 6,000 pounds. I can go on. But i dont want to The jaws are amazing. (Better performances, better effects, better music, better writing) Orca is crap (loud screams from jaws, punch writing, the most nasty effect. Do not use experts from Columbia University to see that. Watch movies better
