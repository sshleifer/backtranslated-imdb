This movie is ok. But it overcame the claim that homosexuals are "Born like that" especially when women are able to leave unhappy marriages and just fall into the arms of another woman It seems that Kate's sex setting is open and closed like a switch, making the film look a little bit simpler. <br /> <br /> It's also a normal story of movies that try to push the agenda Those characters in the movie with questions or dissatisfaction with the gay lifestyle are identified as "big" and there is no happy media. It was both Kate's friends and relatives embracing her completely, or they totally disgusted her. This is not a normal matter of interaction between gay and non-gay relatives with friends. It is often a mixture of emotions and values ​​that come into play. It is possible to love people and treat them with respect without having to choose what they do. Sadly, the movie doesn't show this kind of interaction. For movies that try to show patience and acceptance, it makes me a film that can't stand! Then, at the end, Kate decided after many years that she wanted to be with the Mac and everything was fierce - is that really gay? Come!
