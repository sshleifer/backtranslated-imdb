A great movie, created with a budget of about $ 9.99, a very small set that is very noticeable, uses bad performances and horrifying stories about aliens that use meats left from the butcher shop as fuel for their spacecraft he This movie has blood. (Not enough to disturb) and the character with an eggbeater instead of one of his hands (Yes, you read it correctly.) <br /> <br /> One saving grace performed in "Special talent show" (How is the irony?) By the punk / new wave band that I think is called "I'm hot in the search for missiles". Besides that, this isn't worth your time even. At the level "Very bad. It's good." See if you are entering a magical alien movie. But others should avoid <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10
