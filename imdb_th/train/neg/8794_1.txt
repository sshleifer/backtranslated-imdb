I am completely bewildered why this movie likes to be alone in such a high story, especially from many other critics that are quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> There is one key word that Explain this The movie goes to its core - annoying. <br /> <br /> The most easily explained example of this is the use of the director. In the first half of the year, there will be a really boring reggae play about three times. (When too often) But in the second half, The Mommas And The Papas "California Dreamin '" is played at least seven times, usually at the highest volume. Godsakes Whether you like this song or not, you won't feel it. Comfortable at the end Just think that some people claim to have watched this movie four or five times. Which means they listen to California Dreamin either 28 or 35 times ... <br /> <br /> Repeating all unnecessary hyper (It doesn't help anything in this regard) may be an excuse if the rest of This film has some advantages, or if the story is related to it. <br /> <br /> But it's not. <br /> <br /> The only thing I think is interesting is Bridgette Lin is charging. Stay around and continue to play Asia The Invincible in rainwear and sunny. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that the reputation of this movie will make many poor people look and see. <br /> <br /> I can warn you that - If you've never seen HK movies before, don't start from this movie. <br /> <br /> If you feel like being forced to watch, avoid all the costs seen in the cinema. Fast forward and mute buttons are important tools for survival here. <br /> <br /> You've been warned!
