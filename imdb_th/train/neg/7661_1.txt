The title of the worst movie of all time is the movie that is sent out quickly and frequently. Most of it is exaggeration. But I would like to welcome Alone in the Dark in the short list of real candidates: Plan 9 from Space, Battlefield Earth and Pluto Nash's Adventure. <br /> <br /> When I watched 90 minutes, I was tired. It's hard to be alert, even when I try hard to laugh at the movie. But I feel like being alone in the dark (I'll try to avoid pun But I couldn't resist) when I looked around hoping to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends Alas, my friend and I have to give humor throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> So ... about the movie itself. To talk about action and effects because it should be part of this movie This film has evil creatures that cross between Xenos in aliens. (They are called Xenos) and life in Pitch Black can be opened, not seen at random. (And I'm sure it's random) and get hurt from the light There are still small centipede creatures used to control humans that change them into something similar to a zombie. All of this is shown with special techniques that are outdated, which may be mediocre in 1997. The action scenes are chaotic and impossible to follow. People shot randomly on the stage, a blue screen or an empty scene where the monster was inserted into the post. The light flashes quickly on a dark screen, causing your pupils to burn too much, while rock music rises in the background. <br /> <br /> And that's the top spot. The story revolves around a paranormal detective (Slater) who has a hard time thinking about wearing a T-shirt. The winner, the black wife, wears a trench coat and is not shaved for 2 days. And the government agent (Dorff) whose lines are related to the barking order All three should be ashamed of their performance. (Not that they had done good work before) and the casting director should be ashamed. Reid and Slater should be a lover in this movie. This film has the most awkward love scene I have ever seen in a movie between two stories. <br /> <br /> Then the plot is quiet. The rest is the best reason. The plot hole may have a collective ego of all three stars. The movie begins with a message and sound that explains the story behind it. This opening took more than a minute and the audience already knew that they were doing horrible things. This narrative opens up over and over again in an awkward dialogue in a fashion that sends clumsy and heavy hands through the rest of the film. And the ending does not make one ounce of feelings. Not only does it not make sense in the movie world But it is not reasonable. <br /> <br /> Finally, the direction of Uwe Boll. Shame. That's all that can be said. Using a camera to simulate suspicion He has no direction with the actor. Just watch the red in the scene where she doesn't focus in the middle of the picture. Extra money for ammunition effects And finally choose to use voice commands to explain something that should be clear to the audience painfully. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 1.50 to see this show at the second theater. And while laughter with me and friends makes it worth every quarter, I would recommend people to avoid paying extra for this movie, grab 3 friends and split the rent and tear this movie out again. /> <br /> Humiliating Uwe Boll is embarrassed that Tara Reid is humiliated by Christian Slater, causing you to shame. Stephen Dorf Embarrassed by everyone involved in this film
