As others have stated, this is a terrible movie from every aspect of filmmaking. The way they have famous actors known for making this project is amazing. <br /> <br /> Many people complain that it was taken on a cheap video camera. Yes it is a video But it's not a 'cheap' video. The thing that makes it worse is light, white balance, photography techniques and editing. <br /> <br /> There are many different shooting and editing techniques used in production. Intense and inconsistent light than using a cell phone to take pictures (ala Woody Allen), missing corrections (another Allen technique) but not doing well without real purpose. Lack of white balance in the kitchen, the scene is shameful It is worthwhile to see how surprising it is.
