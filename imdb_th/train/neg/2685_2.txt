I never pan movies online But I felt that I had to do it after seeing it. No one appeared at someone's funeral and said to the bereaved person that "My cousin has died. Why should I care about you?" <br /> <br /> Deleted by propaganda called "art". Use deafness as a mechanism Any deaf person who feels the vibrations of immensity is likely to be examined and ignored I'll stay away: the disaster is one; This is another. I hope these filmmakers aren't arrogant. (And not appropriate)
