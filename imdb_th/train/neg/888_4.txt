This is a movie I can't wait to see! So finally I picked it up and I was quite disappointed. For the beginning of the movie, I don't really talk about New York, just pictures of buildings that are confused, streets, bridges, and cafes. The movie is in this film, I know it's a remake, but it's not a French style remake! However, here you will notice elements that remind you of French movies, such as long and messy scenes, little talk, and of course everyone is smoking French style! The story follows many lives. (Too much for my taste) and they seem connected in the end I feel that there are not as many devoted characters as possible in the story. The movie is too short to cover everyone's fate. Happily ended, so we can see 30 people, about 5 minutes per person, and you have 120 minutes! If you like conversations, scenes and things, this isn't the movie for you! I give 4 just because I love New York and I love actors!
