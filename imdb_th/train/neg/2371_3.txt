I'm not a big fan of Freddy Krueger, but that doesn't mean I don't like Robert Englund and his other Nightmare in Elm Street. I think Robert is a very good actor. No one plays Freddy Krueger better than him. But not wrong. Robert, this movie is sucked. The performance is terrible. The plot is really weak and Freddy Krueger is only part of an actor who is watching. Sometimes the sequel may be better than the first part, for example. Friday at the 13th franchise (I think the remake is the best in the series), but this is not one of those movies. The original is very good. No. 2 in my opinion. I do not see other people, no matter what you do. Do not make the same mistakes as I do by watching this shit.
