I see this for free. Thank you and hope it's better. But actually it's the same old stuff that the movie studio seems to have influenced us over the past decade. <br /> <br / > Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston plays the opposite pair - but they are attracted to each other. <br /> <br /> If the plot doesn't take you by surprise and makes you excited> <br /> A lot of jokes and fart Halfway through the movie, I became aware that Ben Stiller was not a joke. But he tried hard And Jennifer Aniston really isn't pretty, but her hair looks good. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Samor Hoffman have to earn a lot of money in order to get in this kind of film. On average, I come to expect more from them. < br /> <br /> The interesting thing is I saw this after I saw American Splendor, which is a truly funny and original movie - and I compared the two in my head and found myself hoping that movie directors would be forced to watch both movies. after That will make them feel and <br /> <br /> They will start making better movies without knowing the name more than what this formula is best played on the plane.
