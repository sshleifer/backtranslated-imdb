I watched an unpublished version of this movie and realized it in about 30 minutes that I never had time to come back. I try my best to hope that the dialogue will improve. Martial arts will look realistic. In the end, special FX will look special. I am very wrong. I love horror. I counted one in eight, splashing water at the flick among the great people of the film world. However, this was not done in the eighties. If the film came out in the early eighties, the fax might have been forgiven because it looked bad. It is not so because it has no protection system. The conversation is terrible, with many bad chapters that I write in writings rather than suffering. I don't like hostels. I never thought it was too high and I didn't feel anything for the protagonist. But it shines to the greatness of the garbage On the back of the cover for the Live Feed promises that you will never see before. I'm still waiting for the promised twist.
