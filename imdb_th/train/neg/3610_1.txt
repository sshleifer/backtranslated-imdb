The patient escaped from the mental hospital, killing one of his caretakers and then becoming a university teacher after he went to a local college. The next semester, the replacement of Professor Sai and the new student group must deal with the new killing set. The conversation was so lamenting that it was hard to believe that I could predict lines in quotes. This is one of the cheap movies that were combined in the mid-80s slasher era, even killing the heroine. But this is just a waste that is not standard Scary acting, scary scripts, scary horrible effects, scary !! "Splash University" is just a gunk that will put on your VCR when you have nothing to do better, although I suggest watching the tape clean your head. Skip and rent "Girl's Nite Out" instead. <br /> <br /> Rate R for intense graphic violence.
