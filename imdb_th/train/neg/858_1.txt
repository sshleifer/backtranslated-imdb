I hate this movie! It's nothing like a book and just thinking about it makes me crazy. If you watch movies before reading, yes, it's a good movie. But King's book is amazing and this movie is not like that. I mean, the general meaning may be similar. But most aspects of the movie are completely different. Endings like! So in the book it was very violent and Danny and Wendy escaped a few seconds before the hotel exploded. But in this scary movie version of Jack, take them through a stupid labyrinth ... yes, there is no maze in the book and no reason Another part that makes me angry is that the Jack killed Mr Halloran! What the heck is the hero of this book and they kill him like he doesn't matter. Overall, it's terrible that this movie is terrible.
