Make a mistake, unfortunately seeing this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was able to shoot well from the beginning. But that's the last positive comment I have about this movie. The acting is very scary. I wonder if the real cocoa girl is hired? But it's a laughing plot. Actually, it's ridiculous and not boring. The only reason for this 3/10. <br /> <br /> ** Bottom spoiler ** <br / > <br> I want to talk about some scenes that really make the audience laugh :. <br /> <br /> Push the girl on the field: Who would think that the child who is pushing another child can do badly. Open the real eye. <br /> <br /> Take the bus: The girl is on the bus. But according to the world music is ending. <br /> <br /> Rolling under the clothesline: Wow. This shows the skills of the writer. In the room followed by raw meat and selling skills Why not just take her to show all three sins at one time? At least the movie may be a little shorter than this. <br /> <br /> Running down the stairs of the mall: Look, as a girl must fly down the stairs in the flesh that eats Dau. Don't wait. * Being * walking fast, trying not to break nails. <br /> <br /> Blood marks: This scene is my favorite scene. The red half of the marathon is completed by jumping over the stairs and crossing the bridge, only to be transported by car through the most unrealistic. Not only this But this suicide is performed by the most passionate young woman in the movie right now that is attached to the character for you. <br /> <br /> I want to think that this movie was created by 16 years. Old and their friends Sadly, met with the director in this presentation. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> But if you're in a ridiculous mood and laughing with a few friends .. then still don't think about it.
