This is the worst west I've ever seen. The following story is a common formula in western movies and martial arts - the hero learns that the family / friends have been killed, so the hero has left for revenge. Nemesis in a brutal fight This formula is often successful - otherwise it's not a formula - but the Gunfighter is the most complex operation you've ever seen. The script has a simple mind and insult. It seems that one high school writer will write the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity and realism. The movie is lame and sometimes the scene is just in front. The show was pathetic. Of course, some actors can blame the script. But others cannot use that excuse I hope I won't see Chris Lybbert in the script again. Every time he says that the line should be angry or means that he doesn't do anything more than the low tone of his voice and he looks like the boy is trying to do men. (If you dare to watch this movie): He wears new clothes that make him look like Roy Rogers rather than a hard-working and dilapidated cowboys. If you enjoy an unused movie fare that is only available to worship Hopalong's big Cassidy's imagination to get this But if you have more than two neurons
