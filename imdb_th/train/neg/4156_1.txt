Yes, this movie is not good. What's worse is that it doesn't have any benefit to its name !! In all movies, zombies and vampires fight once or twice. Moreover, we are not sure that the main character in the movie will be the exact vampire. Some people may argue that they try to "diminish" or make it "realistic" but it's boring. More than half of this movie takes place in the car. Scenes that occur elsewhere do not have much to boast about. In addition, there is no clear rival, and finally you don't know what happened in the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> However, I would say that for this film, the production value is low. It is surprisingly appropriate and has been played. <br /> <br /> Everybody is free to show movies. But it is not like this for a large audience (if any) <br /> <br /> "worse than the killing scarecrow"
