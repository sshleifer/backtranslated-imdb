In the third installment of the series, Phantasm, Mike and Reggie chase after a tall man, being rescued by a happy 9-year-old G.I, a black Jane and the soul of Mike's deceased brother. (He died in the original dream) Number 3 is a frustrating sequel, due to the comedy and black stories that are less inspiring and exciting in the Phantasm II movie. Reggie's ability as a lover and his talent as a stand-up comedian The humor in the previous film was more arid and oppressed, which was better suited to this kind of story. In addition, the setting is not disgusting here, including the continued presence of the tall man (Agnus Schrim). Still have a lot of blood But not yet half the satisfaction this time However, watch out for the severely cut version because it shows the most delightful killing outside the screen. The entire Phantasm series is the lifelong success of Don Coscarelli, who wrote and directed 4 episodes until the fifth episode in production. The first one is the semi-cult classic, the second is the horror of blood and violence, and the rest can be easily crossed. A. Michael Baldwin returns to Mike. Although James LeGros will show his character better in Phantasm II
