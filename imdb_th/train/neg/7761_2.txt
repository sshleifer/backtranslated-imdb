After a power outage in a zoo on a remote island, a genetically modified sabertooth tiger is in a loose habitat and molting of the island. Sci-fi channels create some "original" bad movies But I think this may be the worst! Writing and directing "Jurassic Park", which is not good, offers an ancient idea. (The mad scientist who thinks that the person who was killed by the monster thinks it is This movie is horrible death, etc.) and not surprisingly no doubt. The special effects are brutal. The puppets in wild animals with bad names look like rigid dolls, but CGI, which makes computer-generated dinosaurs in "Walking with Dinosaurs" like real life. By comparison, it is just terrifying. Have some blood But most of it looks unreliable Oh and the death scene of scientists at the end is one of the worst things I've seen for many years. I can't even laugh that it's so bad. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this terrible person. <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> Oh And this is an interesting little story for you. This film borrowed the song from the sci-fi movie "Alien Hunter" in 2003, which is superior to the shit of this piece.
