This is the worst sequel on the face of the film world. Again, it's not done since The killer is still killing for fun. But this time he was killing people who made a movie about what happened in the first movie. Which means it's the most stupid movie ever. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this story If you value one precious hour in this movie, don't watch it. You have to ask the director and the person beside you, what makes him do it. Because it does not include the horrors, actions and original crimes
