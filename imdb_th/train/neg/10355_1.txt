I love this book since my fifth grade teacher read it in our class many years ago. And I have read it to all students in my 3rd and 5th grade in the last 18 years of teaching Assuming that movies were created in the past But i can't find it My students and I are very excited when we hear that Disney has brought Madeline L'Engle's great book to the screen. <br /> <br /> When I watched movies, I had the highest hope. When the movie continues, I feel more and more frustrated. They are not neat. It's not good! I never felt disappointed with the adaptation of the book as a favorite movie. I understand that movies cannot be attached to books. But they don't need to change things for the benefit of it! Mostly, if not all, leaving the book is totally necessary! <br /> <br /> I kept my opinions at first and just listened to my students talking about movies. It's not just me Almost everyone feels the same thing - cheat the big story at Madeline L'Engle, created expertly! <br /> <br /> Why do they wonder if the Aunt Beast looks like Chewbacca from the Star Wars movie? Why can't Calvin's hair become red? Why did she not have the proper "witch" set that played cleverly in her name? Essentially, we all wonder - why almost all details need to be changed? <br /> <br /> I always dreamed of how this book would create magic. I'm still waiting to watch that movie. This is the only time in the broadest sense of time. I'll write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to work!
