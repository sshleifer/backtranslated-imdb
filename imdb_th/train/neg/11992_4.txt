I never read Gary Paulsen's Hatchet novel, which 'A Cry in the Wild' is a modification, so I can't compare it to this book. However, I would say that as a movie of its own, any adaptations or modifications are an undeveloped adventure that does not describe a few main characters. <br /> <br /> Think 'A Cry in the Wild 'as a less luxurious teen climber (Quincy, California, the only place to be filmed?)' Cast Away 'Jared Rushton is a 13-year-old Brian Roebson. Face to a small plane to visit his father The aircraft collided with terrain on the mountain until he abandoned somewhere, let's get stuck for a while and have to defend themselves> <br /> In general, there are three parts in this movie. The clarity of introducing the character is ten or fifteen minutes, Brian and his mother. <br /> <br /> Next third movie. (Which consumes almost everything) is Brian's "rough" story. These scenes do not have an amazing action scene. There is nothing exciting besides the many beautiful movies of the beautiful Yukon landscape. Nothing will put you on the edge. There is no real confrontation. (Except for quick encounters with children) and there are no major obstacles to starting entertainment or connecting with characters on the screen You may feel bored for a short time while we are witnessing in dealing with his situation through the original first method and then improving. (Using tools, etc.) for his survival It's like the normal time that passes if you're stuck in a real situation and that's about it. In other words, they do not wear meat in Paulsen's words when they translate them into visual media. <br /> <br /> And of course the third part of the movie is his help. <br /> <br /> There are sub-plans that continue to make themselves known at this time. Some conflicts between Brian and his parents caused a strong and rocky relationship between them. However, most will only explain in a short period the least interactive events that are short-term, which look like flashbacks for music videos. Every minute, singers from Jefferson Starship should start by singing 'Sara'. In addition to what the audience can pull out of the meaning or guess that he wants to fill the gap in the lecture, we get the story that gets back. Development which may be necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and establish a connection with The characters, whether they are involved in the adventure for Brian's survival or not, in the third part of the movie These are deficiencies in the storytelling that goes through the audience into drowsiness, as he struggles to find out what those on the screen are doing, and for me, almost screaming at the television for Say anything and Tell me more details! <br /> <br /> It's definitely not for me. A good adventure story, but for Jared Rushton fans, it's one of the last few movies he did. So look purely for nostalgia if nothing else.
