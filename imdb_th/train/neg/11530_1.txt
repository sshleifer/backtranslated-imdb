During the past 10 years, I have worked in three wrestling organizations, an indie professional, managing many professional wrestlers. (Including 2 celebrities, Backyard wrestling), running TV shows, 2 wrestling shows and voice-overs and explanations for many wrestling DVDs I never saw the level of foolishness, skill immediately, lack of talent and skill and low production quality found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. If you want this type of wrestling video to be a misuse of words Taken with a cheap video camera, it is the main video of children playing in the backyard The sound quality is poor, the video quality is not good, and the show is terrifying. "Wrestlers" wear temporary costumes that include hand-drawn tee shirts and ski masks and strike with a variety of items and half imitate the wrestling movements sometimes "Competition" on the grass Sometimes on a trampoline in the backyard All are treated badly and performed without any unscrupulous wrestling skills in the short term. Don't worry about this stinker. Whether you are interested in this DVD is entertainment or academic. (Both in my case) you will be very disappointed
