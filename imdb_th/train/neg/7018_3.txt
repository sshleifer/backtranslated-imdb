Totally forgotten Is special because of weak performances This is the first movie I saw with Dax Shepard. With my surprise, he has been around since the late 1990s. I think he is a newcomer because of his horrifying performance. I can say the same thing as Liv Tyler. Although I can see her doing well in other films, she gives a strange personality to Claire Cooper. Liv is not an actor who makes the characters have a fierce and emotional personality Diane Keaton But it was quite strange to see her speak in her role It seems that overall there is no good chemical relationship between the actors and I think Diane Keaton feels like that. She is a great actor. But appears to be slightly superior in this film Felt like she just wanted the film to end as soon as possible I will not blame her
