The movie is horribly broken !! Nothing happened There are no train ghosts, almost no mystery, no interest. The constant and brutal attempts at the comedies were painful. Everything else is pathetic The location is stupid: not a group of people stuck in the middle of the place because their trains are held for less than 3 minutes. What? And the railroad made them no longer in a heavy storm? I think not. Oh, they can walk 4 miles in the dead black fields. Hmmm. Sure, or they can force themselves in the hospitality of the railway and stay at the train station. Then that there is nothing but the most boring, without a ghost or interest. <br /> <br /> So boring that it seems impossible. <br /> <br /> This should be added. Go to LOST FILMS !! aargh !!
