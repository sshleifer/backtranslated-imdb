Trailers for this film are better than movies. Anything that loses talent and money Hopefully I will wait for this movie to come on the DVD, because at least I won't leave 9 dollars. This movie has no mark. What could be a great movie for every actor turned into the best B movie. The movie moved very slowly and when I thought it would go somewhere, it was almost done, but it wasn't. The story of twisting and closing movies that are unpredictable and this movie doesn't offer anything. The whole thing about how everyone is wondering what is good. But not sure if it is the way it is directed, lighting, delivery, writing or anything Lots of things for I was very disappointed in this movie and I told everyone not to see it. The wonderful saxophone music has made the movie worse as well. And the ending has nothing to do with the rest of the movie Disappointing things
