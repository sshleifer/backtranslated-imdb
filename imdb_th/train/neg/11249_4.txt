Looking beautiful? Of course, I have seen some movies look good sometimes. Sky Captain and the future world use distinctive movies, computer graphics and futuristic creative designs to create a familiar world in the past. But there is something quite new The period seems to be the 1930s or early 40s. The movie tells of a recent attack in New York City by an army of automakers stealing generators and things that cannot be explained for some reason. In addition, the mysterious disappearance of the relevant scientific minds occur simultaneously. Who can stop them and save the world? Okay, don't believe that it is Sky Captain himself and his clever journalist fans are always hot for leadership and in the trusted sidekick. What Captain Sky has in the atmosphere and graphics, it lacks in storytelling and style. The story for this movie is ridiculous. Which was said that the film will give a feeling like the serial number of the movie publication of yesteryear They have a story that is quite far away and bad performances - but without them at all and I don't mean they have a budget and a big name in this movie. Scholars who have won two awards, actors and Jude Law can keep this movie, but who would think, but Captain Skye sank miserably. Even though it looks completely dark But I found myself hoping that the film would end and I could continue to live I have a little interest in matters that generate little interest. I'm not interested in shooting glib photos. Paltrow is very bad. Jolie is a joke that has a role without almost anything. The law cannot be a tradition. One whole liner on his shoulder is limited. I mean, take your face. He's not Wilmith Mel, Gibson or even Wesley Snipe. The sad thing for Sky Captain, at least for me, is that it has many promises. But still deliver very little I'm bored for ten minutes in the movie - waiting for something to ask for my attention - and it never comes.
