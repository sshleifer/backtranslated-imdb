This may be a lovely movie for my children, my nephew once. He was watching it for the second time that I was watching some parts with him. <br /> <br /> When the little bear disappeared in the ice and he was in the water, he tried to get a piece of ice. Come stupidly stupid. "<br /> <br /> I don't want my 3 year old nephew to watch movies with this kind of words. <br /> <br /> That's the reason for being ranked for Children should be friendly with children. That's what I expected. Led by the warner brothers and G graded. I expect that this will not be sworn in there. Words are not suitable for movies in most places as it seems to be added later. And the movie will be drawn in many parts
