There is a reason to go straight to this video, with a foul odor. Nick Cage plays Johnny in an unsightly sex in the church and other scenes that are tacky. Judge Reinhold as a cuckold husband - but the movie itself, with its own content about degradation and revenge, is not good. But it is a good movie for the competition. The matter is not important because there are very few people who see it.
