This film has some fantastic noir / conservatives, and it tells the story of the sugar-free glaze of Hollywood, just because it's an independent foreign film. But some scenes continue for too long (Especially for weddings) and I found that the dialogue, acting that is unrealistic and unrealistic, is more suitable for the stage than the screen The movie continues Most characters are Italian-American or Italian immigrants who live in New York at the age of twenty and thirty. But their conversation sounds like they are practicing Shakespeare's plays while they mix cement and put bricks. In the end I laughed and not because the filmmakers wanted me to do it. I guess the arrogant poems may be protected by saying that the characters should be able to speak Italian, and the dialogue is literally translated as they say. But it didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> Another conversation made me laugh for a different reason: the son of the main character who was born and raised in New York in 1920. Suddenly took a lovely lilting. English accent. I just guess that this is related to the fact that this movie was created in England. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 'A' for effort and intention. But is a much lower level for operation
