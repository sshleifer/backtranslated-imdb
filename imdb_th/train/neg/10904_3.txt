I hired this movie in the hope that there would be a couple of voices, hoping to make me a lot of fun. But I was very misunderstood This movie shows a little short humor and pathetic jokes that make me feel ashamed of hiring ... from the 10-15 year old group. Worth not more than 3 points. Recommended for anyone who doesn't want to waste 2 hours.
