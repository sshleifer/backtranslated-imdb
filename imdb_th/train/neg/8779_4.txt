As a movie fan, White Noise is the most frustrating thing because the filmmakers of this film are quite good, well lit, the camera works well, the right direction. But as a movie, it is just as predictable as other movies called 'horror movies that the market has just been flooded. Although it has a little 'chill factor' But the whole concept of E.V.O (electronic sound phenomenon) seems unbelievable. This film does not explain the reasons for the incident. But go ahead with them The show is far from the heart blowing, the main character that shows emotions, not like horror / horror movies. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's not a movie that I will buy on DVD and will not recommend anyone to hurry out go look .
