Reading all these positive reviews, I found myself dazed. How is it that many people are happy with what I think is a badly bad modification of my favorite Jane Austen's second novel? There are many problems with movies already mentioned in some comments; Just put it into chaos, overload and disorder from the opening of the credit to the end of being killed. <br /> <br /> While many characters are not correct. Worthy for them, the worst thing is Paltrow. I am very happy with her performance in some roles. But here she is disgusting - she is self-conscious, nose, narcissistic and disconnects from her characters and those around her. A very frustrating attempt - even though Emma might not be able to help this film.
