I like watching movies at the end. I like B-movies. I hope I like this movie. <br /> <br /> I can ignore the bad effects, songs that are often brutal. I can ignore the unexplained events and the fact that the film relies on deus ex machina. I can ignore the fact that people who struggle with hunger and try to reach world peace are bad people. None of these things killed the movie. The thing that kills this movie is it's boring and simple. Nothing actually happened Almost every scene in the movie is designed to push the morals of the filmmakers for the audience, with the cost of having a linked story or any doubts. <br /> <br /> Give B-movie entertainment. Look elsewhere. This movie is boring.
