This movie is a terrible excuse for ... The first movie, the casting is better than Katelyn. The main character doesn't look like her TV mother. <br /> <br /> The plot is also so pity It's very old and predictable. The ending is very frustrating and wonderful. (But that's all I will say about that) <br /> <br /> Nails in the bag, even though the scene where Katelyn (Jordan Hinson) should cry, but the woman can't cry by order! No tears poured down on her face. She is not an actress. She laughed like a fake laugh like Hillary Duff in lizzie Maguire (sp?). That was when the movie started from bad stories to bad stories. Looks like you're really acting. <br /> <br /> Short: This movie is really bad! It is a mix of all children's movies that have been clich√© since the 1990s that everyone is bored - even worse! <br /> <br /> I give it as 'F' because it's hard to sit and watch (b / t / w I'm taking care of my child when I see it) <br /> <br /> However, you may like If your 9 or lower;)
