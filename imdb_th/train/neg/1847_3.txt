SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER is another example of what happens when you have a lot of people that are not gathered to create "violent" horror movies, performances, production, stories, FX and more ... Go out of the window to create "shock-value". Now don't understand me wrong - I think I am a gangster of the movie "Shot" and who is better / better - but still good to see some talent. From people involved <br /> <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC Save the life of Harry Russo, manic drugs ordered to kill him from his ventriloquist Rubberneck. He killed the victim, Buzzard and a few other people and screamed that he hated "Hu-uh" how much (that is, "prostitutes" for people who do not speak New York language ...) and he is still How are you Wanting to rape them in the ass, there are a few weak necrophilia scenes that have very little wounds and some nudity that mixes a bit - but there's nothing you've never seen in a better movie ... <br / > <br /> The only redemption I can be found in movies that are often retarded. (Unintentionally) hilarious screaming for our main man Harry. He continued to go about the need to kill everyone and put them in the ass and it became a joke in no time. In fact, I almost want to believe that it should be a homo-erotic story with this movie by talking to the ass and Harry's constant image that is running around in all honesty. That is more neutral in this film. Then, some chicks that show some T-and-A (and the full forehead for good measure) SCHIZOPHRENIAC That looks a little funny as a watch, but I can recommend this to those who want to say that they watch a movie called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER Honesty - the name by far - is the best thing about this trash ... generous 3.5 / 10
