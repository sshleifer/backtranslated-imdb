I think this movie is ok. But very disappointed that they did not capture the true picture of his life I expect to see his mother as a real Jamaican. That makes me crazy. Just watching the beginning of the movie tells me that this movie is not correct. Which I completely lost interest in just a few seconds from the beginning of the movie I was very disappointed. It's like watching the story of Mark Anthony's biography and let Arnold take on this role. I don't know what writers think about precious movies, which I'm sure his mother played an important role in his life. I will say that this movie is okay above from Fla. Important !!!!!!
