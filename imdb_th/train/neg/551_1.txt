I have passed AFI's top 100 comedy program and have to say that this is one of the worst things. Not just 90 films in the list I've watched. But it's a movie I've seen Drunken, sometimes funny, Dudley can't. Lisa almost makes it worth it, but alas ... just go and see the development of the catch if you want to see her in good things. Seriously, Dudley laughing and drinking should be funny? I would like to recommend almost all movies in AFI's first 100 comedies for more laughs. If you want to see "drunk" more fun, try The Thin Man. In general, movies that are more fun than any movie that Marx Brothers will kill (especially if you're drunk like Arthur)
