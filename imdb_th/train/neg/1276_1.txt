This is the worst single movie I've ever seen. Let me say it again: This is the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It has a mark of bad movie earrings: errors, continuity, bad writing, acting. Bad music is not good. I think there are a couple of points in horror movies. The first is that it should be wondering enough to make you scared. This film has been and f in this category. The second point is that when the character dies or the bad things happen to us, we should pay attention. This film also received F on this matter. <br /> <br /> The first story, a woman being threatened by a wild dog, for fear that this will happen to her. The next story, the OCD man, died from being unguarded and talking to his dead friend. Oh, and there is a terrifying and terrifying story of a roommate, you can choose a topic that is more interesting and less common than being alone in the house, being an introvert, and having friends room? All these stories appear in the virtual reality hallucinations induced by a doctor who uses it himself. Wow, stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me explain something. I enjoy watching horror movies. Not good and laughing at bad things I can't do this with this one. It's the most painful to sit and watch. Don't be under any circumstances. Watch this movie. You will regret.
