I heard that this movie is more quirky than the movie director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Tubarell, Snatch) directed earlier. The problem is that it may be too stylistic. In general, Jake Green (Jason Statham) was released from prison after seven years alone and within two years he bet on his money. He is ready to seek revenge against the violent casino owner Jake is sent to prison. Dorothy Middle (Ray Liotta) In this process, the doctor tells Jake that he has three days to have. Live because he is dying from a rare blood disease. Oh and Macha makes the man hit him. Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) begged Jake to pay back Jake and work strange for them. Go with Jake to describe The incident occurred during the three days before the big reveal was about Zach and Avi Macha and I think that's what it is. Starring Terence Maynard as Paul France, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as Sorter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith, while Doreen, a sequence that involves a slight movement that repeats lines twice in different views and changes in speed over time and these things are irritating to the point of confusion and boredom causing it. Is a crime drama Poor!
