I have to shut down after about 15 minutes .. <br /> <br /> I hope it gets better. <br /> <br /> What I see is badly done, directed and written. <br /> <br /> This film should not be released directly on DVD. <br /> <br /> The leading character, the best bride from HELL, has a huge ice statue falling to kill her. She's a nasty person. I'm not sorry for you. She ended up there in heaven and was still disgusting. I left it for a long time. <br /> <br /> Eve Longdoria plays as her & I hope I won't see you again. <br /> Paul Rudd, the normal actor, can't do anything wrong in this song. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs (no teenagers) <br /> <br /> I Like a comedian But not a fool about fool. <br /> <br /> Score: * (from 4) 30 points (full 100) IMDb 2 (out of 10)
