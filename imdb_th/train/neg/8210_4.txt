OK, this is: "Nazi climbers befriended the Dalai Lama." What we do is first, we get a big star without knowing how to make a German accent, and we let him struggle between France, Germany, America and England for a long time. Over 2 hours, then we cook a series of events that are not fiercely feasible and divide them from each other very widely. But to make sure that the audience doesn't fall asleep, we put ridiculous details like our heroes smoking at a height of 22,000 feet. Naturally, we have to remember that our target audience doesn't want to read too many subtitles, so we Therefore, every character, even the lowest farmer in the Forbidden City in Lhasa in 1943, speaks perfect English with a suspicious accent Of course, the hardest part is how to deal with the spiritual and political perspectives of the story. So what we do is: We have the Dalai Lama as friends with the Nazis who have been reformed at this time because the latter is very good at Radio movie screenings Ancient cars and other equipment that represent the freedom of Western capitalism On the other hand, our heroes learned from a vague minor group that did not define religion which had never been taken or treated seriously. In addition, we have many scenes with heroes showing all respect and protocols that the Tibetan society left following the Dalai Lama, even as we pretended that the hero had a profound and profound respect for these people and spiritual leaders. their In other words, we just expect the audience to believe that this man is a Buddhist in his own way, even though we ourselves do not seem to know how his changes have occurred or we want it to go. How far and last, but not the end, we put statistics on the end of the film that the Chinese people treated the Tibetan people astoundingly. (Which is absolutely true), so we are open to accusations that we have made the movie "Politics", even though it is not so organized. Zat is my opinion. Do you make zink? Can you create a ZIS movie?
