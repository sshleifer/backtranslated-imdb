Vampires and zombies aren't really original names ... <br /> <br /> Nasty lesbians Semi-Vampires and Two Zombies are hit by cars: the appearance of special guests by Bob, lesbian, gypsy, witch and her dog, random women with special powers and Catholic school Girl Short Skirt Zombie Choir <br /> < br /> In the box: Warning: There are no short stories, only writers and directors will understand the end or anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, though I love bad movies. I love vampires. I love zombies. Hell, I still enjoy Lesbians This movie combines the three stories with a vague and confusing plot. (Or does not exist) Scary conversations (I mean READY BAD) STUFF and random conversations and people who don't have anything to do with anything (or they ... I don't know what happened in this world) Oh and I can't forget the green oatmeal 'Zombies' in rubber gloves. (Yes, the filmmakers are very cheap, they can't even cover the zombies in oatmeal and paint). In any way, the result is a great BAD movie if you can call it <br /> <br /> Should the end be unreasonable? Vampires are real nurses and other women are real mental patients? Where are the vampires? Zombies? Hell, where are the vampires ... You can't call any vampires. <br /> <br /> Never rent or buy this movie. If you really want to know ... Okay, I'll understand. Seriously, even BAD movie lovers can't stand. Should be number 1 at the bottom 100
