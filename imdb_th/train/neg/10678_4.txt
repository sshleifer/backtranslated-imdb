This movie looks good - a good actor, a lush topic all year round and a great opening. It's down from there Why is the camera with mobile phone? It shook the judge, partly capturing the scene and confusing the audience. Definitely a good choice. As if it's not enough, editing in the worst memory is a boring view - it's necessary if you want to enjoy it. Then it sinned the worst of all After bringing the audience into every situation that is unlikely and unbelievable to the point of exhaustion, they roll the credit without revealing the storyline - ending. How do you expect to be successful by Endless excitement? Doh! This film has a great promise and ends with a face plant in the mud. So disgusting Poor effort by writers and directors
