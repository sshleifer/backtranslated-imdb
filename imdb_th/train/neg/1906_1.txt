They played this game in the Twilight Zone marathon on July 4, and this is the worst episode of the Twilight Zone that I have ever seen. It does not sync with the rest of the series in the tone, even though the Twilight Zone is a series that is quite uneven and many episodes end with groaning. Compare this with the legendary episodes such as "A Stop at Willoughby" or "Midnight Sun" and you know that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton does what he can with scary and straightforward material. Came to surprise me That someone in his funny history will bow to the level of this event Although he tried to do something, he had to use money ... without other explanations.
