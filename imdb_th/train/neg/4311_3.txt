I watched this movie when I was a young man full of glowing hormones and it was a sexy movie that I had seen or used to watch. It may not be a great movie. I guess it's not I can't really remember about this to tell you the truth. I can only remember the sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. There is no woman in any movie that made for me like Cathy is incredibly sexy. Made in this movie. I haven't seen it since the first time I caught it on TV in the 70s and I don't think I would want to see it again since I'm sure it will be a disappointment. And i'm bored more than a year Still, when I think back in the shower scene, I still remember how good it felt when <br /> <br /> added later: after watching the movie again What was once erotic was quite tame. The thing that younger men and women still work for me is not as much as I have ever done, probably because I am not 12 years old anymore. Older women are younger than me. In addition, the expertise of all things was not recognized by my twelve-year-old heart. <br /> <br /> Moral: Sometimes it is better not to go back to the past.
