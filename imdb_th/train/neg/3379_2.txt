I just bought a DVD by forgetting how much I hate the movie "A Chorus Line". Changing everything that the director Attenborough has done with the failed story. <br /> <br /> By creating a relationship between the director. - Cassie is very outstanding Some musical numbers were accelerated and rushed. The hit song of the program received all the meanings when it was given to Cassie's characters. <br /> <br /> The overall stage of the performance is self-conscious. <br /> <br /> The only reason I Let 2 be because the number of great people still can enjoy, even if the movie tries to squeeze the happiness and naturalness out of it.
