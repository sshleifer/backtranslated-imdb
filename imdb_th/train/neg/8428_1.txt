Despite the positive reviews and high ratings But this is a scary movie Scary enough to feel the need to remind you how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The movie was created at the end of the Rajasthan during the time of India's independence struggle. What follows in a ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief. What the characters do and their behavior does not convince me that the character is in that era. <br /> <br /> For example, a married Hindu girl from a local village will have a relationship with the teacher. A married Englishman, knowing that this discovery should mean causing the society to be degraded and embarrassed if not punishing humans? Not likely, but probably, however, the same Hindu young women in the conservative societies of that period of India continue to be like Britney Spears, half naked in heat, engaged in the sweltering outdoor sex at the time Day in an open view that is not only an improbable blood, that is, a plot of mental retardation. <br /> <br /> Such stupidity combined with bad performances The car took me out of the theater an hour into the movie, so I did not watch the movie we just hope that the end would be smarter than what I saw in the first half.
