I am a curious and agnostic person and expect to enjoy this movie. However, after watching, I honestly believe that I can create a better documentary. Its argument seems that there are only four fake sources. (Although he was listed on the IMDb credit, I didn't see Richard Dawkins anywhere.) Edited together rudely with unskilled computer effects. Appear fair The narrative spreads throughout with the rebellious feelings of Christians almost destroying any possibility that this movie may change someone's mind when compared to preaching to the choir (like me) even though There is an interesting conversation about the history of Jesus. But the movie found an unbearable hurdle when it began entering Christian schools, where the director attended when he was a child, an institution which made him look bad in the psychology of the day. <br /> <br /> Although TGWWT does have Low budget But still have the opportunity to express his opinions wisely about the suspicious foundation of Christianity Of course, there are suspicious religious documentaries on the market and this film may help fill the void. The director chose to insult our intelligence with this waste, which ultimately seemed to be a healing exercise for him. It was too bad that his Christian rearing brought him pain. But he doesn't want the audience to listen to his coping mechanism
