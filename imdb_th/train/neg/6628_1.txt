If the level is negative, I will be happier. Seeing Sushmita Sen is good and Nisha Kothari has a bright future. But the producer and director destroyed the fun of this story The choice of angle, the choice of light and everything distracted from trying to remember what the story is. Oh, if the song and dance didn't make you tear your ear first The film can be created twice in 1.25 hours and is quite good, such as "Seven Samurai", but the director and the writer didn't go in that direction, even though "townspeople" will find their spine The film failed in many levels: editing, writing, angle, shooting, lighting style, scripting - named every aspect of this film - it's not good at all - maybe food from food vendors is also bad. I have never watched Indian movies (Bollywood) for 6 years and saw something that made it worse.
