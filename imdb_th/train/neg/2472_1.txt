Everyone who has the ability to sit and watch this movie and walk away, feels like it's a good movie, doesn't appreciate quality movies. This film looks insulting to high school quality. Movies like the Blair Witch Project movies have better cinematography and I hate that movement with passion! The story is likely to be a very good movie, but it is quite flat from the first 10 minutes to the rest of the movie. Someone said that this movie is about children's imagination. Okay. That's all good and good. But they can still do better with this script than what they do. I mean, come to India in the shop. Children look at the little idols and immediately realize that India and the whole story about the Indian spirit named Wendigo, right? What they said about the shop staff and she said no one other than me at work here, so you think it's okay, the ghost is creepy. But then she just exchanged with the idol and we forgot the little boy who saw this man. The ending makes you not only But wondering what happened to Otis in the hospital But still has the feeling of OMG !!! Why the hell did I waste time watching this !! This is a movement that I do not recommend watching. There are definitely better quality movies that will not insult your intelligence! Thank God that I don't have to pay to watch this movie. I will ask for a refund! For those who are easily entertained by this film .... It's very sad that you lower your standards to the level of filmmaking to say it's a good movie.
