This is a movie about the cruelty of animals. Under the guise of a marathon race, we will see a picture of severe animal abuse, including the use of horses until truly dead in slow motion. People who do this have their consciousness in cleansing the soul from the flames of burial / burning horses, which of course still die after being tortured to death. This film is one of the most slender films I have never seen before. As Gene Hackman and James Byrne close to the finish line in our stained animals, we should appreciate their spirits for competition. I want producers and directors to participate in the marathon competition. I will decide when you are finished, maybe about 20 minutes after breathing stops.
