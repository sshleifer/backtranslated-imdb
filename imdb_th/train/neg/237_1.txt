After receiving overwhelming entertainment from Mr. Brosnan's performance in Cad The "The Tailor of Panama" (which I rate 10/10 across the board: casting, script, story, editing, rhythm, music, Emotional impact, etc.) I expect enthusiastically, this film I was very disappointed. It is a script that is read, not a vulgar movie for rudeness, bankruptcy in all aspects, "The tailor of Panama" is rich and satisfying. Blame writing and directing the screen I sat in the theater to wait for "the good part". It never came. I didn't laugh or cry, even though one line conversation would make me smile. Worth $ 7 hardly.
