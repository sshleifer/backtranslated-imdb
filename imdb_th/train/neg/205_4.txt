I increased the opportunity to watch this movie without being uncut and uninterrupted. Remember the rahs and raves for it, but wherever that seems to be truly scary, it retreated and went elsewhere. Dripping water all over the house. Black rain. The dream of predicting the wrong turn in raw sewage was abandoned before they could scream. <br /> <br /> The disappointing thing. The face mask that had almost no face for Chamberlain presented a little disbelief. But confused what I found myself reflecting while the movie was wearing Surprising things that Aboriginal people chant and musical instruments in the background instead of the hubbub that seems to be designed to overcome the fear into the head. The idea that modern people can gather ancient gods, which Aboriginal people believe that white people with red hair are the first priests and many other possibilities are passed, such as shopping lists. A hint in another dimension. Br /> <br /> [Spoiler] In the final scene, it's not clear to me what the director is trying to tell. Big wave or not, then how big? Tsunami? Yes, it's a devastating thing. But not bad Is this the end of the world? From the waves? The last wave? That must be a terrible big wave. Why? Is the world a bad place? It doesn't seem scary in this movie. In fact, I do not think the waves will come out due to the shadows from Burton's face being blown. Is it just Burton's revelation? Heck that happens every day with people who lose it. It is not an interesting thing if it is only him. <br /> <br /> The scariest scene and the scene that shows the best weir's potential is in Charlie's apartment at Burton. Men are afraid of Burton's wife. Charlie asks him "Who are you?" And it becomes truly disturbing after a while. Unfortunately, this movie is not suitable.
