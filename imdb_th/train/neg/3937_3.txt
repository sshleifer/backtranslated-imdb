It's hard to believe that in 1997, David Duchovny was at the top of his reputation with X-Files, one of the best sci-fi series ever. Nine years later, he was almost forgotten and his TEN to create it on the big screen failed miserably. I can't explain why he is a fair actor. But it may be a time when he has a reputation for giving him an eternal role that requires a great ability to break down. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Angelina Jolie and her are very lucky in the movie. 'Playing God' doesn't lead you to death. Fortunately for her, 'The Bone Collector' and 'Girl, Interrupted' are waiting at the corner, and when Lara Croft arrives in her career, it is launched. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to tell about this. Too film, it's the only big screen movie of Andy Wilson and must have a reason. All are repetitive things and things that happen on the screen, most expecting the story of a former doctor who saved the life of a shooting victim in this area, only to find himself working for the crowd. The sound of the screen is not good, especially the moral message that kills every movie experience from the movie. You may not find a movie. But in a DVD rental shop or on a TV Try looking for something better.
