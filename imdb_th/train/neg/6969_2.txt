Blue Monkey (1987) or 'Invasion of the BodySuckers', known here in the UK, is a boring horror movie about an old man bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious poisonous plants !!!! The man hurried to the hospital where this worm came out of his mouth. Of course, it transforms into this monster and continues in chaos !! Even Steve Railsback and John Vernon are in the movie But I found it boring with a predictable story, a character that is not interesting, cheap effects and lack of action !!!! Horror fans don't need to follow this rare movie, you won't trust me so much !!! I gave this movie 2/10
