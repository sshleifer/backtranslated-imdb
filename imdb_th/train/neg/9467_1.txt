If you like Grinch movies ... go see again because this is not a good place to translate Seussian movies. Mike Myers's cat may be the most annoying character in the "grace" screen at the time. His latest voice / accent is terrible, and he laughs in his own jokes with horrible melodic sounds. No, even the children like this person and the kids laugh. Save your money and go see Looney Tunes: Go back to action if you're looking for a really fun family holiday movie.
