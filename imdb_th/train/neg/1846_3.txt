I like to be honest with all the viewers I bought because of Kira's sex scene. Unfortunately I didn't see them very much. The whole sex scene is short and haphazard, along with strange and repetitive background music, as well as all other B movies - it doesn't look like two people who have sex. - Kira's new lover is a killer! Very shocking !!! Why don't we nominate this film to receive an Oscar? I can't imagine how bad this movie will look if it has been rated R (I'm imported from the UK, ranked 18th). Put it down and walk away. So yon won't end up being a moron like me. <br /> <br /> Score: 2/10
