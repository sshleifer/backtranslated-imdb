While I watched this movie, it was very interesting to see that the black male edge This film takes time to show how the most powerful black man in it is. (Save the heroic moments) for this film. Other black men (and black black women) in this movie are in the background, which is almost invisible to Vanessa Williams' characters. Strong and sympathetic. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. In addition, there are three-dimensional, clearly visible and three-dimensional support characters that are soft and some white characters that are warm and dignified. But 99% of black men in this film have nothing but men. can not see Shadows that do not have sound in the background do not have any effect. Scary bugs like this But there is nothing wrong with the mainstream media
