At 21:30 am last night at the trailer of my friend's camp and we were very excited to see South Park (new episode). What is in my country, South Park aired at 22:30. And we decided to kill time by watching the show that was broadcast now. The father of pride I will start by saying that I only watch the episode. The first time I watched, I found nothing strange and rude. So I thought, '' Holy sh * t I have a football game tomorrow, so I have to stop watching stupid cartoons. '' But yesterday I tried to give. The second opportunity with the father of pride I found that it was a complete fraud of The Simpsons. Just replace the yellow human character with a lion instead. <br /> <br /> The second thing is, I wonder why it got the TV-14 rating. I found the Simpsons rude More and only the true vulgarity in this show is a non-homosexual joke The Simpsons are more violent. (Halloween special events) and crude. I heard that the creator of this series directed Shrek 2 as well. I received news from him that Shrek 2 is better and I think he stays with the family. too much However, I must admit that the proud father made me smile. (Even if laughing once) Three or four times <br /> <br /> All of this, I don't mind the father of pride. I don't hate, but I don't like. I see a better way from '' The Simpsons '' <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
