The central theme in this film seems to be confusing due to the relationships, settings, performances, and social contexts that all lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Kate does not seem to be in his composition. And the lack of clarity, direction and violence that was his usual flawlessness In order to make matters worse, the sign of his character is 'Che' and we have been told only. (By the direct narrator) in the movie he is not 'at' Che, just the guy named Che. The family relationship remains unclear until the end of the movie and when the family is divided into younger generations, go out to America So the ancient idea Other reviews discuss how this film represents the impact of the revolution in the family of the boys. However, the director's political stance is darkest and we are not sure who is responsible for bloodshed. So they lost their property (Derived from gambling profits) - then what? Refusing to stand politically when creating films about the Cuban revolution is a strange and funky alternative. No need to mention this film in English! Why do these Cubans speak all English? No wonder they were not allowed to shoot in Cuba. And if family life is the most important thing to watch here, it would be good if we can know who it is - we are all 'recommended' to them at the beginning - the right way to build clear relationships throughout subject! Most performances are shallow and unbelievable. When being closed, the 'special' visual effects are confusing and distracting. A reference to American movies - and black characters as Greek singers - without charge. I watched all the movies just because I was waiting for clarity or some issues. It never happened
