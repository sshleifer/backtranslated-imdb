I can't believe that I have seen this expect more. It started ok This movie pushes the boundaries of reality far !! At least the first one is quite realistic. It tore the first movie and even mentioned Joshua Project. Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie. It has one good message. Be careful from Big Brother !!! This movie makes it look like Big Brother is bigger than in reality. That is very intense. Even the make-up actors were not perfectly good. Some performances are quite good. Some performances are not really good. The script is completely usable at some point and sloppy in other areas. This movie is played comfortably every five minutes. I think I will appear in the original to return to the world ...
