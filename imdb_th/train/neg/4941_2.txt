Actually, I didn't care about Geico's ads in the first 50 years, so I saw them and found that they were boring and amusing. But seriously! This is the best thing that these people will come with !? This show sucks! It's polite and feels like watching the episode of "The Office" with characters disguised as cavemen (I know many of you will hate me because saying "The Office" doesn't do it for me). I understand: We have a poor man who tries to keep his nose clean and he has a crappy boss who hates him. The wise man fooled the intellect that could not really work. And lazy people who want to be accepted But that's what !!! I have worked with these people and found them annoying in real life, just like on TV ... Why do I have to lose another 1/336 of my week? See those types of nominations again !? Please call your parents and ask them if they make you head. Do you think after that? You also fool yourself to believe that this is entertainment.
