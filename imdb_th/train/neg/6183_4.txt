In 2005, George W. Bush began with the second period as President of the United States. North Korea announces nuclear weapons acquisition Pope John Paul II died after a long illness. And the movie "Into the Blue" appeared. The existence of this film is not as bad as anything else that happened that year. But this movie is poor and probably the worst in that year. Now in 2009, the United States has another president, another Pope, a new nuclear weapon in Korea ... and Into the Blue 2: The Reef which is better. Originally ... but that's like saying: "Get your finger. Cutting is better than cutting the head. "This sequel is a terrible movie that makes me bored and not interested in actors from Into the Blue 2: The Reef, written by a television drama actor who lacks credibility and remarkable weight, but is suitable for performing their bodies. Chris Carmack (The OC), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring boring and boring performances. I like some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bil l and Ted's Excellent Adventure), but in this movie, he can't create the lowest level of emotion or entertainment. This is not only But only shows poorly But they are also disgusting. I want them all. The movie from this movie is crippled and seems to have been created by a technical team that made a promotional video for the Hawaiian Hotel in Blue 2: The Reef is a scary movie that is better than the original movie, but it's not the same thing Which I said earlier, avoid all crappy movies
