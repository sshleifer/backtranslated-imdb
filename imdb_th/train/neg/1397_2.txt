Here are the "highlights" of The Brain Machine: 15 images of building swimming pools and houses. 15 Visualization of office buildings without paintings; 5 countdowns by skilled technicians 7 Close-up shots of danger And many technical babbling to show us that it is an advanced technology experiment. <br /> <br /> Many posters commented on the differences between the 1972 copyright date and the day Available for sale on DVD boxes That's an easy explanation. This dog sat on the shelf without being published for five years until someone dusted it out, thinking that it was perfectly compatible with the post-watergate mood that was not trusted in the government. After seeing The Brain Machine right now, the only thing I suspect is that it's all released!
