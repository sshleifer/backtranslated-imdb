This film is a traditional Bollywood value of the power of stars, confidence and love in the triangle mood. The thing that really bothered me about this movie is the ridiculous idea of ​​the mother's producer who is the agent. A prostitute who conceives a child with someone after having sex with a man (From a family that wishes to have children) is not a mother. Instead, she is not a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I've seen Indian movies and TV shows that were done 10 to 15 years ago, which dealt with this problem more wisely. The whole concept of this film is absolutely ridiculous and unbelievable. I know that most Bollywood movies are not reliable. But they didn't pretend This movie wants us to be voiced with the characters. But this cannot be done with ridiculous conflicts and plans. I expect better from Abbas and Mustan
