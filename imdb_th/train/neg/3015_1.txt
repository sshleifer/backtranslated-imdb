This is a bad movie. Not one of the bad things funny as well This is a bad punch. It's really painful to see. The direction is terrible by jumping around and the green and yellow shades used in the movie make the characters look bad. Keira Knightly is unbelievable like a chick and I don't want to believe that Lucy Liu and Mickey Roux. Kee signed a contract with criminal celluloid. The script is terrible and the performance is like nails all over the blackboard. If you haven't seen it yet You're not missing anything and will waste just two hours of your life in watching this wave. I've seen bad movies before and still enjoy them because of their mistakes. This is a waste of time.
