Kalifornia interferes. I believe there is no reason for this to be told. It's not fun and without social value. Technically, this movie is very well made. The show is a good rate and is the first. The story developed in an interesting and interesting manner. But at the end of this film, sick and nasty to the right, I recommend Kalifornia to anyone.
