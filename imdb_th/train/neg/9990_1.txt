After watching this movie in SciFi, I concluded that this movie was created by a group of amateurs who had never seen a movie before in life. This movie is an endless scene of strange events or "happiness" while friends are reading my shoulder telling me. The story is not worth the comment. But in general, the plane with the football players crashed into the Yeti territory. Before the movie ended, we were indented. But mocking in an attempt to run before jumping 50 meters, but tearing a man's leg out and hitting him with them There is no obvious danger. Yeti hanging from the cliff by carrying a pair of shoes and then jumping out and having many strange things happen. Essentially, if you're not on Saturday for the purpose of watching the worst sciFi original movie, avoid this movie like the plague. Or as my friend is reading my shoulder saying: "It's the best movie I've ever seen." My right friend said: "Techno fight songs can only be made better."
