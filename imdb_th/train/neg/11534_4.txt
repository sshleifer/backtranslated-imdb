* Warning * There are many spoilers. <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I respect Gillian Anderson's incredible ability as a versatile and versatile actor - This is the reason I can't understand her reasons. The movie when you see the script (or lack thereof) <br /> <br /> The proof of the movie is that in my opinion is a good idea and there are some forms that really stimulate the mind in it. But it ended up like Souffl√© that collapses It is an example of why I hate 99% of British movies. It feels too long. It's mostly boring and doesn't happen after the first twenty minutes. When you think there is an opportunity to increase the speed, it is disappointing, like Paula Radcliffe, running a marathon with a little fantasy style and a minimalist style so there is nothing more to prevent the audience from coming in. Their popcorn For the script, I can guess that the author tried to save a few trees, with the average scene reading something along the lines of "Alice: F *** OFF! (Adam stared Adam, ran into the forest) (Alice follows) Alice: ADAM! ADAM! "I wonder if the word verbatim might get more money than Kate Moss did for Virgin Mobile's advertising. How many lines do you not have many changes with the use of the f word that often makes Shazza, Bridget Jones's friend proud to have created a little main character before the main villainous event, which makes the audience without sympathy for More drama than drugs 'Oh, scary' automatically. <br /> <br /> Alice is not a woman. Court of sympathy either She has a great job, an expensive London apartment and a dead roof. But she found the screen with a bitter and unpleasant feeling before her life was the worst After a few attacks, it will be pulled back, which explains why she is like this. She grew up with an old military boots, thinking that teaching her to shoot his gun was the expression of the highest level of love, so instead of following her footsteps, she ran away to the big city to find some. Things for Makes her feel that her life is worth living But she found that the middle class Toffs who insulted those who were not rich enough to drive the Lexus and the luxury products that come with integrated security / entertainment systems (like Mr Robinson became a Cockney young priest). Some people pass me tissues. One thing that can be saved from this character is that she is played by Gillian Anderson. In the hands of the actors less than she would be the one dimension, but actually Anderson could inject a moment of humanity into this lifeless human being, especially when she sincerely apologized. Anger on the road In order to stop the attackers from attacking them, <br /> <br /> I can't say that Adam has improved a lot as well. Danny Rider plays with him like Jack The Lat Pla But good performances cannot help him from lack of scripts and lack of background characters. <br /> <br /> This film mainly relies on vibrancy. But the period was closed and it felt that it was designed from beginning to end For the shock, the most shocking thing about this film is a demonstration that is not ashamed of how Anderson's thinness is painful. It's almost unstable when seeing a brutal attack scene. On the side of the record, only British movies that a violent sexual assault gang would take to present each other's contraception before cheering on their friends - talk about the harsh lips brought. To the extreme! If this is a genre that National Lottery is donating to create, I am not surprised that a small number of people choose to spend their money each week. <br /> <br /> Say I hate this movie. Too much credit, I don't care about any characters to guarantee strong emotions. I want my life again one hour
