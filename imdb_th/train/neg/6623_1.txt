First of all, sorry for scoring 1 in this movie. (Nothing is less than this) The film failed in every department, whether it be movies, directions, preferences or performances. <br /> <br /> 1) In the beginning, the name of the movie is really Class C ( Although the movie is exactly the same as the title) 2) Amitabh Bachchan tries his best to do his best. But the weak script along with the pathetic direction led him to become a comedic character 3) In Sholay Gabbar Singh had 50,000 awards (which were credible) here in Aag. The poor were called by our heroes and only a few people were traveling. (With all automatic guns) makes Sholay like a movie in Mumbai in modern times 4) For Nisha Kothari, someone wants to tell her that she doesn't know the performance. Why Ram Gopal Verma recruited her repeatedly 7) The legendary role played by Lila Misra (Mausi of Basanti) in Sholay was replaced by a cheap price in this movie by Gangu Mummy Ramo. Please grow and understand that there must be intelligence. In your movie Each cor stupid in your movie as Shiva and Aag 8) should not say anything about Jai and Jaime Rivera model .. <br /> <br /> In summary, I was shocked to see this movie because it looked like a cheap and funny translation of the original classics. Please don't waste money and time on this movie. I think watching Aap Ka Surror (which I think is the worst movie possible) will be a better idea than watching horrible packages of stupid characters, bad music and miserable directions. br /> <br /> Thank you Saurabh
