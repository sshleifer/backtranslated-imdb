Where to start Okay, don't compare this movie to fight with the club for a ridiculous start. If it is a patch in the club, fighting violence, blood, gore and others will be more obvious and realistic. Secondly, this film is not a football factory - which is much more true. (And Danny Dander makes Nicolas Nick Kelby look embarrassing) Fair enough. The story is quite good and the fight scenes are well designed - with a good ending that I might add. But the overall movie is so bad While people are talking about the accent, shouldn't make the movie lose - I disagree - this is an error in the casting process or the lack of effort in teaching the sound, causing the film to be irritating all the time. Play this role Do not understand me wrong. Those who look good, those who look good with skin heads - but not football connoisseurs. I can go forever about the ridiculous football scene - the 'fake defender' situation. In addition, when GSE is going to play United up north, they go up on the train, expecting only 3 people - not reasonable - this is the organization that The true gangsters and gangsters shown in this movie About 5 mouse culturers in terms of accuracy, West Ham and Millwall did not play in the last few years in which they were in the championship together? Well, ten years, okay, and I'm sure that 'Bother' will be able to dance in Milwall's pub. Basically, a very bad movie that people will like if they have real football knowledge and a little clubhead. If you really love football and are passionate about the geothermal world of the rogue, you will feel as if this movie insulted Ross George's intelligence.
