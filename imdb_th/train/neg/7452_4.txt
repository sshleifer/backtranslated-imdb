For me, this movie seems to fall on its face. The main problem for me is the selection of Glover as a serial killer. I do not know whether this will be caused by casting or his behavior. But I wonder if Glover will depict the evil character that is credible. He is a good person and that is always clear in his performance. In addition, this movie is the story of Mill's serial killer. There is nothing new.
