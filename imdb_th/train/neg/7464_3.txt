I didn't watch all the movies. I can't watch all the movies. I stopped the DVD after watching for half an hour and I would recommend everyone who thinks to stop watching themselves before removing the disc from the case. <br /> <br /> I like movies. Mafia is both a sad story and a cartoon, but Corky Romano can only describe it as a tragic attempt for a mafia comedy. <br /> <br /> The problem is that Corky Romano is trying too hard to make the audience laugh. The story seems to be an excuse for moving Chris Kattan (Corky) from one scene to another. Corky himself has a completely overwhelming role and lacks the delicacy or ignorance - all his strange characteristics reveal that Chris Kattan expressed. Clearly that 'show' instead of acting - it hit you out of the story Each scene is completely predictable. The 'funny event' that will occur in that scene is clear when each scene is introduced. In comedies such as Mr. Bean, the threat caused by the characters will be funny because you can sympathize with the inspiring characters and the initial events and situations in which the characters end up in the telegraph. However, Corky feels that he deliberately tried. Fully to pull the laughter from the audience. <br /> <br /> If Chris doesn't play as an alien character (Which has never been connected to other characters in the movie) and behavior that cannot be explained completely (Except trying to laugh) and the funny scenes are unpredictable and stereotyped - all jokes seem too familiar) The movie can be seen, but it's not. Don't watch it.
