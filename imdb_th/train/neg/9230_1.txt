I should have a feature that name now that I think about it. Payments are not completely worthless. I had the opportunity to see it twice and the second time I laughed a lot about the cost of the movie. So I think it's worth it. And it is worth it for the anguish pain it makes me see first As other critics point out that this film has gained popularity in all aspects of the word. Not the first thought that went into this movie (Which makes the comments below about the originality of the place all messy for me). This film has nothing but the long cliches that go together and flock around as a movie. It's not the next clerk, of course, not the original and Of course not. "Good, fun, clean." This movie is a real pain for those who are not trained. (After seeing it for the first time, the second time may be a funny story. When I looked around the theater, it was clear that almost everyone except the elderly might be bored or hurt with this movie. In some emotional scenes, especially at Nick Chew, his mother, the audience is cringe because it's terrible. I've heard someone groan in the theater, something I've never seen before. I do not care whether you have the opportunity to watch this movie, whether it be at a film festival or in an indie cinema or anywhere. Do things that you like yourself, skip this movie with a vengeance. If you don't like me and can't resist the opportunity to see what might be the worst movie ever created
