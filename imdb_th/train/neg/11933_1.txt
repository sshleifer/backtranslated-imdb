My child makes a better video! I feel torn from $ 4.00 used to rent this thing! No date in the video case, apparently designed by Wellspring; And the worse thing is that there is no original movie production date available in the movie! The only day that was received in 2002 was to bring unsuspecting tenants to believe that he would receive the latest movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible from an outdated and irrelevant perspective at any time.

Fri, 1960, anti-war, anti-establishment But when you read the back of the case video, there is no hint that that's what you get. If you make a mistake in renting, it may look best while taking drugs so that your mind will closely match the wavelengths of the minds of the Fassbinder and Fengler directors, regardless of your mental state for a while. See it. I can tell you that it will not improve after the first scene; So know that I'm sure you will fall asleep quickly before the end.
