I love independent movies, low prices and high hopes for this movie. But this movie is static Do not pay attention to the production value which is very high for its budget. But the timing is very serious It is accepted that these people have little success. But this film failed at the most basic level. It was boring. Fixing ice and walking paces It should be 65 minutes. The best thing about Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde that is almost invisible. He has the most amazing potential. But we have to suffer from stuttering Baltimorean-Brits Through endless and boring exhibitions It feels like playing on a still stage that is committed to the video. <br /> <br /> Everyone's noble effort to produce a voice, but it's just a weak new reading
