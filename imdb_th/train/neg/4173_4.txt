Man, I must say that when I see the trailer I'm excited. The military of the future, the occupation of bad vampires, led by veterinarian Michael Ironside .... In space, I mean I don't expect high art. But it seems to be a potential classic B movie. There is no doubt that the TV pilot was later modified in the documentary after not picking up. Okay, I'm going to start with a few good points of movies. That action is effective for movies with lower budgets and CGI and places that can be used. Now, to the worst, the first thing that Michael Ironside is here is barley and his performance here .... It's not wonderful. But as I said he wasn't in that much, so I couldn't blame him. One really stupid thing is the PETA category for vampires. 'No, I'm not kidding. It's the most stupid unbelievable thing I've ever seen and it's serious. In addition, this film also shows the sin of the important movie B, one story, provoking the lesbian scene and not delivering. The most important thing in this film is that nothing actually happens. Since it was intended to be a pilot, the script was almost nonexistent and it didn't end normally. Even the main villain came to an end. If ever there was a movie that needed a factor, Sleaze and Gore, it was Vampire Wars. In closing, I would say that the main crew in the spaceship is a very talented actor and can put this mess behind them and do things. Bigger and better They have nothing to work with here.
