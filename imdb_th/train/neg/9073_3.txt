This movie looks bright. But actually it's quite bad. The evidence is O.K, but the story is terrible. The actors tried their best to use the content that was limited, but they were not able to dominate the courage of a tasteless college movie. Jason Schwartzman was again annoying - more than in the rest of Rushmore. It's quite not important. The scene that should be fun becomes interesting and the child is unbelievably trying to be a Road Trip / American Pie, but failing inconsistently at all levels. Waste all the time of everyone
