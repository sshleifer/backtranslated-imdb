Really disappointing! I hate mummies But this one is even worse! It was tired and unbelievable and at one point I found myself sighing and yawning all the time. I can't believe that people really like this movie. Nicholas Cage's role is not very reliable. All movies feel like a great tour around America's most desirable buildings. The flow of hints and combinations that never stop is unbelievable as well. I stopped paying attention for about 30 minutes. Things that should be happy at night became a total disappointment. Boring ... I think I've watched too many movies to get the national treasure.
