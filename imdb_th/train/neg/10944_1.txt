Now I have seen many bad movies. I like bad movies Especially bad action movies. I've watched (and enjoyed) all the movies of Jean-Claude Van Damme, including his own clone movies, both of which he played twins, and all three of them are real robots. And then I am the owner that he plays as a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durian. (Hey, if there is nothing, he has a great ass and you almost see it with a DVD. You can stop and zoom in!) That's why you trust me when I say that this movie is so bad that Plan 9 looks like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Everything about Snake Eater is not good. The plot is not good. The script is not good. The scene is very bad. Bad fight, bad stunts, bad FX. The performance is not impressive at the time of the world, and may show the worst performances of the actors with names in the show, including Lorenzo Lamas. And what is that saying? Something really And I am willing to bet everyone involved in this film is lousy in bed to boot In particular, Lorenzo Lamas <br /> <br /> It is unintentionally manageable so it doesn't lose all. However, I suggest you watch this movie only if you are an idiot. Congenital or very drunk. I can sit by myself because I want to see something to divert my attention from washing the cat's urine out of my clothes. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help. What a lot One issue for Ron Pallochadra is a gay arsonist.
