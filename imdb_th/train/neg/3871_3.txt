I try to be very objective when I watch movies with low budget. I also use reduced weight with independent production and low budget compared to producing a large budget. I expect to be near impeccable from large productions and their studios. So I used strict criteria with the introduction of big studios, but this movie is just a fool. The evidence period is terrible. The main character is Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone). It is unbelievable that a high school boy with an endless desire to solve crime. Her character has not enough depth or acting that attracts you into her world. In addition, in order to make this film more mysterious, the lights in some scenes do not create emotions, especially in the warehouse. <br /> <br /> Again, another disappointing movie that I can only score three points
