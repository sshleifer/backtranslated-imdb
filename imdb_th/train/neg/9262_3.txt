On the surface, the idea of ​​Omen 4 is good. Glad to see that the devil is a woman. In fact, sometimes, like in the shaman, when a woman is possessed or a demon, it is very powerful, but in Omen 4 it is surprising But she is a problem child Problems that may be just a therapist But the priest can help She doesn't look scary or insidious. Rather, she looks offended and frustrated. <br /> <br /> This film has the potential and if it was created by the same person who had previously made three movies. But it is quite an insult to create a sequel to one of the most favorite horror movies created for a special television movie. <br /> <br /> On many levels, it looks cheap. Comedy and effects are typical of TV series. Characters do not bring any sympathy and you do not set a path for them. I just watched it again after someone brought it to me for Christmas and it was scary. <br /> <br /> If you think to watch this thing Watch one of the other people or watch the shaman or see a good son. Don't waste your time on this miracle!
