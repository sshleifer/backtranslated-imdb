Help create a movie about an existing talk show and have everything going on in the program! If that idea doesn't appeal to you, it shouldn't stay away from the chief. I do not like to see this stuff in theaters and in fact can sit and watch this movie. I guess jerry springer doesn't play by itself because it shows from cheap props for performances. he (Yes, it's more insulting than the jerry springer shown) and he only knows jerry in the movie. The plot (if you can call it) is about the daughter while staying with her mother, deciding to start. Sleeping with the mother of a boyfriend who lives Therefore, my mother's wonderful idea is to call jerry springer and join her daughter's boyfriend. (Is it a coincidence that they live in a trailer park?) While elsewhere in America, a woman finds her cheating with her friends in bed together. So call America's therapist Jerry Jerryer! I will talk about the rest of the movie. But thinking about it makes me a headache. Jamie Pressly, the daughter player, is not interested in this movie. And remember, Michael Dudikoff, Karate kicker from the American ninja series? Come see him now like a white trash. What he looks too scary and beyond calling it "Contact with his caretaker" But if your fun is to see Jerry Springer singing country songs about their performances or those who like stirring ... well ... just watch See the show instead! ... At least Steve was smart enough to stay away from this flick.
