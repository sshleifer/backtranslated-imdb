Penn spends his time developing his character and we almost care about them. However, there is a real problem with the story here. We do not see the true motivation for the behavior of the evil brother and the unconscious. Set up in the year 1963, the late 60s. The potential for a powerful climax to present itself and Penn allowed to flee. But even with these problems, it is worth looking at but not much.
