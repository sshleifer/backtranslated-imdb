Watching repeated videos with about 8 stories between 1994-1997, Spider-Man comics made me realize why I couldn't get pregnant when it first came out. <br /> <br /> I came from an old school. In 1967, Spider-Man is the best and still the best cartoon. (I will not go into a terrible version of that - please give the villain to me) <br /> <br /> The new act is punch. Read the work that doesn't have any feelings for Paul Soles now. Where are you This guy is the best person to show the voice for Spider-man. No one comes close. Seeing Secret Wars. A good idea for a mini-series. I startled. Dr. Doom looks like a funny version of Bela. Gosei in the scene with the Red Skull and Doc Ock Red Skull does not have a German accent, while Ock is a heavy Russian! The Marvel Comics Hero Series of 1966 is much better than Iron Man. It sounds like he is wearing an iron mask. Captain America sounds powerful, unlike some teenagers. Paul Frees is the best thing in the 60s. Where ever The old voice actors are pioneers and there will be no one like them. Ever heard of Mel Blanc's son? There is no way he can repeat his father. <br /> <br /> Animation is nonsense. Ok, so they have strange characters and have beautiful painted backrounds. Sometimes you can talk more with less movement if more movement looks bad. Sometimes when you let the computer take control, they will become robots. I do not think that these animators will know what lies between them. <br /> <br /> The story is badly written and some of the stories that make the heroes scary. Why, for example, when the heroes were gathered together for the first time, they started to fight each other in Secret Wars. It was an excuse that they disagreed. I can see that the hero is dark, ignorant and mysterious - like the Punisher or not, but why Thing and Iron Man can't keep their emotions in each other so ridiculous so the Torch joins. This is just one of the cartoons later. The tendency to let the heroes approach each other in seconds because 'everyone' wants to see that. Give better reasons to fight and may be pulled out, but "Hey, what are you doing here?" And "You don't tell me what to do" is the reason for weakness. Another scene badly written in the wedding, Harry Osborn and expose himself to make the wedding of Peter rotten. The whole situation is terrible. <br /> <br /> Last but not least is what other critics call the violence of children and youth - meaning there is no punch. In the Secret War, the chameleon takes care of the cost of things, but what the bad guys punch throughout the block in the cartoon He had to go back and lift the heavy stuff and defeat the bad guys by holding him in the cartoon. Of course, these cartoons are not made strictly for adults. But for children under 12 years, that's why they can't punch because the mother and father don't believe that violence But you can blow things. These cartoons will include that. When being a child before political correctness came into fashion, I saw a cartoon that was punched. What's wrong with a chop punch? Today, the world is less violent because of the new, slippery and tricky comics. Can you punch out? I found that this was the most insulting when I watched the new content. They wrote "Punch" because we all could hurt ourselves. <br /> <br /> Kids enjoy these cartoons as you want. I see enough <br /> <br /> 3/10 rank
