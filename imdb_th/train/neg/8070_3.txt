This is not a very good movie. But it's not a foul either It is confusing and unnecessary, so rent it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend and I think this movie comes out (we think) so this is: <br / > <br /> * ** MAJOR SPOILERS below *** <br /> <br /> At first, this movie is quite easy after you remove the unconscious-dreamy garbage - confusing state (95% of the movie) < br /> <br >> Not interested in junk. The real thing is: a group of school friends go crazy one night. They went out and had a car accident that everyone except Cassie and Sean died. That is a simple truncated version. (Correct, I said Sean is patient with me) <br /> <br /> After the accident, Cassie was placed in a hospital that stuck between life and death until the end of the movie. This is the beginning of the dream. <br /> <br /> Movie named SOUL Survivors, right? Cassie's soul and spirit continue after the accident, interacting with other spirits (Annie, Matt, Raven, 2 weirdos and Jude), along with images that have been created in her heart. (Sean, the school and everything around her) The spirit still does what they define as follows: Annie, a chick who is crazy about two killers (from the opening scene). Father Jude continues to help other people. <br /> <br /> We were taken The long driving shows a lot of pictures (which my GF and I still can't bind), but it's so difficult that it's not Cassie's time to die. <br /> <br /> At the end, Cassie woke up In the hospital after "dead" for a while, her family and Sean were there. This is true again. She agrees. <br /> <br /> Then the director added a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little example of her dream in the right cart. Strangle But this part is only a nightmare and she wakes up next to Sean. Of course, still having to face her painful experiences But feel free to Send us an email if you wish. <br /> <br />
