Think of "theater". This is something worth watching. Lionelville's performances and Dwight Fry COMPare the Melvyn DOuglas in "Ghost Story" and Melvyn DOuglas of this film There are vampires that are loose in this 'Bavarian' village or more natural. Dwight Frye is Herman Herring, the red color that has been chosen to act as a talented character. It's fun to see his different facial expressions in what is actually a character that doesn't exist for a long time. But then we discovered that Atwill's smoking doctor is a real killer. There are 'too many relief cartoons', but that's normal for the course for this era. Fayray looks really good.
