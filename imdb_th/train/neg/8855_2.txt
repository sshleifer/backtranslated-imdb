Yes, "Howling" first is classic. The werewolf movie that is quite good that I accept starts slowly. But was driven all the way to the end quite well. Then the young female announcer turned into a cute werewolf who was shot by the camera. Yes, created for entertainment horror movies. Be sure ... Don't forget all this because this movie is not related to that movie. Oh, sure, they made it out that the women who were bonding together and her brother or something wanted to find out what and why things fell like they did. Transylvania or somewhere here, they have to fight with werewolves, magicians or something. Often I wonder what Christopher Lee is doing in this movie. But I read the trivia that it said that he had never been a werewolf. But still read the script before you play the role Maybe you enter "American werewolf in London" that may be possible It is located in London. After all, Heck the werewolf doesn't seem to have much thought in this movie except for a strange and prolonged sex scene. In fact, the most memorable death in this movie for me was when a girl started talking loudly and this friend's ear started bleeding.
