Although recently I will put it in my 10 worst stories, I must say that it may not be worse than Burt Reynolds in "The Maddening" or the sequel of "Look Who's Talking". The story is quite boring, even with Drew Barrymore playing the horror movie Holly Golightly, which moved from New York City to Los Angeles. Poor Sally Kellerman, a famous actress in the 70s Was reduced to the role Supporting small and George Newbern Actor Award from the Barrymore acting worst sitcoms. Such images are But Drew's blood-blooded bloodshed shows off his appearance and the psychotic identity. (Even though coming out of the episode "Scooby Doo") is interesting. But for the ending ... Get real! Who needs to clear that mess? * From ****
