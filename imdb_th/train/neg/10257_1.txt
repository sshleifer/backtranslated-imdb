This movie has a great cast for the show: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres - all b-solid movie actors, but this bad movie doesn't take any advantage because there is no character. Their meeting on the screen (although Christopher Lee will play with himself in many scenes) <br /> <br /> Alien motivation in this film seems to change when wearing a hat. First of all, they just want to repair their ship and then they open the main character by killing most of his friends and not letting his wife after he receives the important parts they need. Then there was no "calm" competition. This decided that they had to destroy the world because it caused too much "disease" (although they offered the main character and his wife as a point in their society). > <br /> Most of the movies take a look at men and wives, drive or walk or stand around or sit at the desk, do nothing. You almost want them to be taken out with other parts of the world at the end to avenge us from dying. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Chris Lee or the era with a very low budget I will give this person a miss. It falls within a narrow range of wasted celluloid between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
