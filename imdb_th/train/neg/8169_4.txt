The movie begins with a couple camping. Men and women should gather together, trekking alone in the vast wilderness. The man heard something very loud and it hurt him so much that he had to investigate. Our killer greeted him by stabbing to the stomach. Then he pursued the girl and slashed her neck. The camera during the opening scene comes from the point of view as a killer. <br /> <br /> Next, we will meet two of our four main characters, one of which is on the rocks. Funny guy about the way that the woman will not be able to deal with camping alone. On the second day sparked the ambition of a blonde token to leave early in the week. Unexpectedly, they left the same day and their cars broke down .. They arrived in the evening. When they arrive, they will be warned about the people who disappeared in the forest by Ralph doppleganger. They ignore the warning and risking the gloomy night and the song, eight songs played as a backdrop, with lyrics about Killed in the dark forest The men are lost. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, we know that this is not just a clone of The Burning, but a ghost story! A woman who is scared and lonely is crowding with fire. Two children appeared in the shadows and decided to play secretly at Tom. Obviously they are ghosts according to their resonance! Their mother appeared with blood dropping from the hole on her forehead and asked the two women if they had seen her children before they disappeared. <br /> <br /> The children Ran home to find his father and told him about two beautiful women beside the river This caused a stir and he got up, grabbed his knife from the top of the fireplace. "Father is hunting" The little girl exclaimed with a bad performance. Obviously, here, my father was not a ghost like his son. <br /> <br /> Surprised in what was in the forest. She found a father who explained that he was hungry and that it would be fast. This is not reasonable because of the roar of the tiger that we heard earlier. (Maybe he will lose! The Panthers are honest, even in California?) She ended up wounding him a bit before stabbing her head. Thunderstorms, eruptions and people seeking shelter which became the place where the father lived Apparently there were people living here because of the fire and there were some strange things that were coming in. Children appeared and warned them about the father, which would appear a little later. They disappear as soon as he arrives. <br /> <br /> Whatever the reason, our killer is pursuing only females. He invited men to eat and tell us about his ex-wife. We have been retrospective of his wife being caught cheating. The old man didn't tell them. However, he killed her and her lover later. But dreaming about this We do not give reasons for the death of children. Men go to sleep and are not dangerous. The next morning they discovered the empty camp of their wife. After a brief conversation, they separated. One is to stay at the camp while others go and get help. The man will return to his car, breaking his leg. Then we will reunite with the children as they explain to the survivors that they are ghosts that killed themselves from the sadness about their mothers. They agreed to help the girl gather with her friends. <br /> <br /> The following scene challenges the logic of the movie when the father kills the guy waiting at the camp. He was still dating or married to a blonde girl. The children realized that he had been killed and told the woman about it. She decides to see it by herself and apparently runs into the killer. Fortunately, the children make him stop by threatening to let him go forever. You know what will happen. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film deserves four stars out of ten, and that's generosity. For all the anxiety, the music score was very good. It can still be seen as well. There is a camera angle that looks professional and some scenes do well. Unbelievable story There are things that are willing to suspend unbelief. But when the toad is 6 miles away, I can't imagine that the blonde token would be like that at night. I mean, come on! <br /> <br /> - Alan "Skip" Bannacheck
