I've never seen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> It's possible to shoot a video game shootem up and make it a good movie. <br /> <br /> Mistake 1: Not relevant. With anything of the characters in this movie, you are not bound to any characters because ... you don't get a chance. <br /> <br /> The only character that is sympathetic or interesting is Deck Hand: Salish Played by Clint Howard except this unique character, the result of the image Then press the meaningless because all the characters from lifeless beginnings /> <br /> The crash <br 2: battle scenes, the worst ever. I love fighting sports. I love when heros turn up on badguys and clean houses. Heck, I like watching bad homes sometimes. But this gunfight is very strange. I guess the best way to explain is "indifferent". I've seen people shoot with feelings and emotions more while playing videos. In this movie, it looks and feels like an "actor" walking through shooting everything that moves without emotion. <br /> Why? <br /> Why? Where are the trash talking? Where is the roar of anger among the guns? These things should be children who are crazy about ... but even soldiers who act professionally and show merciless humanity. <br /> <br /> If you want horror movies Good about a quiet house full of Demon, I would like to introduce Sam Rami's Evil Dead series, not seeing the disaster that is the home of the dead. I hope they will burn the master and all copies of this movie.
