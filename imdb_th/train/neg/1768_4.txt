This is another movie that would be great. The basic evidence is good - the immortal cat, the killer for living, etc. - the transformation of the vampire vampire concept. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes it break is the overall negligence of the main character. Knowing that you have to maintain a low profile if you want to survive - see how long it takes to catch Unibomber and that's because family members think. <br /> <br /> Children (and And to a lesser extent, MA) behave as if they were untouchable. Killing children without thinking, leaving no evidence or as evidence or witness The way these people manage to live and not be discovered for a month is unbelievable, let alone for many decades or centuries. <br /> <br /> It's really a shame. - This may be more than that. Let the main character at the level of common sense that they have to pass for a long time. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is not a bad performance. I love the bit at the end that every cat in the city meets at home every time I leave the food on the balcony and see our cat running from wherever they came before. I think of that scene.
