James Gandolfini is a good actor, so what he had done in the role of this junk Afflux is just a light weight that cannot be cut. But the rest of the actors are truly memorable. I saw this in the United States in an empty theater. I soon knew why the place was empty. After about 10 minutes, I walked away before finishing. It was terrible. So imagine my surprise when returning. Come to England, I saw that this movie has a sparkling report from "Paul Ross" yoyo in the Sunday market. I always rely on Ross to save money on cinema tickets if he says. These good movie I went to the site to investigate. This movie should go directly to the DVD for 1.99 pounds in the supermarket near you.
