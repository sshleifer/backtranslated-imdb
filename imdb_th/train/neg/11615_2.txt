Although not Sam Rockwell's girlfriend, but I was surprised when he saw his name on the credit for his debut. 'Joshua' Heck, I didn't even know he was in 'Joshua' until I started making movies. So it went without saying that I was watching a movie based on the movie, not the genre of 'Rosemary's Baby,' 'The Omen' or other children's movie 'Joshua' being charged. Unfortunately it has decreased Slow, slow, incredible and flat Nonetheless, I still continue to see how this thing can be resolved, hoping to exceed the belief.

Is Joshua crazy? Is he jealous of someone who has just entered the family? Will he grow up to be Michael Myers? Or is he driving his family to the edge? I do not think so They were nuts before and there was no show called "Make me believe otherwise Unfortunately, almost none of the questions were answered almost without opening any doors. I'm sure that might be the idea. But for the benefit of Pete, what movies are better than children who go to explore in large numbers? Joshua is like the Mini-Me of the devil.
