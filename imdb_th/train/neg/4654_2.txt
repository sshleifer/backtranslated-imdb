Female vampires kill young women and paint with their blood. She has an assistant who does not want to be a vampire, so he must do as she commands or becomes a vampire. After killing a few times, the assistant will repent and fall in love with the homeless girl. <br /> <br /> What can I say about this movie? That its rhythm is very slow, it has a strange sound effect (never bitten, sounds strange) and the atmosphere (new jazz here I come) Looks like a self-sufficient horror movie "auteur" Light crosses, garlic and rods do not work. <br /> <br /> It's not funny comedy. Maybe with a lot of friends and beer, it's not funny. (To be honest, it's funny during the 10 - 15 minutes near the end of the movie.) Don't be fooled by the Troma stickers.
