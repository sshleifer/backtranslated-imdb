If I give it less than 1, don't bother to rent; If someone wrote a DVD for you, <br /> <br /> This is an awesome movie creation. Solid waste, even the "digital" film I saw better on Youtube. The 12-year-old boy, Lommel, claimed to have written this if it was the case in which he was a classic case of people who are illiterate in two languages The story does not exist. Most conversations make a camera call. Artistic works that try to cut the absurdity of a jump that is totally irrelevant to the industrial transport scene or the rift of an angry girl. <br /> < br> I tend to follow the plan less clearly, or see the purpose of the movie "Creative" - ​​I like David Lynch. <br /> <br /> This film is beyond my limited ability. I understand where It's totally or pointless. I think this is "Lets see if we can grab the title that will come out soon and make a strange crack and see if we can grab the coin or not." <br /> <br /> I don't see why Lionsgate cares. With this All worthless. It's terrible. I won't rent with the same director.
