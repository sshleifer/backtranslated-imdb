Like many other series franchises, this line doesn't know when to quit. Instead of throwing away things when they ended up perfectly, they created this. The first part of this franchise will lack a lot of marks. <br /> <br /> This movie shouldn't happen. It is not intended to have a fourth movie on this line, and it certainly shows. The location is stupid and the painting is the same. <br /> <br /> After a wonderful experience, which is The Omen, this is a big disappointment that makes Cheese of 70 and an awesome performance. It reminded Amityville Horror of those aspects and left horror long after it ended. <br /> <br /> Rate 1.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> demon:
