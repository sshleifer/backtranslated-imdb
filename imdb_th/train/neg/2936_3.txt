I was fascinated by the high ratings (8.5) for this movie and was very disappointed. I just saw two great foreign movies and are looking forward to making three films in a row. But not so I went with a Spanish-speaking friend who felt the same way. If there is not much I don't need that in the movie. But must create entertainment or bring me in. The best thing I can say is that it wants to be an Altman movie. Of course, there are times when But at certain times it was thinner, with nothing slow. 97 minutes I didn't understand the high ratings for this movie.
