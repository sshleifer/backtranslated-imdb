This movie is really bad ....... No, I mean really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. From every movie he made, I was like an enemy of the state. In addition, he was one of the worst directors of all time. The thing that shocked me most was Richard Kelly (director Donnie Darko) doing this role. Now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes. But participating in this story hopes that he will learn his lesson. <br /> <br /> Now I love Mickey Rourke's new role, but I don't like him because of this. The story and the look of it Don't understand me wrong. I still love Mickey Rourke, but he gives confidence in his time and this is one of them. I don't know what to say about Keira Knight. I think she is a bit exaggerated. I just don't feel like you in the movie. <br /> <br /> All in this movie is not good. That's it ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
