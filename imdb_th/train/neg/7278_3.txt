This movie that doesn't seem difficult to sit and watch. There is no good group. But at least the first group was mildly amusing and the middle group was quite imaginative The last person is just a brutal ordinary person and after sitting through two weak funny shorts, the third person is truly painful. Despite the low standards of the national film, Lamphun, this movie looks especially boring and unhappy.
