Scary Movie 3 (2003) is a bad idea to start. The last film is moderate effort. Placed next to this burden, it is a classic joke. While the second part is full of old humor and cheap images, at least it's funny. There is nothing funny about forced humor, jokes, pratfalls and jokes that should be funny nature. Hit the audience over the head with that funny joke. Not cool. The humor in this movie is primarily aimed at children and young people who will laugh at anything. When they responded to the middle school crowd, any self-esteem was thrown out the window. Ring parody is not a joke. I watched them in the drama since 1998. They are dating. Michael Jackson's gags aren't as cool as well. The worse thing is that the fun of the two people is broken down into the "actors" who do not have the best days. <br /> <br /> The death of American movies is slow Movies like this are the nails that are smashed into the coffin. What happened to true humor? I haven't laughed loudly in the theater for a long time. Too many bad movies cause the brain to spin. Do you want to prove Go to your large video rental store and see what's on the shelf. This movie is not good. Do not believe advertising. I would like to watch 2 horror movies in a continuous loop rather than pass the poor excuse of a comedy again. <br /> <br /> Definitely not recommended. (Unless you have a few brain cells)
