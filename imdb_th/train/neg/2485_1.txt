There is only one use for movies such as bullets: it will remind you how bad it is. We often see movies that we describe as "very scary" or "not so good" but you can find movies like this and you can see that although all other movies are not "good" but there is no way Rancid Not as good as a bullet This is a birthday gift from someone who takes less than two seconds to search through cheap trash bins at our local superstore to fulfill obligations. (For example, giving me a gift) It may be an accidental discovery, but not: This is a fully ancient idea, badly written, badly directed, behaved very badly. For 10 years, God is scary. I wonder how much from about 30 seconds in, but continuous, because sometimes - sometimes - bad movies are bad, they can enjoy. This is not one of them. It's terrible. I stopped watching after 45 minutes and tomorrow I would throw it in the trash.
