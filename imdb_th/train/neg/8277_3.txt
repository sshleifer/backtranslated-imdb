This may not be convincing. But this movie earned $ 878,138 in Russia! It is shown in most theaters and still works! I do not know why the distributor watched this movie which was not screened around the world. That's some puzzles! haha! Maybe it came from the fact that another movie "Pledge This" and Paris Hilton, which released the only DVD, almost all have big screenings in Russia and have earned more than $ 1 million. Also received many promotions, such as advertising banners around the city, television commercials and more. If talking about movies, I think it's absolutely boring and boring. It might be better. Although it has Jessica Simpson
