The first lesson that some filmmakers (Especially those who are inspired by Hollywood) need to know - 'style' doesn't sell. I guess when translating, Tashan means style. Second, if you have a sales style that doesn't allow you to have a good story, <br /> <br /> Tasan has some stories that are just enough for a better director. But it is not slippery For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshay - are narrators at various points in the story, but this setting is not used correctly. There may be a better mix and match with their subtitles. The action sequence comes from the age of seventy. <br /> <br /> The movie's choreography is terrible. I think Vaibhavi Merchant just slept through this film. Vishal-Shekhar scored well, but it didn't belong to this movie. Why is there a sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is the cool Hinglish song (Dil Dance Maare) not in Anil Kapoor when he is an English fanatic? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is a movie grace But he was in his own death You won't miss this missing movie.
