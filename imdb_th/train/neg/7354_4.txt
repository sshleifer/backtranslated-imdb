As a philosopher Hammer, I was scared when I had to add courage to watch this movie and the story that followed was Holiday on the Buses. I had seen the movie The One Buses and thought it was one of those movies. The worst I have ever seen It was filled with horrific jokes that happened to British television in the early 70s. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to say that there is a part of this film that I laughed at. I do not know if it is because I am now familiar with the characters and enjoy some situations and know how they will interact. I found that Blakey was especially funny, although I could swear that he would say his poem. "I'll give you a butler" at the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See the holidays on the bus. Wearing some, and these three movies can be compared to the early Trilogy Hammer Barton Trilogy in the second film that made it the best. (Although this may be the only way they can compare) <br /> <br /> Only people who want to watch this movie may be fans of the TV series that will no doubt enjoy this. For the conspirators, I would say that this movie is not that bad, and I can think of a worse comedian.
