Nowhere near the original It is quite accurate in bringing the copy, nothing new to the story. But the director is terrible Basinger is weak - no good director Baldwin is only the second league compared to McQueen. I watched it out of curiosity and a big fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece and I got what I thought. Almost a B movie with a second acting and directing rate I'm not disappointed, I just don't know what they're trying to do. This remake didn't try to play with the original content. It's not a tribute, and of course it doesn't have a really good actor in this era. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a bad Xerox copy. > <br /> This is a waste of your time, completely save yourself 2 hours or see the original (again :))
