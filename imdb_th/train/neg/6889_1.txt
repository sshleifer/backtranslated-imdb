My wife and I saw this movie trailer while watching another DVD and thought that "Jon Heder, Diane Keaton, Jeff Daniels and Eli Wallach had to be better than the summer screenings again, so I ordered from the local library" Lawrence Welk "It makes me laugh more than" Mama's Boy ". I'm really sorry that the actor must read the script in the privacy of his own home and I can't imagine what it must be for. He crossings To speak along their lines in front of the camera, maybe at least sometimes the next time they offer this type of movie, they will "Just Say No!"
