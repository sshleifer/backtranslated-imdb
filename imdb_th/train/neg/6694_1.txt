I have a real hope for this movie because I saw Kari on other things and thought she was capable. Alas, this fool is a case study of things that shouldn't be done in the screenplay. Characters that are not completely defined without any liking and without any plot. It's a street / friend / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? The filmmakers didn't have a clue and we didn't do that.
