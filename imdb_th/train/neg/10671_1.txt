MST 3000 should do this movie It's the worst action movie I've ever seen. First of all, you find that athletes do not have a bank account and have no history since leaving the army in 1993 and paying rent in cash. There is no way in hell that such people will be allowed to be close to the president who does not mention high-profile jobs. In addition, the security chief for POTHUS will not feel that way. He will start drinking with confusion if the president is shot. This movie sucks I can't show the greatness that this movie can be. All actors are terrible. Even chickens, trailer parking I'm shit with this garbage Waste time
