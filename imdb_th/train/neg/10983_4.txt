When this drama was first screened by the BBC 30 years ago, it would be a different story. So some people find it quite scary and may be impressed with special effects or not. <br /> <br /> If you look at the plays of this era, it doesn't seem scary. Longer, even special effects can still be needed. <br /> <br /> Can the train allow the red light to pass into the dark tunnel? I don't think so ...... but if you watch this drama again, you will notice that the first train that entered the tunnel ran through the red light! (It may be that it was a time of error) <br /> <br /> You will notice that the path leading to the signal box is very steep and in poor condition. Of course, there will be a set of steps that are suitable with handrails for people to signal to climb up or down in the cut. (I can't help but notice things like that) <br /> <br /> I'm not going to take anything from the performances of Denholm Elliott (the transmitter) and Bernard Lloyd (the traveler). Excellent <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what happened ...... I mean, it's a ghost that travelers or what ??? Does anyone really understand this, is it quite confusing? (Maybe I am the only one who can't) ??? <br /> <br /> To conclude ..... <br /> <br /> The drama has a wonderful atmosphere throughout with great characters. It suffers from not being scary today, and only a little, if not very confusing, in places and has a way to send signals that are quite unusual .... <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading my review
