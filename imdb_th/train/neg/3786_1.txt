This is not an appropriate review because I didn't watch this movie so much. I stopped watching it. This movie is very violent with nasty drug dealers and street listeners. But that's not the reason I stopped. <br /> <br /> This is a problem: I look enough to introduce many characters. Not interesting. Everyone is a boring and nasty psychopath. No attractive personality makes me Nothing to wait I find myself not wanting to see a bit about what they will do next or what may happen to them. <br /> <br /> If someone is interested in even one person I mean, interesting people. I can live with it. Watch "State of Grace" to see what I mean. In this film, the character Gary Oldman is completely insane. But he is a very interesting person Maybe Al Pacino might work well in Scarface, but his character doesn't share with me.
