While I wrote this review in 2008, we mired in a remake culture. It seems that the movie studio is committed to destroying as many classic movies as possible with updates aimlessly, such as' King Kong, 'The Wicker Man' and all films starring Michael Caine. This lazy rebuilt idea is not a new phenomenon. However, while 'Dough for the Do-Do' proves a version that doesn't have the end of Bob Clampett's masterpiece that is entirely pointless. 'Porky in Wackyland ',' Dough for the Do-Do 'sucked life out of the original by splashing paint all over the original video of Clampett. Freleng was a totally unsuitable director who would interfere with Clampett's sources. Any director who is hoping to get close to Clampett's madness is inevitable, so 'Dough for the Do-Do' doesn't have anything more than a classic rape with a new name. Afraid to attach Swimming For cartoon fans like me, it's equivalent to the color of 'Casablanca'
