Ok, first of all the video, it seems that it was filmed in the 80s that I was shocked to find that it was released in 2001. Secondly, the plot is all over the place as soon as the bat has a confused story. If the opening is short or the story is better I like fantasy But this movie is too much It's strange and not well shot. The scene is not smooth and the characters are strange. It is difficult to follow and may be translated. But it is difficult to understand I love Chinese epic movies. But if you are looking for Chinese epic fantasy movies, I would like to recommend Promise (amazing, visually, interesting plot and good character development), not this movie. Be careful, you will be disappointed.
