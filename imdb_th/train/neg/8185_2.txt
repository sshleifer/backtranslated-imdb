Gosh. I decided to go out to the cinema and some friends wanted to see a gentle and good Christmas movie. They walked out with disgust. Movie failed Paul Giamatti, who I think is a good actor, plays his character and spins horribly along with Vince Vaughn, who is my personal favorite They try to change the Christmas movie into a new style. Sort of bad mixed with good But it turned out to be very wrong The first ten minutes are not bad. But when we saw Santa, it was over. It doesn't get any better than the original rest rate. There is no character development and of course one of the worst Christmas movies ever invented. Do not see what you do.
