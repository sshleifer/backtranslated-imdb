Once upon a time, there was a director named James. He brought us to an exciting science fiction story like Terminator and Aliens. These movies were made from Blockbuster movies and he had a great future waiting in front of him at the dawn of a computer that created effects. Special on the film industry Shows that Terminator 2 gives us the possibility of seeing this new era. <br /> <br /> ....... then it happened ................ ... 1997 ........ countless prizes .......... amount of pornography ... ......... strange foreign advertising ...... ...... highest profit margin ........ Titanic is here! <br /> <br /> I have never (jumped over) to the bandwagon and are extremely important for the benefit of In fact, I tend to use the opposite gesture from most people just to get arguments. Titanic, however, is a movie that I received from only one positive thing - that is Kate Winslet that is absolutely beautiful. <br /> <br /> Fast - the conversation is like something. From Beverly Hills, 90210, Tree House, My Nephew, the terrifying picture is a real joke (the one who fell from the boat and hit the propeller button) in the past. (Do not start at all because there are too many) There are horrible theme songs. (Up there with bodyguards for cheese) and a pointless love story that is boring, absorbing and poor, causing others to disparage (I'm glad that he died and disappointed when she didn't do it) <br /> <br /> Obviously, this picture is designed to attract MTV, chewing gum, chasing boys and Cars, teenage girls (DeCaprio himself is similar to something that is less heroic than the weak members of the boy band). Half time, flick the chicks, hope to get lucky later! The worst thing is that it doesn't stop there. Millions of people who are stupid, vultures culture to see expensive celluloid because "It costs a lot to build. It must be great." And "Steve and Barbara say it's good and they know their movies." <br /> <br /> The highest glory comes when The Titanic swept the board at the Oscars. King James of Hollywood had a very quiet moment for the victims of a terrible night, which he spent three and a half hours. It seems to me that he is praying for forgiveness after the wrong fortune comes out, showing the situation that led to the death of many people. <br /> <br /> However, if people are stupid and grateful Enough to buy this type of garbage, they deserve to be robbed. Good luck with Hollywood. If that's how they want to make money, I'll do it if I have a chance in life like that. <br /> <br /> It's there in the movie list. Worst of all, with other stupid historical false / human interests, rags such as "Patriot" and "Pearl Harbor"
