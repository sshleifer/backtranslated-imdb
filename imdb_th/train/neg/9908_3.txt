I gave this 3 stars out of 10 possible times - because the story ended and was not explained and because of the annoying scenes of people who eat in a very disgusting way, including the scene of rotting bodies. <br /> < br /> No need to show one of the above in a graphical way. <br /> <br /> The story of the film involves three stories that are loosely linked. <br /> <br /> Bounty hunter who plays By Bruce Dern, a character that links the three vignettes. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have Dylan McDermott. It looks scary. Fleeing to Mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter when he rides through the border town and finds a sad saloon girl played by Helen Han. <br /> <br /> We have women in Hemingway One whey Not sure who would play with a lonely western wife on the border to see about a neighbor woman with attractive red hair, which we soon realized that she was out in the forest for too long. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of the movie returns to the bounty hunter and what happened to him with the final scene in this movie is a story that is beyond reasonably understood.
