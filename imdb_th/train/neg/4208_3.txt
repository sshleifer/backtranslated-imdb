There is a really good movie that lies under the surface of the layer according to the layer of cheese, "the Pagemaster" <br /> <br /> I found this when I watched this story again this morning after ignoring it. Went many years and years. I remember hating it with passion when it first came out. But this time I found that special techniques are quite good. The story is just a "Neverending Story" that is creative - endectomy, but it's a little flick for anyone who wants a really scary eye candy. The animation is amazing and I like the way the animators let their characters look and behave more than normal. I give the third grade as much as I can give twice. (For parody values) If I decide to watch this movie, expecting it to make my story smarter.
