OK, I'm not an American. But in the opinion of the Scots, Steve Martin never never was and will not be a joke, as long as our posters point in the direction to the south. Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bill Koko is a funny person, without a doubt, because of the skilled writers and directors and characters in other talented teams in the series that are perfectly involved in the most funny comedy. The way everyone can have courage, even trying to imitate the character Phil Silvers is above me. In combining things, exercising over and over again in Martin's unspeakable effort is the reviewer of Peter Seller's Clouseau, which is another attempt that has been accomplished in my opinion. Some of your moderators say 'Steve Martin put his seal on the character' so that I could say 'balderdash'. His depiction was long forgotten when the Silvers and Sellars would be a treasure for future generations.
