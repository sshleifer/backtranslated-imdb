You think the first landing on the moon is amazing enough without having to do anything about it. However, this documentary seems to have to leave everything in the most scary places possible. It talks about the risks associated with the moon module and discusses the serious accident that Armstrong used with training vehicles as if the trainers and spacecraft were involved with each other. It caused computer overload problems (warning signs 1202 and 1201) found during the last landing, sounding like a disaster when it was just a nuisance and not risking the crew And use the call "Thirty seconds" to mean the fuel that lasts thirty seconds before it expires, when actually thirty seconds before the cancellation is forced Find "from the world to the moon" or either PBS documentary But skip this one
