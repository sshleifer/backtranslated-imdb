If there is a strange Oscar festival coming in, this movie will win everything. It has all the gods, a great plot, a special special effect with great acting skills, and of course in every role with a celebrity superstar. This may be a scenario if the world is invaded, but not but it is the worst horror movie ever created. But the poor performer only seemed to read the script from the transmitter via a phone that had a bad disdiscia For example, a demon set (Which is the way to see) is the most hilarious thing I've ever seen Whenever I see a red monster called a monster on the screen, I can't hold back. And above all, it seems that funny creatures are transported by conveyor belts. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistakes as I do. IMDB checks that this movie was released in 2003 with scores. Less than five points and think: - "It is worth it to shoot so badly." <br /> <br /> Yes /> <br /> I won't lose anything more than words in this movie.
