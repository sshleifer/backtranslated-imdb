I want to have fun with this movie, but Van Damme is just doing the same old junk again and again. Pants in the normal fight scenes The only thing that this loser is left is that Russia will eventually be killed. This movie is the story that the smallest dog can do to the highest level. Please please Van Damme. Get a acting lesson. You want it. Everyone who likes Van Damme has a problem. The show was when he co-wrote the screenplay, co-produced the movie and played the screen for the movie Avoiding VAN DAMME and he received an obnoxious return. WIG WIG I gave this movie In the tenth because this movie and Sandman is better To increase insult to injury, I lost what is manure.
