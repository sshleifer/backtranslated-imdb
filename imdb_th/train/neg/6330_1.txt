If you enjoy live broadcasts and traditional SNL performances, avoid this film at all costs. When this first time came out of my friends and I waited in line for more than an hour to go to the movie theater that was sold out. Half way through the movie, the theater is empty. 3/4 We refuse to go out, thinking that it will be better. When the movie ends, we are the only one left in the theater. This film took only one day in the entire cinema, then disappeared from sight. In an interview with "Mr. Mike", he refused to comment on the film. This film is a joke in the episode of SNL that came out immediately after the film opened and closed on the same day. We all tried to contact "Mr. Mike" by phone and post to request a refund. But was totally ignored
