This movie should not be done. Honestly, I have to admit that before I saw it, I had some doubts. The director is not a great actor, even though she has made many films in Holland and the girl who plays the main role is the personality of the TV that has a smile on the face and not much self-criticism. Actors who play other important parts that I just saw in Bride Flight and although this movie is better, he doesn't convince me more. To start with the story, I didn't read a novel that is based on But the script that is under the film is something that may happen in the minds of children who have a birthday event on a rainy Sunday afternoon. The same age as the director who likes to watch good movies What really disturbs is the exaggerated dialogue that most speak out loud. My respect goes to the photographer, at least he tries to do something from it. It is a shame that the film has been modified. If not, some scenes are more reliable.
