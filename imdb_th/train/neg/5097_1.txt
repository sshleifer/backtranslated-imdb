In contrast to most other critics, I really hate this series. <br /> <br /> It started to look interesting with mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I still hope until the end. At the end of this story, I still don't understand what the alien attacks are about. (Maybe I miss something, who knows?) And I know that I sat 26 episodes, which consisted of character hating myself. Selfishness and self-pity. In fact, it turns between aliens / fighting robots and darkness. The press-and-flashing scenes that one or more characters can say or shout. "I hate me / you / it" 10-12 times in a row. <br /> <br /> I don't see Shinji or Asuka (two main characters) showing growth or change. (Or I don't see other characters that are learning or growing as well) I want to kick them and tell them to get the bloodshed at first and the feeling doesn't change at the end. Shinji has a futile despair that makes people more angry than real charity, and Asuka is a very angry knowledge that I want to smash the TV screen every time she looks. Oh and more than others, both hate everything and say veeeeeeeery often. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of anime and manga and I don't like it before. I read that the creator / author of the series wrote this thing while suffering from depression and I believe that. It made me feel pressured when I watched. Is that the goal of this series? I sincerely ask Is it designed to make people look confused and annoyed? And if suffering from depression, why not write a book or history about it instead of mixing with aliens and mecha The plot of this alien war, as far as I can tell, leads to the exact place. <br /> <br /> Finally, because I am passionate about the fact that there are many people who claim to love Lots of deaths cannot help but wonder how many people find it good and people say that they do it because they have been told.
