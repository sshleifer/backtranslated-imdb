But all I saw was a bad movie that had no resemblance to the graphic novel. <br /> <br /> All in all, not as bad as CGI. I was quite impressed with the performance and thought that casting Well and a little more character information should be good because it makes me a little confused on occasion. But it is not surprising as I said that it just makes me interested, but honestly, I hope I will give this person a miss.
