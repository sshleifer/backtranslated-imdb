Harsh, yes, but I called 'em. As I saw' em <br /> <br /> I saw this in the late 80s and it was one of the most boring and boring movies I ever forced. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is very cute. The Czech setting is truly amazing. The political backdrop is enticing. But not like the story "History series" (eg _Dr. Zhivago_ (qv)) This thing cannot make politics relevant to the story or interesting. <br /> <br /> Laing and Benoch are beautiful. But this film can create a scene that is "aroused" fully and slowly. I am a lover, but this movie is boring. I start hoping that the Russians will shoot them all and end my misery. br /> I'm sure I will read the book. The story will have more reasons. However, life is too short to spend more time with it.
