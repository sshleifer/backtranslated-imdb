As long as there is 3D technology (50s, I think) there is animation. I remember being a Donald Duck cartoon with Chip and Dale in it. I can't remember the name right now. But the plot is that Donald, working in a circus, is feeding with peanuts. Elephants and Chip and Dale are stealing peanuts. This was created to be viewed in 3D. It may be 1960. If you happen to see the Meet the Robinsons in a three-dimensional format in the theater, they show this cartoon in front of the movie and explain the details of the source. There may be about 100. Cartoons are made specifically for viewing through 3D glasses. This claim is an incorrect move because the error proof is not difficult. Moreover, it looks like a bad movie.
