This film does what it should do: shows that a young girl talks about poverty and grows into her adult. However, for most of us, this story has been adequately explored and in most cases more complicated than done here. The movie is fixed on the chest, which soon gets bored and I lose interest. If this is on TV, I will change to the latest news in the Star Report. That's a very boring way that I found this movie.
