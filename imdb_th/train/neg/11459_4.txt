Whale hunters will choose unusual whales. <br /> <br /> A group of Yahoo whale hunters catch females and catch her tail. Whale's friends saw everything, including the time when the baby's womb came out and jumped onto the deck. 'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) can tell that the big man is really angry as he stared at him as though he said "Going out of town before the tide" <br /> <br /> This revenge story has Harris's presence and the beauty of Bo, but not so much. This is the film 'Let' for the first time. Bo's performance, although her first performance, four years ago in 'And Once Upon a Love', was released in 1981 in the name 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek) <br /> <br / > PS Today, this review date (20 November) is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo will have 'whales' in Good time ..... Can you bring it ..... Whale?
