This movie has a foul odor. I do not think I have ever seen any films that cause stress. The plot is quite interesting. But the conversation is quite flat and the performance is not interesting This may be a good movie. I think it relies on real images. Normally, I can handle human scenes and graphics. But it feels like Miike shoots it for shooting Movies that are not good in one show There is nothing to be entertained by watching this movie unless you are intrigued by the incestuous scenes between a pedophile, neophyte, rape, self-milking, parents and brothers I think I just sold many movies for you. But i mean it when i say it stinks He succeeded in other films. But I think you should be better than watching someone clumsy.
