This movie is probably my biggest loss of life. The show was pathetic. Jordan Hinson is unable to show upset. At the beginning of the movie, she should be discouraged. She brushed her head out of her lower lip. She sobbed abominably without tears flowing out. I was almost angry that every woman who wanted to be an actress had to withdraw her. Others also suffer from acting too. It's smooth, annoying. It is also an insult to figure skating. Jordan spent a month training and they made her the Olympic team. It throws the efforts of real figure skaters into their work. Pathetic excuses for movies and poor efforts to link hockey and skating Don't die It doesn't deserve one star.
