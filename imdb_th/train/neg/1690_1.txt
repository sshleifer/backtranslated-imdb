This movie is scary. I can hardly wake up. I will never see this movie again if I get money. The horror scene called in it can be predicted and played more. There is nothing about this movie that will make it original or worth the $ 7.50 I paid. Do not go to see. Do not rent. Do not read online because these things will make you waste time. Sarah Michelle Geller gave a lackluster performance and should be ashamed of herself that made her famous in this film. Shame on Sarah, related to this scary and scary movie. Scary movies do not need to watch.
