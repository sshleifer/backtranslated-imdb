Even 20 years later, Ninja Mission is outstanding as the worst movie I've ever encountered. The Scandinavian ninja was quietly approaching the scene of a nasty sub-machine gun shot by abandoning the forest and then quietly departing. Just follow the shells and smoke! The conversation was badly painful. (Or is it so clever and poorly translated?), Not an Asian actor seen in the show The plot is ridiculous. The show is quite impersonal - then again, the ninja can't do it! Save yourself - avoid watching at all costs!
