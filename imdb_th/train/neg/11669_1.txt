I think it is good and modern to see the wonders of the emptiness of this movie. With a lot of ridiculous Hollywood movies, sometimes we can relax and enjoy the scene without the explosion of inappropriate language. Minimalism has a location and can work effectively when used correctly. However, this movie is not one of those cases. <br /> <br /> Take a long scene without any dialogue and boring and sparse scenes. I'm sure they will have to hold some good meaning and understanding because the implicit messages are covered with bad performances ... polite and walking ... and one of the worst crying scenes. The most in history (At the end of the movie, if you can pass it until the end), the scenery is buff and the long ending sequence of a girl who walks through a barren park is as satisfying as pulling teeth I will call this anticlimatic, but since this movie doesn't create any climax ... not even in the "erotic" scene ... it won't be true. I'm sure there are scripts used during the shooting. But with the number of conversations, I think it might be written with a cocktail napkin. Essentially, this movie has nothing to do with anything interesting or surprising ... There are no great stories, no insights, amazing, no dramas and no excitement. In addition to two or three amusing moments, this movie takes two hours. The movie is boring and tragic.
