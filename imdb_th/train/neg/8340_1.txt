One of the worst movies I've ever seen Very bored that I closed it half way to see the news. When I opened it again, I fell asleep. The movie begins with a dream, continuing with dreams and ending with dreams. Then there is a little more dream. Come on, what should make me interested in that? Movies must have interesting reasons. The minute that you feel that this movie is just a dream is when any movie that is shut down Has anyone insisted on telling their dreams and how does it mean to them? This is it !!! <br /> <br /> Absolutely great.
