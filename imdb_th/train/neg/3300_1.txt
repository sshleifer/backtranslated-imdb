Quite common for this type of movie in Sweden Strange that the performances are not good, these actors often perform well. The casting is not good. It makes you expect something. (I won't tell you) The lead character is horrible ... I don't know where they found her. Stay away from this and see "Den Tredje VÃ¥gen" instead. This is a Swedish action.
