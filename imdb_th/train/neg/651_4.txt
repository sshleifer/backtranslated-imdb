I saw this movie a few days ago and jumped lively in the frightening period. I have to admit, I find it quite good ... until I start thinking about what the characters say. Logical problems: <br /> <br /> 1. Her boyfriend, who seems to be a cute friend, doesn't hear the sound while being killed. Don't you think at least he might try to kill the murderer? <br /> <br /> 2 When speaking to the fitness instructor, "SOOOO, dear to Lisa", I almost screamed at the screen. When your best friend's family is killed by a teacher who loves you, she doesn't show that opinion if you have half of your heart. <br /> <br /> 3 As soon as Nash asked his uncle how many people He is in the house and the uncle can see that there may be a danger ahead. The smartest thing to do is not get a master, a boyfriend, aunt and uncle into the car and Drive far away, then lure the house with HRT and police forces so that the murderer has no way to go out. <br /> <br /> I'll go on and on and on. Basically, the plot. Well, the characters don't have enough profiles for you to feel sympathetic when they are killed and there are too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> However, <br /> <br /> This movie may It's good for teens or young couples who are looking for a place The nightlife is fun If you don't consider every fool, it's an ordinary movie.
