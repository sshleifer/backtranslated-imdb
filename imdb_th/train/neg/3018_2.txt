What do you get when you mix clichés with pacing that don't have a direction and a group of characters that you don't care about and the attempts that failed to create a style of attractive images and large clichés and weak humor? And a really big budget? Why did you get one of the most unbearable movies ever made! Of course, I mean Domino. <br /> <br /> Here are some things people might say during watching this movie: <br /> <br /> "Oh, yeah. Say in order that it has not been done billions of times and has more expertise in this movie. "<br /> <br />" Wow, look at the flashing lights and the film surface with coarse and complex grains. The director tried hard to make things look good and create the style of the image! It is terrible that there are no effects on these movies or make sense of the scene in which they are and it is too bad. That most of them find annoying! "<br /> <br />" I heard the exchange of dialogue in twenty thousand movies before! "<br /> <br />" I've seen this scene Previously, there were about thirty thousand movies! "<br /> <br />" This one too! "<br /> <br />" Eh, they did not reveal this 'twisted plan' about half an hour ago, right? Would you be surprised? "<br /> <br />" If this movie should be a 'strong chick', go around, kick the ass ... when you don't do it so much? "<br /> <br />" I can't believe that this conversation is not strange. "<br /> <br />" How long is this? I felt that I had watched it for more than four hours. "<br /> <br />" I don't know what happened. But I don't feel motivated to think about it. "<br /> <br />" Is this over? "<br /> <br />" I want a refund. "<br /> <br />" The song on this soundtrack feels wrong here. "<br /> <br />" It's funny. All the curses that they use deviate from the impact of each one. "<br /> <br />" UGH "<br /> <br /> And finally:" I may have to end the friendship with the people. Recommend this movie to me You should consider the fire to be burned at the stake instead <br /> <br /> (If I sound bitter, it's because I'm just used to it. Two hours watching this movie and uh, I don't enjoy it a lot)
