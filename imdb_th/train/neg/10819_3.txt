I agree with one of the writers commenting on other people about good stories & good actors, but I do not match and I will say hurry. For about 24 years, I read books like in school. But I feel that you have to know the story of Jane Eyre when watching this program because the bit is released, so it's not reasonable. For example, Jane & Mr Rochester spoke hardly & suddenly he asked for marriage !!! Actors have no time to let the audience know how their characters feel about the things that happen in the actors. But not enough time to do this I'm sorry to say But I didn't really enjoy this model. The 1970 model with Susanna York and George C Scott would be the movie Jane Eyre as I wanted. With 225 minutes or the full version for 330 minutes
