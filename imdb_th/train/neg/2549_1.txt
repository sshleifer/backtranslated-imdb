My friend bought the movie for 5 years ?? (It's not worth 1 cent) because they write it like an American pie. But soon we will find that there is a long way from the American pie to that shit. It's not a joke. But it is like a really bad documentary. Not only the story is bad, the picture and sound are also bad. They put alcohol, dwarf chicks and teen drunkenness. And the result is disastrous If you see this movie, don't buy. Should spend money on other things and better. If you are torturing yourself, don't invite your friends unless you hate so much and you want to get rid of them.
