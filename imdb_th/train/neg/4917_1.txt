Warning Spoiler **** **** <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, it's one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen. It is impossible to do this seriously. It will be an important novel in all comedy shows there. In the time of her show's glory, Carol Burnett and the company who often started filming often distorted this story in ways that were difficult to imagine. Carol played with Jenny, who was seriously ill, and suddenly the song came up and everyone was wondering where it came from. Harvey Corman plays Oliver along with the flow lock and almost looks like Ryan O'Neill. The only thing that is more fun than this bit is the real movie. <br /> <br /> The ending scene at the end. Jenny seems to be dead. Actually ... is dying to let her makeup artist come in and give a little color. And of course, we all know that hospitals often encourage loved ones to sleep with them in the last moments of the patient. The final scene of Ryan O'Neal sitting on a bench in the snow that reminds his future in the film industry is a classic story. He has many concerns. He never recovered from this.
