First of all, I expect that "Caged Heat" will be in line with "Ilsa, The Wicked Warden". My boy is wrong! There has never been an exploitation in the 70s. The film "chix in chains" or "women in prison" of course, the plot consists of a number of women in prison wearing street clothes. (Quite funny) but nothing happened. <br /> <br /> There is no fierce competition, no one tries to seduce the guards or The doctor tried to escape and no prisoners came out. There are 2 shower scenes that I suspect are just videos that are recycled. But there is no fight. / No one is tempted here - or anywhere for this! In addition to the lack of a plot of unbelievable, sympathetic and flat characters, two prisoners who escaped to the prison in order to "liberate" their inmates for free? PUH-LEASE This movie should end by escaping to the sunset ... as opposed to letting this story continue. <br /> <br /> I feel deceived.
