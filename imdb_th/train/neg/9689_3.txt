On the one hand, it's like 'The Wizard of Oz' with Paris in black and white and Riviera colors. But it's about love, ownership, destruction and moral degradation, while actually about Riveria's image designer robes. Many expensive cars can be seen, but it's an amazing example of the material Dark color and elegant style in the opposite direction (This is the version for 'The Talented Mister Ripley. Who else feels the relationship between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
