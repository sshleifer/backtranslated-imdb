The only thing I have to say about this movie - the scene in which Shaq is in a number of musicals with the character of Francis Capra, about the desire to be a devil; Never watched this movie The story is terrible. The performance is terrible (c'mon, it's Shaq!) And I want to see Capra in Free Willy (equally scary) twice before watching this movie.
