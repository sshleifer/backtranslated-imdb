I am a kind person, so I gave this movie with 2 instead of 1, no doubt that it's the worst movie I've seen for a long time. There is very little plot and a deep area of ​​interest that touches on what Jesus might want us to know, being overflowed and we are heavily punished in the sadistic way to the heroine. The total crucifixion during the first 15 minutes was more humane than both the characters and the audience. That performance was almost impossible and the direction was not accepted. And if I saw another drop of water droplets or pigeons flying towards the camera, I might start screaming louder than Patricia.
