I want the Drawing Blood to benefit from the initial questions. During the opening hours, with the naked women stretching out and the painter Diana painting her and sucking her blood to drain, so that she could use it for her art, impressing that this could be the art of kicking. Kick-flick the vampire, change this initial impression to false. Oh, Troma. Mark of lack of quality: Sometimes they will offer things that are rubbish. But funny and at least have the ability to craft junk food (Or sometimes not) This is the case that it is not fun at all to watch because of humor (Eg, the father of the protagonist is the old singer who made the impression of Jimmy Durante?) The weakest direction in the basement. <br /> <br /> And it can't be without him trying oh god no He tried a lot, which was a big problem. He and his producer have money for light of course. But the way they used to film made me a former filmmaker and director who wanted to sulking in my seat: if I saw this in the theater, I would have to make me blind in many cases and wonder if Will his DP understand the 3 basic lighting settings? At the moment, with the lack of clear sound design (Or a humming sound that is very similar to that in an art gallery) should not be something that is interested in releasing Troma. It should be the basic thing that filmmakers Can be played even if the script is not funny or scary (and not) or if the Lapel combines strange songs in strange moments <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie at all And maybe if you are a soulful vampire (Or just a period of vampires). There may be something interesting as an alternative to the basement that bargains for cheap rent near Dark Dark or is a slight improvement in the blood of 1972. You have a good way. Than in wasting time overall
