At first it seemed that David H. Steinberg's script would have a real smart point that could create a romantic comedy, but BUT BUT BUT, but ok, dear! What had happened in the way ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I'll tell you what happened, originally (Animal House - 1978) and (Porky's - 1982). But those things are pioneers of the new genre of godfather: raw teen comedy. Then in 1990, it came after a major event that became a hit song. (I am a nasty person) such as (Problem Child - 1990), (Dumb and Dumber - 1994), (Nutty Professor - 1996) and (there is something about Mary - 1998) that I think the slack people are affected. With the highest age and one of the next and only prophets: (American Pie - 1999) which is an undoubted and unsurpassed type icon After that, I thought that every type of comedy would have to be dirty and disgusting to be admired by the youth. Otherwise, it might be outdated! <br /> <br /> I believe (Slackers) have the first smart plot as a script, then the manufacturers have to add a lot of rudeness, unconsciousness, sex that is unscrupulous to do. In those days, it's as easy as pie! As if they had to fill every element freely, such as: self-help, oral sex, urination .. etc. just to see the la mode 'they are all unnecessary elements in this matter But of course they need to make a profit and to follow the latest story in creating teen comedies The problem is that these things have replaced all possible comedies in it. <br /> <br /> Some of the moments of it look truly scary and that's what you see. Everything is in the look and performance (Jason Schwartzman), disgusting, memorable to the end. So the ambition changed from being a romantic comedian to creating something that wasn't done before. Is like a horror movie that you ask all the time What nasty will happen? (Vomiting, fart, etc ..); These are the easiest combinations of current comedy. <br /> <br /> Even if you hate, you must love something. For me, it was only the scene of Gina Gershon Hijack. However, they designed it as a whole to gain evil-against-evil, such as the mischievous dreams of teenagers. Although most are close to anyone's nightmare, <br /> <br /> The thing that makes me sad is that this is the core of the work that has real potential and is no longer funny. Became a good remembering detail of the exam theft (the first 2 minutes), so the main plot of the movie (weirdo tried to reach the girl by cool blackmail) through the form of (Boys love women and women love other boys) It's nothing but a schlock that is straightforward. It tackles the content of it that is a bunch of dirty college men who don't do anything. But doing something nasty out of nothing to do It ended with being and I'm sorry to say it sh * t! <br /> <br /> At the end, it says something. (You can imagine!) About time and place too. For a swindler or looser to win completely like this, funny himself. It sounds good, but for other films that are better; Which can guarantee my opinion about this one is a smart one .. once! And don't need to understand much that the filmmakers are really lazy! Perhaps foolishness may be the smartest way in Hollywood, but even though the end result here doesn't have the least flair for the feelings of any words. <br /> <br /> PS : Screenwriter (David H. Steinberg), author of the story (American Pie 2) as well. There is a main page at IMDb which you will find under "More details" is usually the word His "plot of words" is: sex / vulgarity / vulgar humor / ... They forget to write urine while showering or bathing a 70 year old woman!
