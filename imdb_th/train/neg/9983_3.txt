This film is a huge Yawn that proves that Americans do not have jokes. Although it was written for them! The original movie "Hodet Over Vannet" is a comedy with errors that I will rate 8/10. It's not about language translation. But some ridiculous events were completely skipped, robbing the movies of unscrupulous, intelligent, original nature
