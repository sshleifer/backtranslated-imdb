I don't know why they created This version of "persuasion" when they have an excellent mini series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I think they want to create a feature-length version. But of course there must be a lot of deletion Alas, what ended up on the floor was the adorable wit and humor that left the film that was just a melodrama rather than showing the manners and manners in England. <br /> <br /> Amusing, shallow and Not interesting They had a poor Anne running up and down the road after Captain Wentworth, like a foolish teenager. (And if you are a foolish teenager, read this story, let me tell you: running like a man like a woman in the heat is not cold). That is what women are good in Napoleon era, never do and not this heroine /> <br /> Some people say that they find funny clowns. My reaction is not laughter. But is rape The idea of ​​the Austen's corruption is insulting. <br /> <br /> It's scary.
