Veronica Mars' greatest mystery is not what she had to fight on screen. <br /> <br /> Somewhat mysterious that causes the score to be disappointed. This is still in the air. This week marked the nadir for Veronica Mars: ranked 146th out of 146 entries in the big 6 (soon to be big 5) Yes, you read correctly. Veronica Mars defeated all of WB's programs now that have expired and all items on UPN. It has been overcome by all performances on Fox and of course by all performances on ABC, CBS and NBC. > Hip players will say: But this is the return. But everything on the TV that week is a new release! It makes it impossible to figure out why the CW is so disappointing. This is one of the few records from UPN. <br /> <br /> Obviously there is something behind the scenes. The exchange of help has the influence and influence that has been sold. <br /> <br /> Sorry to mock others. But there are other explanations. The line "Veronica Mars has the potential" is clearly dead. It now has two years to create itself and fail to do it. <br /> <br /> Maybe it is. The influence and influence of Joel Silver, but frankly Why do everyone choose to use their influence on a bad program that doesn't have viewers watching? <br /> <br /> The great mystery and the improbable debut for CW
