It's not shocking for you when I say Alone in the Dark is a crappy movie. To put it honestly, it was as if the animal droppings were taken out of the fruit and vomited. The final product will still shine for this film. <br /> <br /> Watch the ancient Atari video game. This movie has something related to the portal to the world. Demons and ancient civilizations Something about having two worlds of darkness and light (Let's guess who we are) Oh, and 10,000 years ago, the most advanced advanced civilization opened the door. The devil came in and then exploded. Which is why we have never heard the names of them easily enough. <br /> <br /> Christian Slater is perhaps the day of Heathers and the sound level accelerator. Play the paranormal researcher Edward Carnby that Something Bad happened when he was 10 years old. He was hot on the path of one of the inventions of the advanced civilization mentioned. Carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713, which tried to find out what had happened to the civilization long ago. That he would not be able to find the answer he needed, so he left the group. <br /> <br /> But see that these beasts have gone out and they have been preyed in various forms such as While gouging it out, split it into the middle, bury the neural control device into them, or just change it to become a zombie. Yes, it's a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> It's about refining that I can create a plot. It is quite complicated and difficult to understand. In a similar movie, we may see the brave researchers / adventurers think of the steps and when we the audience has a mind with the researchers, it's very fun. But when the scene changes from an attack to an attack without a view or context ... it's not fun. <br /> <br /> The performance is frightening for Slater, which (although he almost seems embarrassed in the movie) Shows that he can bear the burden of acting. He must; Get this - Tara Reid was selected as a museum administrator! Honest and good Reid's "Newfoundland" pronunciation is "New Fownd Land". Reid presents almost all of her songs in a single, shocking voice. Museum curators take into account you - spend a lot of movies in hip jeans and hip jeans. Oh yes, you can believe as much as Jessica Simpson, who gives the stock price. Oh, why do cute people have to be dumb? (Note: I don't think that Tara Reid will look good. Everything. She looks like she needs food all the time.) Almost everyone on the cast will forget the perfect example, except perhaps Steven Dorf, who plays Burke. The leader from 713, Dorf's character is not well developed. But nothing in this movie, from characters to characters to Tara Reid But I'm talking about <br /> <br /> Anyway, the most horrifying and miserable story is hard enough to follow this movie in a dynamic rhythm. It's very loud. You don't hear what the actors say in some scenes! It's wrong However, at the show level, it may be thanks to Mr. Boll. <br /> <br /> Oh and fun notes. The opening hours of the movie include subtitles ... of words that crawl through the screen at the same time. Can you remember Star Wars for the first time? You heard that the familiar Star Wars theme now, while the prologue crawled Of course, there is no need for lectures. Why do I need some doofus to read what is on the screen for me? Does the manufacturer look for a blind person? Maybe that could explain why the soundtrack is so loud - they are also careful to hear those who are hard to hear. In addition, the mysterious narrator rippled for the first few lines of the data collection - then made a strange disappearance. <br /> <br /> The only person in the dark is the loud voice of a terrifying performance. Uninterrupted and directing hands at the ham Hardly know the real ring There is a lot of chaos that the audience surrenders, just caring about their characters and their roots. Even in the dark, demonic creatures look cooler and more developed than comparing <br /> <br /> ridiculously because only three people in the theater, so I watched this Alone in the Dark. I wonder if Uwe Boll is planning Is that so? I can't give this lowest rating because I have low hopes for starting with - and because it never makes me enough for me to work on this issue. It is bad, even though Slater will redeem himself a little.
