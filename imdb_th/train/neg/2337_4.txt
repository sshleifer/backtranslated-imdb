I do not know what is contrary to this ... This is a really bad movie ... It didn't do anything for me. The only scene that descended is that everyone gathered at parties and music. Good, playing high and good rhythm Filming movies that make you move .... that's the best part of the movie ... otherwise the movie lacks everything that will suck the audience in without a story, nothing to think like some people say That there is no collaboration between A different story ... It is another attempt to make Anderson 'Magnolia' again, which is excellent. But it is blatantly failing ... Okay, it's light and easy to see, but that's movieclips too. Maybe write a story before you make a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian movies I've ever seen.
