I love the "Masters of Horror" series that is wrong. Often scary fans live in a lack of continual maintenance. Projects like this (and similar "Greenlight" projects that give "celebrations" - just like us or lumpy) are breeding places for bubbles, a wonderful idea in the minds of directors with the fear of developing Love to eat with horror. <br /> <br /> This thing starts with the kernel of the real idea and runs ... away from the edge of "Where am I going in this world !!!". <br /> <br /> I don't know how to destroy the spoils, but "SPOILER AHEAD" Suddenly ... There is no light that floats across the sky. The night soon ... We have aliens that glow in the hair (huh? ... HUH?) Brain piercing men and ... Yes, I understand. But ... uh ... the curse is bad. Most of the storytelling - arousal br /> <br /> Queue to storytellers ... Your collection must have a higher return than Perfect Not the other way. Math. Storytelling 101. <br /> <br /> The end of the spoiler - big!
