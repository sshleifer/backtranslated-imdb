This is the greatest shit ever. It seems that they spend more time, effort and money making more DVD covers than they do in real movies. I think the DVD has been changed with someone's homemade porn until I remember an actor from the cover. This movie looks like someone created it with a hundred dollars and a video camera. The picture is really clear. But that includes a very unfortunate light of movies if you can call it production, acting if that's what they're actually doing and scripts if they have one. Make this movie look. Worse than old porn At least old porn has issues. It seems that some PETA members come together and decide to create a nuisance and pointlessness PSA about the rights and feelings of animals. This is not worth the money or time. There's nothing like BTK's true serial killer, in addition to the names of some of the killers and victims. The person who made this movie should be glad that he is not independent or he may come after them just to make this movie very bad.
