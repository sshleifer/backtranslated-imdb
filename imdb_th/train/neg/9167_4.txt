"The Leap Years" is a film adapted from e-novella by Singaporean writer Catherine Lim, who became Singapore's first novel / novel to be sold via the internet. This film has a post-production schedule that looks lively: filmed in early 2005. It is scheduled to be released in late 2005, but will be launched in the next 3 years on February 29, 2008, which is the year. Leap <br /> <br >> Before I said anything, I had to admit that I was not a romantic fan, so I might be a little biased with this movie - I watched it just because it was the creation of Singapore and Sa The car was borrowed At my neighborhood library This is my two cents in the movie. <br /> <br /> We started by saying that apart from the KS of Qi Yu-wu and Wong Li-Lin, everyone in that note seemed to be Asian. Interesting love is Eurasia. (Ananda Everham) and Wong's three friends But as an Asian This movie makes the story of the stereotype that falls in love and connects with Europe as "more" than ordinary Chinese people. In addition, everyone in the movie speaks with a mysterious "anglified" accent that does not exist anywhere, of course, not in Singapore. It is a "semi-complete English" that officials want us to say. But that doesn't exist outside of the MTV Channel. The result is a movie box, listening to insult, compulsion and cynicism, not being helped by the lack of a true blue Singaporean actor. <br /> <br /> The script writer The drama seems to be trying too hard to use one line of liners after twenty minutes. The "ingenuity" of the movie began to sluggish and the movie began to show ancient thoughts. <br /> <br /> I guess I didn't enjoy the movie because the place of lasting love for over 16 years seems unbelievable. <br /> <br /> There are other foreign matter in the movie. I can't believe that KS (played by Qi Yu-wu) will fall in love with one of the girlfriends. And the scene that the groom says "Go before I change my mind" was used in East Asia. (Korea, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc.) TV programs ... <br /> <br /> So 4 stars for this movie. The production value is fair and Wu Lin tries his best. But she didn't get help from the script. Joan Chen had 15 minutes in the older Wong movie and probably the best actress in this story. But wait, her role is just hijacked. <br /> <br /> If you come across "The Leap Years" in a rental or library, you may want to appear in the DVD player for the sake of curiosity. But otherwise, for those who don't like romanticism, you can decide whether or not to miss.
