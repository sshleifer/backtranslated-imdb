From the conversation and the opening scene, I know that I know myself in the train. Do not want to look But can't turn If it is not for the film's eyes, I will give one star. The fact that the interaction between the characters and the relationship behavior is drawn in a bad direction and the scary story makes this movie nothing more than a low-budget disaster. Money is definitely not necessary for making good movies. But this film failed horribly. There was no chance to rebound. <br /> <br /> If you're stuck in the woods, your childhood friend is dying from a disease that doesn't know other friends. <br /> <br /> A.) Escape from everyone and try your luck. B.) Have sex with your girlfriend. C.) Take a warm shower to relax your grief. Including shaving your legs. D.) Bashing in your childhood's head. E.) All of the above mentioned <br /> <br /> According to Eli Roth, saying that there is no answer, in all truth, there is a reason and it is A good representative in Cabin Fever. The lack of truth and unreasonable effort to explain what people will do in a traumatic situation has screened this movie in the Bonehead Bin at your local rental store. Any Far away
