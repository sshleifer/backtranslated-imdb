This movie has errors. The score and performance are not bad by David Muir. As Dr. Hackenstein credits, the beginning and end shows along with most actors and "Special effects" which are movies with low budget There is nothing in this movie that you can't find in scientists who are crazy about horror / comedy or cheap movies. Not special for lovers of nude scenes or bad movie lovers as well. This movie is just here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller have nothing to get excited as well. If you are curious as I am and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of one line summary.
