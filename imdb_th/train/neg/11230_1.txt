In the sixth grade, every teacher I decided that it would be a good idea to make this film a semester course. Every class has something related to this horrible performance. We look in English and write in the journal as if we were one of the characters. In mathematics, we talk about charts and other sea crap in science. We talked about whales. (Which is actually quite interesting, so this is not a 100% waste of time) every day, every day being tortured Not only that But they will make us afraid this twice a day by allowing us to look in the study hall as well. I can see if this is a new series or something. But it's like '93. I'm still trying to block this.
