At first, the movie seems to be doing well. They have profiles, characters that are defined ... The plot seems to go in the right direction ... However, when the movie goes on .. or can fix it. Lots of movies The characters of the characters changed more in the movie. In addition, there seems to be many implications - in other words - they have things in the movie that don't seem to fit the movie itself. And the title ... no title in the movie that matches the movie ... I think this name is suitable for preview .... actors do well with what they have ..... if they have Better director And writers. Perhaps this is better But it wasn't So now there will be a horrible new movie coming out this Friday .... my opinion! .... Don't waste your time or money.
