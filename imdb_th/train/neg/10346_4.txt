You think with Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter that this movie is probably much better. Sadly, the film has problems from characters that are difficult to believe, as well as important planning issues that make certain characters seem to be stuck in the brain. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with Ingrid Bergman Everything looks very slim and swollen - the family likes Bergman and everything is not perfect. That is, until the mother (Fay Wray) died, the stock market crashed in 1907 (eliminating family treasure) and Bergman was forced to go home to France. This movie is quite sweet, sticky, but not bad. <br /> <br /> Later, after the fortunes of the family improved, Bergman returned. She once again as a guardian, but briefly everything will swell again, but when WWI happens, the four men enter the war - Gosh! Among these things, a son (David) brought his new wife home. (Susan Hayward) The character of Ms. Hayward is black and white, like everyone else, although while they are all good and swollen, she clearly states that he is a demon. In the family home while David was at war. <br /> <br /> Now, this is where this movie really gets stupid - dumb, brain. Hayward starts a relationship with his brother. David's But when Father saw the shadow of his lover, Bergman walked into the room from the entrance and pretended that she wasn't Hayward and Jack! why?! Why would a conscious person do this to help protect the apparent evil and conspiracy of women? This is Bergman's excuse that is necessary to get rid of snipe in the trough every time! This is just a case of lousy writing and makes me mad ... and most of the time do the same with the audience in 1941. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie consists of opportunities that fail after The chance of Hayward's failure, the evil that will be revealed It's just flying across common sense and making this film a ridiculous nonsense. However, as expected, the truth will eventually come out and everyone will swell again --- happy to be a big, lovely family. Erase Hayward's body <br /> <br / > This film suffers because of poor writing. Hayward's story is not reasonable - at least in the way of management. And having a scary or good character (Nothing in it) made this film up to the second soap level. The only thing that can help is acting. - They try their best as they can with boring scripts. It can be said that the Columbia Pictures writer who made this movie should hit the dead chicken!
