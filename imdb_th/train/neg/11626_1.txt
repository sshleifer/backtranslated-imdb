This may be the worst show I've ever seen. In addition to the insipidness of having a story about Hitler, it is not funny or entertaining. It is similar to the 1950s sitcom drama about Cornball's humor and inventive situations. But while it can do well in I Love Lucy, it's not funny. I think this program is based on novelty. "Luke, it was Hitler as a sitcom" but it was quite flat in everything. The guy playing with Hitler was hard to sit alone. I wonder if it makes the network think this is a good idea to broadcast. I think America has a tasteless performance. But we must overcome this time America has never aired sitcoms about Hitler, although we have a list of Lincoln slaves about the Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer. There is a chance that you may not have seen this program because it only aired once and may never have. DVD release
