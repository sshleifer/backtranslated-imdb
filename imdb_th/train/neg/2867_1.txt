I was lying in bed with cold or flu or whatever. I think I might sometimes kill some horror movies that my mother bought for me recently. I hope I won't choose this movie! After I watched it, I felt more discomfort and I wanted to throw up. Afterwords (when I'm better, of course) I did research on Dennis L.Rader and I noticed that Dennis in the movie is not like the real thing I hope that no one will see this movie. But if they do not eat or you feel the way I feel after first viewing I think you will have more time to watch The Santa Claus 3. At least that movie has better reviews on this website.
