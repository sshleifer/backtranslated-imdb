If you've watched this movie, you'll know it! If you haven't and want to watch classic BAD movies, I suggest you watch this movie because it's ranked as the worst. So if you are really tired of going to rent it, if you want to know what it is, here's my small summary: Adam Sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with models for Miss Universe and five person Adam doesn't like how one passenger gets all the babies and he tries to come in with funny jokes. But wait! It's only worse! You will have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it is.
