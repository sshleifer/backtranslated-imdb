You can let JMS and the boys pass because they are at the beginning of their series and with a small budget. But this movie is still a sub-section Don't understand me wrong. The B5 series is the best TV series ever. But if I was an executive who watched this movie, I wouldn't have ordered the series. I don't like O'Hare as a stupid costume actor and have many ancient ideas. Can say that most of the first season (except Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately put the fire in the series and it was an amazing phenomenon. If you are a B5 fan and haven't seen this movie If you're not a B5 fan, don't ... You don't want to watch this series.
