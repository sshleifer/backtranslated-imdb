The author came out in "The journey of discovery" of his "roots" in the southern tobacco industry because he believes the film "Bright Leaf" (complete and forgotten) deserves about his ancestors. It was not, and in fact he did not find anything that was even less interesting in the movie Home Raving and this insult was suitable for screenings at the drunken family rally. But did not come out commercially or even commercially The reminder of why most independent films are not selected by big studios because they are boring, irrelevant and do not care about anyone except the director and his / her circle. Avoid all costs!
