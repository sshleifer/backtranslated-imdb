"Washington Square" is a book adapted from a short novel by Henry James. In fact, this novel is very good. But still far from the level of James's masterpiece Moreover, a simple story without incident seems to be inappropriate to make it into a movie (although William Wyler and his "The Heiress" in 1949 created a beautiful novel) <br /> <br /> However, This movie completely clears the spirit of the work of this great American writer. In the novel, the heroine Catherine is a shy, uninteresting and somewhat clumsy person. But still, she was the voice of a wise woman, and she was not innocent. The attachment to her father is respectable and graceful, without any abnormalities caused by three-fourths movies. Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) seems to be a mentally retarded person. In the last quarter she (And incredibly) became intelligent, aware of her dignity as a woman and everything. <br /> <br /> Director Agnieszka Holland added two vulgar scenes. The first time when Catherine's children had problems with her vesica, the second scene when we saw the open-air brothel background with prostitutes taking customers behind the tents and so on. The art of Henry James It is well known that the author is appropriate and reliable even in the Victorian era. I challenge anyone to find roughness anywhere in the thousands of pages of James's great literary production. I was very annoyed with both scenes. <br /> <br /> Yeah, I know that the director wants a reasonable freedom to modify the novel's screen. But if one director ignores or misunderstands the author's art (This is Henry James) I didn't see the point of using him to make a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The performance was enough for the movie: the poor and the flat, despite Albert Finney's talent. And Maggie Smith "Washington Square" is a movie that is not recommended for use
