This movie is a cowardly story. I am not concerned with the emotions in every character that the biggest character of the movie is myself. I played it beautifully all the time. Promised myself that I would walk away But just drink another bottle of beer, hoping that it will magically change into something to eat along the way. Even in these conditions, I couldn't help but notice that Cuban performances were subtle like tracing paper. His devoted dedication to his work was unbelievably the same as drinking one of his nights after the failure of his foolish standard Bert came on the screen as a general, yes, General (Those who make up too much) I agreed horribly fast with Cuba's rivals, except for me being real and I touched my feet. Calculate my polished toe!
