This is a very scary production. The general consensus has always been that while Princess Margaret may have been destroyed and pampered and may be more than happy to eliminate her, she is a very beautiful woman. This is the weakest point of production. Female actors can't understand that. In addition, it appears that the production budget cannot be stretched to the hairdresser from the beginning of the hairs on the character. Princess Margaret has a permanent bird's nest that looks messy and looks as if she was dragged through the bush The actor who played the Duke of Edinburgh seemed to be prepared for his role by watching Rory Bremner mimic the Prince Charles and being a grotesque. <br /> <br /> The production is a flaw that rides on ancient horses that Shameful I think every Daily Mail reader should get a free DVD for Christmas!
