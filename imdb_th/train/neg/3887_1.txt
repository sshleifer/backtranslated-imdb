I managed to see this thing with the help of MST3K and oh boy. Despite having riffing the film, it was excruciatingly bad. Imagine someone who has the ability with a camera can do by monkeys. <br /> <br /> Highlights (what's less) come from special effects that are "OK". The big one is "OK"; Even if there is nothing special But the quality is higher than the other B movies that I have seen in the past. <br /> <br /> This movie is very bad. The camera man on the roller skates and pushed him along the story (if it was called) was filled with holes that were almost funny. It never explained why the hell he had survived from the beginning or wanted human flesh to survive. The script is poorly written and the dialogue is close to the stupid plane. The climax to the movie (if any) is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you can't find the MST3K version, avoid this problem without charge.
