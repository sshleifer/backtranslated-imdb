I will not call it scary. But there is nothing that shines in this film and it is developed with the development of a basic plot that is seriously unbelievable It started well. But when the main attack is complete, it will become a long-term subplot around an unattractive girl and some action scenes that are unrealistic. For example, there is a long shot at the airport where all the light is stroboscope. There is no explanation for that. How reliable it is for the airport storage area to have a blinking and open fire that is confusing and sufficient to make Snip an incredible escape. This is one of the few action scenes that are separated from the settings that can't pull the right belief. <br /> <br /> In addition, the whole place looks like the CIA team of USA can Shoot the place up But fled by saying "National security" with Brits. This mechanism relies on a fixed rule that is far from satisfying reality. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of better action movies. Better formulas, better action Sometimes there is some entertainment. But there is not enough bone meat and soon after, it is very boring - something that shouldn't happen in a good action movie
