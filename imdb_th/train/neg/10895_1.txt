I have seen many bad movies. Mostly I can enjoy crappy horror movies for what it is. But this will bring badness to the new extremes. <br /> <br /> It's gentle. Plan for what it has never really been and take over it. No bumps, no horror, no suspense, just rubbing someone to rub yourself for an hour and a half, then finish quickly <br /> <br />
