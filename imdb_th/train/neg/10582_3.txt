At first I was confident that this was a movie created to watch TV which was not worth the time. But after a few minutes after that became a panic, I knew that at least there was a cartoon value in the stunts and c-movie movies. This movie would have been 1 if my wife and I didn't laugh hard at the moment. We watched it with suspicion that It's like the funny little spy of The Big Hit (I laughed a lot. Actually, I bought Big Hit DVD) with a worse performance. We were disappointed that Nick chose to marry Elena, not Jim. After hugging and high fives, all the rum and coke are a little easier to help.
