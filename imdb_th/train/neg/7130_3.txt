This movie should be called Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who do not play the Need For Speed ​​game, mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot. This works perfectly with Redline. The only thing about this movie is the A-Level. It is a car. It seems that the show is forced and scripted. The location is the most subtle and the storyline is almost none. I watched this movie just to see how bad it was and while it was terrible, it was worse. And at least it's fun I just hope they show Eddie Griffin bumps Enzo somewhere in the movie. In summary, do not pay out. But if in the showtime or HBO and nothing else, it is a distraction
