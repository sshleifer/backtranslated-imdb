The long list of "big" in this flick (including the widespread John Mills) didn't shake me until I couldn't judge the true moral movie. It is full of caricature patterns and standards set from hero ace to avid gladiator. The music track was like that at one point, about an hour before the end. I thought that this movie ended: the louder the big spire grew and ended in silence I didn't find the real story, haphazard writing. But a cleverly pressed uniform and Jean Simmons (pre-nasal work) with a lovely, slightly inspiring song I can't say that this image has ingredients that make the movie great. I find it ridiculous, disgusting and less.
