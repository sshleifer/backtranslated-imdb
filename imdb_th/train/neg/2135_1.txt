Just throwing garbage I'm a big fan of Cusacks. This is the only reason I watched this movie. But the only reason I can see their presence is to respond with a perfect and deeper quality than their true role from Grosse Point Blanc. In addition, the role of the film as a political satire cannot be shown. Can see that it is too clear to have a clear purpose And charging it as a satirical word, is just an insult to ordinary people, even chimpanzees The imitation is clearly the most flattering word. But when I saw that this was not something that was close to Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league that I found (See if you are a mentally retarded person) The Spartans in terms of political satire This one fades into confusion. It certainly deserves.
