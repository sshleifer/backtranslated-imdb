I don't like this movie! First of all, I don't know why. But everyone here says that the play of ClémencePoés is great, which in my opinion is really wrong! She doesn't look like Natasha: reappearance, another character ... worse, she is a very inexperienced actress and that's why she can't play this role! She completely disfigured the heroine! That's really disgusting to watch her play! For my thoughts, it is much better to give this role to the Russian actress because it will be much easier for you to understand the Russian spirit for the Russian people. Unfortunately, Kutuzov looks like a drunken man who has not shaved for 2 weeks and lost the fight that he opened his eyes ... (Thank God in this movie, there are some great actors! Alessio Boni handled his job very well. I was surprised. He was one of the few people who read the book, which is very important for playing. Also, I like the drama of our Russian actor. To see them)) The only thing I like in this event is the view that is very beautiful and the set is amazing! My advice is to read the book and understand the true feelings, the purpose that Leo Tolstoy wrote of this masterpiece and may understand all the ideas of this book ... 1 out of 10
