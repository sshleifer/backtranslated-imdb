I am not ranked for The Amati Girls and I think I am a really kind person. Scoring 4 out of 10 things that may be a great story. Actually, many or less famous actors become jokes In my eyes. There are many clich√©s in the flick of a woman's hair, just scary and most scenes are more unrealistic or look like fake. There is no passion in this movie. But there are many actors who act beyond the limits that it hurts It's not funny enough to be a comedian. It's too sad to be able to really feel. So in my eyes it's not good. Look, I can't believe that there is something that makes my TV in the living room in Switzerland, but .. Maybe it's still okay and it's lost in translation? Who knows. Of course, it's one of the most strange movies I've ever seen, and it's not absolutely good! Sorry!
