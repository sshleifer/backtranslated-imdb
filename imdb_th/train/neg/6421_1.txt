I was surprised with some reviews of this movie. The only place that seems to tell the truth is RottenTomatoes.com This movie is terrible. Extreme lazy storyline It's not scary as well. The people there who thought that because it was the actor Sarah Michel Geller, it was something that resentment should be forgotten. This movie is like Dark Water except that it is predictable and slower. I am very disappointed with this movie. It doesn't make me scared and doesn't care about me too. Seeing this type of plot was beaten to death at this stage, such as Dead people try to contact living things - dragonflies, things that are underneath, ghost stories, dark water, darkness, shuffle, etc. etc. For me, it seems that only one person currently writes horror. This movie that comes out of Hollywood is a cynical practice of making money without respecting the audience. They are being upset.
