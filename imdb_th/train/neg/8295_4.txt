I always like movies that are driven by characters. I think Hope Davis will continue to perform well, so I have high hopes for this movie. Those hopes are sooner or later. <br /> <br /> The main flaw of this film is the direction. There are many scenes arranged according to daydreaming. This film uses the character Denis Leary as the character character of Campbell Scott's character. It didn't work for me at all. This will be more effective than playing movies. <br /> <br /> There are problems with the plot as well. It is important that the characters in the movie have to travel and end up in a different place than they started. I do not feel that the characters grow up from the experience expressed in the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the editing is not good as well. There is a very large prolapse in the middle of a particularly boring movie. <br /> <br /> Except for acting, which I feel is always strong
