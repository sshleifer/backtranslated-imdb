This movie is terrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is a great movie Goodgfellas. It's not but one of the better crime movies. This film should be considered close to THE STING Part2 or may be a speed zone. Remember those gems! The only reason for this movie is to take advantage of the original cult. This movie lacks everything. De Palma, Pacino and Penn work very hard. There are no cute characters and that's the fault of everyone responsible for creating it. I hope RISE TO POWER will win all RAZZIE who can and maybe Invent new categories to be able to own statistics. After I watched the movie S @ * T FEST, I sat down and watched Carlitos' original methods to make the taste worse. After watching this, I hope Pachanga will come to me and overcome my misery.
