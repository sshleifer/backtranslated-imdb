The only good thing about this movie is the image of Goldie Hawn, who stood in her small frilly bikini pants and struggled to make a dozen other wicked women unable to remove the sticky cotton top. Get her out while giggling Ooooof! Her waist is comparable to Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen years old and that image almost killed me. I totally forgot that it was hiding in the mischievous Roladex in my heart until seeing another day on the TV that they blurred in her medium size. In that scene, the great grief reminded me of the hottest woman. Of Goldie Hawn in the 80s. Kurt Russell must have a fun life
