Cage (1989) is another low-budget action movie "Buddy" created in the 1980s. Thank you very much because most of the movies like 48 hours and armament. One of these is Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno, a former Vets veterinarian of Vietnam who used to use a local dive bar. Reb took care of Lou because he saved his life in 'Nam. But Lu was shot in the head and is now quite soft. Although he is big, Lou has a child's brain. One day, some gangsters threw in the bar and Lu and Rebb smashed the tar from them. But pay back as a mother They broke the bar out of Lou and Reb, with nothing. That was until these two gangsters came into the picture. (One of them is really good) who has a plan in mind. <br /> <br /> The movie is a waste of time. Maybe if they go as they want and then do the heavy action scenes instead of trying to reduce the horror of the situation, maybe it will work. Alas, it can't be, and the audience will be left with a bag. Oh, well, it's terrible because you have all the elements for the B-movie. Good luck. Next time, I guess <br /> <br /> Not recommended. <Br / > <br /> xxx
