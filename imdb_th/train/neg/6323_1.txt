This movie is a bad memory since my childhood. This is one of the movies that they show children on a rainy day at school when you can't go out to relax and you want to see more. At least that was like when I was in elementary school. I remember hating this movie. Granted, I didn't see it in 15 years or more, and they may no longer use it on a rainy day. But I just want to remind everyone: You should use this to make your children sleep more than entertainment. They trust me. Choose something else. Although the topic is debatable But the story is quite tame and slow until I can't remember anything except that I don't like it very much. Here, 15 years later, I feel like having to warn you all.
