I saw this movie with a mountaineering instructor and we found that everything was ridiculous. (For one, if Stallone is free, climbing by himself, no need to carry any equipment, but I think the carabiners hanging behind. "Mountain climbing" So try throwing them in.) For those who are lobotomized that think Colorado looks like dolomite in Italy. (Who is filming the movie) The Hollywood moguls filmed something ridiculous and smelly than you would swallow.
