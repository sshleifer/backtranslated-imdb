Big money machines can do it again! Disney has a lot of expertise, taking advantage of mental retardation like himself who feels that we have to own every video. (Good or bad) stamped with Disney's nickname Why am I looking forward to these "sequels" that make Don Bluth on a bad day like Leonardo DaVinci? Cinderella 2 consists of three stories. (It's a bad choice!) The most adorable Disney creation, at least not deserving of a linear story? In these three stories, only the final story will come to the quality of the animation and the narrative I expect. Ruthless and modern music (Meaning in 2 years it will be dated) and do not add anything to the story Why do you need to update everything? Did you know that the original cartoons are still popular due to immortality, so why not respect and be true to the original music with style that reflects the same style? Gee, I can't wait for the sequel to Sleeping Beauty. Instead of Tchaikovsky's theme song, we will be inspired by Britney Spears songs !!! So, Disney, if you're listening, remember that we don't separate children from here. How to throw one or two bones to the fans who have been long enough to know the difference between the ship and the shit.
