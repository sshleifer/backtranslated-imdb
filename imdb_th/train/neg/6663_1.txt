I can't stand this show! Have you ever had a one-time ransom, a funny one, or one plot line that "no" makes the average audience want to drown in a wet cracker bowl? <br /> <br /> Oh, that sounds scary and sad. Similar to dragging a good cutlery set repeatedly on a blackboard with dust, each character is annoying in his or her aptitude in the nasal shrill. Cosmo listened to the wailing sound. Vicki listened as a ready-made template and Timmy's father made every line sound like a bad imitation of the game host. (Guy Smiley from "Sesame Street" came to mind) <br /> < br /> Very bad animation Even the producer "Yu-Gi-Oh!" Laughed at the overwhelmingly bad art on this list. Every character has a buck teeth or a square head or three heads, too large for his or her body. Then the character speaks with wide eyes and smiles at every line as if posing with the president? Then there is the fact that every character in the program is perfect. Not because of the elegance of Amelia Bedelia, Homer Simpson, and Buddy Lembeck from the famous "Charles in Charge", which has been conveyed as a stupid character. Usually "unrealistic" is synonymous with "unfunny" and this is the exact case here. Never had this hurt from innocence since "The Naked Gun 33 1/3" ... and at least Leslie Nielson did well. <br /> <br /> Finally, the place of performance (and It is the same for every episode. The big spoiler alert here): Tim has a desire for something with his two. "Fair, strange". Something went wrong. There are always some artificial reasons why he can't go back immediately. And then everything turned out to be good in the end Oh and on the other side, Timmy's parents never believed him when he complained about Vicky and they still hired her on every occasion. Maybe it's just me. But it seems that the list of children with a delicate message that it is not good to tell an improper babysitter may not be a good idea. <br /> <br /> If you are writing an article and want to give an example of how the cartoon is quality How much "Fair parents" must be a good starting point. An important example of a TV program manufacturer that combines worthless products for children with little or no effort because they know that there are some people who will watch.
