Why watch this movie if you have a great movie to watch? Is a waste of time and money overall This movie is so bad that I feel bad about wanting to watch it. Everything in it is BAD. The actor is not good. The script is really bad. The story is stupid and the worst CGI. The only good time is the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club. One interesting thing with the character that we hope he will die because he is so stupid that we get enough of him. (I can't remember the name but the BOYFRIEND of "Chosen One") <br /> <br /> Note: If you want to watch a good movie, this movie is not the right choice. 0 stars out of 10
