I watch today, attracting some to actors and some because I like other movies of this family. However, this is something that must be avoided. There are dozens of bad cut scenes where continuity does not flow. Billiards challenges at the beginning, etc. The battle scenes with the natives are as good as you can remember in the black and white Tarzan movie. You know that you saw the spear fly through the air and the camera cut to the dead, still standing on the ground without sticking his thigh Is death immediately? There are also many unnecessary scenes that are not related to the plot, such as the little girl who was rescued while collecting flowers. Clay toys with really bad animations are too painful to see. If you see this film, the crab at the finger forward about 5kph is highlighted. One can creep up on David Mccullum and give him a pinch. As if there was no time to go away, as when the obelisk fell away, the natives had time to move around the world 2 steps to the left, but there was no screaming and it fell to him. This is because Ekkamai and why Mccullums voice is stuttering while the movie goes on?
