NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB and other agencies in the world should watch this movie to get information about how to spy on people. (According to MST3k's description, says ... "Sanata has all the dirt. Santa's mustache is far from being hidden from the organization. Klaus") <br /> <br /> From a telescope that can spy millions. Miles to the ears that can hear everything. It's wonderful that CIA doesn't have Santa in the payroll. <br /> <br /> Satan's dance routine is hilarious. Pitch ... he's so useless. <br /> <br /> The supporting role of this movie is like Much Very low budget but very fun. I recommend watching the Mystery Science Theater 3000 for more laughs. <br /> <br /> You also laugh at the misfortunes of good children. <br /> <br /> I give this thing with producing 1 quality item and 10 for pure cheese and fun factors.
