I rented this movie about a month ago when I had nothing to do on Friday night. All I can say to explain this worthless movie is 'Trash'. Actions can be very bad. I see children in high school doing better work than both actors. It seems like they just read their script no feelings And there is no room to catch the audience in other records. Special effects are amazingly crazy and everything looks like it was shot with a camera that everyone can buy a radio hut. What on the video cover? Heck, he didn't appear in this movie until near the end, and all he did was a song humming and following a few characters. There is no real murder shown, so this is not a real slasher movie either. Since I've seen it, I have asked something 1 if it's a serial serial killer 'if not a serial killer to kill. Joker? 2. If your friend disappears, why would you go out in the forest to have sex instead of looking for you? Really sad. <br /> <br /> 3. Why is the only real action smelly at the end, all of a sudden? Do the actors decide to show their efforts? This movie is as sad as they come. My advice is to avoid renting, so you don't lose one or two hours of laughing rather than screaming.
