I am looking forward to seeing Amanda Peet in another good role after just renting "The Whole Nine Yards" - worth the rental easily - but this is not it. <br /> <br /> I can remember. The trailer for "Whipping" is quite funny and plot about twenty New Yorkers who are in danger and under the control of Mrs. Pete, who is charming. So I believe that two friends one afternoon will come to see this movie with me. This examination is my punishment. <br /> <br /> In the first action, we have three leaders who will explain the conquest in the restaurant. Things that should be funny or at least somewhat pathetic Is there a redemption feature about the three men and their encounters that we should have received from this story? <br /> <br /> [And while I don't care about movies that are rude, cheerful, I wonder Why no one In the restaurant, turn around when the buttons speak loudly about sexual details and scatalogical. Do they do this every week at the same restaurant? You will think that someone is complaining. Oh, wait, I forgot: Two diners noticed in one scene. But this is just a setting for pearl Everyone in the deaf restaurant is deaf] <br /> <br /> The second action has three pins, all falling in love with Mia and developing a rotten brain, unable to ask each other about what happened between them. Four. And I always ask myself that the buttons act like they used to be. She saw the qualities of exchanging with them for more than a day. Did she start with a rotten brain? I hope Eric's character, a married couple, becomes more than just an annoying punching bag in this scene. His role is clear to give advice about marriage. But why do they have to talk to him when they don't talk? And his advice? Sheeesh! <br /> <br /> Third action, edit the plot with But now i am watching my watch My friend told me that they are still waiting for something really funny to happen and I have to admit. All the scenes described are adequate and manage to explain all the questions and mysterious conversation bits throughout the movie. But we just check them out of the list ("Okay, okay, that's why Brad happened and Jonathan said this and ...") <br /> <br /> What we do is a laugh from the stupidity of the story. Fun stories, even the scenes during the credits, are not very funny. Eventually, I had nothing but the desire to warn people away from this movie. <br /> <br /> Score: 3
