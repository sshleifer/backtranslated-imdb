This film deals with Doctor Claw, the doctor of the story, Inspector Gadget, who returned after many years to the peaceful Metropolis city. At this time, Claw's plan was to destroy the gadget once and for all using the crime gangster "cold "New to help destroy the popularity of gadgets. Sadly, this film failed miserably. The set was great. But it was revived almost 20 years later with sad results Without Don Adams' voice as a gadget inspector, it will not cut anymore. But showing less fear But still sounded like a wrestler with cold symptoms rather than his original intimidating identity Get this as a movie for children But the plot is painfully weak (Do not heaven, I'm talking about animation) that it's pale compared to the original series.

In the two decades now, she has a style like a semi-punk rebellion and doesn't play only half the role of Gadgetmobile's talk television series, including the corner. The plot focuses on all talking cars. Maybe I was just a child who loves to grow up tired of acting. But I think the live-action version is more painful than I can tolerate. But now they go and pop the quality TV series on us. It's more than I can.
