I'm very disappointed This movie made me feel anxious about my time and psychic powers. This is the quintessential Woody Allen movie: Manhattanites High-level neuroscience is arguing whether they are cheating on their spouses. Woody I've seen these characters already. I've seen stories from you ten times. Where is your creativity ??? You have to open your eyes and look around you. The world has changed a lot since Annie Hall - and you have to change with it. <br /> <br /> There are interesting and funny situations where you can use the logo. Of suffering and neurosis - why not try them Go out instead of doing the same color over and over again. <br /> <br /> When I heard that Woody Allen had a new project, it didn't do anything for me - because I am now. Then expect His old standby: a lover who is bored and ends cheating. <br /> <br /> If Woody wants to win his fans back, he must understand that our humor and intelligence must be motivated - not insulting.
