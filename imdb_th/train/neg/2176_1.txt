Perhaps the worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy movie is that every joke must follow by insulting people in the crowd who don't laugh. If someone who is not safe is a comedian who will not shut down his audience What a high horse. If you want to be funny, just create a joke. Don't explain all the reasons that you recorded in the American way with a failed attempt to create laughter. The worst thing about movies Carlos Mencia's statement is that it is a substitute for jabs that are regarded in the ethnic sense for legitimate humor. Avoid this, such as the plague.
