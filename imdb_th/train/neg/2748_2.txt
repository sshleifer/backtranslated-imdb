This movie received the second star because I worked in the city and liked to see it destroyed. The results are quite good - I heard that it is the most expensive Korean movie ever created. Being the most expensive and frightening person is a huge waste of money. I rented it so I wouldn't complain too much about what I paid for. But it was a couple of hours that I would not return Plot hole abundance Scary performances across the board I do not recommend taking the time to watch this movie. Life is too short. If your friend wants to see this, run away. I can't stress how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> Where does the second dragon come from? Why did he not appear earlier? How do they have rockets for dinosaurs 500 years ago?
