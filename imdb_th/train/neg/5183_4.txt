This is the first collection of "8 Films To Die For" that I have seen and certainly didn't make me want to watch the rest ... even if I heard at least I don't know it's not scary. But it didn't do much for me A family of people who have your basic anomalies in the suburbs. Mother and dad died. Families sold the farm & moved to San Francisco. The best part of this story is the eerie German sister, which of course invites friends from a school that never left. However, of course, we have a meat shop in the basement and others. This family is like the white bread version of the Sawyer family. They are nasty & they do bad things. But they do not go without spirits I see a lot of reviews from people who like this and I think I don't know what I missed. But I think it's very common and I won't recommend anyone. 4 out of 10
