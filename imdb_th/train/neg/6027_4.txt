I grew up Baptist and I knew that the story of this movie was trying to tell even though I didn't believe it anymore. I will give the glory of this film as well as the average weekly Lifetime movie. The performance is moderately interesting, slightly slow. The script is predictable. The music is delicate and it is fascinating. And everyone who is left behind must not be the most clean person of all time Not a single curse from them But I laughed aloud when the actors played the United Nations executive, pronounced "Nuclear" as "Nunusitree", like Bush. That every Christian must conceal his folly by pronouncing the wrong words in the same way he? Lol! I had a hard time acting seriously after that. After the "nu-cu-ler" incident, the movie began to feel like a propaganda that was packaged and distorted. I'm looking for something brave. In fact, I'm looking for something that might make me think. But i didn't find it here If you are looking for unreasonable entertainment, stop here - it's good for killing the rainy afternoon. But if you are looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
