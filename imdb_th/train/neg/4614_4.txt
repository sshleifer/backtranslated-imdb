It is a distraction that the film has been nominated for 7 Academy Awards and received any awards. Not because it's arrogant or because of the overall honor of the creative team behind it should deserve them But because in every category, being nominated for Prizzi's honor disappointed, some people may argue that the old Hollywood pioneer John Huston lost this career. But did not buy Last year, he signed a great book under VOLCANO, which is a study of dark characters in Mexico, which are among the best groups he has ever done. Prizie's honor, on the other hand, movies that are full of star power, good intentions and good screenplays prove to be important cities. <br /> <br /> Overall sound and plot A hit of a gangster who falls in love with a hit-man woman showing examples of strange crimedies that caught Hollywood with a storm in the early 1990s, but the script was too complicated because of his own selfishness. Down and story It seems that all is not what it is: a crime drama about a gang of thugs, and Jack Nicholson. (Brooklyn accent that works well with De Niro but sounds unbelievable from Jack) and Kathleen Turner in the intro seems to be in the paycheck mode. Sleep, walk through some Anjelica Huston has a better fare. But her performance was sabotaged by the character's motives: she became a victim of the insulting of her great father. She proved to support her old husband. <br /> <br /> Color The film has the same level of quality that it was created in the early 70s and the direction of Huston is not as interesting as anything else. There is a promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a starving director to recognize that it may turn into something better. But what is left seems like a movie that no one really cares about.
