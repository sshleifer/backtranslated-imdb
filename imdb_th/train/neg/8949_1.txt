A few weeks ago I read the classic George Orwell novel 1984. I was fascinated by it and thought it was one of the best books I read recently. So when I rented a DVD, I was amazed to see. How this adjustment measures Unfortunately, the movie didn't come close to creating an atmosphere or developing a character that Orwell had mastered in his book. The director seemed to think that everyone who watched the movie had read the book because he didn't try to show why the character was acting and felt the way they did. John Hertz, the main actor, is always laughing and hardly doing any duty until the end. We have never found what he has done for a living or why his love affair is forbidden or what the political climate is and why the main character desires riots. This book is not able to create justice in the form of movies without proper subtitles and explanations of the political system that presses the characters and the fact that the missing thing is the greatest flaw of this movie. In addition, John Hertz is also an option for the selection of horrific actors, aged 15 years from Winston, who is 39 years old. On a more positive note But the rest of the actors were well selected It was terrible that they were converted into horror movies with the wrong actors - Brian O.
