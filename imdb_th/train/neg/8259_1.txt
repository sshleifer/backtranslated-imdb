I saw this movie when it premiered. <br /> <br /> It depends on the idea that autistic children can communicate with printed messages with others, just help them and guide their hands. <br /> Suddenly, many of these children didn't notice the keyboard or screen when typing text. (They can look up in the ceiling in some cases) but their caretakers are fixed at The keyboard began typing messages of abuse from parents and other people, sending parents and child welfare agencies in the left and right tizzy. <br /> <br /> All this things proved to be misunderstood when the third person presented. Open the folder for children and say 'Type the picture you see'. Then, when the presenter changes the folder to a moderator, the fold will fall, revealing different images. <br /> <br /> So while The child may see the dog as the host, seeing something like a boat. <br /> <br /> Every time, every time in Bloomin, the name of the printed image is something that the moderator has noticed, never shown to the child. <br /> <br /> So who is the type? <br /> <br /> The film continues to cause catastrophes, as the Australian poster states that people who hurt children in this movie are in a situation where children are trying to help. <br /> <br /> If you Lissa Gilbert never brought her son into that place. He will not be hurt. That's what the movie says. He is better under her supervision. <br /> <br /> If I turn my child to your organization for help and he is attacked instead, you think I will be eager to listen to everything you have to do. Speaking after that is unlikely! I think it is a safe bet that all the accusations that these children have printed, which the film is based on, they never accuse someone of their actions that happened here. <br /> < br /> Unfortunately I Do not forget that this film gives great results from Gilbert as a mother of autism. But other than that, this movie doesn't do much. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that kids are typing at the end of Patty Duke and we hear mechanical sounds, read what he typed back. ... "We win!" This child molested. If you cut my legs out and take you to court and you find guilty of harming me, whatever is the legal justice. But it didn't bring my legs back. <br /> <br /> The best in my condition. I can see that it's a hollow victory. <br /> <br /> No matter what the opportunity this child will There are things that are seen as normal with autism only being damaged by further harm. <br /> <br >> Children who are 'normal' have enough to fight this kind of experience. <Br / > <br /> It's super shallow to think that you have to watch any situation and go to 'Re Winners' If a person is convicted of an offense /> <br /> Only the court handling the situation and <br situation around here is not good.
