In the case that half of the film looks strange, that means you watch the horrifying Italian movie too! You see that the famous demigod Lucio Fulci not only But created this movie only, he also commented on the use of the most sadistic killing sequence in himself. (And easier to follow) "Cat in the Brain", an opening scene where mercilessly brutal prostitutes are composed in Fulci's next film and one kill scene and a few scenes of Andrea Bianchi's "Masssacre" Failing to be pathetic as a giallo due to the search for an abusive killer when the scene of a movie team filmed all horror movies But interesting and suspicious But it is also a good entertainment. This discrete script presents a group of nasty characters, all of which are likely to be human beings. But without a red herd, Biachi happens to be reliable and you can point out the killer almost immediately. What remains to be enjoyed is the real makeup and the great performances of the entire cast. Whenever there is no bloodshed on the screen, such as during the first and second murder The "massacre" was slow and almost unbearable with ridiculous conversations and unexciting photography. Fortunately, in the second half, there were women who were plugged into the fence and the male was repeatedly stabbed with spikes. Music is ridiculous and the use of the filming location is very imaginative. My advice is to cross this puppy and go straight to the "Cat in the Brain". That said, offering a great time of "Massacre" and then some.
