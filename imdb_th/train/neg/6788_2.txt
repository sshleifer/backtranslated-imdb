The idea in the name of a good killer didn't want his only daughter to end up in the institution and asked the guardian of the woman he killed to look after his daughter. And you can expect from actors, especially Scott Bakula, to perform well Unfortunately they can't! In the name of people becoming torn on a regular Friday night The incident with the murdered girl is pathetic, and at some point you can predict what the actors will say ... If you want to see a good movie about it, see Dean Man Walking.
