I am a romantic person. But this thing doesn't have the same qualities as good or love. My plot is nailed down before the credit is passed. With conversations, plot and poor character development, I suggest investing your hour and a half hours. I had to hurry out and rent Serendipity for the third time so that I could get a bad taste from my mouth.
