I agree with everything that Calamine said! And I don't always agree with people But what Calamine said was true, it was time for girls to have a better role. I want to see them being very successful because they are a very inspiring couple and I want to see them grow as people, actors and in their careers, including their personal lives Therefore, the manufacturers please give women the opportunity to develop something that is slightly changed, touch them in a new direction that recognizes them individually and their abilities in many aspects. This movie that has been criticized is not bad. But when I have watched more in their movies, their movies remain the same with the plot and characters. When in Rome, it is good for the audience of the new generation. But adults who are children when twins are children, want to follow twins in their success, so I think we want adults to see them doing many kinds of movies. Said that there are only serious movies for them. But will see them in a different role to what they play in their latest movies, such as This minute with New York (Note: I'm from Australia, so sorry, my strange spelling is like reognise with s instead of z)
