As a lesbian, I am always looking for movies about gay and lesbian. However, with shit like this - it will be enough to discourage any audience. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for something to happen - whatever! - stories to develop or just for it In order for some feelings to not occur, it is just a scene that is meaningless, not related to anything. The movie failed to convey any story or depth to the characters. <br /> <br /> After an hour or so, I closed it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste. Your time with this nonsense <br /> <br /> 1 star - and it is not appropriate.
