It is not surprising that most actors want them to never make this movie. It's ridiculous, plain and embarrassing to watch. Bad actors are reading the magic line while the classic glossy car showrooms circulate restaurants that look like Disneyland attractions. Students fight with the mad headmaster as he tries to stop them from burning a bronze civil war statue. Watts riots with the actors of ... uh ... 10 ?? Dermotney tried not to gag as he did with Mary Hartman, too, with the most annoying smile from 'Mr. Sardonicus'. Noah Weil read the lyrics of Bob Dylan. For the evil teacher, with a swinging pointer and a terrible face lift. The pure, drunken Rick Schroder sat in a small rocket on his last night before entering Silly. The leopard stretch pants and walked on the set of 'Shindig', singing off the keys horribly and making it big in the music business. And who wrote this interesting message ?: "I will go to Burkley and wear flowers in my hair" .... "I think I found someone who bought Stick's wood!" .... "People These are 'animals'! "" These people are my 'family'! While Shirelles sang "Mama Said". Oh, brother, it's a mess. It's like 'Reefer Madness' of the 60s, except that it's not funny.
