I am very excited to watch this movie after reading this book. Finally, my 13 year old son is looking forward to it too. I rented it and attached it to the classic holiday story that brought to life on screen. <br /> <br /> The boy I was disappointed. This film deviates from the book rather than forgetting. George C. Scott is a great actor. But in this regard, he seems to have a full role in just 20%. The rest of his time is quite flat. <br /> <br /> I know that this was created in '84. CG for most But it seems to be a quality B movie, especially the confrontation with Jacob Marley. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment is the fact that they have separated the most moving parts of the story when the soul. of Christmas gifts take Scrooge to travel around the world by observing people in situations that still have the light and love of Christmas. <br /> <br /> I'll admit that Scott works. Good with "reformed "Scrooge at the end That is a refreshing picture. <br /> <br /> I hope Bob Cratchit will be shown to be a bit of a trivial matter and deteriorate and Tiny Tim ... Oh, don't let me start with the actors. Bad boy ...
