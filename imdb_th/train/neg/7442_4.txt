Sorry that this movie didn't scare me. It just made me annoyed. It was so frustrating when I saw the potential and that thing fell on the way of the child! father! Premonition! There is a lot of potential and ziltch! Nada Center! I've heard it all before. Scary! No! I can make myself afraid only here, where I sit more than I can in the movie. Are men writing numbers that are annoying women? Ha? This film is quite atmospheric. Or at least should have the director / writer pay attention to work We may have good songs that will increase tension as well if someone tries. What I want to know is why are they getting money? Just give it to me and save everything that is tricky. Abandoned or not ...
