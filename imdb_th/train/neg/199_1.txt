This is a horrible movie, horrible script, bad direction and ridiculous ending. In addition, bad performances, except from Clancy Brown, who were criminally abused here and Michael Pollard Watching this movie is a baptism - you do to release a movie that is not good enough to see what's better Not everyone May be related The part of the male lead is not very well written and does not seem to be hostile to this role. You can see the plot a mile away. The actions of the female leader and her brother, the police, are not reasonable as well. Therefore, an important act on her part at the end of the movie makes no reasonable reason for the script.
