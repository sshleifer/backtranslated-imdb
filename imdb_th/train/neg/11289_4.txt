Elizabeth Ward Gracen, who may be recognized as one of Bill Clinton's "bimbo bombs" (they have pills for now!) Should be the weakest element of this program. It continues the formula for the fatigue of the Highlander Series - the immortal hero meets Immortal again in the last episode they meet. But there are some conflicts and there is a battle with the sword at the end that you have a cheap special effect. <br /> <br /> Then you have the character of Nick Wolf. 90 that doesn't shave your hair will have a story. "Sexual tension" in general (Seriously, why do you think Hollywood types think that sexual tension is more interesting than sex?) This is a joint work between Canada / France. New York and the other half are in Paris ... just like Highlander did
