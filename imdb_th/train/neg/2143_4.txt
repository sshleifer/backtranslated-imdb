I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella and liked it so much that the tape had deteriorated a little. <br /> <br /> So I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 came on TV and I would be able to watch. br /> I should have known each other. <br /> <br /> This movie joined the sequel club of the movie that should be left alone. It holds no real charm of the original! It seems that I'm quite rough and almost cruel from (not) singing for a long character. <br /> <br /> While I remember the characters telling stories through music The soundtrack of this film is placed on top and doesn't seem to fit. Jaq's transformation is an important example: where he walks around, eats apples and adds a little bit here and there, he should dance around and sing about his height! And in the ballroom, there are old country barn music As if the writer had forgotten that and when this story was set Children with fast rhythm are not suitable. <br /> <br /> Even the art and animation in Cinderella 2 is still not as traditional. The artwork in this film looks quite raw and has less detail. And we see a part of Cinderella's hoop skirt that doesn't feel right. <br /> <br /> The movie itself may be my own story. I will not say I hate But I believe it has many flaws Seems to be downgraded in an important way from the beloved Cinderella manuscript
