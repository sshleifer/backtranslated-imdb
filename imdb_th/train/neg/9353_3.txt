I was tempted by the name ... I expect a wise and interesting trip to drink. But I have a story that is quite boring and uninteresting about the Scotsman. <br /> <br /> The characters don't get much. Psychological depth unless you are willing to classify poetry like a teenager who looks funny. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the essence of the story can be a good thing with a better effort to Explain the inner feelings Of a man who has to live with alcohol and violence since childhood. <br /> <br /> Sadly, the general idea seems to be like "I am the way I am because that is what I am" and the humorous attempt at giving the poet some edge to the lower class makes the story worse. Turning to the repetitive words of "po√®te maudit", which is a quick solution, the right way to create movies that look boring, smart, artistic and meaningful. <br /> <br /> But "16 years of Alcohol "is not clever, artistic, or meaningful ... The lead character does not develop at all, and the weak effort in change fails without a good explanation. Just as the first attempt was made in blue, <br /> <br /> Movies borrowed from classics like A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting But in the end, it failed to regain their greatness again. <br /> <br /> Jobson paid too much attention to the arts and neglected the rest, giving us a good movie. But interesting for the brain
