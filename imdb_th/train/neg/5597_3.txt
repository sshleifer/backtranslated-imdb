I would say that at least this movie is reasonable. But it's not good Most performances are not good. (I think that only Sky shows promise) and you feel embarrassed to watch it. All the scenes that should convey the meaning are very shallow, like when you come out to find your parents. There are many details such as Kanji tattoos on Sky's shoulders, girl's fridge magnets and the terrifying d√©cor of God in the scene ... and music ... Real life has never been like this movie. One boy said "I am gay, not a stubborn person" and unconsciously, even though the explanation is terrible, I closed it after Ng said that she was strange to play lesbians.
