"Envy" is not good for many reasons. Yes, there are different characters. That's not a problem It's a different thing and we don't care about them at all. "The War of the Roses" focuses on different characters. But due to proper guidance, we found ourselves interested in their fate, at least for a while. "Jealousy". Some advice. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller is a nasty person in his role, and I am a big fan of his work all the time. Stiller campaigned to publish videos. Here and now I can see why. The film proposes that he is "The best friend" with Jack Black, but from the first five minutes, we received a video that seemed to indicate that Stiller hated black. I think this will develop into a one-sided relationship (a la " The Cable Guy ") But it never did. But Stiller confirmed that he was "His best friend" and I was confused "Crab". The story of this film is ridiculous. But it is not important because it should be an exaggerated story Unfortunately, the message disappears in the clutter. Walken provides good performance. But black is not important and annoying (And I always find him very funny) No, it's not a scary movie But I still don't want to believe Barry Levinson ("Rain Man," "Sleepers") is responsible for this - it's not one of the worst movies of all time. I hope Va-Poo-Rize actually exists - so we will Makes this movie disappear forever ....
