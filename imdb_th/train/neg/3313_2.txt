Who can say that this movie is funny? If I didn't go with it then I would fall asleep and ask for a refund. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it's like she's in the wrong scene I like most chicks flicks. But i hate this one This was the only time I saw so much cleavage and didn't open. Those dresses too No one else said that way, and I don't think they will do that. When dancing was terrible, I said to me later ... "You don't like that part? I said yes, just to keep her feelings. Now I know why we never married. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
