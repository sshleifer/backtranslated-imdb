This is a perfect example of something wonderful that will be terrible ... For this reason, can I recommend it to everyone to see? Well, I was forced by the fact that in a tiff match (I still don't believe it to win) .. and I remained until the end because the director was there for the question & part .. but that's still What other than interesting .. what is it about? The first half (people who are worth watching) present three characters: hooker, musician and some government officials .. The first two lie about their careers. But the third is a true liar .. The second half (doing something else..dont not destroy the good evening) includes old breasts and heavy drinking .. But maybe you can see that it's completely different. ... Jury Tiff do (they drink vodka yet)
