The boring rhythm of this movie makes us feel so shocked. No doubt Most characters are fresh. The eccentric Irish clergyman did not receive the attention. Misleading attention The women they chose to make the glamor of this movie might be better. The main conflict of the main characters is irrelevant. This movie is completely useless. It is like a boring exercise by people who do not want to go to the gym that day, but continue.
