It is hard to believe that this was the sequel of Henry Fool. It is hard to believe that the same director and actor were involved in both films while Henry Fool was refreshing, witty, funny, Fay Grim was slow, boring and not Where to go Wisdom is gone. I'm confused. <br /> <br /> For 10 years I've seen Henry Fool and the dialogue and the scenes are still bright in my memory. The fairy is awesome. This is not the fault of a good actor. (Parker Posey) or Great (Jeff Goldblum) - The fault lies in the plot of the conversation and even some of the filming. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I can't pay attention to the plot. I'm very bored. Disappointed ... If you enjoy this, you may not enjoy Henry Fool ... There are two movies. Of course! Nothing is related to the character's character ... It is a scam for Henry Fool's fans to watch the sequel. <br /> <br /> I closed this thing now - Henry is in prison with the group. Taliban?!?!
