Okay, I'm a big fan of Black for a long time and feel bored after watching this movie. Let's name the problem first ... This movie has the same crew as the first two. It is called PREQUEL. Go to the original black stallion. Why can't they make Shetan's dam name correct or her color? In The Black Stallion Returns, we learned that Sagr is the mother of Blackest's CHESTNUT, and in this movie, she is Jenny Gray?!?!?!?!?!? WTF? And it is located in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I might be wrong, but the first one was created in 1940 as well when the ship wrecked The timeline doesn't sound right for me. In addition, as a fool, there are free people at the beginning of the movie that should be Shetan's father ... from further observation, it seems to be a eunuch. Ben Ishak is the only character that still makes this film seem to be related to the two previous stories. In any way, it may be a lovely family movie for some people. But it's the biggest movie that disappointed me this year.
