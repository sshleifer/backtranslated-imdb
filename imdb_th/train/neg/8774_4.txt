Story: A movie that consists of a full 4 hours covering enough details about the events that occurred in the Kargil region, near the LOC in 1999, when the Pakistani invaders crossed the LOC and entered deep into the Indian territory and the response of India To find out more about this, I encourage readers to read a list of news related to Kargil. <br /> <br /> Comments: If someone is looking for a recipe in this movie, not LOC is a story. Of pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and many bullets and blood The movie theater I saw in this film was filled with cheers and cheers when this film depicts the courage of India. The movie audience looks similar to the audience, such as in the Indian cricket match vs the mouth. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie is praising the army's sacrifice and creating the characters of real-life war heroes. (4 honorable heroes from PVC) who sacrificed their lives so we can see today. This film creates a wonderful image of the army that can fight in adverse weather conditions. Negative film is too stretchy and the music is extremely boring.
