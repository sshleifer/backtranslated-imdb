If you're a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3K, Attack of the Lee Leeches or Pinata Survival Island, this movie may be right for you. <br /> <br /> I live in Nashville and I don't even know. The existence of the film until the day before the release, when the advertising company panicked and hid the Music Row with dozens of flyers and billboards. It took almost two weeks in the next movie. <br /> <br /> Bad performances, bad writing and bad production just started to explain the shame of this film. For beginners, there are very few names: Bo Price, Angel and Dixie? <br /> <br /> Toby sends a late, slow, causing anyone to suspect that the production assistant is stuck in the camera queue. Angel's character quickly turns from a city where she shakes up into a cowgirl and sneaks into a slang under a second day on a ranch. Her wardrobe changed from chic to the female version of Toby. In fact, in the final scene, their dresses were the same, causing the suspicion that the wardrobe assistant called sick. <br /> <br /> The sound was inconsistent - Perhaps the most obvious example is when Toby decides to swim and his voice looks like he is shouting in the gym. <br /> <br /> There is no explanation or character development that is sufficient for things. The happening on screen Exaggeration, exasperation, frustration and frustration will most explain the interpretation and direction of the most terrifying script. <br /> <br /> The film is the happiest after drinking two alcoholic beverages.
