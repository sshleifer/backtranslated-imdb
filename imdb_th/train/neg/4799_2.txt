I am a big fan of 80s horror movies with a low budget. This is not the worst thing. But still not beautiful The plot line is good. But dragged too long You go through the movie halfway before you can see the actions of zombies. Killing is not very creative and zombies are not too good. I think this movie would be better if they released zombies. It can be viewed But I felt that this movie stole at least an hour in my life. I will give credit to this movie as an original story. If you are a horror movie of B, it really is worth watching. But if you are not But you don't have to use my words for it
