Sounds like a really interesting movie The Nazis occult government conspiracy I expect to use the low-cost Nazi code DaVinci or boys from Brazil or even the shock wave. You will get something different. Psychology is more like David Lynch. But the way to tell the story is terrible. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the casting of the characters of Andrienne Barbeau. She did not do that well, even in her age, even though she certainly tried. The actor starred as the son thought this was a joke. Most other actors seem to think that this is a camp movie, or at least acting like it's more than just quirky. The only thing I think is really good is Siri Baruc's daughter. <br /> <br /> The other part is walking. It started very slowly. So slowly you may be tempted to turn it off. But it was interesting for a while when you reached your daughter's suicide and the consequences But after a while, it became a mess. Some of this has a purpose. But most are just confusing, confused, and poorly focused. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that it's not a glamorous movie. It's slow, boring, no characters that are satisfying. Image and image set too Some movies that you see are tortured. Here is the audience who did that. It had a slightly creepy time, especially the creepy Nazi paintings and credits. But the rest of the movie is mostly boring
