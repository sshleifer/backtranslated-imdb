This is another incredible and unbelievable piece of the Hollywood wreck. Kirk Russell, while Snake Pliskin in a business suit, believes he is a better bass than anyone else. Ray Liotta as The police are all predictable and ridiculous. Madeline Stowe is your own normal cardboard and is not a reliable victim. <br /> <br /> Every scene in this temptation is certainly predictable all the way to End point When Kurt clouts Ray with a vase or something, he comes down. Then Kurt and Madeleine accept the embrace of the movie and everyone - except Russell and Stowe, knowing that Liotta is about to come back. And threatening both of them again. <br /> <br /> He did, of course, and Russell drilled him 10 times with a 9mm size that wasn't all that necessary. This movie may end up with boring scenes --- except Hollywood that talks about unnecessary violence and the more they can increase or increase "the more" they are even more dirty.
