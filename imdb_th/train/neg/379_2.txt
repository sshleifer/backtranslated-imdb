The TV guide calls this movie a mystery. The mysterious thing for me is how the culture that can produce such complex and complex classical music and excellent mathematicians cannot create a single movie This is the best / worst Bollywood. I honestly can't tell the difference. Sweet, sweet, unattractive at every level story, story, dialogue, music and choreography In order to rant, you must have patience to enjoy it. I watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity. But there are times when I have to walk away from it because I can't use it anymore. The only redemption quality of the movie is the splendid beauty of the lead actor. <br /> <br />
