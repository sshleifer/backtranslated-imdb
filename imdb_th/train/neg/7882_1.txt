After stopping at a movie store to find something that is worth watching, we stumble upon this. At least it looks interesting from the conclusion, so we try to see And this is a player: the first 20 minutes are interesting! It's really fun! Oh, wait a minute. Speak too fast. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in that, this movie becomes disgusting to the basic right-wing Christian brainwashing. Not sure what happened But I think that the screenwriter found God somewhere in that, finished writing this script and had no time to fix because he had a KKK meeting to meet friends from the Church of Westboro and his skirt wasn't clean. <br /> < br /> Can they warn? I refused to support this religious stupidity. Just like a video game with a movie rating system, there must be some symbols: maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that the movie is going to change worse. <br /> <br /> If You don't share Feelings, whatever happens to this story, will keep your Bible open while you watch and plan how you will convert your neighbors. Don't waste time. It is the worst waste that has come out for a long time, and the violent religious nuts do not need capital anymore.
