... or more accurate so much that you have to spend your life laughing, resigning when you watch it! James Sbardellati's "Deathstalker" in 1983 was one of the most horrifying productions that the Sword & Sorcery sub-genre brought, but it was very amusing. The performance is terrible. The plot is nonsense and the effects and the shooting cannot be more mastery. But it is a bad performance, magical effects and many mistakes that make this movie hilarious. <br /> <br /> - Front spoiler - <br /> <br /> Deathstalker ( Rick Hill) is a very strong and skilled warrior. One day, a good witch assigned him to combine the three powers of chaos and the creation of swords, amulets and cups to allow the country to escape from the brutal rule, the evil king and the magician Munkar. But the amulet and the cup are in the possession of Munkar. Fortunately, the king of evil has organized a competition in which the most skilled warriors of the province fought until death. The winner is the replacement of the king. Of course, the king doesn't want anyone to replace it, so he plans to kill the winner. (Instead of not competing in the first place) Deathstalker not only receives the power of the three creations But also protects the beautiful daughter of the great king (Barbi Benton) from the evil claws of Munkar Fortunately, he was not bored during the trip because he was allowed to look at Kaira (Lana Clarkson), a beautiful female warrior. At the same time ... <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly wonderful. Stupid and funny scenes Some of my favorite scenes include: <br /> <br /> Deathstalker, the villain's head with his sword. The head that fell was not the man's head. The falling head will have a red goatee, while the person who has the head of Deathstalker has dark hair and no beard First time The black cloak hides her face and body. Deathstalker Oghris (Richard Brooker) travel companion fights with her and while the sword fights with her cloak (Which she is the top part, of course) opens to reveal her breasts Her chest is the first thing we see of Lana Clarkson even before her face. <br /> <br /> - Deathstalker, the last warrior, must fight in the race as a giant man with a human body and a pig's head. <br /> - Evil Munkar has an ugly little creature locked in his chest. He pulls the eyes and fingers of human beings. That little creature. <br /> <br /> ... There are many funny scenes, hilarious scenes and many other great scenes. The end was disgusting and although I explained that this movie was 'Unintended jokes' Sometimes I feel that some actors know how bad this movie is. There is a large amount of blood and there are many female nudity that make the audience fun. "Deathstalker" is a very scary movie. But I still highly recommend People with humor will have time in their lives!
