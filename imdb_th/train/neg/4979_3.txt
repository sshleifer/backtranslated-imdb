Why, oh, why can't anyone make a good movie from a legendary story? This is the second modification of "Wolfe" that I've been disappointed in one year. But I have to say that the previous version ("Beowulf & Grendel" starring Gerald Butler) is far above this. That was a bit disappointing. This is a mess !!! <br /> <br /> What is the most annoying thing? It is a plot of uselessness that they add without any reason (human sacrifice? Pointless love or) poor CGI or character inconsistency Even worse is the way they make Marina Sirtis look scary !!! And don't even mention that ridiculous face? <br /> <br /> And why are they constantly reminding us that Beowulf has 30 people, but he never shows the slightest strength in the entire movie? He was thrown around by the two monsters he fought by relying on his followers to keep his bacon. Although he had taken an arrogant prince, he didn't shock him. He is too dependent on weapons. Beo-wimp is the same. This is not a powerful Beowulf of epic poetry. <br /> <br /> I want to finish this story with a positive note. But I can't think of it at all All I can say is that if you ever read "Beowulf", you will be deeply disappointed by the depressing and incorrect excuse for modification!
