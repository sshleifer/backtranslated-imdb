For a good half hour, I remember I thought: "Hey, this may be Bill Rebane's best achievement!" The opening sequence is the atmosphere. There are some horrifying moments and our director also cites. His notorious celebrity "The Giant Spider Invasion" in a playful way The concept was mercilessly stolen from William Castle's "House on Haunted Hill", with three rich and dull millionaires enticing nine losers to become a single mansion to win a $ 1,000,000 prize. Participants began to disappear. Going fast one by one and spending too much of the coveted head bone before they know that the old man is sadistic ... or there are other killers among them. The movie begins and ends with a strange narrator telling a lot of nonsense that is irrelevant or interesting with the story, but with an admirable T&A in the first ten minutes and stupid bimbo (I believe she was called) Really hilarious to observe After the first half hour, the inevitable thing happened naturally and "The Cold" became a book. Rebane - production with a slow twist plan, the most stupid interactive intelligence ever and lacked all excitement. There is no budget for the bloody murder scene. But many of our talented directors try to compensate for this with the endless images of disco dancing girls and amateur rock bands. This film has four or five different climax points and there is no point that is slightly satisfactory. Maybe it was inspired by LOTR: Return of the King? Avoiding this film, you will have a longer life and a happier life.
