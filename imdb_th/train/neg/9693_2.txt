The hot plot of "Bonjour tristesse" is taken from the first novel of children and youth by Francoise Sagan, who later became the best seller, even though God knows why. For teenagers who want to eliminate potential parents, there may be some appeal. Do not be caught by the fact that David Niven plays the father, male and Deborah Kerr, who is the stepfather. Unfortunately, too little on Jean Seberg's shoulders. She is beautiful and responds easily to the image of a teenager who died. The problem is that she can post. But she can't Anyone who sees her as Joan of Arc in St. Joan's first film - Seberg's first film - knows that she can't do it at the age of 19 in the movie. This film by Preminger also fulfills the "promise" of the first movie. It's her second movie. Now, she is 20 years old. What is Preminger thinking about? Can Niven and Kerr compensate for the lack of ability to show Saber? No chance? Seberg's character is the centerpiece of the story, and although she is convincing even though she is 17 years old, she cannot meet the emotional needs of the script. I do not know whether she will become a successful actress in her short life, because she does not affect my consciousness in the later images. But everyone who thinks that this movie is better than average, must have a taste check. Even though Niven and Kerr are still stories of children and young people who perform in the form of children and youth by beautiful girls who want bad acting lessons.
