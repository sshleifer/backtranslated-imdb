Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov are pairs that are unlikely to be possible in movies that are not desirable at all. <br /> <br /> This film shows that Ustinov was released from prison because of embezzlement. He convinced Robert Morley to disappear so he could accept his identity and start hacking the computer at a fancy company run by Carl Malden and Bob New Hart. While he did it in 1938, "Marie Antoinette", perhaps he would like to go back to that type. <br /> <br /> This film is the most ridiculous. It is hard to believe that in the following year, Maggie Smith completely changed her way and gave the Oscar-shaking performance in "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie". <br /> <br /> Ms. Smith made out here for a red-black head, but at the end of the movie she was the brain of the set. Unfortunately, the writing didn't go with her.
