Okay, I saw a sneak preview of this stupid movie. First of all, this movie was posted and not real. They're all performing. They can't sing They are too full of themselves. It's terrible. Yes. Kids like 8 to 10 may be fun, but it's really stupid. I mean, they say that the manager is a child. And having the name recorded as a fake, it is stupid. I can't see it. <br /> <br /> For setting and governance, it's not a bad thing It's a cute documentary. But it is a stupid thing. <br /> <br /> See only if you don't like really good music. In addition, it is very repetitive. It doesn't have taste I hate being heartless ... but this is really garbage.
