This is a movie about how men think that women miss love. No woman explained one night of sexual encounters and said that it was a love story. <br /> <br /> From the ten words I felt that only three people had the truth in such a way. I waited for this movie to be better and it could be done. But it's not better. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting concept and I want it to be good. But was not successful Maybe if they really love the story, it will work.
