All other comments have already been said that I will continue to speak. I think this is the first Italian language. Sorry about Italy. I'm not bored because I'm waiting for something to happen. When did anyone make a song about Dr. Tarr and Professor Feather? Is it Alan Parsons? See this 10 packs in Brentwood and the quality is very poor. Full of wrinkles and content This film is not a mess, funny music and innocent characters. Important people should know in the first minute that the doctor is stronger than the patient. I think the "doctor" director of the "fight" scene will never end. It seems that these stupid movies are often thrown in a naked chick or two, and that makes you fascinate me for 2 points for a nekkid woman. Pau probably made about 3,000 rpms in his grave when this thing came out because it was based on his story.
