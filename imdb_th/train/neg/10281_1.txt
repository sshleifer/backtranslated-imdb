Carly Pope plays the role of JJ, a food critic who has recently been promoted, which is bright and colorful. The mother who is waiting with her Her in exchange for "maybe" reviewing his dying restaurant Alex falls in love with his daughter as her mother anticipates. There are many problems with this film. The characters have two dimensions at the international level. JJ is a character that shows himself hating her mother, superficial and shallow. JJ's colleagues at the magazine are vile and opportunistic. The basic message of more than 50 women who cannot do it themselves without receiving help from a man is bad. BAD The performance is not consistently interesting. The script has not been answered. Movies with But the only elegance that saved us was the setting of New York City. I will not recommend this movie.
