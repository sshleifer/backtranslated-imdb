Just saw this at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid all costs unless you have a sleep problem. It's a movie full of excuse - it's open with a little word from "Hiroshima mon amour" and it's all down from there. The camera works - imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kaew, the story - Smokey Robinson and miracle "The love I see in you is just an illusion." Extending from 3 minutes to 2 hours, but full of repetition. For numbness in the buttocks, this film is rated with a bench at the Methodist church. My parents dragged me when I was a child. I want to receive 2+ hours of cash back. Julian Hernandez's supporters have opened the watch in advance, commenting that this movie is "controversial", which is a true story for the film's drug effects only.
