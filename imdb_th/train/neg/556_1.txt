In my book "Basic Instinct" is the perfect movie. It has outstanding performances in the part of Stone Douglas and all supporting actors in the least role. It has great photography, music and noirest noirest scripts. All of this combined with the best movies ever! <br /> <br /> This sequel is the opposite. Of course, it may not be worse again, bad performances and weak scripts. This direction is really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that keeps you focused on waiting is quite short for the next scene that is the original copy. These copies are terrible to make you laugh, and I laughed at myself because it was like watching the destruction of the shining monuments. The only good thing in this terrifying mess is the excerpt from Jerry Goldsmith's score of BI1. Michael Caton-Jones and the responsible half of the script included dialogue. "There is no smoking in this room" in the scene. Asked and yes, she would send her lawyer. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry. It caused damage to the manuscript. It was very bad. The only ransom value was to realize that doing cosmetic surgery. (And I'm sure Ms Stone has the best money surgeon that can buy) can do the job well And the things that are related to the human body are also effective in making movies as well. There should be laws: Don't create the perfect sequel of movies!
