I wrote this review when I watched it several months ago ... The sample looks good enough for me to buy this excuse for the movie. It is a complete joke .... and literally a spit in the face of the true classics of the first generation of horror movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), in which they also have bile to compare themselves to the side. Back of the cover Brandon players should go to eat burgers and serve hamburgers that are .... Hell, he might not be good too! The lights are not good, bad, bad and have a lot of nuisance in movies that you can't see the faces of the actors sometimes. I do not remember the rest of the members, which is really sad. They never do anything to impress you so that they remember. That is all the time that I would lose with this review. Please stay as far as possible from this garbage collection, even if you get it 25 cents. Don't buy gum, at least it will keep you entertained! </ br> <br /> If you want fun, economical, better quality ... try watching Jeff Hayes .... because it requires the ability to make horror and kids have it! <br /> <br /> I gave this 1 star to the front cover .... That is the only thing that should be worth it. This is called "movie". <br /> <br /> -Rick Blalock
