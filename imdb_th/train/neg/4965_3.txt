For a great classic story, setting up (place) Grenend is disappointing. As a writer, I blame the script for having a lot of tension. The rubric of the club's story is useful and should be something new for classic literature. For some strange reason that Rubric had been left early to know that this was shot in 21 days, told me "hurry" and it was a shame that it showed Now we have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I speak in FX. I can tolerate CGI really crappy. But the script must vibrate and this one is too slow. Spartan and lack of drama I blame the player but ... because I know that writing is more than acting, I will choose my co-workers.
