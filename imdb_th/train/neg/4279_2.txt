I found the DVD "I Dream Of Jeanie" in the trash. $ 1.00 at Wal-Mart when I saw that it was "The Story of Stephen Foster", a musician and music educator, must see it I don't know what year it was built for. It didn't say on the cover, just that it was a remake of the "Siwani River" in 1939. Bill Shirley's composer, sometimes painful, sometimes laughs. That guy has no testosterone and is always smart! I have a hard time believing that Stephen Foster thinks that the music producer is doing his favorite thing by publishing his music ... without paying him! In addition to ridiculous ideas, Ray Middleton also has more than 20 minutes, and the black "Christy Minstrels" that he has to perform in Stephen Foster's songs. I hardly believe who will consider this film appropriate to be resurrected in our current time. It is an embarrassment and should be forgotten. Fortunately, Stephen Foster's songs will never be forgotten .... as well, the image of Gene Eileen of Jeanie is the highest point in Hollywood history.
