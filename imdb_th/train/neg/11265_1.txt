There was a low time in my life when I was confused and depressed. Sitting through the Rancid Aluminum as one of them. <br /> <br /> The alarm was there. No premiere show (Even celebrities don't want to join) and there are no reviews in the magazine. The only reason I watched this movie is that I wish I could not sleep. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie can be explained. The narrative is silly. I cheered at one point of the movie that seemed to be shot. Then my increased despair was revealed that he was not shot, causing my happiness to decrease. I sincerely hope that everyone involved in the movie will be hanged because of this brutality. <br /> <br /> There are some positive aspects, mostly unintentional humor. For example, the scene in which the main character, for some unknown reason, feels the need to loosen himself in the bathroom cubicle while telling the person in the next room, put your finger in the ear. My speech cannot explain the anger that I can feel, so I can conclude as well. <br /> <br /> Rancid Aluminum: For the sadists, wasteland and regression only want to suffer themselves
