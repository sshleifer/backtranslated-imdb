I would like to think of myself as being open-minded and having to spend a lot of time (!) For me not to like movies. But this is without a doubt the most attractive and disgusting movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> I don't know what happened to the people who voted here (imdb is quite reliable when it comes to ratings) ... The only thing I can imagine is that people have to vote. Between one or more conditions: <br /> <br /> 1 While being shitfaced / being thrown with their thoughts 2, they get heavy cash for the 3rd vote under gunpoint <br /> <br /> I can't believe that I have to spend 1 hour and 45 minutes to do this. Pathetic excuses for movies
