But there are not too many It may be the worst "big" movie I've ever seen in my life. Absolutely the worst for this year. There is no point in expressing opinions about the story, characters or performances. The problem is above all else. It put in absolutely ignorance of the annoying kind. (Not funny) of everything that happens on the screen I don't know why I gave 2/10 instead of 1/10, probably because Steven Martini. He really tried. Bottom line - 95 minutes. Wash the toilet down with a few brain cells. Avoid any costs.
