This movie should be number one in the lowest 100. The performance is so scary that when my son and I watch it, we are almost physically sick And the story is getting worse I can continue to do how bad it is. But what I really wanted to do was add a warning to Frank Bob's review, because I saw that no one had encountered a problem. Do not waste time, money, energy or anything else in this movie. Thank God that we saw on TV, so we don't use anything with it. If we do, I will be forced to write people who are responsible for this nasty thing and are forced to execute in their general direction. In summary, I would like to say that I enjoy watching Carey Fisher's performance. But I am sorry to say that she is not particularly good in this movie Do not make your comments bad by watching
