I saw this movie for the first time in MST3K and although I laughed funny But I don't think that this movie is so bad. Of course, it's hard to understand that it's quite obvious that there is a low budget. But with a plot like Hitchcock and I can honestly say that This movie is crying out to create Hollywood.
