If Bob Ludum saw this mini series, he would cry. This is a waste of time and money completely. I have read the book and although the movie is not exactly the same as this book, but CBS wasted time and money on this, and it was embarrassing to claim that this was Ludlum's work. <br /> <br /> May the creator examine Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good the TV series is. <br /> <br /> Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm. Why are they signing a contract to overthrow this price? br /> <br /> Awesome !!
