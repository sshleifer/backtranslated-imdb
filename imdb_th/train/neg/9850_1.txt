I feel that my brain is dead. I will tell you. This is the worst movie I ever bought. (In my ignorance, I think this is Peter Jackson's movie of the same name.) The performance is very scary. Special effects do not stand the test of time and look scary. The script to promote that type of television staring at the medium-term performance The actors looked as if they had learned from Joey Tribbiani. They had one face. Also, I never get confused with movies until I sit down to see this stuff. Is it a dream or a terrible plot that causes frustration within minutes? Avoid like the plague.
