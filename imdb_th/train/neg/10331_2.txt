God, I felt disgusted from the head when I watched this pilot. I expect a lot from it because I am a big fan of James Cameron (and not just "Titanic" I might add) and his name on credit. I think it will guarantee quality. (Then again, he also wrote leaden Strange Days ..) But things that failed miserably attracted my attention at any point in the period of nearly two hours. At that time, it was almost no more than a two-line summary, and I would press very hard to try to plot any of the links from the chaos of nowhere. Other than that, I don't think the acrobatic performance is better than the usual "A-Team" episode for Alba. Yes, she's very beautiful. But the fact that she expresses only one facial expression, both movies (Nonsense and angry) makes me feel bored with the "gal wit a attitude" schtick. Soon you can count me out of this, Mr Cameron!
