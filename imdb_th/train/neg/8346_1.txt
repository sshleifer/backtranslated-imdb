The name should be a walker. Men spend 90% of walking movies. He doesn't know what he wants or what he is. Through life, stealing people's identity for what? He doesn't get the benefits. No money. Nothing pretends to be someone else. <br /> <br /> The body can't understand why he pretends to be someone else. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is clear in the movie. This is he loves his father and is a good son. But the rest is crap. <br /> <br /> Maybe the director is a lazy person who wants to be someone else. But what he really should do is to get a real job because after his movie I don't think he will have the opportunity to be a movie maker.
