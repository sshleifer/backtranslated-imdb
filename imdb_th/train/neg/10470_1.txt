What's more to say? <br /> <br /> I have read all the comments here and most of them are on. However, there is one person who goes so far as to call this movie that evil and Satan is broken. (Or something along those lines)?! Wicked. Wow. The shocking thing. I mean, TBN created this movie in general. Please open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Annie is the lowest nonsense of propoghanda that has happened in recent years. <br /> <br /> The most horrible thing about Oh. Mega They spend time doing it. If this film can be created without limits, so we have no choice but to prepare for "Yentl 2" and "Ernest, lose the Omega code" <br /> <br /> For you, the new movie Dogma will come Get the role that Omega Code never starts.
