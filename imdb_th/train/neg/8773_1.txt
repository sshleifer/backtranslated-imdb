If you see fewer movies, this may be a big deal for you. If you've watched many movies, this is a joke. The acting of the real hero is not good. Not to mention that there are many past stories and most importantly, the fight scenes are shocking. New characters, good directions, should be able to do better. But since it has all the Bollywood / heroines content, you can predict what will happen. You do not feel sad when something happens. The emotions that they show are terrible, mostly because we have seen actors in more than 1,000 other Hindi movies. But it cannot be displayed There are times when you suspect that you have thousands of army vehicles that are full of moving soldiers and Pakistan is bombing them and there are no bombs. Pakis is terrible in aiming or the director makes them look silly? There are only a few that perform very well. But as far as it's related to PTSD, the action is bad. This movie may be short if they bring songs back to that point.
