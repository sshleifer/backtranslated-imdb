Buy this movie in a cheap trash bin at Rogers Video store for $ 2. I enjoy a good B movie now and then and think that it seems to be a good thing. <br /> <br /> The movie This is quite boring "1970's" and quite strong for that. Unfortunately, the story is difficult to follow and nothing happens in the movie. In fact, I closed after watching 45 minutes and thinking a week later that I should watch everything, no matter how slow it is. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good spot, but you have to wait and wait. And wait ....... for them. <br /> <br /> If you enter the movie B, this may be a matter for you, just warn that this movie is slow and not too much. Actually, and I'm not talking much about the story ... <br /> <br />
