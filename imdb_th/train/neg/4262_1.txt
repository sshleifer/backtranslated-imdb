This is just the worst movie I've ever seen. It has a period of 2 hours or more and the box art is totally misleading. My friend and I rented it because we thought it would be 300 of the poor men. Do you know, laugh and make fun? No, there is nothing funny about this movie, only pain. Then the movie started and they were speaking different languages. We thought, 'Oh, it's just the beginning.' Read in elementary school years that have nothing to do with real life for many hours and fight scenes with 2 children fighting on the field. And this movie is in the trash compactor This kind of movie will lead to the world that we see on Wall-E, which is a good movie.
