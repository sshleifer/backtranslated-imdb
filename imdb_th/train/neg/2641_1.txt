Almost every detail, the synopsis in this movie is reasonable and unbelievable. It has no resemblance to the story of a real man, both dead and boring. It's a Hollywood joke that has a little music that reminds you of Denzel Washington, a shaky camera image and a focus on stereotypes, racist, unnecessary and humorous pictures and celebrity gestures. Clothes catalog It was created to support a large number of zombies whose meaning in life arose from watching the names of celebrities. The only good thing in the movie is the end credits and funky songs that come with it. I feel like an idiot who looks at this thing to help himself.
