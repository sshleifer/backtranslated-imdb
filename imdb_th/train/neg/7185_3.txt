I am interested in watching this movie because of this and my desire to watch horror. <br /> <br /> My disappointment has made this a far more funny thing than a horror story. The display of the conversation and the flow of the movie was not good. Mostly it is not reasonable. For example, there are about 30 parties and they are afraid of only one person, although they are in a secret and healthy place to watch adults and those who threaten them. I have always thought that maybe this is another parody of the movie, such as Scary Movie, but they try too hard to make it look scary - focus on the trial together I've seen Halloween costumes look more reliable. A man with his head cut clean ... looks clean - the missing signs of bones, flesh, blood and even the head. Beating down strongly with an ax on the body should be extended into something ... It seems that people are gouging out instead of an ax But conflicting with other parts of what is in the minds of men to become like that? If there is a twist, you should at least create it to add mystery and suspicion.
