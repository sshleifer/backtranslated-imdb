Perhaps one of the worst teen slasher movies I've ever seen. I will start with a bad spot of movies that cover almost the whole story. First of all, no one can avoid it: scary actions. I swear that they take some random children out of the road in the way they look. Secondly, BAD / Not sure. The characters work / develop. You almost don't know even half of the children killed here. What you think is that they deserve one. The scarecrow character is used too much and cheap by other great fantasy killers such as Freddy or Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOG: A scarecrow full of terrifying liners that will make you laugh just because it's bad A lot of lines like "We go to find small animals to torture!" Really, just let you have the last eyebrows, but not the end: Next off: Bad casting How old is the man playing Leicester, like 30 behind his head bald for God's sake? There are many other things that I can say about this movie as well as the special effects. It is an effort. "Secondary movie classes" but understand the issues It's just the worst movie that makes it the worst. For what I found to be "good" in the movie: - Getting help from people with low, low, low standards - will help to sleep. - Laugh or laugh.
