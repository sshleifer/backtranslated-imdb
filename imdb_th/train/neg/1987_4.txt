This is a great idea and the scenery is beautiful. But that was the end The story has almost no reason. There are many characters and not enough time to develop their personality. There may be unnecessary things that are not related to the story and do not help this matter anymore. In addition, there is a long free time in which the plot may be explored. But used for quiet or unnecessary conversations The script should have more reason and direction. I have a big question mark on my head watching this movie. But the casting was excellent in my opinion If you are looking for eye candy then this is the movie for you.
