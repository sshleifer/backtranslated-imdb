In general, I like dinosaur movies. But this one is nonsense No script, no conversation, no show And brave Colonel Rance tries to show that he is a tough and bent person, similar to his twin brother who is a stupid examiner from the police school. So this is a complete waste of time. (Fortunately, don't waste money because I watch movies on TV) and I can't understand 7 people who give points. * 10 * They will have to play. My advice if you see this name working from it!
