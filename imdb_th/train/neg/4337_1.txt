This is just a wonderful story of Edwin Torres. This movie does not follow the story in the book. And there are many inconsistencies with the original movie that you have to wonder if the screenwriter had seen the first movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino (original and still the best Carlito) left Cook the beginning of the original here. Carlito retired with his woman in heaven. <br /> <br /> What happened to Gail from Loren, Ohio? In this sector, she did not mention and Carlito would retire and expect to marry another woman. <br /> <br /> Where is Kleinfeld? I think he is in the first book. <br /> <br / > I like the way Mr. Guzman plays as a completely different character in this movie. He is a Pachanga in Pacino. Now he is Nacho Reyes, a killer from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes was more active in the book. <br /> <br /> For a long time I read books. But where does the character of Sean Comb come from? In addition, I think this film selects racial tensions in Harlem that Torres wrote and the mob did not receive the treatment they did in the book. They were eliminated in this movie, but the Pleasant Avenue bunch is amazing around for the second movie. <br /> <br /> This book tells a wonderful story. This movie may tell a great story. This is just a huge disappointment. Read a book. It's better to spend your time.
