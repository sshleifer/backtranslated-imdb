We are wondering if there will be only two minutes to light. We are the only ones there. There are only five people who participate before the movie begins. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to redeem this movie. The performance is terrible (especially Ms Hurley). The script is repetitive. The effects we've seen millions of times. The direction of the movie is the worst we have ever seen. Crooked and separated No one laughs, including children Lose money with this movie If there is nothing, look at your cinema to buy popcorn and hotdog drinks and do some watching. You will have a more enjoyable time !!! <br /> <br />
