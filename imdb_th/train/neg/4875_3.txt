My grandmother took me and my sister out to watch this movie when it came out in the cinema in 1998 and so we bought happy popcorn and soda tickets and walked into the cinema and sat down to watch a movie When passed, the audience was not applauded seriously. I remember hearing someone say that they didn't like it. I didn't like it. I think it was rather stupid and not worth seeing. this story But apart from him, this movie is terrible. I don't laugh at this part. I remember that other people in the theater couldn't laugh at all. And what I think is not good is to make animals speak because talking about animals is only in cartoons in action movies. They become stupid! I said that in addition to Eddie Murphy's crazy twists that he brought in, this movie was not worth watching. It was rather stupid. <br /> <br /> I've seen Eddie Murphy. In many movies and I think he's funny I just said that he was the only funny part of this movie. I have never seen Eddie Murphy in the movie "Great" really. The Adventures of Pluto Nash This movie is not the movie I want. Will recommend you because, besides Eddie Murphy, you may not like this, especially because the animals talk about it a lot! <br /> <br /> I'll score 3 stars out of 10 possible stars.
