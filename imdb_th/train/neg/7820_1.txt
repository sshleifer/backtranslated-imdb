Or: is it a bird? Is it a plane? Don't see ... It's a disaster! Or: No need to look up into the sky. <br /> <br /> Or: (... OK, enough) If the singer tries to create a romantic Titanic like a movie that will break the box office record. He failed. The SR structure cannot do this. Dark and restricted color schemes (I call it "wishi-washi") Normal dialogs that are boring, clowns with advanced alien technology, fun and lost magic, etc. Make movies Completely disappointing. <br /> <br /> It's not working. <br /> <br /> The main thing of the characters like Superman is that he's a superhero. That is the very essence of the most important thing. <br /> <br /> Desperate and Supersoftie's love and depression problems can make the most in the movie Superman. Long 2:40. Not all the time. <br /> <br >> Because So it's not a Superman movie or a superhero anymore. It's like social education. (And in this case, terrible and boring) which every 30 minutes that people fly around. <br /> <br /> That's a big difference. <br /> <br /> This movie is Jokes. Sacred Sky Walker. This is Superman. So let us direct the superhero and the most important thing is Superfun. <br /> <br /> We want entertainment! Singer, if you want to create a life that is long, 2:40, love the problems, drama, people who are lost and sad? Then bring the normal human characters to create a new image. <br /> <br /> They say: Superman is back from supersadlysoftie. Standing at the door <br /> <br /> Maybe the singer may try to kill the legend without using kryptonite, but one bad movie can't do it. Don't give up. They plan the sequel ... <br /> <br /> The next singer. (And Warner Brothers) created a superhero movie, not a superlame soap that was depressed or let it be. The superhero movie refers to the imagination that is full of fun and magic. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a chocolate box that is very cheap. Yes, technically, there are all kinds of things, yes, little talk, funny gags, action scenes, etc. But the only thing that these bad things have in common is poor quality. <Br /> <br /> It is not more than the most boring patchwork and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> A ridiculous acting strategy. Able to continue in the next 25 years). Given the rest of the time, Kate Bosworth plays as a 22-year-old star reporter. She looks like 19 Superman, full of five years. 16 years old (looks like 13 people) and the Daily Planet reporter wrote, "I spent a night with Superman," Warner Brothers too. <br /> <br /> Ruth is not bad. He plays wood. little But all movies are wood, so ...?! The temporary goodness was destroyed and sometimes posed. The rest is forgotten. Even in space, this is not his terrain. <br /> <br /> Reef / hackman / Kidder acts very easy, fun. It's different. <br /> <br /> Jesus posted in the end, too absurd. What the hell should be? The problem here is that they mean this serious matter is not a joke. Next time Spider-Man or Batman or Ironman falls and gets up like Jesus or an angel? Or they speak directly to God, why not they are heroes to save human lives every day Therefore, at least one person talking to God every week should be possible ... Oh God. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is not the actual movie announced. But from a strange parallel universe <br /> <br /> <br /> The best-remembered brothers and sisters will be the greatest disaster in history. Not just because of money. <br /> <br /> I understand how hard it is (maybe) to create and send messages or feelings. But shows that only one person, who is lost and sad, is not a new movie TV shows can be better in old or new programs like Magnolia. And the flying frogs were even more impressive than the superhuman flying. Sorry. Of course, Superman <br /> <br /> Singer and WB isn't that easy. In fact, it is even more than nothing. It's like a black hole that destroys a movie (comic / superhero) passion and steals our lives for three hours. <br /> <br /> Smilla's brother (angry and Very green like old wrecks)
