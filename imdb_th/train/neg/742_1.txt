If this movie has a budget of 20 million, I want to know where the money goes. The monkey can create a better CGI effect. Then the wasted thing is 3 hours on this terrifying garbage, even though I have to accept the machine and the Mars will look really good in the PlayStation game. 1 Traditional and early PC games From the mid 1990s, if the game was created Where is my puzzle? Where does the money go? Pendragon movies can create great movies with good old models and computer-controlled cameras. La George Lucas, circa 1975-1983, and actors who seem like they care about what they do. (Or break in this case) about the same 20 million. This may be the worst movie ever created! I want to sit and watch the movie Ishtar 24 hours a day more than watching this movie again. I hate it completely! I'm back. I say this is the worst movie ever created because unlike other bad movies like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes or Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, these movies are terrible that you have a special place in your heart. You they love them There is no love in this movie and there is no place in my DVD library for this. I sell to the guy for the dollar. I bet the money for this film was used with alcohol and other evil for actors and teams. Shame on your Pendragon movie! I need a refund!
