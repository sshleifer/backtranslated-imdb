There are only a few movies that are expected and make me as angry as Fire. The film is solid waste. It was not successful at the art level. The only thing to get is the ban in India. If it is because of the poor quality of filmmaking rather than the controversy, the flat will have more reasons. <br /> <br /> Now I'm out of trouble. Can analyze the movie: <br /> <br /> * From the movie attack, it feels unreal, especially when the protagonist starts to speak in English. Of course, the director didn't make movies for Indian audiences. However, it evaluates foreign viewers too low by making it easier. Watching the characters in the country help make the perfect English conversation to be true and not true. <br /> <br /> * Next, we will see Radha's dreams on a regular basis. Effective They came up as people shaking and hindering the flow of the movie. I still wonder how the philosophical dialogue is linked to the story. I feel that surrealism is gone. <br /> <br /> * The love scene feels like a sneak peek and may be meant to make the audience more excited than a powerful sentence. In either case, they will not succeed either. <br /> <br /> * The names chosen for women, Radha and Sita, are the names of Hindu gods. However, since this film is not intended for Indian audiences at first, the shocking selection does not mean a goal that is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * The quality of the direction. Terrible and some important and delicate scenes are poorly managed. The better director can create a drama that has emotional power from the story. <br /> <br /> * The performance feels like wood, although Nandita Das brings life to the script. I always thought that Shabana Ash has a good actress. But her ability does not appear in this film Actors bring men as garbage immediately <br /> <br /> In the event that you are a fan of the world and want to see more directors to stay away from this person please.
