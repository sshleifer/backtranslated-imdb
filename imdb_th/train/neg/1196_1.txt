How can the movie with Amy, Posey and Raechel be funny? Believe it or not, 'House Bunny' is better and more fun. Hope that the employer will have a good holiday and get money - this movie is embarrassing for all of them. It is an ancient idea from beginning to end. Clich√©s can work well with scripts or at least ideas. This film does nothing but use ancient ideas after thinking more than ideas or scripts. It uses the characters that existed before the actors instead of developing the characters. Poor, sad and rubbish Now, obviously, I have to have ten lines of text for really opinions? why? As an IT manager, it is another example of writing sloppy code.
