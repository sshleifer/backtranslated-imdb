This film is not as good as laughing. Friends rent it from Netflix and make me watch it. There are many gaffes and goofs that can't even get to know the characters and the story. For example, these things ... <br /> <br /> "Vermont Airport" surrounded by palm trees <br /> <br /> Ben appeared astonishingly during the phone conversation <br /> <br /> The priest's luxury office ... with a folding table. <br /> <br /> There are good stories hidden behind bad movies. But even if you look through technical flaws, you will find awesome performances and selections. I was most motivated by the selection of colorful gay actors to play as brothers and sisters in the right wing religion. His opening scene sat in his impeccable apartment, stroking his kitty cat. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> I applaud writers / directors / producers / editors / celebrities / The host / dentist / performer made this move) for creating a movie like this. If you have nothing better than doing it, it may be a fun group movie or the basis of a drinking game. But do not rent for powerful stories about homosexuality and gay marriage
