Let me start this review by saying this: I love vampire movies. They can suck (intentionally) and I will still love them because the vampire is cool in Van Helsing, which many people think is a garbage dump. It's fun for me because of the fact that there are vampires. You might ask: "How is it related to this movie?" The answer is that I intend to tell you how horrible this movie is, even the sucker. (Harar Harar) For a vampire movie like me, I can insult this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Van Helsing, an incredible college professor. He is an awesome actor like everyone else in this movie and he writes it to add salt to the wound. I do not intend to make him angry and I'm sure everyone enjoys making this movie. But watching it really painful I'm not sure why I watched all Maybe it will be fascinating, like watching the train crashes: It's scary, but you can't force yourself to look out. Its main fault is that it is very boring and its plot is very ridiculous. Even horror horror movies <br /> <br /> But I digress. By the way that Van Helsing had sex with his mother Of course he didn't know that she was at that time. He just thought it was one of his students. (Which is still illegal and all But not disgusting and disgusting) <br /> <br /> If I were Van Helsing me, at least I would have to pull the Odyssey out when I knew. I do something bad It will make it fun if he just commented, but not this issue does not occur even with any character. It's like the writer doesn't think. At least I will have another character laughing at him and saying "Hahaha, you have sex with your mother" which is gentle jokes. (Even underage) I might run out of the room, so a few more words that will prohibit you from going to watch this movie: there is a battle with the vampire ninja and the old man. Let us seriously It's not worth watching a movie to see how bad it is. Far away from that, if you value your time, <br /> <br /> I'll tell you one positive thing about the movie: the guy playing Van Helsing is quite slick with his knife. Looks like a one minute long section in which he wanders around his knife. It's boring in other movies But here is sad. It is highlighted.
