This makes the third movie Errol Morris I've seen and I don't like his style more. It seems that he will find interesting and diverse characters, great personalities in documentary filmmaking, and then with a cheek editing, making fun of everything they are about. It was never a direct caricature of them and Morris often said that "But no, these people are really passionate!" But there are these delicate little corners and elaborate cuts. Techniques that show that Morris seems to mock them in the back Find out if they are Lion-like ants, round hats, gardeners that are filled with animal shrubs and robot designers. The general theme of the movie seems to revolve around the question of what are the qualities of animals, humans and life. Therefore, the title of Fast, Cheap, & Out of Control does not mean anything in terms of movies ... right? Exactly, of course, Morris seems to be just the confusion of these people. (He may call them "Obsession") makes synthetic design in life I didn't share the fear and sincerity, not admiring some relationships that Morris did in the film. <br /> <br /> But I emphasized his subtlety. When there is no voice lecture and leave all the words with the interviewer, it's not that Morris will cause anxiety at the audience. He often mixes circus images and ant foot images together, often when they are removed from the circus context and the ant shows the overall absurdity behind what these people are talking about. I did not find them ridiculous. I found that all of them were neat and interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, he didn't intend to hit that news, which means he was a bad craftsman instead. The subverter silent person, considering this film that I have never seen, especially impressed me. I'm not interested in finding out what he is trying. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
