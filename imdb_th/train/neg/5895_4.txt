Miike is a Chabrol art, alternating with shipwrecks, sometimes causing both confusion. Does he match the fifty / fifty claim rate for Chabrol? We see here, Miike, too or too little. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. But I can easily fill the ten lines by claiming the stealing of Chakushin ari (One Missed Call's). Most of them, although not Saimin (Hypnosis) of Ochiai, for doing supernatural things. Only once when Yumi picks up a zombie-like mother in her arms. One Missed Call makes me a little shocked. <br /> <br /> Another interesting point: Renji Ishibashi (looks like Christopher Walken) is a detective in Ishibashi. In the audition of improper auditions and as the Aoki Boss of the Dead or Alive of the drowned trash and others may be the most evil actors I have ever seen So here he is a cop.
