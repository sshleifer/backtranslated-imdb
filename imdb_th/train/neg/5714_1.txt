I have seen many good Korean movies, including thriller movies and darker movies. But this is very bad The director seems to be a sadist who happens to someone to create garbage. Movies lack any form of entertainment and are not exciting. I can't believe that someone created such a movie. Even if the show is available But the story and the feeling were scary. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I won't watch this director's movie. There is no feeling in making a movie and disappointed with the exciting moments. All of this shows a scene with bugs breaking the wheel with badly shot scenes and demonstrating blood and intense thoughts that make it exciting The movie is very disappointing and I recommend skipping all the movies of this genre.
