This is the worst movie I have ever seen at WorldFest and it still received the least applause after that! I can only think that it has received such recognition from a number of known actors in movies. It's a very good thing to see J.Beals, but she's in a few minutes of the movie. M.Parker is a better actor than the allowed part The remaining performances are difficult to judge because the film is ridiculous and predictable. The main character is not sympathetic and boring. There is no real emotional depth for the story. A movie that revolves around an actor who can't work, doesn't feel that it's my original. Or police development It feels like being one of the movies that match the videos I saw in the 90s ... and not a good movie in those standards. <br /> <br />
