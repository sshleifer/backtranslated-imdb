Vincente Minelli movies are always worth your time. Meet me in St Louis, The Bad and the Beautiful. I am waiting for this movie with great interest. But the disappointing thing <br /> <br /> Came Running some scenes are the backdrop of nowhere deaths. Sinatra is a sad sack that comes back from the war to find a frustrating family relationship, frustrating dirtyness hanging on him, living in a disappointing accommodation while the girls invite him to write a disappointing project. This film has a great final scene where the frustrating villain meets Sinatra and MacClane and the disappointing things happen. The sequence is intended to add tension, but Minelli is not a Hitchcock. He has been distracted by beautiful colors. He doesn't notice that the scene is a clich√© and the character is skinny and poorly drawn. Shoot (especially MacClane), but that's the only movie in the project. Otherwise, we will see the constipation character standing around the bar and the living room where each other makes worry for two hours. Clearly, the other hell is <br /> <br /> Nothing happens in this movie. The military dilemma returned to displacement and indifference after WW2 was handled more aggressively in 'The best year of our lives' and both Inge products 'Splendor in the Grass' and 'Picnic' covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead city with many pain.
