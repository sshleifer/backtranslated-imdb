I like the movie Asylum. I make it a habit to see the most. Even the cheating they make is cool, like excitement and when there is a killer line. This is just plain crippling. I can't believe that the same person who made DEAD MEN WALKING and CURSE of DRACULA made this movie too !!! It's not as ridiculous as JOLLY ROGER or alien abduction. (Which by bad means) this is just BAD! I mean, I can appreciate and / or forgive bad performances or weak special effects in the Asylum movie, but this movie is too serious. I hope the tracks on the train will be better. Now it's a movie I can't wait to watch.
