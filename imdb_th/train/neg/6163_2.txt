Hooper isn't funny, funny, not romantic and doesn't give information. No real drama You will think that the movie about the greatest stunt performer in the world will have this drama with effort. But it seems not true No education, no characters, no lessons learned, it doesn't seem like the actors are really fun. They just try to act like being fun. There is no reason to watch unless you want to see Burt and want to get a glimpse of Sally from time to time. Prancer's horse is beautiful and does what he should do. In fact, Prancer is the best actor in this movie. Smoky and the Bandit is a fun movie that I'm ready to like Hooper. This movie became a disappointment and a real waste of time.
