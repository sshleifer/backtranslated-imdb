Ugh, another one on the DVD that "was fooled." I expect to have some action with the bear, cat & on the cover. I don't get anything! Bad movies!. <br /> <br /> I forced myself to watch this thing all the way, thinking that in the end what will happen ... no luck. <br /> <br /> Now, the reason I give 2 is Because of the scenery; Otherwise, it sucks. <br /> <br /> The child is terrible. Say to yourself. (Although I think they can't play the movie with dumb songs and no dialogue), causing his weak karate legs with stump trees, threatening raccoons, chewing on worms and (stupid) kicking a porcupine and he won't pull Those feather pens come out easily as well ... They are attached to a fishing rod. At least he fought a few (weak) bears. <br /> <br /> What happened to the past? It makes the movie worse. I want to see survival movies, not children who suffer from divorce. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? Maybe they should have a bear to eat a child or something. At least it's more exciting. <br /> <br /> People don't waste time with this person.
