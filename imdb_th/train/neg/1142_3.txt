You get cluttered and threatened to present my news about the movie "femme fatale" / "guns n 'gals". Now, another breed of frustrating discoveries: Ninja movies! Many things I've seen before and let me tell you it's not all that will break! They are usually not attached to issues among others. All this does not have originality! How are ninjas associated with preventing nuclear disasters in Russia? And this should not be a movie "Martial Arts", too? Is the sound of a gun like the action movie incredible for you? Is blood the number one reason to love this thing to death? Will you lose the hard earned money with a woman singing in a true SEAT tank? The answers to these important questions can be found in THE NINJA MISSION, which should be in the martial arts category of your video store. For the more ridiculous fun of the ninjas, watch the movie Godfrey Ho at Trans World, presenting you what you deserve and that is a promise! Recommended for hardcore ninja addicts only!
