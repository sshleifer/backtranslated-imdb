This film was created for Dani's fans (and the Cradle of Filth). I'm not one of them. I think he is just an imitator who drives a black metal wheel. (But in general I am not a big fan of black metal) but while I carry this DVD box, I am confident that the more genuine it is, the more I try to convince. So I assumed that I was on a rubber roller coaster ride and doing it yourself with a scary background. Now that is what I like. <br /> <br /> I got home and nailed in my patience. It took 15 minutes of AWFUL camera work and awesome quality and that is (2002). Which seems to be taken using the Hi8 camera. I left it on the shelf Maybe a good evening with beer and Bmovies may create a good atmosphere for pictures ... <br /> <br /> After a couple of months I came back. (In the environment mentioned) and saw half, then not only But the manner mentioned makes me annoyed My dislike developed I noticed that Dani jokes (1,65m; 5'5 "height) look in his platform shoes, tearing the villain's head apart. (Yes, Ripping apparently had his head without a skull.) I found that this movie might have There is no feeling, but I'm not finished, so I'm not positive. <br /> <br /> After trying a few more times, I finally made this flick - a couple of months ... (Yes. I spent 5,5 years). So - in fact, Dani is a joke because Satan / Manson / super-evil-man's helpers and DID movies don't make sense. See our bad guys. Hire Dani to do bad things. give Why do I think he is a terrible person? Actually, both of them are like that and it's very beautiful. <br /> <br /> We have a couple of short stories together with Dani's character. It's about a man who steals the leg of someone because he wants to use it for himself. Of course. <br /> <br /> The performance of ROCK BOTTOM CGI is the worst. I mean, Stinger and the boy. This is Stinger's CGI baaaa). This is meaningless. And the quality is ... let's say it's not satisfactory. The only thing that makes you look is violence and gore. The blood and the machine do quite well. Why did you see that the movie originated and then moved (for example - Dani 'The Man' Filth using a stuffed cat - fake as much as possible - and brave ... and then eat something that fell out. Why are we? Never know. We know that this cat must be With illegal substances because his heart is almost half his size) <br /> <br /> You may think that after my opinion that this movie is terrible, it's good, but it's bad. Cradle of Filth fans can add 3 points. I add one to bet.
