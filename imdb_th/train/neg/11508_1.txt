Anything with Guy Ritchie that will make Wertmuller's movie difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> This new movie isn't a mess. There was another audience when I saw it and she left it for about an hour. (I hope you ask for a refund.) The only reason I remained to the end was because I had never walked out of the movie. <br /> <br /> But I watched this junk that was dazed at that. Madonna and Ritchie think they are doing really good movies. The conversation is laughing. The show is cruel and the only thing that is good in this movie is the scenery. Ritchie brings Lina's movie and turns into "Blue Lagoon" again. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you don't have to waste time watching. Late at night on Cinemax, the time is too precious to waste.
