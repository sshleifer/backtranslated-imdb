Oh my God, I gave this movie three stars out of ten for the following reasons. The last sequence was effectively managed again and it was absolutely hilarious. That is what earned all three points. In addition, it was brutal. It doesn't mean being a very funny person. But the dub, the voice acting, the conversations that they say are often hilarious Actions that are performed and / or not carried out also lead to a lot of buzz and / or throwing things on the screen, such as when the whole city is being killed and a small group of people stand on the balcony. Looks as if they are watching a glass of cooking or "trying" to escape from the church they drilled. <br /> The evil mayor: I think there's something going on outside so you should go up. Go Both the top and look out the window hero <br /> <br />: <br /> Mayor's evil /> <br Now is mine. The opportunity to make the idiot go out and throw around with the unfulfilled fire and being hacked. <br /> <br /> The insertion sequence happened. <br /> <br /> The mayor at Evil: Damn waiting for me to pick up this small child and she will walk outside and cry. Pappa seems to be vague with the fact that those rotten corpses are not just spooky strangers. But actually, zombies that don't have meat or movies or whatever. Insert the order in which this happened. <br /> <br /> Hero (upstairs): He tried to escape again. Stupid and he opened the door. He was stupid. This is a good view. > Female: Where's my daughter? <br /> <br /> Hero (now downstairs): I don't know. I didn't see you and she wasn't outside because I couldn't see you even though I went out. outside There and I have a view of the whole neighborhood and she stands outside, where she will be on earth. <br /> <br /> Without needing to speak, anyone will throw things on the screen after passing. For 10 minutes, so watch the first movie with a few friends, have a few drinks and make sure that when you watch this movie, you will be unconsciously drunk and may laugh at the stupidity of it. Toast the end And without even the proper wounds like this is a shame
