VIDA RIDES (1968) became a big disappointment! And even though Sam Peckinpah had a hand in the screenplay with Robert Towne, it still appears as a film written in a lead role directed by Buzz Kulik. Firstly, the popular Yul Brynner bill is Pancho Villa Guilty for the part! He's not charming enough to play the great Mexican revolution! One of his performances was without fire and Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland might bring Brynner's role. It seems that the Russian aristocrats dressed up like Mexican robbers in the middle of The Mexican revolution instead of Russia. In addition, Robert Mitchum, who was charged twice, was completely consumed in the picture! As for his part as an ace, the two-winged plane that was bombed in the house from the cause of the revolution was a bad chapter that could be a minor star. Mitch is not the proper line in the entire film and reminds him of his other Mexican revolutions, "Bandido" (1956), which is superior, unfortunately it seems that no one is interested in releasing a DVD. In addition to the lack of style "Villa Rides", all forms of suffering are not well tolerated without a female star! There is a new star, Grazia Buccella, a Mexican girl who gives Mitchum the pleasure, but her casting is only a ceremony. Some people, like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters, may add bad notches at Needed into the story of the poor. <br /> <br /> There are two great action scenes in the movie. Not the movie that is created and the quality of the Panavision image is less than perfect, including the refinement of Maurice Jarre's unique theme. Didn't help. <br /> <br /> As Paramount, there is no special thing even. Trailer! Yes, a frustrating movie and a DVD presentation that seems to be and probably much better.
