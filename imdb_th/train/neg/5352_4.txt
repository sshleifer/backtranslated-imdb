The Honey, I provoke the kids, the franchise is a big deal, and not to mention a lot of fame. I love Honey. I shrink my baby when I'm young. It's a traditional story and an exciting story! The scene is amazing and the actors seem to be happy with each other's company. Now, my darling makes the child look silly, so I think they want to go back to what everyone likes. br /> In general, Adam grew up a bit and the mother was going. On holiday to leave her husband with children But when Wayne's favorites were threatened for garbage, he wanted to reduce the size and keep it. But he and his brother came in But when the wife came back after forgetting to give their sons, they were also caught in the machine, leaving the children in the house alone. <br /> <br /> That story is stupid. But as I said It's just a family movie that I think some people might be fired. Traditional honey. I shrink the children the best. I think everyone can agree. The third one is not that bad. I will recommend this at least in the story of Honey. I will make this movie fun at least. <br /> <br /> 4/10
