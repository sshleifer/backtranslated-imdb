I am excited to see the sitcoms hoping to represent the Indian Kander. But I found that this program is not funny. Producers and actors are happy to get bad and good food back, because as long as they are concerned, it will be talked about! I am ready for some pattern and there is no problem with it because the pattern exists for the reason they are always true. But there is nothing funny about these ready-made characters. The "fresh boat" father doesn't understand his daughter. Radical Muslim daughter, young woman (A terrifying actress) and a new young Indian man trying to call his mosque as politically as possible (He's a good actor /> <br /> It's well designed and the dialog box isn't smooth. It has a lot of potential for something like this. But sadly, I thought it failed and didn't care to watch other episodes Doing your daughter badly in the show, not being able to perform as well!
