I can't believe that the likes of Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger are related to this junk! The script is very poorly written and the director is very weak. (Both by the same person), which is difficult to find one-dimensional characters in the movie The dialogue is rather lame that this thing is called a thriller, which makes it laugh out of a few stupid people entering the theater. The setting is quite complicated, inviting you to believe that you are going to watch the frightening horror movie and suddenly it becomes the most stupid persecution movie. Bassinger's character is very stupid. Actually, she stopped screaming to God. "Where are you?" So that the people who follow you can follow and leak !!!! And then she clearly entered the smallest forest in the world. I mean, she ran all over the place and the murderer never followed her and this happened in the middle of the night. It really makes me wonder if the best writers in Hollywood can find that they spend millions to produce it.
