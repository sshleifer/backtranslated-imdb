If you like pop / punk, punk, ska and tad bit of modern psycho billy, watching live performances is about the only thing that should be worth watching. The film has many bands and along with the president of Troma, Lloyd Kaufman has many semi-mainstream roles and death scenes. Doesn't sound like good? Death continued and repeated with many bands of Warp Tour and fans in the event. Some of the deaths started with style. But after that, they were recycled again and again until they became repetitive. Almost everyone died due to smashing the head or intestines being pulled out of the stomach. The blood seems to come from "Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence" by Andreas Schnaas; With this "Blood type blood" but now this movie is good and gives some humor that this movie lacks. Of course, this movie was created by Doug Sakmann from Troma. It has a very low potential and it tries ... but it's too difficult. Everything is too meaningful to be funny in this movie and that's what brought it down. Everything is trying to be a cartoon and too stupid by using ill-intentioned performances, using pointless death and doing the same thing ... over and over again. Basically it is "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker", "Chairman" or any movie you do with your friends: it's funny for those who create it and it's about it. <br /> < br /> Excellent, great potential, great use of effects But it is the same ... over and over again: playing as a band, the band is dead, the fans will die, everyone dies, the blood will be sprayed everywhere Is this type of movie, which is generally 'slap-badly stuck' - are they trying too hard?
