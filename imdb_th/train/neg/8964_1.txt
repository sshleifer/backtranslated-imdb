Those who are familiar with the two previous Cube movies know what they expect: a small group of people stuck in a room full of people, paranoia, bad performances. (Half of them) <br /> <br /> I guess Cube Zero has a desire to explain things Deal with the cube is But you do not know more than what is covered in the first two movies Of course, there is an explanation in it. But it feels pretty lame when compared to what was introduced in the first movie. Cube Zero looks quite cheap. (Like the previous model) and the fact that Show more than just two empty rooms that emphasize this feeling. I am quite confident in saying that there is no risk that the actor will receive any awards in the near future. But they brought the trap from Cube 1 back (where I mean they are almost the same, which is a little embarrassing) <br /> <br /> I know many people are the same type. Appreciate this film and bond with the first film. But I just felt that it was absolutely unnecessary for a franchise that didn't start well. [1/10]
