My girlfriend and I am shocked how bad this movie is. After 15 minutes, we will call it stop working, unless we are too curious about whether the film can redeem itself or not. <br /> <br /> I can't understand the words. Praise given to this film The writing is terrible and presented by the worst performances I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> One thing that makes me particularly annoyed about this movie is that people often talk. There Is a natural pause between lines I understand the use of pauses to create an awkward feeling. (Like in happiness) This is not a type of pause - it's just a bad governance. This movie may be much better with subtitles and the international market may be the best thing for this movie, because then the naive dialogue and bad acting will not be noticed much. <br /> < br /> I like this small movie (The Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing), but this movie has failed in many levels that I think is one of the worst movies I've ever had when A few None ago
