A series of ununny skits that seem to be forever and day. Not terrifyingly scary, like saying "Freddy Got Fingered" or "Lost Reality", but that does not endorse any kind of feeling or style. Any person who doesn't like the most But is the most rude or politically correct person There is also the worst imitation of the songs that had been put on Arnold EVER's worst imitation film (not just the worst put on the film). I do not know why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan or Slash will perform in this story. (The reason I watched this story in the first place) The only amusing thing is Dickman. In conclusion, I won't recommend this movie to anyone. But those who make their mission in life to get this in the top 250 in this website is pathetic Do amazing things with you in people's lives. In addition, if it is true that the Church of Scientology hates him, he is not bad. <br /> <br /> My grade: D
