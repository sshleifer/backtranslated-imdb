Good ideas are not well implemented. While able to summarize 99% of the movies of the SciFi channel, but it actually works here I love movies that have a good background story being revealed slowly and I like action movies and I like every major actor, so this may be a great story. However, despite good performances But this movie failed because of Bill Platt's poor writing and directing. <br /> <br /> Another review that makes you know where you are going. This movie is not It is gathered together, as you know, the word "second body" is not in the terminology of Bill Platt. There is only one scene that is totally unnecessary and can be removed without being noticed. This scene begins and ends with the fact that they drive, so you can cut from one car scene to another scene and never miss the nonsense scene in the middle. <br /> <br /> This movie has a strange habit. As well, under the description of some details while explaining others to the point where you can guess all "plot" in advance In addition, they were used to canceling a fight before, probably because they couldn't afford it. There is also a ludicrous scene where the "plot" is revealed on the computer and the final battle involving "toxic glue" (seriously, what is * that *?) <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because she's ok. She tried to distinguish the personality of "Roswell" a few times and create a strong chicks. (But not always) John De Lancie plays the character he plays in everything he has done since playing Q in ST: TNG. So there is nothing new. <br /> <br /> In every story, I rate Movie 4/10
