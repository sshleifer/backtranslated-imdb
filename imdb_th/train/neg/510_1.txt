This is one of the worst movies ever created and published by major Hollywood studios. The story is stupid. The dialog is written in an ancient language. You can complete many sentences in the script completely because of this. The performances are not ridiculously good, especially about Rod Cameron. "Choreography" is completely ridiculous and worthless The only one who can criticize the critics who saw the 23-year-old Yvonne's dance is sexual. It was a very bad choreography. The ballet scene at the beginning of this movie was especially ridiculous. If you are a bad movie and enjoy laughing at Hollywood's turkey, this is for you. I bought the colorized version in the VHS, making the movie worse. Yvonne's heavy makeup, when colored, makes her look like a clown all the time. And she is the best part of this movie Is a way to start a career
