One of Boris Karloff's true clinkers. Karloff was basically dying. (Looking at over 120 years old) is a scientist who needs cash to complete the experiment before he dies. Moved from Morocco where his capital was dominated by others. He went to the south of France where he worked as a doctor while trying to lose enough money to prove his theory. Desperate for money, he made an agreement with the rich young wife of the cotton baron who was dying. She will give him money if he helps poison her husband so that she can take his money and continue with the gigolo (which I think is married). If you think I get that from watching movies You make a mistake. Why do I have to read what other people post to figure out what happened? Because this movie lost me in two minutes, I didn't know what had happened to the many characters and plot that converged on many lines. There was little spelling and didn't say much until the end, which I didn't care about. The purely interesting clutter for Karloff's performance, which is quite strange sometimes To be honest, this is the only time I have ever seen him invest in a strange Belouloucie land, not every scene, but only a little bit and make me wonder how much they went out.
