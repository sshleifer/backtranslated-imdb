Much of the movie fare is very boring here with Stella Stevens getting directions from someone in disguise. (It didn't take long, I would guess who it was) in the old Nevada town outside of Vegas for the money robbed in Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. He must act much faster than expected. Despite having a look at Las Vegas in the 1970s, but the most reliable performances from the average person and the potential planning of Las Vegas, Lady spawned a big boring time. It seems that this movie will open forever and when it spreads out here and there and never accelerates. I was quite disappointed with this movie. Of course I didn't expect much. But at least I think this may be one of the movies that were finely exploited from the 70s or something like that. Not close. No one died. There was a slight clash between Stuart Whitman, the illusionist and George DiCenzo, a year before his great performance as a lawyer in Bugliosa in Helter Skelter. See the waterfall With a single punch and one head hit with a blunt instrument More than nothing in terms of action and for girls, don't expect too much as well. Stella and her girls (both mediocre but very cute, into the sauna and showering, we see nothing, nothing but the missing details). Stella wears an open blouse. These emphasize her true ability. Slightly wider with her performance. In this way, I can write one thing to introduce this film. Alas, it should not be. And I only have a little to say in favor of the film. Afraid, in any way, it has nothing to do. YAWN
