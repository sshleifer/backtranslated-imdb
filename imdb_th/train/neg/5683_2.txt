From the beginning of the movie, I felt like it was a movie about someone else's Jason from Friday the 13th. But over time it was just a ridiculous movie about a serial killer that was silent and soundless. I mean he went under the bed of a man without making any noise, not seeing anyone. He should be blind after the execution has failed. But he walks and kills people like he used to be I'm tired of it For me, it's all the same. <br /> <br /> In other words - not true. Errors and information that is too confusing. <br /> <br /> Good scenes with women who look feminine. But first:} For that matter, and for the interesting 2-star intro
