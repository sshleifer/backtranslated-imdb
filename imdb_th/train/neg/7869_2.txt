Passage of time Movies that you can watch if you are looking for a complex suicide method. Some people use guns, ropes or gas. But do you want to destroy your brain? Don't wait anymore! The passage of time should be one of the biggest mistakes possible: Christian Clavier's thinking can show and make you fun. I shouldn't miss 45 francs. This poor thing makes me lose money: sometimes we have to reset the evaluation system by looking at absolute zero. This film deserves 2/10, but because I like Jean Reno only. Very bad for him. He also performed in Ronin too. I think I will not like him ...
