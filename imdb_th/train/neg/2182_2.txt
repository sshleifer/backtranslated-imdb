I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart. After seeing it, I might go back to the store and try to get a refund! The only reason I gave this movie a second story and not 1 is that the story has a few storytelling elements, although it has never been so interesting. This film, with all of the earmarks, is made for the drive cinema market - ultra low budget, amateur shows and liberal medicine of sex. (For the early 60s movies) In fact, I suspect that perhaps the only reason for this film is to make a quick buck and because someone knows that the dancers they can use as a supplement. This film is about Dr. Wacko, who wants to cut his girlfriend's head onto the body of an unsuspecting donor. Most potential donors are dancers or models whose sole purpose in this film is to make the pale because they removed most of the clothes. However, they are still trying to make too many movies, even though it is worth the mischief and the movie is not enough to watch from the bad movie.
