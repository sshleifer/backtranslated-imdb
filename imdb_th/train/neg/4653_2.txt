Vampire's followers want to call her after falling in love with a five-dollar prostitute in a horror movie. I can't explain all the positive comments of this movie. I will chalk it up to a lot of hallucinations. But it doesn't make any trouble One redemption factor (And this is me being very generous here) may be a grandfather who is a semi-satisfying character in all this mess Don't waste money or time. In fact, this is a suggestion if Troma puts it on a DVD. But do not do it on every occasion. It is annoying. <br /> <br /> Troma Special DVD: Description with Omar and Kirk; The second comment on the scene and the team was removed to the clip; Troma interaction, radiation in March, clips from "Terror Firmer"; Movie trailer for "The Rowdy Girls", "Teengirl Catgirls in Heat", "Cannible: The Musical" and "Toxic Avenger 4" <br /> <br /> My grade: D
