Joyce Reynolds seems to have grown up for the role of Janie, a sixteen-year-old boy who is mad in a small town in America that left a man with a soldier who visited and ended the Life magazine (kissing at a blanket party)) all week same! Uninterrupted volley, talking about cows and other businesses such as the little sister who bribed Janie Hattie McDaniel's family members (while the maidservant) ran continuously after sis kid sis, Janie's mother and Janie's father tried to write an editorial about the problems of teenagers today. (As a parent, stuffy, Edward Arnold, and not polite, female, Ann Harding, speaking to a couple, is not worried, even in 1944, raising two people) Warner Bros. was offered. Nominated for the Academy Award (!) For the revision of Owen Marks, followed in 1946 with "Janie Gets Married". Reynolds had to overthrow her teammates and she was replaced by Joan Leslie * 1/2 from ****
