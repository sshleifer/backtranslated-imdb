The only reason I DVRd this movie is because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq plays basketball for us now and 2. I've heard how bad it is. This film does not disappoint. The best part is Shaq's dress. The worst part is good. Everything about others. My 12 year old son and I just rippled and couldn't see the screen when Shaq started rapping and we still wondered why Mac Do not want Kazzam to fix his front teeth! But for everything, it's so scary that we can't stop watching. Such stories are sucked into you, such as black holes or quicksand or tar holes. It's hypnotic. But it is worth it for laughter and just saying that we really see "Kazzam"
