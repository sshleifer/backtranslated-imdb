Um, I can't go to the plot. But that may be just me Sometimes the movement of the camera is not lively. But this movie has a charming vintage quality. The show is sometimes authentic and entertaining with occasional chases involving women who are scantily clad. The climax is confused and separated, but still ... stunned and stunned to Stella Stevens The movement of the mobile camera is a little bit jerky, which makes me guess for a while. But I don't think I will chase the DVD.
