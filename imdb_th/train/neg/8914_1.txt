I have to stop watching this movie. (Intellectual pseudo-product for the claiming movie audience) Twenty minutes because it is common and boring enough to inspire yawning, not to mention that I soon tears for almost $ 3.99 that I lost. Joan Pugula's performances and her Slavic accent are terrible enough to make their teeth dirty. I know that her two hours are too much for two hours. Both Breuer and Nietzsche played by a few talented ordinary actors. While we were on the topic of talent, Breuer's great assistant seemed to have been drawn from the local theater. Obviously she didn't learn her craft. In fact, she is really scary. All public scenes are staged with special scenes related to walking on Sunday. The closing of this film is more satisfying than opening a movie. Don't rent this scary movie. You will regret that you spent money.
