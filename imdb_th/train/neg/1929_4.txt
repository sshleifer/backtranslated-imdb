Some people appreciate it - Atlantis: -The Lost Empire- is a Disney adventure for adults. I don't think so - at least not for adults who think. <br /> <br /> This script shows the beginning as an action movie that makes someone become the type of person you are. Can not be sold to adults anymore "Cracker" of many old adventure movies has been done well (think of The Dirty Dozen), but -Atlantis-is one of the worse movies in the standard. Weak character Even the background that each member jogged out seemed to be the best and the most embarrassing. MD / Medicine Man Tomboy, whose father had wanted a son before, if at least we had never seen these things before, we saw the habit. Strange story about how a friend, Vinny, played by Don Novello (Fr. Guido Sarducci) goes from a flower shop to a totally unbelievable destruction. <br /> <br /> The main character. Only Milo Thatch in Atlantis fascinated scholars voiced by Michael J. Fox have any depth to his search for Millau Atlantis continues to go from his grandfather raised him up. The opening scene shows Milo younger than he was on his knees like a grandfather, while his grandfather placed his core hat on his head. <br /> <br /> And while the character is the thinnest in the best part About-Alantis- is the voice talent. Commander Rourke has nothing to be voiced by James Garner, although Rourke is a soldier in stock. But Garner shows his ability to breathe life into a character just by sending him. Garner's sound performance is the highest point. I'm sorry to say that the king of Leonard Nimoy's death is nothing more than responsibility. In addition, Don Novello, as a demolition expert, Vinny Santorini is famous for one or two funny stories that are funny, but I like it. Father Guido Sarducci anyway <br /> <br /> Well done as a computer animation. Background animation that is The character's animation doesn't do anything if it doesn't create a flat character. In addition to the terrain, buildings and vehicles, there is nothing impressive. <br /> <br /> The storyline is the worst. Some people say that they are ridiculous or repetitive. I'm not sure about that. Any plot that serves can make a new thing with proper treatment. Shakespeare often begins with a known story and plot, and is famous just to wear a new color coat. So the treatment is something that is and -Atantis-clearly missing. <br /> <br /> I can't start to enter all logical spaces without spoilers. Bad story Plot the plot of the plot like a big line and the ending is not reasonable. If you want to add scripts and animations, it will be full of annoying dirt. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** <br /> <br /> The beginning when Milo finds That the Runic or Celtic symbols have been misinterpreted and "The Irish coast" should read "Iceland coast". We have problems. The script writer must know that England uses Eire or Eireann as "Ireland" and doesn't care about Hibernian in older Latin. But more than that, they need to know the conspiracy of the Vikings in calling the Green Island of Iceland and the Island of Greenland. <br /> <br /> By making it a story Of the "wrong" letter, doomed to have the English version of runic and the Roman post date in the script Because for a long time after Atlantis should sink into the cave under the sea And if there is no visible clue and less technology that Milo has made the inscription less reliable, <br /> <br /> Shepherd's journal cannot be written before the sinking of Atlantis. Baptist, or it doesn't know anything about the cave or the crystal lying "in the eyes of the king", it must be written after the sinking But without the technology that Milo's survey has And how will it know more about it after that? And why it was written in Atlantian <br /> <br /> writing and automatic clairvoyance or star travel can explain these things However, clairvoyance and travel on a star do not need to be written in Atlantian. Therefore, automatic writing is required. Since no one is left in Atlantis that can be read, it must be the spirit of the message that shines the crystal on the surface. This will make more sense. But can also be explained in the movie: Milo can find that this power calls him all his life - appearing in dreams, etc. This thing needs to be explored in the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> Atlantis should not understand modern languages No one expected that the original Indo-European people would be able to talk more in Europe than the Romans would understand that "c" or their days became more difficult, becoming French "ch" (pronounced like "sh" !) <br /> <br /> The Atlantis people are still alive in the presence of cataclysm - when they are clearly * able to * read, but now they can't read what they used or use similar machines. <br /> <br /> Don't know Newspapers, many pointed out a major flaw in the film. It seems that nothing has happened to this culture. Seems to be floating in the air until Milo can save his life Although it seems that life is not struggling for survival But no one wants to write poems or write novels, and maybe it is a combination of the Atlantian school system that has fallen to the end and there is no good novel that makes Atlantis fall ill. <br /> <br /> Kida can Can not excuse without knowing how to read or use the machine if she is a child when Cataclysm of Stupidity is located - but it is true ** qualified for her father For clarification !! Kashakim's folly almost wiped his only one from being alive. Kill a bunch in progress (Not many were killed here But he oversaw a large slide in culture and progress) until someone could kill everyone if they didn't boil lava first because of the giant robot Not there to protect them. <br /> <br /> The lightning of the blue electric current should make Kashakim's image crumble when Kida tries to join her father's image with the great king of Atlantis. <Br <br /> <br /> Although Milo is the only one who can read the Atlantian, Rourke and others know well enough to read gibberish books and search for pages on the crystal which he knows are crystal and not Prophet or The sun diagram <br /> <br /> If Milo's grandfather told Rourke about this, it still didn't explain how Rourke would suffer from Milo's reading as part of the book. Out - which is the ear dog in the hands of Rourke, although Milo finds that there are no signs of a torn face in this book. Obviously - only to tip the audience that "There is something wrong." In addition to the word "crystal", there will be a warning signal in Milo's head that someone is trying to steal it. Milo will not doubt anything. It's just a bold guess. <br /> <br /> The crew's crossover is not a change of character. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie have collaborated with Rourke from the beginning. However, "change of heart" falls. It is a change and requires better motivation. Difficult to do with characters that didn't get anything. Start <br /> <br /> A little bit of lava flows over the dome instead of filling in the rest of the area where we watch the sequence. It's liquid. It will not flow through the protective dome until it will fill the entire bottom area. <br /> <br /> The end of the STINKS! - and there is no other reason than to appease political correctness By restoring power from various sources, Atlantis is no longer the weakest power, so coddling the giant robot defender and the blue cycles that shoot the blue lightning, suggesting that they are less afraid of us. Technology is superior to us and, of course, until the beginning of the 20th century. In the end, Milo needs to teach the Atlantis people what to read? The whole idea is to let the small, quiet culture be taught only not to send to the Hyper Drive. <br /> <br /> ** Rear spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Perhaps the world is lost and Setting at the turn of the century should advise me that this is a respect for the pulps rather than the failure that I found in the movie. Agree with this idea. But I am in a loss, why should I pay to see some characters and plot the story just because of a little fiction? And stories from the story are part of "Shit that they can't sell adults anymore" However, we are more complicated and our pulp must grow as well. Raiders of the Lost Ark loses the feel of the pulp and avoids badness. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - fun movies, but I think about the plot
