This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. The first time I came from Kansas, this film had no truth in this story. It's like they use the name BTK and create the rest. Moreover, it seems that somebody like me has only $ 20 dollars to create a movie and oh yes, don't worry about researching btk. Just do something pure Dookie seriously. No one should watch this movie. Killing the cow, staging and causing his victims to eat and explain the killing of animals. BTK didn't do these things. But the movie made for God's love never saw this horrible film God What is created for the TV is better and more accurate.
