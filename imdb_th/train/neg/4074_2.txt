I expect the same excitement as I spit on your grave. But I was left down by junk just the way you can call this movie. (Kind of mini porn) It makes me sick when the man is eaten to do my own business. There is no story that will quickly jump from each murder. If you like to see naked women or even men, there are spots in the movie for, and there are even points to help yourself in a movie that makes it porn and not a movie at all. I've seen some dumb movies in my time. But this is number 1. I want to watch again. The actors looked boring during watching movies with me, so they might need bad money to create this movie.
