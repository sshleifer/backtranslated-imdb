Let me start by saying that I consider myself to be one of the most open-minded moviegoers ... The movie is something I am passionate about and I am a great regular on the place of renting my local cult movies. . I feel the need to add that they often ask for advice from me about the movie every time I get there and it seems that I can't leave the place without Requires a complex debate or discussion about what happened. Film cult area ... I like to rent strange things and that's why this movie has been advised by one of the places of film and video cult - he told me that he thought I had to see this. And because the cover talks about something about being a film with Jodorowsky's atmosphere (one of my favorites!) I rent it. <br /> <br /> The score I give here is not fair. Because i can't I thought it was terrible. I don't know how to rate it otherwise. Question marks should be more appropriate ... <br /> <br /> This is the first movie and the only story that makes me feel bad at the stomach: I feel that my body is really sick! Am I the only one that truly changed the stomach? Even though I didn't want to close it, or maybe I couldn't because I was obsessed with the disgusting way ... <br /> <br /> I don't want to watch this movie again. > <br /> Not scary as I said, just a cup of tea (Or vodka for that) ...
