D. This is not a strange matter. Many people will tell you that this story is full of blood. But they are talking about "shiztz". This movie is very slow. <br /> <br /> It started with some men who made the mix to feel pain that he called "My son" has some scenes full of blood.

There are some very stupid scenes in this story and they dub the hit songs and slap with fake slap sounds that make me laugh! I will not recommend this place. Looking for a hound
