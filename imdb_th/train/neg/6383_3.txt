Gayniggers from the Outer Space is a short foreign film about gay black aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble on Earth. Being gay, their goal is to have a universe only for men who are all gay. So when they discovered women? "Female creatures" live on Earth. They are scared at first; Eventually they decided to get rid of all the women on this planet and release the male population. <br /> <br /> Nasty names with scornful stories and sexism However, there are a few substances underneath. As an examiner, others point out that there are few jokes other than the names of the characters (such as ArmInAss); I think I laugh once in a small gay joke. I think I got the point of this film very quickly. The satire of bad science fiction. But after that I was enough I want the movie to end. (And it's a short film!) Not bright or especially written
