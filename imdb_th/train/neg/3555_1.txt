Many years ago, this movie was my friend and I went to watch the horror movie that we thought would be good because it was the actor John Cassatess. For newbies, John Cassavettes is an actor, writer and director. (Married to actress Gena Rowlands) was nominated for three Academy Awards. Until we saw The Incubus, we didn't understand that John Cassavetes' income was made from the movie that was presented to him. If we know what this film is about before seeing it, we may totally avoid it. But we didn't walk away At that time, my friend and I joked that it was the worst movie ever created. Now, frankly, this is not true. I've seen many poorly made movies on Friday night at Cinemax (I just said it aloud?) That is much worse than The Incubus. Almost every movie starring Brian Bosworth is a movie that's worse than The Incubus That Santa Claus conquered the Martians is a movie that is worse than The Incubus. However, I have regularly used The Incubus as a criterion below which I do not want to fall. When talking to friends about this movie, I may have seen I often say it's better. (Or worse) than The Incubus <br /> <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
