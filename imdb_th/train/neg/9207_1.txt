This film sells for one dollar at Wal-Mart on DVD and so I don't feel like I'm lost to see this movie except my time. Enjoy Tom Hanks' performance. (Robbie Wheeling) who watched the children and gave a great performance because it was a scary chapter. Stories about students who decide to play Mazes & Monsters games only in very realistic environments Robbie finds a beautiful and romantic girl with her and when he starts playing the game he stops loving her and behaves like a monk. There are some scenes in this film, which were filmed in the past World Trade Center and in the observatory and roof areas. It is quite sad to see this part of the movie that many humans have died because of evil in the world. This is not a very good movie, except Tom Hanks tries to keep this movie above the sinking level of entertainment.
