To me. Where do I start? The father was not near that old enough to be the father of the girl. He wrecked the camera in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The favorite exclamation point in this movie is "Jesus Christ !!!". The zombies are nimble, stupid, and very few. The motivation is not fully understood and there is no story telling. People 'rush' to their destination with a jeep driving at 3 miles per hour. The world seems to continue as usual. But these things should be the last day The breasts will appear for the benefit of the breast. Normally, this method will provide partial redemption. But the rest of the film made me ignore the breast or the future of humanity. No dog that has reason and has a thin orange blood that changes the stomach The generals and his poems of "Close f ** k up!" Are redeemable properties only. The rest I hope to hear that they have done the right thing and killed themselves.
