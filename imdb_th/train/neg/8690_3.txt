Everyone involved (and viewers) should search for "candidates" to see how well this movie is. What happened to the story of South America? What is Julie Christie and Kate Cap Shaw who thinks that their role is to be cardboard? Now I like Gene Hackman's performance and / or every movie. He doesn't care (which I can hardly believe) or scary ridicule. I also liked and defended Richard Gere (and was also abolished), but here he had no "power". He never threatened and persuaded occasionally In conclusion, I was very disappointed. I expect a lot from this director and actor. If you don't find "The Candidate" again, see "Wag the dog" or even "Bulworth".
