I saw this movie in a mysterious science theater when it was called "It lives at night". The name is less misleading than "Batpeople". In fact, it is more accurate, called the Batperson. This movie is about doctors who study bats that I think because they want to heal Better rabies This is not really clear. The obvious thing is that he and his wife went to the cave and he was bitten by a bat. Why do scientists have to go on a tour to study bats so they are beyond me? He should not go inside himself. After being bitten by him and his wife on a honeymoon, where he started to be appropriate They went to see the worst doctor. The man was in the hospital and killed the nurse. In the end, the guy kills 3-4 people and his wife stands beside him and you should take root for him instead of the sheriff investigate the murder.
