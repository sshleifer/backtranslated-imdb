Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi channel (although I think it's now called Syfy?) The original movie I've seen But I have seen one or two people since then and I can tell you that they are stupid. But this fact, the scrapes on the bottom of the CGI tank are not good. The performance is not good. (If you've seen Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean. I don't want to. There are also songs that are used in every dangerous chapter that is really stupid. They just played over and over again. And it is not real I know I have heard somewhere before. (I do not remember where it is) This is one to avoid.
