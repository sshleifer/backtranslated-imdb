Abyss of guns, builders and road builders that cannot be captured This film is a definite plot as the Philippine movie STRYKER and is much worse! Performing improper conversations, effects, rhythmic movements, improper action sequences ... The list continues. Italy has built dozens of road warriors in the early nineties 80 good and bad This is the worst thing without competition. Not only the mood of this movie is completely bleak and miserable. But the experience of watching this movie is half boring. There is a good chase sequence 1 (one), the beginning of the movie and the wonderful picture of a man carrying a grenade. But everything about this movie will be seriously revived! For real post-Nick fun, follow a copy of ENDGAME after the fall of New York or escape from the Bronx instead. They are more fun than this garbage.
