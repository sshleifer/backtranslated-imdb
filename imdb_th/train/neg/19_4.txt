I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally, seeing him as a star of a recent movie, not just a small part, makes me happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I admire movies in college and The only thing I can tell is that I don't like it. That this movie was created in the abandoned part of the city and without background traffic or lookie loos. <br /> <br /> I must say that the expression of what is needed, but Arnold is a great actor me Must chalk it in the lousy direction and the supporting actors will throw away something that is needed. <br /> <br /> I love Arnold Vosslo and he makes the movie look. Otherwise I will write it like a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I found that the rape scene is ruthless and unnecessary. But the actor who escaped at the end was quite good. But the sound effects of the shooting are quite poor. There are some mistakes in this movie. (Continuation) But they overlooked the low ability of the movie. <br /> <br /> All I like is this movie because Arnold Vosloo is there. <br /> <br /> Jackie
