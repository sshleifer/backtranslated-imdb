Gave the worst movie I have ever seen I think nothing can get rid of the Last Action Hero, but it's easy to do. This film is about 3 single men who met on Sunday to discuss sexual escape from the weekend. The fourth man - married - who had been part of the group, appeared and talked. About what he and his wife do Nothing works in this movie. Jokes are not a joke. But they will repeat throughout the movie The big players at the end of the movie are laughable. Avoid all costs.
