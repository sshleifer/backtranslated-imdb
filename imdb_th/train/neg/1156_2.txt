Seeing tenants is an interesting experience for me. It was the first movie I ever saw that I had disabled it with speed through various parts of the action (not) - and normally I can watch anything from boring action movies to Serbo- Croat Indie /> The tenant is too sluggish. One of the main problems of the script is that there is a slightly realistic character dialogue, in addition to the set scene in which the characters 'collide' in a very structured structure. (In order for this film to require more ideas) this leads to a lack of realistic character development; Everyone seems to be two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The worse thing for this is the character of Bill Spear, also known as Snoop Dogg. I find his style uncomfortable and not very sympathetic. At one point, I stopped the film because I was annoyed by the aggressive characters and trumpeting the lack of other personality styles besides the conservative "top" switch. (Which is actually predictable after a while) and I really want to have him qualified for redemption However, one reason for this jar may be the ambiguous time of this film (about 70 years, it feels and looks very fast since early). If it gets fixed more safely in the 70s, his character may Will be easier to understand. <br /> <br /> The film's light is also awkward. The soundtrack tries to provide an atmosphere that is a mix of jazz music that doesn't come out, mostly because the scene is too bright. <br /> <br /> The tenant for me is Unbelievable movie It does not describe the real person or offers interesting ideas about the ethnicity, identity or life of the writer, whether white or black. <br /> <br /> Strange, I feel like this project requires David Lynch; His creepy and disgusting looks should make both actors and screenplays become quite remarkable.
