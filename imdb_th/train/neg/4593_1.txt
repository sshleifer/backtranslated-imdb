As a physics student, I realized a lot of stupid professors and other experts called in this field. I learned more about actual physics experiments and about people doing the right thing. <br /> <br /> Then my friend told me about "Physics movies" They want to see. I don't know anything. I'm excited by the hope that the information will be presented well. <br /> <br /> I have actually made quantum mechanics. This is not it. <br /> <br /> This movie begins with a preliminary assumption that anything that happens to the atom's particles can and will happen to you if you just opened your eyes. Think about it for a moment. <br /> <br /> Our body consists of small particles, about 10 ^ 30, that is one trillion million trillions! More than two "mysterious" quantum effects can have a 50% chance of completely canceling each other. When you add more particles to the mix, it is almost impossible to get large quantum results. To tell us to believe that this is the right assumption without a reason behind ... it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> My friend in physics and I count 3 facts during the making of the film. But they were presented in the most misleading manner I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can't say much about the nervous part of the movie because I don't have training on the way. O any doctor that it might seem a little more real this day remember my biology. But I can't speak. <br /> <br /> At least this movie has a ransom quality: dance peptides. (Or whatever, actually, they) scenes that will not destroy the most valuable plot that drives this movie But the main character goes to a wedding where she sees different personalities of all types "powered" by their peptides. * Then the movie cuts to the dance floor. Between the dancers sometimes surrounded by CG peptides and the CG scene is filled with dance peptides. At that point, the movie tries to tell us that we are "emotionally addicted", so we treat the song full of popular songs. <br /> <br /> This scene has been redeemed because anyone who can go through that scene and still perform this movie seriously ... Okay, you are the one who must. "Open your eyes"
