Reading my opinion about a house with screaming people, many people might think that I am 14 years old who thinks SCREAM is considered a "classic" horror. This is not the case when I was 30 years old and watching horror movies Almost all life But admitted that I was a child in the 80s who grew up from slasher / zombie / ghost / cannibal and others ... the type of horror movie - so I always like horror movies that are more graphic and faster Just like someone who can appreciate music, drawing, or in this case, movies - but not necessarily like them - I appreciate why some people enjoy this type of film ... I don't ...> <br /> The house that screams is a boring and boring movie about school for girls who are wayward. The tough lady of the school rules with a steel hand (Or whip in some cases ...) to keep the girl in line She has a small son that glides around and peek at the girl while bathing. (In the evening dress, not less than (?!?) ...) And at the same time, the girl disappeared from the school because they were victims of the murderer. Lurking about the university ... <br /> <br /> I can see why screaming houses are often compared to SUSPIRIA (which is a movie masterpiece in my opinion ...) in Terms of the atmosphere of My own school and the interaction between girls and their parents - but this movie is boring and worthless until I barely wake up. I am all "tension" and "suspense" in horror. Morale - but this movie is not for me. Fortunately, I didn't expect to have much in this movie, so I can't say I'm really disappointed - the house that screams just adds the fact that I personally don't like most horror movies. Which is older than 70. This is not a difficult and fast rule. But what I enjoyed seemed to be an exception rather than a "must see" for horror fans who enjoy more horrific and guided horror movies - but because I don't know too many fans of that type of content. I can't recommend this movie ... 4/10
