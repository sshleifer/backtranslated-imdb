I like to watch it and enjoy it. It's all the badness of the movie. I saw this film through the gratefulness of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have a DVD. If you flip to the other side of the DVD, they show real movies, so I give you a chance. Seriously, this is a grilled cheese. <br /> <br /> The show, special techniques and plot in general is wonderful and unrealistic. "She doesn't want the lungs," Crowe said. How can the head still speak, as it does not have a body, and Tom Servo said longing that "No, you have water!" The ending is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with K-Porn! I like "The Battle of the Cat" between the two dancers, "Meow" after the fight or whatever scenes are classic. So in some ways, this is a fun movie. I think for the horror fans you may enjoy it. For a good time, see the MSTK3 version. You will get good laughter. <br /> <br /> MST3K version: 10/10 Brain to die: 1/10
