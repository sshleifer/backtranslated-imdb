You don't expect much from the PRC image and there are rare exceptions - mostly from Edgar G. Ulmer and a few others by Joseph H. Lewis or Lew Landers - that's what you get: not much This "epic" story about the Nazis in Africa who tried to instigate the anti-British rebellion against Britain is not much different.
