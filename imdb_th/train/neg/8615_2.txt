This movie is terrible, outdated and stupid that I have time to watch until the end. I've seen this Rodney man in Natural Born Killers and I think he's funny like hell in it. But this movie is interesting. "Funnies" are not funny. Actors do not joke. Anything about it is not funny even in the distance. Don't waste your time doing this! The good thing about this is a beautiful wife :) and Molly Shannon that I'm sure she's trying her best. But the script is too bad That's why I scored "2" instead of "1" but it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
