I don't know if there will be a movie on my shelf for a while in Mill Creek Collection and one night I just decided to watch it. Although not expecting much When the credit started to roll, I was surprised to find that the film was created under Filmirage Filmirage, bringing a world that has an astounding smell like "Troll 2", "Ator the Invincible" and "Quest for the Mighty Sword". So I was forced to watch. <br /> <br /> When the movie begins The potential to be a good person, even if it is not original The gore scene may be improved if extended more often. But shortly after this movie, the pace started to drag and I found myself thinking "Okay, those who are killed better soon" or "Someone can mutate better" at the beginning of this drag when I have these ideas, although some people may have been killed or mutated. As stated, the blood and the effect is not very good. What makes matters worse is changing the scene to confuse. Example: The first Dr. Houseman will be at the zoo. He will then go back and kill some people. Finally he wakes up with a cold sweat on the bed - causing the person Watch asking "He is dreaming that he is at Zoo? "These transitional scenes are getting worse. <br /> <br /> I might try to say that the character development of Dr. Hausman is quite good. But at the end of the movie, that is when you 'see what doctors have changed, hope you laugh - which is actually the only reason to watch this movie at least once; This movie proceeds unintentionally, like a long joke. <br /> <br /> The set of um things Doctor Houseman becomes can still be seen in Joe D'Amato's "Quest for the Mighty Sword" in The same year. You must love Filmirage movies. They often use the same thing again!
