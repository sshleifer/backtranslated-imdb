I am walking through the collection of 50 classic horror movies and REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is one of the movies in the series. I'm watching them, along with the upcoming seven-year-old daughter, which makes this movie a lot of riots. Laugh. <br /> <br /> I have high hopes for the zombie revolution after watching the White Zombie. Is the precursor of zombies in the movie (think Clive Barker Serpent and Rainbow and James Bond's Live and Let Die, the funeral scene, not the Night of the Dead Dead) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, though The title will have the word "zombie" but it is a lot. The love triangle that involves anthropologist Armand Louque anthropologist who was killed by Claire Duval; Who will be his friend with Clifford Grayson? My daughter slept half way. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time decoding those people working for - allies or cores; But I guess it's not really important. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see Bela Lugosi in the credit for this film. But of course, that is his eyes (from the White Zombie) that acts as a mind control device for zombies.
