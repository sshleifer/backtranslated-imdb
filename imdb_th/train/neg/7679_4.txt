Snow White, which just came out in Locarno, where I had the opportunity to see it, of course, means a world-famous fairy tale. And it means coke Finally, the real snow of the Swiss Alps is also involved. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the names of the three sides are mentioned in this film. There are a lot of drugs at the scene and there is a girl with dark hair, pale - with a prince who has to go through all the problems to help her. <br /> <br /> But: not a fairy tale, it should be Is a real drama that is based in Zurich, Switzerland (according to Tagline). <br /> <br /> Technically, this movie is almost perfect. Unfortunately, the plot is weak, the visible dialogue, the most unrealistic scenery, and mixed performances do not increase to create accuracy. So, as an audience, I'm still not being touched. <br /> <br /> And then there is a clich√© that makes me crazy one by one: Snow White is a rich and spoiled daughter, of course, father. Her mother was divorced. Never getting enough love from them because they are constantly busy While her best girlfriend has a loving and caring parents, they (the blacksmith and the housewife) live in a poor and happy small flat - and don't know the situation in which their daughter comes in. A good guy (= Prince) is a musician (!) From the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Which is considered a less successful economy He had problems with his parents. They are immigrants from Spain who do not seem to accept his way of life - until his father was seriously ill and confessed to admiring his son from the hospital bed. <br /> <br /> So he went on: naturally, the merchants The brutal narcotics, the heartless banker, the club owner is Playboy and the photographer, although the woman (!) Has a career in mind when she reveals Snow White in pornography in art. <br /> <br /> This review is not remembered. As There must be a spoiler so that you add these parts to the plot clearly. As I like Samir's other movies like "Forget Baghdad", I'm quite disappointed. Hope to be again
