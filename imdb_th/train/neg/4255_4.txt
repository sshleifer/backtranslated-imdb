This film opens with a beautiful woman in a tattered white dress that runs through a stereotypical Eastern European city. We know that she is being followed by something because she looks behind her. And soon we saw that she was chased by a mysterious man in a black skirt Then we realized that the man was a vampire hunter. He actually followed her. But the look she reflects in the shop window ??? There are no identical twin vampires of yours! But unfortunately they both received <br /> <br /> After throwing with old hammer movies in the 60's and 70's (in the twin credits, will be identified as the twins of evil, of course are The name of the last installment in the karnstein trilogy of the hammer) The beautiful plot is dead. <br /> <br /> A little plot that is related to Dracula. (Convenient to change his appearance every time he was born, so the manufacturer doesn't 'not have to create the same dracula). Come to the morgue, the medical student realizes that he is dead and is thinking .... wow What opportunities? Maybe I don't care about those movies that say vampire blood has become a vampire. And use the blood of the vampires to find a cure for the illness of a jerk friend Obviously this was a mistake and everyone became a vampire. <br /> <br /> A new concept, but was pulled out badly. The movie continues to create a wonderful situation and refuses to do anything to them. <br /> <br /> For example, a medical student tries to make Drac come back to life again by placing him in a bath filled. With blood in a quiet country, the mansion. The house itself is scary enough to be the center of the movie. But are we there? No, because they decided to take the vampire to the abandoned pool, sigh. This movie has a real problem with "homages" as I mentioned before the opening scene is straight from the hammer and the scene in this house is suitable. For a movie like a hammer But this movie changed gear and transformed into a medical horror movie. <br /> <br /> The other problem is that they introduce many characters that are almost impossible to feel sorry for them. There are medical students and friends sitting in their wheelchairs, tied to "friends", all professors, students: arrogant, boring, money hungry and stupid. The way they made every medical school surprised me, except that the medical school had to find a large muscle / big breast quota. And there are vampire hunters that are still mysterious in the movie Hey i can respect But it would be nice if they didn't set up like a movie would be about him Then you have a police priest and a random type of science. A lot of people have been suggested and quickly forgotten until they want that person to save the whole day or jump out for fear of being cheap and becoming boring quickly. <br /> <br /> In general This is a lazy movie. Not really afraid, just afraid of jumping a few guesses. The settings for these things are very complicated. For the examp le the tub is full of blood. It is clear that drac will emerge from the dark blood. And we still have to wait too long to reach the inevitable fear After this, he killed one of the idiots and a big breasted medical student. We all know that she is going to become one of death. But what do others do? Buried her in a shallow grave near the house Sigh to let you know who will jump out to you when the police appear at home .......... <br /> <br /> Oh, well <br /> <br /> Maybe Someone Will be given a hint that it is impossible to create a scary vampire movie and go into the atmosphere and we will end up with the whole movie as good as the opening scene. <br /> <br />
