This may be a good option for "The Worst Flick Ever". Perhaps without John Hurt, it may be accepted as a child. Of the screen makes myself less in this story .... I give two points because Mr. Hurt shows up ... because he doesn't run fast enough As far as the rest of the actors, they are just awesome. Janine Turner is as beautiful as she is able to save her life. And the lead actor is AWFUL. If you can make yourself embarrassed, please do so It's terrible. It almost hurts.
