I can't believe that I spent $ 14.00 on this. The only redemption quality is gore. The voice overs are worse than I've ever experienced. It seems that it is taken with a VHS camcorder. I think everyone pfennig spends time with special effects because there are lots of blood and body parts everywhere. Is one of the worst movies I've ever seen But I have to accept the rich blood that is not as disgusting as it should be because this movie is both stupid and unbelievable.
