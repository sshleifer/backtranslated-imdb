When I saw that IMDb users rated the movie at a minimum of 250 stories, I thought it was too harsh. But I know that the low score is absolutely correct. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the Wayans. I love their Scary Movie 2 and still enjoy the White Chicks. The little man has a little laugh. Much of that joke is not boring. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the joke will revolve around a dwarf player Marlon Wayans who has just been released from prison. He and his partner Tracy Morgan stole the diamond which was intended for the gangster. Everything went wrong and the dwarves had to put the diamonds and the unsuspecting pair played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington in order to bring the diamonds back. The dwarves pretended to be babies left on the unsuspecting pair of doors. Of course he came in and the drama started searching for diamonds. <br /> <br /> The film has actors and actors from Saturday Night Live, such as Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider, as well as In Living Color. Can help the bad script and jokes that are not funny. <br /> <br /> The special technique that makes Marlon Wayans look like a dwarf is ok. I mean, it's 100% unbelievable, but it's okay ... nothing good. I just hope that Wayans brothers will try to develop a chapter that has a better joke, trying to make their poor plays have a cameo. From famous actors and comedians <br /> <br /> Waiting for a call or television, it's not worth the amount of money.
