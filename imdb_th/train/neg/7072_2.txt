This movie must be the worst movie ever aimed at children. The performance is terrible. Humor doesn't exist. The Direction is the worst thing I've ever seen & special effects won't appear in Disney movies in the year. 1950 <br /> <br /> What happened to DEE-WALLACE STONE! Which was once a promising career in the 1980s.
