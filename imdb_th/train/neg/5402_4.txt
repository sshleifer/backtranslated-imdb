This film is unbelievable - all evidence is two layers; The fact that serial killers (Vampires or other things) can fly around without being killed and killing as many people as this movie means laughing. Vampires themselves will not look out of place in Bela Lugosi's movie. Most performances are woodwork, so actors should be treated to dry rot. I waited for somebody to make a good movie from the Steven King novel (except for Stand by Me). "Special" effects, bad actors This movie is cheap, tacky and fails in everything that is trying to do.
