At one point, Violet (Lucy Liu) told Neil (Cillian Murphy) why she was constantly adventurous. She said, "Because I'm so bored." That means she can't really do anything about her life by doing. Necessary activities I think her reasoning and the way this movie is so ridiculous is because "watching the detective" is boring. <br /> <br /> Are these characters exciting? Neil is a person who has a very small video rental shop. He and other friends often travel around the shop and watch movies together while discussing them afterwards. But Neil's life changed completely when Violet entered his shop. She is a unorthodox woman who hides a little secret from him. However, after the day they decided to see each other The problem is that Violet is a prank on Neil and can't do anything normal, while Neil is the opposite of her. The question is: do they have to have love at the end? You bet on <br /> <br /> "Watching the detective" is a romantic comedy that is the essence of it. And they make it the worst by pretending to be something else From the first few settings, we know that Neil is a relaxed person who doesn't do anything. Then Violet entered the scene, looked strange and annoying, so at this point we all knew that we were going to sit, even if all the meaningless situations to find that they would end up in the end. Is it worth it to wait? I'll say no. <br /> <br /> As I said, they try to give more to the audience. "Watching the detective" is trying to talk about commitment. To observe how far people have reached what they want We know in the end what the warp that Violet has done is all the tests that Neil is ready to win her heart. (Or whatever) I think it's really disgusting. This movie will end quickly if Neil says to himself "Forget it, that girl is one of the nutjob!" "The Wind That Made Barley" and "Breakfast on Pluto" by Neil Jordan Murphy created a movie with one of the comedies, Broken Lizard Paul Soter. In general, he was not bad (as usual), but a talented actor like him should not waste time on this movie. On the other hand, Lucy Liu is very scary like Violet. Her performance is messy. I mean, it's all over, and many more. Tony Montana is proud. <br /> <br /> The last mistake. But at the end of the movie, it was a completely unrelated name You cannot connect the point between the plot and its name. And you will think that it has no reason at all In brief "Watching Detective" is a delightful thing if the unforgettable animations that you may have the opportunity to capture on cable TV so quickly that you can't imagine. <br /> <br /> BloodyMonday score: 1.5 / 4
