It's a very scary junk !!! All of these people who are sobbing about this goodness? Yes, it is "arty"; And yes it is "foreign" but .... not enough. The plot is boring and disjointed like a reality show But didn't make it slippery. <br /> <br /> People are not interesting. But as a character, they have not enough depth to feel sympathy for them. If they are based on real people, I feel very sorry. <br /> <br /> Violence (and some people are very violent) seems to be quite exaggerated and not worth having. It's like the manufacturer has a vision of being a Quenton Tarantino. Not that I think he is a lot. <br /> <br /> And oh yes: If I have a neighbor like this, I'll move!
