LUNPOON'S CLASS REUNION is a failure when it is launched. Not so long in my big city cinema. Why? Because it's terrible !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not bad in a good way. But not good in a painfully painful way Most actors are not known before and are still unknown after turkey. <br /> <br /> The idea is really wonderful. <br /> <br /> Just avoid "funny" this time. More valuable than using a fraction of a second to see this embarrassing mistake
