Andrewjlau I do not agree more My girlfriend is watching now and I found this movie scary. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend. Laughing: "They do everything for men!" <br /> <br /> I found that these women had no violence, no sense of fighting between tragedy and identity and men. These are hardly worth fighting for. During the dance scene that Zhang Xi Yi won, they looked more stupid than men. <br /> <br /> Japanese people are more violent than Chinese people and being geisha is Japanese culture. I'm sure Chinese people have something similar. But the face doesn't match the main thing. <br /> <br /> The conversation is merciless. If Europeans do it with Europeans, they will probably do better. <br /> <br /> I have to add: It seems that most people who like this movie are Americans. Sorry to say But not surprising All spellings for you are not instincts, not passionate. I think Chinese actors are cute. But I can't say that they are good actors in this movie. Yes, the movie is great. But actually I can't see that these characters are complex and deep. <br /> <br /> I'll go to Japan to see the real thing. I'm sure it will be amazing to see.
