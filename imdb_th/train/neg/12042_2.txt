Confession of having a dream about Brad Pitt is a rather difficult acceptance for heterosexuals. But what can I tell you? May be a famous special thing that everyone talks about and makes as a star It crossed that wall It draws you into the sensual and unknown emotions. Brando has Montgomery Clift shovel, Gary Cooper, James Dean. Of course, and recently, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave But Brad Pitt has set a new concept. He is the only reason to go outside, ride a car, find a garage, buy a popcorn ticket and go into the theater to see "Troy" if you like poetry in style. "Jupiter's Darling" You may enjoy it. But if you don't, we want Brad Pitt to do business.
