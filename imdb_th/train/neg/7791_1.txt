I have seen a German version that is not the original dub, and I was surprised that this movie was really bad. I think I've seen bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and nothing to prepare me for this! It is really painful to sit and flick because there is no plot. A good performance and even special effects are unbelievable, especially the zombies, called dressing, are nothing more than white clothes. Their good dress will not be destroyed by the tomato sauce and orange jam. <br /> <br /> If you want to spend 90 minutes in your life, try it. For others, don't do it because you will Must be sorry!
