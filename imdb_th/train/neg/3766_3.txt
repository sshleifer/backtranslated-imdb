I went to see this movie because I knew it wouldn't be great. But what I see is a great word I didn't intend to show violence. It was just a movie that was terrible. Overall, it's terrible. I mean special effects. AWFUL The show isn't too bad. But not as well In my opinion, the best sasquatch movie is Harry and the Hendersons. It's not violence or horror. But it has the best expression of the sasquatch. At least it is a suit and not a half CGI. Watch this movie only when you are desperate or see the value of everyone in the movie. Or going to see the boondock saints, it is much better
