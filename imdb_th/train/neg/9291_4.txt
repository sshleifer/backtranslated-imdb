I can't believe that there is no official review for this movie, warning people that there are two sexual assault scenes. As if our culture accepts this kind of behavior as sexual, but not serious. My biggest problem with this film is that it seems that it is not condemned by these intimidations - while women who are hurt and right Repeated pressures never hold men responsible for their actions and no one else. One man stopped the attack when someone threw a dagger at him. But he scolded that "You can't force a woman to love you more" "You should not force a woman to sexually jerk you ..." From a woman's perspective, this movie is worse. It is "throwing bones" for women in Letting them be both fighters and skilled leaders But this movie is determined by love - which is characterized by the idea that human sex must be related to the imbalance of power. Women they love This amazing martial arts fighter doesn't use any of her fighting skills to try to protect her attackers. She never made them apologize - but it looks like she apologizes. Overall, it is a depressing and annoying movie with great movies and great fighting scenes. But not as good as the hero in the long run
