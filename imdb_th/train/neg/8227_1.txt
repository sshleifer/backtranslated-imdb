I will keep it fast and sweet. Five girls are traveling home from a football game, deciding on a 'shortcut' that takes them along a deserted deserted road. Nothing but good things happened to them and they arrived safely. <br /> <br /> Okay, they don't. Soon they were hunted down by chickens who had severe psychological problems and what followed was 90 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> I hope not to see these actors in any movies. at all Their screaming screams caused me headaches and the script was written so badly that it included many repetitive phrases and ridiculous screams. In summary, one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot.
