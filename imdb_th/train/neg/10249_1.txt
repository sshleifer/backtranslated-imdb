What can I say about this movie besides "I can't see". I wait and wait and wait for what will happen. (Or whatever) and it doesn't come Looks amazing while two people walk around while setting up the most filler screen time recording in a single movie. what are they doing? Do they solve the mystery? Do they collect clues?

Some aliens want to return to the utopian world and are very happy that they want to explode the world. (I think they don't like to share wealth) I guess they have finished filming and have seen 35 minutes of work or art (junk!) And decided that they will allow the editing team to change into a documentary film 88 Minutes see the danger of yourself. It's not funny because it's terrible. It's terrible.
