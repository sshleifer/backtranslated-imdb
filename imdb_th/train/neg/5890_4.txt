This love movie is not bad. There are funny things going on here and there, and there are some memorable characters. <br /> <br /> However, the performance is not professional. While some scenes are very fun But some scenes are embarrassing In particular, I found that the "romantic" part of the story is not good. <br /> All <br /> I think it's worth to see if you like football and romantic comedy It's not a really bad movie and the ending feels great. Don't expect anything from ordinary things. Fair enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
