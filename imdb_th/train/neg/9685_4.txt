I do not know anything about you But I always felt at the 'ART' movie theater. The first 'art' movie I received was 'The Cook, The Thief, his wife and her lover' by Peter Greenaway, who sounded. My thoughts and creativity came out a lot. This film is the ultimate conflict, both beautiful and weird ... This is what 'Art cinema' about exploring intellectual ideas and bringing internal organs to the screen with the purpose of life, real life, can be like in the hospital, and the art displayed shows what it is. I love all types of movies. But especially those who entertain and have something to say, whether I agree with the posture or not ... <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 women" dry the clinic 'funny' at Father and son gather harem to fill their sexual fantasies. There is a short reference to Fellini in the movie, which is different from the recommended example. The main focus of this film is the relationship between 'intimacy' between father and son brought together after the death of the mother. In the first scene of this movie, the sadness of the father is believable. You can feel his pain. After that, what will happen to the standards of Greenaway, the gathering of harem, observations of love and death, and the flesh showing for the sake of meat ... Anyone can argue about this. But I feel that this movie is shallow And the idea that this may be a joke makes me dazed Most performances, if possible ... especially good are Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (although poor Mandy should take her clothes back). The thing that this movie can't live without is the story. interesting Other films that are very watchful. <br /> <br /> While full of intimate moments and occasional contraindications, "8 1/2 women" are cut and placed too much to hold. Can be said that art is too "funny" and too boring <br /> <br /> Save your money ... I recommend this movie as a sleep aid. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
