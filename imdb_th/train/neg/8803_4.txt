I love "Anchorman; The Legend of Ron Burgundy" and hope it's a joke. But not so Although some bits are excellent I think the Champ Kind athletes who show their love for Ron Burgundy in a car full of other members of the news team are hilarious. Not everyone is interested in him and he is louder and louder and eventually kisses Burgundy, which is not accepted as well. But overall, the story is not a gel. However, it was a lofty effort to salvage unused debris from the first film, including the whole story about some kind of terrorists in a country that is sometimes called "alarm clock" Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has a few songs. But basically this unused plot line has good reasons to not use it in the first movie. This disc special is quite good, with two of the best things to practice filming with improv, humor and criticism of Will Ferrell and "executive director" that Ferrell discovered in The first part is not part of the movie. Any shape or pattern turns out that he is "The guy" who walked into the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer It is a lovely joke and takes about 10 or 15 minutes.
