I am interested in seeing the movement, thinking that it may be a rough diamond. But the only thing I found was bad writing, horrible director Going for it looks unexciting and immature). Edits can be made by anyone with 2 VCRs and stock as a low budget video. I will say that it is not as easy as a small digital video. <br /> <br /> There is an easy way to edit a movie with what the director has, such as through editing, etc. But clearly he doesn't. interested There was a lot of effort in this movie, like a ham sandwich. It can make it better. But that means special work
