This movie reminds me of the movie A Mary-Kate and Ashley. Just think of the rich sister. I think even though Alysons will be more actors in this movie, Amanda michalka is ok. But sometimes Alysons does not perform well I think that after high school music, they need to find something better and this is not certain. The story is not good and I think they should have two other people playing Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a great Alyson Michalka fan and this movie doesn't make me like you more. I think they should definitely be sick to sing and watch this movie if you have nothing to do better. (Which sadly I didn't)
