From the many problems of this movie, the worst thing is continuity. And re-editing the VHS for college cable channels many years ago. I tried to figure out what happened. What seems to be happening is that they create movies that are longer, and then cut down to see how standard theater plays to fill every hole in the plot as we have it. About three hours of storytelling and character development - especially from the fact that the movies that we have are very slow. <br /> That shakes Halperins. What are you trying to do here? Their previous film, "White Zombie" is a low-level effort that succeeded in repeating the movie Monster Studios, the first generation of The Studios (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.) and stuck near the zombie legend. From popular magazines <br /> <br /> The zombie riots on the contrary seem to be intended to be a comparison symbol for the politics of modern warfare. This thing is not only But explaining the opening and changing of Dean Jagger's character is a megalomaniac, but it also explains why zombies don't do much in this movie unless they stand waiting to look scary and wait for their orders. Not just human beings that we love and hate in zombie movies. <br /> <br /> I am equal to everyone who doesn't like modern warfare and politics - but I think movies should be entertained before and after that. It's education and of course - movies about zombies should be about zombies. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it's one of the most bizarre movies in Hollywood history. But not that I can recommend even in the historical value
