This is the first movie that Guinea Pigs from Japan, and this is the worst story in my opinion. Many men have tortured girls for many days before finally killing her and at this point I will say that these movies are not real! They are horror movies that pretend to be as realistic as possible. <br /> <br /> The scene looks boring. But it is unrealistic in many cases. For example, when they kick the girl on the floor, we can clearly see that they kick and slap the floor near the woman! And how stupid it is! The sound effects are unrealistic and unreasonable. Other scenes include the intestines that are thrown at the girl, loud for hours, tearing the fingernails, worms placed on the wounds of the girl's body, eyes pierced and torn Lacking in scary details and things like that Movies that are critically ill and cruel and have no value or significance in film This first item is the most experienced and skilled guinea pig, although it is not as blood as the next part is the flower of flesh and blood that tries to be as shocking as possible. <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: Devil's experiment may be the worst thing I have ever seen and the closest thing that smells This is still a fake (n / t) uff. The only difference of the genuine "scent film" is that no one dies or is actually hurt in this movie. I can't recommend this to anyone because this is s **** and nasty. Those who consider it to be a great horror movie do not understand anything about the movie and its true meaning. I watched this as a curiosity. (Like the rest of the series) And now I know how important these junk are. They can only be used at impact levels and that is not the success of too many valuable movies. The Devil's Experiment may be the most ugly movie I've ever seen and Mermaid in Manhole (Guinea Pig 4) may be a movie. The most disgusting I've ever seen So these things are quite a lot in my book. But that's all they are
