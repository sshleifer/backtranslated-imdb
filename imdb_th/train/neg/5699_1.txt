Wow, this movie is very scary. I'm glad I didn't have to pay to watch this horror movie. It is like a history bean to drinking coke! Its example makes it look good. But it's really bad I would say that the idea sounds good, but it's really terrible. If you sit down and think about it, you will realize that it's not true. Come back on the day you thought they had everything to work with. It's not like Ben Franklin sat down one day and made a strange puzzle. It's completely ridiculous and you want to watch bad movies, all by watching this movie. All movies and horror stories, in fact, may be in the top 10 worst movies I've ever seen.
