The original sci-fi image is medium, slightly skirmish, but not much. The US nuclear powered submarine Jimmy Carter is on a mission deep under a thick frozen ice near the North Pole when attacked by a highly charged electric eel. A member of the team (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) thought that she had thought of ways to communicate with monsters. But did not receive many opportunities for vague reasons Also among the crew are: David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This movie would be better if the eels / monsters are not cartoons.
