My wife and I just finished this film and I came to IM to share opinions with auditors who found that the film was less satisfying. However, from the 10-page review, only a few words are negative. I feel that this movie is a terrifying concept and I want to warn people who are watching movies in the future. <br /> <br /> I accept. I accept. I get more inspiration in writing reviews. When I I don't like to watch movies more than before. Even so, that doesn't mean I have a bias towards not enjoying the movie. But I tend to find movies that I like more and more. <br /> <br /> Paris je t'aime is my most formidable movie. Have been seen for many years By using the "genius" concept and connecting large talents with a few short stories and short stories, making the movie become the worst in the world. It is an art for the benefit of art. But some things that 2 year olds can dream of and accomplish Providing independent director time in 5 minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of work even in the entertainment industry. Directors cannot write. Writers cannot be directed. (I would like to say that Clint Eastwood feels overwhelmed, but that's because he is the director. (Which doesn't work as well}) <br /> <br /> The things that end up on the screen are unreadable. The chaos of any unreasonable short story has not been completed in 5 minutes and overall I lost Paris. Why is it called Paris je t'aime when the title apropos is more than a cluster f * ck? There are only a few things that can be watched. The most noteworthy parts of Alfonso Cuar√≥n are everything. Everything will fall into confusion. The Coen brothers are fairly short, but can you name their movies that do not have a guitar scene? As if every director decided to do what he wanted and chose Paris as the place to do While we all love Paris, the company that is currently included, we feel bad about the fact that this movie is SUCKS. In fact, I think they put the director name on each shorts because The director saw how bad this movie was and decided to make sure they were blamed only 5 minutes seriously. Seriously, <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman is not a good actor. She is not the girl of your dreams that is going to be yours. Why is Maggie Gyllenhaal!? Are you a person who acts or just regurgitation from other movies? I'm watching Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), Elijah Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace) <br /> <br /> One last comment about the show: I gave twice. Glory to Nick Nolte for acting and look more humane than you have in an era or maybe again. Finding his summary on youtube because his 5 minutes are so fun. <br /> <br /> Writing short stories is very difficult and only a few authors have received it. I miss Ernst Hemingway, Raymond Carver. , F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Cheever, just to name a few It's more difficult than writing a full novel and only truly talented people can do this. The same can be said about short films. It seems that only one director will live in history. <br /> <br /> If you hold Paris as a gem to discover and reflect through your own lens with your own story. Enjoy this movie. Directors are not interested or lazy. In every situation, according to the time you read, this means you rent it. Praise that you didn't pay $ 10 per head in the cinema.
