The slasher's flick, which occurred in the early 1980s, had a curse which anyone who tried to make it dead Many years later, the film students tried to complete the film - including a serious curse again. A good idea for a movie, but 'Cut' is sad. It's another wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia doesn't have the best record in the world when talking about horror. '(1984) is a fool and out like' Holy Wing III '(1987), half of which are American movies already. For our attacks on horror jokes, 'Body Melt' (1993) is the best thing that has been forgotten. The problem of 'Cut' is that the creator tries to create a horror that is smart and satirical, a la 'Scream' (1996 ) But doesn't understand the type or thing that makes it work And although this sounds strange, I say this about slasher movies, but what 'Cut' really lacks is "heart". Of course, it follows the basic "rules" set by 'Scream' but it doesn't need Play with the formula But it will go for a copy of the previous cardboard. <br /> <br /> The killer Scarman may be one of the most boring and harmless villains in horror film history. His endless barrage of clumsiness, a lame person, makes the pornographic dialogue look like Shakespeare. Actors do not seem to be fully involved and it seems that they are waiting for the filming to end so that they can collect their pay checks. And the feeling of this movie is like it is intended to try not to be creepy Look like the episode 'Neighborhood' or 'Heartbreak High', those efforts in the form of MTV, hyper movies during "research", just look lame, outdated and out of place. <br /> <br /> If Australia had the opportunity to do horror stories Morale again Hopefully we will continue.) Perhaps we should abandon the book 'Mad Max' (1979) instead of trying to copy the United States. We should try to do our own things.
