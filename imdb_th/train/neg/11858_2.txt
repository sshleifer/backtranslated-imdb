I am a big fan of Matthew Modine, but this movie - which I stumbled upon in the cable - certainly not witty. I saw that the screenwriter and director were the same, so no one was nearby to check out her worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines and no original characters. Goldfish are the most sympathetic. It's a waste of talent in all performances. When considering how expensive filming in New York, I have to wonder how this happened first. And if you wonder why I watched it all, it happened after the movie I liked on the cable and I left while I was working at the computer It's not a very demanding picture!
