After watching the movie, the first question that arose in my mind was: Should this be irony? After reading the comments about the Doc Savage character and the cartoon series, I know that this movie doesn't mean satire. So the story tells us about the US-American Super-Doc that helped the South American country from evil. Sounds like a general matter But this thing comes in a way that is unrealistic until it becomes nonsense. Compulsory fighting shows the worst martial arts presentation I've ever seen. This film is interesting for film designers with a low budget as a bad example.
