Hmm, not true. It's not a really good movie. But it's not as bad as I thought I didn't feel that my rent was deducted and sometimes that's all you can ask for. The plot of this story is ok, nothing great or new. The performance is quite poor. But the actors are quite good The director can pass. But the effects are horrible, especially the werewolf effect in which the werewolf movie is a big problem. There are a number of nudity that for me is a pretty good thing. But it is not hot Overall, it's quite straightforward with video movies, not the worst movie I've ever seen, and if you're tired of these types of fans, try it. I'll look again. <br /> <br /> Bonus facts for horror. Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in some people) plays as a werewolf.
