Despicable Eva Longoria died on her wedding day when an angel's ice statue (without wings) fell from the back of the truck and killed her. Then she tried to break the relationship of her ex-girlfriend and his new girlfriend, who can see her. <br /> <br /> A movie that doesn't come. The original origin is not too bad, except that the character of Longoria shows hate and horror that she has drained fun from the movie. It's like your ears are cleaned with sandpaper. Being a fair Longoria, no matter who in the show or team is a problem But it is a very scary chapter It's really stupid.
