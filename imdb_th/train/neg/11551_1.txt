Seriously, there is nothing good about this shit festival. Randolph Scott is a homosexual man who lives with Cary Grant, his lover for twelve years. He is the most woody and boring person in the role. At least 57, he looks old. Too much for the romantic role, although it is not very important because Gels Russell looks much older than her in 31 years and she is very ugly because she is addicted to chronic alcohol and smoking Lee Marvin has a normal role. But not enough to collect this garbage Thank God that they no longer create the West. They just dated old movies that were racist with guns and charming murders. <br /> <br /> 0/10
