When I read the back of the DVD box, I think it sounds really interesting ... So ... I let my mother throw it into the movie in "4 for 20 dollars" at Blockbuster when we got home. And appeared in the movie ... Twenty minutes in there, we found ourselves facing each other as "This is terrible. Let's go do something else." I will accept a few lines from friends at the cafe, making us smile a little. But at least get some famous actors! Every time in the movie, if the performance is not good and the movie does not move slowly, painfully and seems really interesting, I can take it out and laugh a few times that it is over). But I can only do so much The crying scene looks like the actors are laughing appropriately. There is no delivery of their chapters ... The amateur doesn't come close to performing in this film. <br /> <br /> Everyone who comes here Said that this movie is a good thing to have some really good drugs while they are watching movies It's the most pointless thing I've ever seen. Do not watch or buy this movie !!!!!
