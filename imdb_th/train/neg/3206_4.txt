I was thrilled to hear that Cesar Montano decided to make a film in Cebu (not "dialects" of the Philippines, most of which are incorrectly referred to as Cebuano and Tagalog). I was very disappointed when I watched this movie. As Cebuano's Canadian guardian, I was optimistic about the revival of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this film. I am very excited to hear that it's not a stupid action movie or melodrama because Filipinos like this type of movie. But alas, I changed a little. <br /> <br /> Panaghoy acts as an ego trip for Cesar Montano. Of course, Montano plays the movie's hero. And when I say 'hero' I mean the most courtesy of etiquette His duty is to win the girl and bring the Bol-anons to victory against Japan. His character has no depth or complexity. He fits the hero The remaining characters are one dimension. They all fit in with their cookie cutter roles. <br /> <br /> I'm all for slow-motion / meditative movies, but this movie is just a slow movement. It doesn't meditate at all. Just because the movie is a theme, history, drama and slow motion does not make the movie better. <br /> <br /> Especially annoying is an American actor Philip Anthony. His acting is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If Montano wants to revive the Visayan film industry, he should think like this all the time. He said he wants to create a Visayan movie that can compete with Cannes and Toronto, etc. But this movie will be booed and mocked at the festival. In order to make the film Visayan into an important consciousness, he should make the movie at least to attract viewers, even if it means sacrificing quality. Obviously he didn't think or receive information about the type of movie that won in Cannes, so the movie that attracted the audience had to walk in at least one step. <br /> <br /> Now I'm scared. Then Visayan movies will not be created for a long time because of this film. If I told the Philippines that I wanted to see more of Visayan movies, I would definitely get an answer, such as "Visayans do not make good movies. You don't see Panaghoy Sa Suba?" Visayan movies and may be the only example that everyone today is likely to see. <br /> <br /> Examples of movies that focus not only on But moving slowly The movie Tagalog Blackout or David Lynch's The Straight Story. I hate to promote Tagalog because of endless and unfair promotion and pushing the non-Tagalog Filipino's neck. But in order to call spades like spades, I said that blackout is a good movie. These films are based on what Hitchcock calls 'pure cinema'. Images without words are used to convey stories. But I bent a little definition for the benefit of these two movies, which these films use without words to convey the mood of the movie. And they do very well. Panaghoy thinks that if they just take a panoramic view, they create emotions. <br /> <br /> And many Filipino movies that have a mother or grandmother dying? ??
