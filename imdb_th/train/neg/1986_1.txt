Must agree with other investigators. This must be the worst movie, let it be western that I have never seen before The acting of scary and pathetic conversations (Not particularly suitable for being in the 1800s) and oh I'm not talking about a battery pack that appears on the back of one of the characters I'm waiting for the boom mic to fall in the middle of the scene and the ending? At least I can say that it corresponds to the rest of the movie ... completely immense. And yes, there is a clich√© in every book, from walking slowly down the dusty road to laughter. "Remember when" the appointment when the main character died. Luckily I saw this on TV for free. Don't waste time.
