I remember this item since I was a child. I don't remember too much about it. There are only a few things about the character. For some reason, I remember that it was very intense. In addition, it was also early in the morning. In the PA, I finally looked after the web for a long time. At first, no less Criminey! This list is very scary. Apparently it was created to show children to play lazer tags and have a good time. The show opens with bhodi li telling his mother, "I'm not Christopher. My name is bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" Then we were forced to watch the kids play the lazer tag in "foot loose" Not just a short song, but a whole song. Ahhhhhhhhh, my brain hurts, just misses it. Oh yes, and as if I can't get worse, you can't even see the laser beam from their gun. It's like they're running to the song "loose feet", all later, after bhodi into space or wherever they have a crappy laser gun to fight Phil Collins "su-su-sudio" Ah, believe me, she doesn't want to. Know others What I can say ...... shadow light !!!!!!!!!!!
