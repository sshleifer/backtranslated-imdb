It's meaningless and it's terrible ... I think Hollywood has many movies like that ... You don't watch at all. People cut or eat what I should say ... It makes me sick! Oh God! Movies about people we don't know But feed yourself with humans! They have bla bla bla teeth ... not familiar? I can bet you see it in another movie. The actor is very good, but I think the situation is really bad. And I should say that Bradley Cooper is awesome ... he has a lot of talent ... actually, I say badly But I think because of the scary scenes ... Have you ever eaten the tongue? But in this movie, there is one person doing it! It's really bad ... Anyway, I think this movie will be very good if there are no humans to eat or cut the scary scenes ...
