A comedian about anemia, an unhappy relationship and seems to have happened to share as a woebegone housewife who gradually gets to know a fellow man hired to kill her by her husband Chazz Palminteri as a gun contractor. Adapted the screenplay from his own plays with the setting and conversations back and forth that drag the eyes and ears quickly The air of grief hung all over the project, and director Paul Masusky couldn't bring friends out of her perpetual fears. Despite all the great abilities (Including Robert De Niro as one of the producers) but "honest" is a hoax, without content about stories and characters that are not alive * 1/2 from ****
