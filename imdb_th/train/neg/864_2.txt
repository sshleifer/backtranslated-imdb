Although there are over 180 plays to choose from, this movie 'Succubus' is often called the best film by Jess Franco Heck. Even the legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang is considered 'Succubus' in his personal favorites. So maybe i But I think this is a very boring and confusing movie. Although this debut was great and showed that Janine Reynaud performed SM's performance on stage, everything went down from here. Unfortunately, Reynaud's character was the Maneater who eventually killed her lover in a trance. Some things, Franco has the right budget to work and spend time in good places, taking beautiful pictures and engaging musical scores. This ability is his greatest movie, of course, if it's not for the weak and unattractive stories. It should be psychedelic. But I would say that sophomoric is a better word to describe what is shown here. Half of the time, you have no clue what is going on or something that has been said for sure, so even though the short work time of 80 minutes seems to be long. Of course, this is not Franco's best movie. Follow me. I don't want to suggest that fans find slander. If you are looking for a superior Jesse Franco movie, try holding hands with 'Las Vampiras', 'The Orfuloff Dr. Orloff' or 'Female Vampire'.
