In every movie (And I'm a movie graduate if it's worth it to you) This is the worst movie I've ever seen I know that there may be someone worse than that. I haven't seen it yet. But I've seen this and this is the worst thing. Friends and I rent it one night because Denise Richards is on the cover. Talking about being a child and mentally retarded She was not checked! Her role is incredibly small! How can you do it on the cover!? IMDb is not listed in her film work. This movie is terrible. We wrote a little note to the video store when we returned and slipped into the box It reads something like "Please help your customers not have to watch this complete and bad movie!"
