Dieter Bohlen, Germany's famous songwriter and a little worthless pop music producer "You are my heart. You are my soul." Feeling the need to tell his story - and he decided to hire a ghost writer gracefully. The result is a funny book about his life. Very good or less, its fuzzy image He didn't deny that he was selfish. But the whole story is twisted to match his image. There was no word that he might beat his ex-wife and she ended up in the hospital. However, it was written in a funny style and was very successful after his appearance as a jury member of "American Idol" in German - especially his memorable comments. <br /> <br /> This should be the end of the story - really. In the television program that says "Idol" called "Deutschland sucht den Superstar" (DSDS, short), some people have to come up with the idea to make movies out of books The result is "Dieter-der Fil. m "<br /> <br /> I rarely see a movie that is trying to be funny and completely failed. There are no jokes that affect the issue. The voice and style of Naddel's talk made me nervous, even though Verona's voice could do more. Obviously, the gags are predictable and lengthy, destroying any motivation to watch this movie in a matter of minutes. The content of this film is a film adapted by a ghost writer based on Bohlen's ideal memories. They may use this freedom to do almost anything. It should be words. But they failed The story is not entirely interesting and the fact that Bohlen's background sound guarantees that this movie is nothing to slander. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that it will not be good for the release. the movie The probability that this will be rotten in some archives is quite high until recently when the DSDS season became a moderate success. With the help of "friendly" of Germany's largest yellow newspaper "BILD" and the hopeless situation for RTL television stations that will have something on the program while the show "Wetten dass ..." is working at Channel 2 Finally, this movie arrives on the TV. Unfortunately, <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a waste of time - there are better cartoons with fun and really interesting stories. br /> Then: 2/10
