I never really liked the movie Myra, but I appreciated that it pushed the Hollywood envelope at that time. Of course, Miss Welch's costume has become a distinctive image, although I have to wonder if many people who remember the picture really saw this movie and knew what it was - <br /> <br /> I watched Myra. The FMC for the past few years and do not think it will last more than a year ago. There is a segment about this story in comic books, cartoons, cartoons. Sexploitation The movie, which received the proper credit for placing such a large star in an outrageous work, however, this movie IMHO is too bitter to be too exaggerated to be a turner and busy trying. Scare until unable to alert, participate or entertain ---
