I have read the obvious reviews that you have to be a student in a very strict English school in 1960 in order to understand this. It may be true if that movie is out of date. <br /> <br /> ************* Alert Spoiler ************** ************************** The ending makes sense to all children at Against the government and against the company without having a better solution to not associate with the type of coal. Mad Max <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character may be able to go. The reason they went about this was not reasonable. Character development is not enough to explain why. What makes a group of innocent people should not explain or even imply There is a mention of war as the last creative expression, perhaps the only revelation that the characters in this movie have and it is unreasonable. <br /> <br /> The characters that go to the fun of murder are not. battle They just kill people. I think they may use all the explosives to bomb the place or at least the holy place at the end that will make them feel more symbolic <br /> <br /> TL But in reality they want It has no moral, symbolic truth or meaning. This movie shows the imagination of killing teachers and people in the "power" that makes you annoyed. <br /> <br /> If you think that rampant murder / school shooting is similar to Columbine technology Or Virginia is a reasonable and reasonable way Deal with the professors and institutions that you don't like. Then I think you will love this movie. If you are like me and you are trying to create life for yourself instead of being blind (Blindly in this movie) that opposes "the man", this film, children and boring youth. <br /> <br /> You can tell that in the absence of funding and the story seems to have a deficit interest. <br /> <br /> All of this is like a rough sketch of what might be a movie. Okay, but without any effort in dialogue, character development or morality. So it's just ... not good. <br /> <br /> If ... only me, I'll get two hours back.
