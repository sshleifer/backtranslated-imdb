what are you thinking? This movie! Every minute I became more bored. I try to watch the end because I hope that at least eventually will happen! But instead of that, I was amazed how the end was treated ... What about this "bogieman" blood? Why didn't he die? He is a blood man for God's sake! Boy who killed his stupid sister 15 years ago? Is psychiatric hospital immortal? This movie is an idiot that is fascinating ... It must be foolish. I will sell to some stupid people who will understand this stupid movie.
