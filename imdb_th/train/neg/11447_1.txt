Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen I'm ready to walk away after the first ten minutes. The only person who laughs in the theater is a tweeter. Don't understand me wrong. I like stupid movies as much as the next girl. But all the places of writing and humorous humor For me, it seems that they are going to go with the feeling. "Napoleon Dynamite" - a strange and random scene which leads to the cult audience But in the end it was forced to be uncomfortable and strange (And Sissy Space) Sign up for this awesome thing. /> <br /> Thank you for not paying me.
