This movie is very scary. It's boring Accepting all women, but he is ugly, overweight and looks like he was from the early 90's. <br /> <br /> Every character is away for a weekend to meet with friends Have seen the "main" men in the last 5 years The source and back then they were not really friends, "the" man of principle only known from his work with the women they had been at the bar. Now tell me that you are at risk of losing your job to spend the weekend at your cottage with people who are not your true friends. Because that's what he did at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with your lemon. I made the movie at home more scary. <br /> <br />
