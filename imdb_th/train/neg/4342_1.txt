I must say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. They have a good story to continue. But to make it worse First of all, all the actors are wrong. Van peeble (actor, shit, btw) and Puff Daddy come from ?? It looks like Carlito is coming from the hood and is really familiar with the fool. This movie didn't do "Carlitos Way". Any justice. I am very happy that the sequel "Carlito's Way" came out first if I could. Seeing this junk before, I would never have been given the opportunity from the Pacino version and the next. Pachino should also read this story, thinking that it is ridiculous and sequential. Instead, Carlito's Way: Rise to Power - 1 of 10 ways of Carlito - 9 out of 10
