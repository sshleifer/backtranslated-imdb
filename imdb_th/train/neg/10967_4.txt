Believe me, I like watching horror movies. I like science fiction movies I like independent movies And I like the low-budget B movies. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I like bad performances, scripts, stubbornness, strings, improbable situations and things I like. However, I don't like Christmas on Mars. <br /> <br /> It doesn't work for many levels, for all of the reasons listed earlier, and many others. Overtly And an allusion to the male penis in Freudian style. <br /> <br /> I believe this is nonsense. As opposed to trying to do different things I mean, every movie that takes years to create a movie But cannot maintain the level of consistency and focus on the needs of modern audiences. <br /> <br /> I hope that all the movies are just a dream or a hallucination. We see things that appear on the screen. <br /> <br /> About the only kindness I can show is that the image at the end is amazing. If this was used from the beginning instead of the end, it would have ended the movie in 2001 ... <br /> <br /> Not good that they didn't try. I just don't understand how important this story is to this movie. Is it a story? Of course it is impossible. Is it a character? I doubt it; I mean, I can live without knowing about Ed 15. Is it a conversation? Meaningless music? Perhaps, but more likely that the undefended ego of the employer needs to be rubbed. <br /> <br /> A much better effort has died on the cutting floor.
