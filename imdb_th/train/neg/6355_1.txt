I can't wait to watch this movie. About half way through the movie, I can't wait for it to end. All the actors (white) show their roles like Woody Allen, just saying "Say this ..." Then they talked about. Screen as if they were trying to imitate Woody Allen. It's very annoying We all know what Will Ferrell will say and he doesn't stumble on his words like Mr. Allen. The funny part of this movie is boring like a tragedy and never funny or even entertaining. I have to admit that I have never been a big fan of Woody Allen and this film has certainly not made me repent. I think his writing is not as good as his direction. This movie will go down as one of the worst movies I've ever seen in 10 stories.
