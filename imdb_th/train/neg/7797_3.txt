This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But I want to say that some criticisms I have heard have become irrelevant .. <br /> <br /> As far as pure filmmaking techniques are This director has the ability He is controlled by a limited budget and a VHS camera, but the actual editing, camera angles, camera movement, and the setting of the scene are quite professional. I've seen many movies that "director" is much worse. At least the scene flows in a way that is not confusing and he has a few smart images here and there. In addition, the scenery in the forest has a good atmosphere. There are many things you can do with a VHS camera, and he is doing very well in the technique. As far as the art of making merit The scene in which the camera moves down so that we can see the male urinating in the forest for 15 seconds is an example that indicates the art style of the entire movie. This is a pure trash ... all garbage. <br /> <br /> The right blood for the movie during this budget. Obviously it's fake. But there are many and it is strange .. <br /> <br /> I saw the US version by intentionally copying This is a good idea. (And it's the only thing that allows me to do it through movies) ... unfortunately there are too many, especially at the end It's worth the camp. It's hard to find a movie that is worse than this, and it's categorized as a unique category.
