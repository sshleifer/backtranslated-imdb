Many people think that this is a good movie. But I disagree with them At the beginning of the movie, the spaceship was crushed on Earth and some aliens fled from the spacecraft and he killed some people on the planet. But without reason In addition, it was in the dark forest. I didn't see anything on the screen. I could hear almost no sound. <br /> <br /> After a few days, the hunters came to Earth. But no one at all Signaling to him before that, he should not know what happened on earth. So there is a conflict. Eventually, the hunters found the principal of the alien and killed it without reason. He is not on this world, there is no business about what happened here. Finally, the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes. The summary is too short and cannot tell the investigators about the story clearly. <br /> <br /> In summary, I don't think this is a good movie
