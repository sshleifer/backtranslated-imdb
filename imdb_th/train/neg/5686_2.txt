Hello. This is my first review for the movie I saw. I have a problem doing this to tell everyone that this is the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. I felt that this film was created porous, which I would give some insight due to budget constraints in making movies. I felt like I was watching a terrible remake of the movie I saw. Which I agree with, there is a lot of graphics But I didn't like the movie that I saw. <br /> <br /> The scene where he took a hammer to the victim's head tied in a chair is The most annoying scene I have ever seen That scene lasted almost forever. In fact, it may be about 5 minutes, but still I want to know that I like horror movies and I will give credit if they are good. This director carried the ball and a group of people who had done this movie should think to the end before creating another one that is similar to this movie. One last note, haha ​​!! For everyone who enjoys watching animals BEATIN TO DEATH, LOTTING ROT, with women and children as well, and the five minute scene of someone hurling with a hammer Go with a movie, a higher budget, like seeing an example I do not believe that people will create movies like this. However, sorry for everyone who loves uwe boll and takes it to the heart. This is just my opinion in the movie.
