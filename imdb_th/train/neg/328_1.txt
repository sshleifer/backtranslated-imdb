I am a big fan of Adam Sandler and one day I watched the casting and the team on one of his DVDs and saw that 'Going to the board' and deciding to rent So I went out with my friends and rented it. We put it on and we were shocked to see Adam Sandler who hadn't reached adolescence. He looked as if he was 12 years old when this movie came out. I can't even watch this shit for 30 minutes. I didn't laugh, laugh or smile in this movie. Actually, the only time I smiled when I saw how scary this movie I can't believe how much he tried to make the audience laugh in this movie ... and it didn't work. Although seeing the horrible camera angles and hearing disgusting scripts But I know why I haven't heard this before ... because it sucks more than anything that has been sucked before. In my opinion, this movie is the worst movie ever created .... Ever!
