This is nonsense - apart from Australian friends who have criticized this review, I can't help. But I think others who have submitted criticism until now have been involved in the production of Elektra in ways that consider them kindly. Towards the movie so I didn't go with many expectations Still, I still find that Elektra feels incredibly bad. What makes me the most angry is the fact that there are many stories in this film that do not explain what makes you think. "What are the things that are related to this?" <br /> In addition, the behavior of the characters in this movie seems to be about. Random moments to suit the story and don't let me start a romantic story that is completely pointless. I still scratch my head about the fate of the character of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, which seems to be unexplained. <br /> <br /> If I can give glory to this movie Is a wonderful place where it was shot But otherwise, I received a little enjoyment from Elektra. I know that we should stop ignoring our imagination / action. But almost everything in this movie is impossible or confusing (Even according to the action movie standards) until I disappointed. <br /> <br /> At least Jennifer Garner looks very good.
