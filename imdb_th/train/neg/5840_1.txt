Well, then. I just watched shit-loaded movies - everything has different qualities. I'm not sure about what I want to check first. Then it hit me like a sack-a-rats: Rodentz warned people about Rodentz. This brutality has no stars and is boring. And it's about mutated mice that kill people ... really bad original "Food of God" or "Willard" Who? Those things are better and that doesn't say much ... <br /> <br /> ** Possible spoilers ** Okay, this is the story: Inna Laboratory, scientists and assistants. His brave man is experimenting with rats and labs. In a crappy neighborhood and crappy buildings and friends, brave assistants appeared drunk and everyone became food for rabid rats and almost everyone died. And oh yes, there is a giant rat that looks crappy. All there. In one sentence! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff !! I wish the difference! The moment that we all know that there is a giant rat, we all know that it will eventually die !! ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> This is the detail: <br /> <br /> Good. : <br /> <br /> - Well, I watch it for free. But for others ... hmmm no nothing good here. <br /> <br /> Don't hurt it. Can't help: <br /> <br /> - Hmm ... Well, the blood is good - the movie is very average. <br /> <br /> --CG is not as bad as it should be in some shots ... <br /> <br /> Not good: <br /> <br /> - .. and in the picture Other CGs look poorly priced. Look, if your movie has a low budget, you may not be able to rely on CG. Lessons that lead to the heart <br /> <br /> - The performance is not good. <br /> <br /> - The character is too much. Amazed - we have a clich√©s mistake and nobody can do it well. <br /> <br /> - Buobo is on the side of the house. <br /> <br /> - I've done it before - many times. <Br /> <br /> - Stupid story, just stupid. <br /> <br /> - I look like a fat man in a bad bear costume - that's funny - but not funny enough for the movie. <br /> <br /> - The dialogue is unrealistic and boring. <br /> <br /> - Every student, Chow is drinking tequila from a large milk jug - but they Seems not to get drunk for more than a few seconds. How to adhere to the continuity of people <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - This movie is not good. Just scary Worse than you might imagine It's not as bad as laughing as "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead". Now those movies are ridiculous. You can enjoy. <br /> <br /> A memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - The ending of a weak action movie with a hero and a bomb that doesn't get hurt. Because it doesn't feel like the rest of this cruelty - but still sucking. <br /> <br /> Acting: 2/10 Story: 1/10 Story: 1/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Movie: 4/10 Character Development: 0/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 4/10 Nude / Sex: 1/10 (I take care of my son from time to time in this movie, so I might miss. Violence / Blood: 4/10 Conversation: 2/10 Song: 1/10 (Average at that time) Writing: 1/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br / > Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 1/10 <br /> <br /> See only when you love horror-themed movies that are only mice and mice waiting. ... check that. Don't watch it. It's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
