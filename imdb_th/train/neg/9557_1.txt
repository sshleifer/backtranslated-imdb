I didn't expect high, and I have to admit that I'm not disappointed. This movie is so bad that I feel it is necessary to register an account at IMDb, just to warn others that they don't waste time. The story is terrible and you ask yourself throughout the story. Yes it can! Somehow, they manage to make the worst by every minute and you end up thinking "I want 1 hour 35 minutes to come back to me!" Some people have to pay for this! <br /> <br /> I dare you to find the worst movie in this story ... <br /> <br /> I don't have high expectations and I have to admit that I'm not disappointed.
