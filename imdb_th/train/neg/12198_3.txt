When growing up with the Beast Wars Transformers, I'm not familiar with the original Transformers, and now I've watched great movies, and now that I've seen old cartoons that have been based, I have to say that I like it. Original cartoons and live-action movies over Beast Wars. <br /> <br /> Not that I don't like the characters BW. I just think the characters like Optimus Prime are better than Primal Optimus. <br /> mean "Autobot transforms and spins out!" Sounds better than "MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!" The original Optimus Prime's voice also convinced me that he was a true commander rather than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> In addition to This Powermaster Optimus Prime is still more powerful than Optimal Optimus. Just watch on the web! <br /> <br /> Megatron, in the character BW, looks like a comical version of him that is more evil than in the original series. <br /> <br /> In addition to what is cool than a robot turns into an animal? robot Are vehicles and spaceships? Try watching the original Transformers every day through Beast Wars!
