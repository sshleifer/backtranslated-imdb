This movie is just an excuse for writers to create a movie from two failed scripts. <br /> <br /> Its character is just a compilation of characters with sad features or comical comics. Woody only that Allen can write Women like this because it's like looking into the mirror, so they will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't like this movie. But because there is no chase in the car and this movie does not have any fighting, there is also no gang leader or drug gang Not to mention the lack of snakes This movie has no snakes. Not my cup of tea and maybe not your ether, so think about what I said before you find yourself watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you look like a woman with a problem Weight matters and mcbeal partners are meant for you
