In 1993, "Visitor" was very popular in France. So the sequence is inevitable and unfortunately this sequence is in the worst order ever made. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that does not keep promises. Of course, it should tell the story alone. Jean Reno must go in the twentieth century and bring Christian Clavier back in the Middle Ages, so that the normal time can follow the course. The problem is that Clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century and makes He returned in the Middle Ages. Middles was quite difficult ... instead of this, the film went on many things without success. Sometimes it becomes a messy head, sometimes messy. <br /> <br /> But the film still suffers from almost all actors. Reno and Clavier fall into a trap, however they can be avoided in the movie. The first story: They are going up to the top and become annoying. So why did the filmmaker Jean-Marie Poiré play a role with Muriel Robin in the main role of women? He made a mistake because she looked uncomfortable and very poor. Other actors are not better: Marie-Anne Chazel does not exist and Christian Bujeau can't stand. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie contains a good time with powerful jokes. Some sequences and dialogs are affected. It also appears hollow because Poiré brings back the elements which guarantee the success of the first film. So the girl, Parano, is a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding. <br /> <br /> Follow and work disappointing. However, this movie has a commercial interest. <br /> <br />
