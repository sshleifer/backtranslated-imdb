So this man named George sat at home alone on his birthday when two women appeared. George's wife was in the hospital to look after their son, so when his wife was not there, George went up to take a shower of bubbles. It's not a great scene because it doesn't show anything. After that, the birthday boy woke up the next morning and the girl remained at his house. They made him a good breakfast. But George wasn't hungry George was not very happy and he tried to leave them. But when he returned home, the girl remained at his home. The girls have enough with old George and do not want to cook for them anymore. They both become important psychopaths and use George in their crazy game. I like girls who do what they want and confuse George's home. George is great for his two guests. When George says that he is a married man, he doesn't seem to truly mean. George looks like Tucker and Family Guy. I am two women all the time.
