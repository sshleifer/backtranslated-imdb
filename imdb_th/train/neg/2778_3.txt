This movie looks like everything will happen with a camera, movie sound, music set, good costume. But Gary Roll said! I don't know if it's a bad show or is a bad script. But will say that both of them Considering his casting role in this role, I found it difficult to take root for him, even to the end. I want him to die on the battlefield, or one of the swords / knives to sweep. <br /> <br /> Then, the fire for the king's plans to kill because the king had no dinner and had sex with him Queen? Rather lame and go to the extreme to kill her son? And then pushed her lover into a successful king? I see one or two threads here and there are bytes in the past. But all of the features presented are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I don't know Gary stretches from anything else. I read the opinions of other users about sound reproduction. But didn't think he was dubbed ... after that, he spoke English, was it really bad? The lines were read from the coroner's desk ... the flat line might be because he had no sound to cause <br /> <br /> In addition, I've watched it until the end, so this movie has "interest". At least it may be more if the script / line and selection gets more results. The scene crew and filming with a very good quality movie is what makes this movie above all else. Actors and stories are secondary. I gave 10 movie crews.
