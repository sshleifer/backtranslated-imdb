Movies that are more intelligent than film makers that are capable of producing This film turns and plans through the miriad plot, the story of the "surprise" that is trying hard to make the audience guessing the "plot" with the scene that they think will help. <br /> <br James Belushi pseudo-intellectual effort and just sleep walking through the movie Like other "actors", the story is quite stupid and tacky. Which in itself is not a crime But in the end, a distorted, boring and very boring planner. <br /> <br /> However, this film tries to create interest in the middle. In every house that looks lazy on a really boring day, but don't worry if you miss this story. <br /> <br /> Quite lame 4!
