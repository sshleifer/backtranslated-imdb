I think it might be a movie with actors including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrews. Maybe it looks worth it. Alas, I'm wrong. The most ridiculous nonsense from beginning to end. Merck acted in a cynical manner. I watched it twice and still didn't know what it was about. I felt that O'Toole was a Scottish castle player who had problems with drinks and liked playing childhood games with his sister (York). But other than that, your guess is also good. <br /> <br /> This film doesn't have any redemption feature. I can assume that the actor and the director were blackmailed to do something. Boring, unimaginable and hardened It is clearly a waste of time for talented actors and directors.
