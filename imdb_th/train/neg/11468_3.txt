I do not know who has thought that the orcas went to kill people and beat and destroy things for revenge. Orcas are not the most cold-blooded killer that this movie makes them become ... it's foolish. But I doubt very much that they know and understand concepts such as revenge. So I have to say that all I get from this movie is entertainment that it's something unusual. At least I enjoy it. Personally, I suggest going and watching the jaws if you want to watch a movie type. Animal-Killing-Humans But if you like me and want to laugh at things that are far from reality, I would say go ahead: D
