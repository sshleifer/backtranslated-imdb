The movie is not bad. But still not good Kirk Douglas was recently released, which received an offer from the mob, so decided to pull the job out. He recruited a member of the acrobatic faculty, Giuliano Gemma, to lose his organs. Douglas and Gemma soon found themselves being pursued by the Mafia, Gou, Romano, Napopo and were involved in a love triangle, true love for Douglas's girlfriend, director Michele Lupo. Fast and with at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence related to Puppo & Gemma. Although Italian production, most of the filming is done in Germany. Douglas is a normal, not just a bump in Giallo quickie Bolkan, which stands out for his excellent performance. The music is by Ennio Morricone and the film is Tonino Delli Colli, the great person who can work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini Leone)
