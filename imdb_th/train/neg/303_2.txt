It is impossible for me to consider this film objectively. Not that I didn't try your heart - but I sat down and I appeared in the VHS of my age and I watched the opening ... and suddenly I was five years old again and caught Care Bear and watched my own. Movies with open eyes and enthusiastic hearts <br /> <br /> I can honestly see that this movie is a combination of the embarrassing baby bizarre BIZARRE - mascara. And children, unimaginable animations But within my five years, go "Yay! Care Bears!" Every time I miss it, so - I just ask (unwillingly, carefully) recommend this movie for those who saw during childhood and can call great power Of nostalgia while watching (like me) or those who like ridicule Gen-X / Y-ers who deliberately search for bad / strange things (The category in which this movie ... is for sure) For those who are looking for interesting movies or useful family entertainment: You may want to look further.
