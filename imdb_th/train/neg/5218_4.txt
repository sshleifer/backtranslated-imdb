All elements for the bad night of the movie are in place: a conversation full of biological techno, chintzy babbling, balsa-wood performances, scary Casio scores, late-80s and the overall appearance that suggests nothing. In the Sci-Fi Channel programming schedule, around 1993, although "Metamorphosis" begins with a large number of promises But this film reveals the stupidity and MST3K thinking, while Clark Kent scrambled by Peter's doctor. His secret project But when he tested his vague experiments with himself, he transformed into a clearly defined creature. (Which is more than a passage similar to 'Dr. Freudstein' from "House by the Cemetery"). FX work is quite good for production with low budget clearly. (Although I suspect that most are in the shadows for a reason), but overall "Metamorphosis" makes your back feeling bad even with hope. To sway us otherwise I can't help but agree with the closing words of one character: "(It is) a nightmare ... from the past!"
