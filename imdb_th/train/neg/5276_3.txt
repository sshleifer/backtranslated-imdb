No, this isn't about fairy tales, with fairy pumpkin coaches and glass slippers. But if I will do so thoroughly, I will have to make a loss that will not make you But don't let curiosity get better from you because this movie is not great. It was one of the movies that started brightly before betraying the audience with scare tactics and incoherent stories. And it is a real horror story. <br /> <br /> Yoon Hee (with Ji Won) and Hyunsoo (Shin Se Kyung) are your ideal mother and daughter. One plastic surgeon succeeded while the other was a teenage daughter who followed your obedience and beauty. Their relationship is like a glove on their hands, so you should think of them as brothers and sisters more than parents and children. But things are wrong (not always) when Hyun-soo's friends, Yoon-hee, start to start. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a warning for the audience and for those who Korean women who do not measure the eyelids when under the knife, if believed to have reported The only horrible moment is those scenes in plastic surgery. In any way, I think Kim Ki-duk's time has more blood when there is a story and explaining what happened during surgery. <br /> <br /> It's about The two and a half fists are an attempt to shock the audience with the standard dreaded tactics that I have accepted that have come to me now. However, in the second half of the year, the film became a matter of unconscious mumbo-jumbo melodies. Some things did not make sense, and while always trying to explain, you might not buy, not a horror movie that has a reason to start. Ton <br /> <br /> The opportunities for sales are beautiful and There is a lack of differences in the appearance of men in addition to minor police roles. But wait, I'm not complaining even though the story has been greatly improved. I would recommend you to watch this thing only if you are a big fan of ordinary Korean horror movies in VCD. Be careful of those moments.
