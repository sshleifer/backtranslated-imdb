<br /> <br /> Tomato killer attack is "Parody" of a bad monster movie that ended up worse than the movie that forged a story (very little) telling the tomato against those who treat them badly In general, they rotate and growl. (Yes, they roared) And the next thing you know, the person that is covered with tomato sauce. The actors do not have a name that has never been created after this movie, so there is no point to name them. There is a man hired by the government trying to stop the threat of tomatoes. He came with a black man who was the head of disguise and women and men who dive. However, there is another woman who espionage the first guy working for the government. If this is not reasonable for you, you understand This movie will not be very good at first. But it still lacks the fun of laughing in a stupid assault But it was really hurt in what was an entertainment movie (reasonable) until one point, a giant tomato wax "sliding" on a piece of wood without wheels with wheels! Maybe I recommend this movie if it is worth having a fun camp. But despite this lack of horror movies, 2/10
