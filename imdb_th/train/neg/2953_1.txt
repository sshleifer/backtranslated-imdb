These reviews claim that this movie is very bad. It's very good. This movie is not a bad pleasure. Leonard Episode 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli have those movies fun in horrors. But this dung-droppings are so painful. I've never had a lot of pain in watching bad movies since I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I started to review my story, listen to Theodore Rex for $ 35 million dollars. The New Line Cinema bust refused to put in. cinema They reduced the loss that was sent directly to the video, making it the most expensive direct-to-video movie in decades. Whoopi collapsed to be in this disaster after a big examination. <br /> <br /> Synopsis : Millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can fire missiles in the sun which will kill humanity and start the ice age again. A female police officer named Katie Coltrane and a stupid dinosaur named Theodore Rex unite to stop him after the death of a pair of dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Plot for you at the beginning of the robbery movie. Movies of all mysteries So then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is really scary. Whoopi looks uncomfortable and tries to act with her performance. But is useless Theodore Rex is smooth, annoying and his mistaken behavior is thinner after five minutes on the screen. Most jokes revolve around him, threatening to bite people and smash people with his tail. (Accidentally and deliberately) I think Burglar is not good, but must use the back seat of Theodore Rex: the worst movie in Whoopi's career. <br /> <br /> Don't let anyone say this terrible thing. Bad enough to have fun I don't see that when I watch this movie All I saw was the wreck of a train written by people who admired the film Howard The Duck. The humor at that level and Theodore Rex looked like Barney's cousin. Pain from beginning to end
