"Over Her Dead Body" is mostly a very painful thing that I have struggled in my own seat without any difficulty for the actors. <br /> <br /> Eva Longoria proved that she couldn't hold the movie in This scary romantic story Funny and, moreover, she does not have funny rhythms. She is scary and scary, like a ghost that comes back to the world to prevent the mind from croaking from dating her fiancé. Paul Rudd's fiancé plays the role of drift and charm, while Lake Bell plays the psychic power of this film, whether it is an anemic energy. I felt the most regret for Bell because she seemed to have the ability to cartoon and work overtime in an attempt to make the material work. Unfortunately, she resisted the film that Jason Biggs couldn't bear, and she was dragged down with the remaining actors like Leo DiCaprio at the end of "Titanic". <br /> <br /> "Body Her dead "Actually I like me because of laziness and lack of effort. I started thinking about all the interesting projects that couldn't get money because a lot of money was used as a way to become ridiculous like this. Hollywood seriously thinks that this kind of movie is good enough? How stupid do they think that making movies is real? <br /> <br /> Grade: F
