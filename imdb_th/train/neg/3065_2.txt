This movie shows the time when it was created as much as the original. I think Which is really sad because the level is deeper than the original name 'Vanishing Point'. The original is very funny I'm sure it's not like that. But was originally filmed in the 1970s and was released in 1971. The real 'VANISHING POINT' was the end of the era that ended in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> In this remake, the anti-element All cultures are separated and make more PCs to try to reach a broader target group. "Purifying for your protection" <br /> <br /> The American Indian scene insertion is free and the concept of 'The noble purpose' for the journey is also negative. I'm glad I watched it But it makes me appreciate the original more The original is a classic and gold cult. This remake is awesome.
