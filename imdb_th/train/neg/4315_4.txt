The only good thing about this year's ceremony is that the winner is the winner. <br /> <br /> Although the ceremony itself is quite short But still quite boring I think it's time to look for new directors and producers for the show, which can really create new things. Clearly, they are trying to make the 'hip' program more attractive and attracting younger audiences. This year by letting Beyonce show and let P. Diddy and Prince show the category, giving Chris Rock as a presenter is another attempt to make a new ceremony and make it more interesting. It doesn't really work. <br /> <br /> Of course, Chris Rock is a funny person. But he is not a good presenter I really saw him as a person who had just talked to each other and from different categories. His presence is not as big as Billy Crystal. <br /> <br /> In addition, the prize distribution is quite stupid sometimes. Don't let everyone come to the stage. But the prize distribution in the theater is strange. <br /> <br /> Still, I can't remember being satisfied with the prize winner. There is no movie that truly sweeps away awards, as in the past few years, it has always been the case. What does it mean to be a good year for movies with many contestants? I do not think so I think most movies will be forgotten in 20 years from now, except "Million Dollar Baby" and "The Passion of the Christ". Of course, I disagree with every award given this year, like Caleb. Deschanel should have won the award for the best film, not that I didn't like Robert Richardson's work. He did some of the most amazing work for Oliver Stone, but I felt Deschanel deserved more awards. In addition, I would like to see Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win the best edit and John Debney for the best song. But oh well, there is no way that the Oscars can make everyone satisfied. Of course, I understand that. There will always be people complaining about the winners. <br /> <br /> It is also a joke to see that most awards presenters are more nervous than those who have been nominated and winners. Does the Prince speak the name of the nominee immediately? And what is Sean Penn's humor? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope they miss" Irons is the best present at night. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a very memorable performance. But with good winners <br /> <br /> 4/10
