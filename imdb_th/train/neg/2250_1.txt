Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) turns Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into a lounge singer as an overnight singer. Esther's star increased while John was depressed, thanks to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John made a self-destructive thing that destroyed the red-160-mile-per-hour highway in the desert. The best thing about this movie is music, especially "Evergreen". Barbra Streisand sings well. But you can't make you serious as a hot star when you are an existing star The first time she appeared singing in the back bar, she seemed to be a famous singer who was sleeping at night, unlike the struggling people who tried to start her singing career. She is confident and professional too. Her apartment looks like a front of "Apartment Living", not a perforated apartment that the struggling singer will live. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson Deal with self-centered-controlled rock star roles, such as ... well, like a singer trying to be an actor But without much acting ability The direction is stupid, slow and boring. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is not acting or lame or slow. It's me! After staring at the great hairstyle of Kristofferson's and Streisand for 2+ hours. Your eyes are painful.
