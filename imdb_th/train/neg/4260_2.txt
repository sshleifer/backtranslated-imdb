Yes, <br /> <br /> I spent an hour waiting for the movie patiently. It was horribly boring and mostly random riders around the hills. There was no clear direction. Then the hero came into the picture. Born as an Asian But when he grew up he became a white person Obviously white He was not close to passing to Asia. He looks like Justin Timberlake. It's very distracting and the story doesn't help anything. Pointless battle sequences and weak conversations It took one hour and forty-five minutes and at the end I tried to eat my face. I watched this because people at the video store that I work often asked me if this movie is good or not. Now I have the answer. It's like this: Ahem "No! God is not good! It is unbelievable! Do not do this to yourself! I would like to recommend another movie.
