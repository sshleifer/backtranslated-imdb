As a Danish, I am proud of a number of good Danish films that were produced a few years ago. It's a terrible shame. But the increasing quality makes most Danish film critics lose their sense of criticism In fact, it's so terrible that I don't trust the Danish film reviews anymore and because of this I stopped watching them in theaters. <br /> <br /> I know it's wrong to stop the development. This unfortunate One movie, so I emphasize that "Villa Paranoia" will be a terrible movie in every situation. The fact that it was hyped by critics just fueled my fire, indifferent to Danish movies. In addition, waiting until it comes out on the DVD can help very little with the insecure feeling of wasting time and money. <br /> <br /> Erik Clausen is a successful director with special abilities in Social realism in Copenhagen. I like "De Frigjorte" (1993) especially as an actor. He is always funny. But in general, he will have the same role in all his films, that is, working in dirty classes and fate, partly because he is dirty. But mostly because of society and self-redemption By doing something good for his community. <br /> <br /> This is the number one problem in "Villa Paranoia"; Clausen disengages himself as a chicken farmer, which is a break from the norm that he never succeeded in making It's trustworthy. <br /> <br /> It's much worse. However, this movie has to cause twists and turns and break the rules of storytelling so that the audience understands what's going on. For example, the movie opens with a very sad attempt to see the near-death experience of the main characters by using low budget effects and poor camera work. After that, the character told her best friend that she suddenly felt like wanting to throw herself out of the bridge. This is a symptom of all movies; There is little or no motivation for the character's actions and Clausen turns to the lowest form of communication. The motivating thing is to tell instead of at one point you have a character that speaks. Came out loud to a person who couldn't move in the way he felt because the script wouldn't allow him to express his feelings And later the voice was suddenly used, which may be later thought to convey the unrecognized feelings of the audience due to the improper conduct of the director. Fortunately, at this point, you are about an hour ago. Come about one of the characters to tell the story that is called alone. <br /> <br /> The performance, which is often a problem in Clausen's movie, concludes in a sad statement: SÃ¸ren Westerberg Bentsen, who claims to be a star, is the only contestant in Big Brother, not worse than many famous actors in the drama. <br /> <br /> I gave this with a score of 2 out of 10.
