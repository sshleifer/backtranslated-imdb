In what seems to be a typical movie mill about infidelity in the sixties (the period of "free-love" subtle), the creator of this film is a ridiculous scene. A little cherry is happily on top after finishing. In a short time I felt sympathetic to Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in life without the care of their difficult middle class, and I didn't feel Liev Shrieber. Interesting and able to see about this film is Diane Lane that has no upper part. This is a hint. It happened about 30 minutes in the movie. Fast forward and skip the rest.
