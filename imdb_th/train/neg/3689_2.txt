The main issue about the movie of Superstar in the next phase is the gap frequency between one movie and the next. As South India's famous movie star, he received the answers he received before Baba was great. <br /> <br /> From Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of movies he performed in Tamil as a hero In 11 years, there are only 11 stories that the rate of 1 per year. All these are very popular. He has pictures that many people think cannot be brought down easily. <br /> <br /> But after Padayappa (1999) he entered hibernation. His fans around the world, especially in South India, are ready. Will watch every movie along with their great celebrities So the Tamil film industry decided to come with Baba. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers think fans will use everything they perform with the Superstar. But this is clearly not effective in this movie. As usual, advertising from the media and expectations from the fans exceeds the limit. <br /> <br /> The image of Rajinikanth is totally damaged. The fans are crazy. The collection of movies doesn't go as expected. The reputation of the great people is reduced. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is positive about this movie is ARRehman's song. It is well known that Rehman has composed good songs for the worst movies. Such as Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, En Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu etc. I never thought that> <br /> You feel very depressed because this movie is not good. It is because of Superman's image. Star is down He spent five full years recovering in full with two movies that Chandramukhi and Sivaji gave and what they were looking for in a superstar for fans.
