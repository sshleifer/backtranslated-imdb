This movie is not funny - losing the great stars that seem to be stuck in their own stars until they forget. Just a moment shining in the light of John Kleise, as a hotel manager who likes to dress up, you almost fall out of the chair with a laughter of laughter when he dance Donna Summer's "Bad Girls" while wearing high heels The rest: Forget it!
