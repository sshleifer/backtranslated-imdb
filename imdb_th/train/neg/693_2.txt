((NB: Warning, spoilers like that!)) <br /> <br /> First of all, this is the flick of a teenager - the type of Spam-In-A-Cabin while Joe Bob Briggs is overbearing. You are looking for Roshambo. It is not like that and will not be like that. I was especially impressed with the thrust of movies, directing or acting. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this is not the first horror movie of Zuniga. It was when she first appeared in a movie theater, TV or Whatever For something worthwhile, be it Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon or Katherine Hepburn. <br /> <br /> Third, you have to give the scene a lame flick. Of course, it follows the content of the insulting formula of the genre: a girl who has or shows interest in sex is beef in the hoof and harvest time. Now <br /> <br /> except this person to chop to The sweet and sweet protagonist too! Now there is a normal Death Teen movie that has the courage to judge! Interestingly, this is the only screenplay for the ingenue Another One Hit Wonder, except that the word is too much credit. <br /> <br /> (Then again, this movie may have one of the highest percentages of a movie actor. The story in history from the actors who received nine credits Thirteen did not appear in the other three movies, appearing in another movie, with one producer, the other one. In addition to Zuniga, there were six credits. What was this movie and never shared the social contribution?) <Br /> <br /> I have been seeing this thing for a long time in the late night when I was bored and never expected to be bored in my life again. But I do not see the reason to hunt everyone involved and throw them in Incinerator with Joanne <br /> <br /> 2/10
