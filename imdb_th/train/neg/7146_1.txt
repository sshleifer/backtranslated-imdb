I just registered to comment. (Which is quite a partial echos of here). The show is worse than the subpar. It is described in a typical map form, with the worst performances of tasteless female objections And there are some of the most wonderful lines that people know. <br /> <br /> including but not limited to "Okay, let's see what these people can do." Feeling bad for the innocent and start hating the character Eddie Griffin's character is also one of the most bizarre black guy who just rubbed the wrong way. He may or may not be a good actor. But this movie does not allow the exploration of characters like that Do you want a movie that puts the audience beside the bad guy? Ocean 11. This movie makes you hate bad people instead of capturing the audience. <br /> <br /> Even cars can't compensate for the damage of this movie. Enzo at Griffin has collected the complete work of this film. It's terrible.
