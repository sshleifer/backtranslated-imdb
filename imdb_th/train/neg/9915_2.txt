I just finished "dark room" or known "Under supervision" and I was stunned. Shocking, not from movies. But with some crazy comments, I read that influenced my viewing. The story is destroyed by the plot hole and most of the show is flat, so the classification is funny, looks appropriate. Seriously, I found myself shaking my head and laughing in a daze while I was patient with this movie. <br /> <br /> Justin left home to live with her traumatized mother. With his police father, even mother Warning that father is not good When it was discovered that a young woman was killed, Justin became suspicious of the tenants who lived in an adjacent apartment. With the help of a close friend, he installed a hidden camera to track these people. While the truth began to unravel, Justin revealed an unexpected secret. <br /> <br /> One interesting point is that Felissa Rose is interesting! I'll slap one or two extra stars here if you peel off a bit. But without such luck It should be the saving grace of the movie. Eric Conley plays Justin as an expert. I think and I will not be surprised to see him in the future. <br /> <br /> The general location of the movie, even though it's full. Go with ancient ideas But it may be possible that it didn't happen because of the ridiculous performances of the main cast members of the cast, Alexandra Eitel (Kayla) and David H Rigg (Justin's father). Horror! (Forgive the players) <br /> <br /> I have nothing compared to movies with low budget. In fact, I believe that independent movies are our only hope of creating valuable movies in the future. I will cut the film with low price to look quite viscous when talking about special effects, lighting, music scores and overall image quality. However, I did not give allowances for the display of sticks and scripts of Swiss cheese lovers. There are many low budget movies that are made out well. Sadly, this is not one of them. I can't help but doubt that at least some of the critics who praised "Dark Chamber" are involved in production.
