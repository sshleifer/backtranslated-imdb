I will remind you here: I choose to believe those reviewers who say that this is not a normal action movie. But it's a psychological drama, so you should appreciate it on that basis and you will be fine. <br /> <br> I'm here to tell you that they are wrong. Completely wrong. <br /> <br /> Good, not incomplete. It's very frustrating if you're looking for action movies. They're right. But it is not desirable for every level as well. <br /> <br /> Tom Bringer is not too bad. I think it's not worse than usual. But what are they in the selection of Billy Zane in this story? Is it the death that is needed in the part of the manufacturer? How to make their movie is absolutely a failure? In this case, it works. <br /> <br /> If they really aim for success, why not choose someone who can show? Oh, and it's possible for script writers to know how to write. Ah, yes, and the director who knows how to direct <br /> <br /> As a person who is really busy with this story, he believes that he will redeem himself soon Unfortunately it's a good movie.
