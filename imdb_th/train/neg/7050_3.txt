Note to yourself - just because foreign movies are vague and the actor Catherine Zeta Jones doesn't mean it's good. As in the case of 'Blue Juice' in 1995, Brit flicked about a group of people who like to surf, which is unlikely to be possible in what seems like You might think that this is a quirky joke, if only. This film takes only ninety minutes. But seems to be endless The easiest way to explain that it's like the English version 'Grease' '90's without dancing. But even if it makes it sound better No, the best way to use it is like dividing a small part of life in a small town. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Chloe, a young woman who lives with a master of surfing. JC (Sean Pertwee, you remember him) Pertwee is a real movie star and his character is something that is a legend of surfing for a small group of surfers who need a free spirit to live. This In this case, it consists of a drug dealer who wants to be a former journalist, a nightclub DJ who wants to be a record producer and a stupid obese person who is in a scene that expands without needing to be thrown by a cube. stone Of course, that's the best thing that happened to him. I can not say everything that is happening in 'Blue Juice' frankly because it is in the place and reflects the customs and manners that I am not familiar with. But there is something surprising or interesting that happens or with the characters. However, comedy is predictable and very tired. One can touch the setting one mile away and almost recite the conversation. (In the form of America) before actors do The relationship between JC and Chloe is a small matter. She wants him to grow. He wants them to be with the teenagers they started to live with. He was afraid to lose his face with his gang; She thinks he likes them with her. You get the idea While I was trying to focus on 'Blue Juice' at the end, I felt that this speech was an hour and a half in my life. I wouldn't come back.
