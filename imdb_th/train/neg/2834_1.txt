Now I have watched all four Derek vehicles directed by her husband John; Of course, quite bad. But this is definitely a hole Subtitle, subtle, normal, bad script? By the director and the actors do not have to mention the nude without the cost of the stars. It involves loss. Anthony Quinn, her eldest husband (She admits suicide with his shotgun by saying In fact, he wants to come back again, a younger body. But actually only can do in the final scene! Derek is as cute as ever and still plays na√Øve (!) ?? Especially in the middle of a mess, which she pursued by a hired killer at the spa In general, Quinn is bigger than life (read: Hammi) here, but this is easily considered his lowest point. In addition, during most of the time, he shows from the back a shiny plastic sheet. (Presumably he is in the limbo area)! His 'replacement' is clearly a handsome group that doesn't have talent or personality. What is outstanding in this story is Hollywood veteran Don Murray. (As Quinn's close friend and business consultant) and Julie Newmar Including an astounding pendant look by millionaire Donald Trump (who wants this in his resume)! In addition, it is not said that John Derek is a filmmaker of his own. In this film, the credits at the end are filled with useless (and repetitive) expressions. At the 1990 Razzie Awards!
