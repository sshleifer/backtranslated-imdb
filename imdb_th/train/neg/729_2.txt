Before starting to watch the program, I have heard that it's great and interesting. It's a very stupid script that I'm quite sure that the author is the son and grandson of the writer Scoobidoo and the things about SFX and color. Overwrite and show exaggerated This show is like a bad pie that the kids only put on sugar and butter, thinking that because these ingredients are the best, they are enough. Unfortunately for this performance, the two ingredients of this program were finally empty and lacked all credibility.
