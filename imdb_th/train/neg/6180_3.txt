I joined one of the premiere last night and had the following observations: <br /> <br /> 1 Just because you directed a lot of music videos didn't make you qualified to create a movie. This film has many lingering images that are not reasonable, horrible angles and terrible light. The solution did not help solve this problem. When "Dixie" appeared slowly for the memorial service, her mother spoke of her hand. But it's not clear what the heck she said about <br /> <br /> 2 The story has a contract. But the script is thin and full of Ford Truck's big holes. We never understand what drives the character, what is behind the conflict they have with each other or what they fix. The sixteen-year distance was eliminated in 4 days with magic. The deep dialogue was destroyed by stupid ancient ideas. (In fact, the whole city is one of the ancient ideas of life in the south). Half of the audience wailed when Toby painted. "You put my blood flowing through your veins." And we received one uninteresting treatment! The revelations occurred, and the confession of the drama was boiled down to "I'm stupid and stubborn." <br /> <br /> 3 The performance is OK, considering the destruction of the script they have to work with. Toby is dark and contemplative. Most of the movies But when he smiled and lit up, he was charming It's a shame that he doesn't have more screen time. Kelly Preston's acting scene is quite rusty and it shows Lindsay Haun has the ability and of course not her fault that the author created her character different from the first episode that you do not blame for your father. Not coming to you Bert Reynolds and Tess Harper are able to create this movie more But still look more or less lost (And of course, their characters will get lost in this movie!) <br /> <br /> 4 If you're a Toby fan, you'll love this song. But often the movie feels like being forced into the scene so that they can present one of his songs - or the artist on his record label. For example, the love song of this movie is "Crash Here Tonight". You might think it will play in a gentle love scene but not ... We heard about 45 seconds while he was heading to the funeral. It's like they say "Okay, we have to use this song somewhere." "Broken" is haunted and the best thing to come out of this movie. <br /> <br /> In summary ... the plot The promise that has never been fully developed and the film is not very frightening. Vehicles for the musical position and products of Toby Keith for Ford Trucks. It is about people who have built a new broken bridge to try about the power of music. But the story has been told so badly that both of them disappeared in a music video that is too cluttered. I like Toby and want to like "Broken Bridges", but the person he intends to create this movie let him be disappointed and deserves his famous boots you know.
