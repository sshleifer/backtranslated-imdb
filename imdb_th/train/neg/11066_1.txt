Before watching "Dahmer", I thought there was no worse movie than "Freddy Got Fingered". I was wrong. To sum up, "Dahmer" came up. Kill and almost all consist of Dahmer's encounter with gay men before they are killed. There is no plot to be found and it has no purpose as far as telling us about "Dahmer". All you will learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he likes sex with men. Scary performances, horrible governance, scary writing, everything scary ... If you have to choose between watching "Dahmer" and vomiting for three hours with vomiting ... it will Less pain .....
