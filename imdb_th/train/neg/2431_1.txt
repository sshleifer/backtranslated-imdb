As a Turkish man in Sweden, I must confess. I often watch Scandinavian movies. Most if they I never understood I think the actors from Scandinavia work best in Hollywood. Last week I watched the movie "The Polish Wedding" along with my Polish friends and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched. Unfortunately, I was wrong. "The House of Angels" is even worse. There are no actors who can certainly do their duty, not a female star named Helen Bromstrom. The plot is so stupid that no one can believe it. I think that all things are messy from the beginning. Many bad performances except from Selldal and Wollter Ahmed Sellam
