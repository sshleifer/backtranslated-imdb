Animal Farm (1954) Read very well about the dangers of dictatorship. Good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who do not know or rule with an iron fist and an empty head. Sadly, this movie does not convey anything. What we show is a propaganda piece that has waved and pointed a lot. The animation and direction are good considering the budget and duration. But the essence of George Orwell's novel is gone. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who want to see how to adjust Novels or just interested in seeing the adaptation of this wonderful novel, by all means I just found this to be quite moderate. Just the opinion of a man. <br /> <br /> The remake is the bottom notch but not much.
