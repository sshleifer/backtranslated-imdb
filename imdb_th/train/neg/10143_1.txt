FLIGHT OF FURY is the best mantle that Steven Seagal, the most wicked thing I've ever seen ... Now <br /> <br /> It's so boring that there are no action scenes that are interesting. Seagal is not. Try to do this really. - He is fat. His voice is dubbed again. <br /> <br /> Co-stars are no better than this because it is a sad burden from the third appraiser. > <br /> Direction by Keusch is very poor and not surprising that he will be responsible for There are a few smells of Seagal (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE). The screenplay was co-written by Seagal himself, not laughing. <br /> <br /> IMDb $ 12M was spent with boring old burdens. This - if these numbers are correct, I can feel a great tax fiddle because there is no cost close to that amount. <br /> <br /> Michael Dudikoff's madness flight, BLACK THUNDER - will Must be better than this rag. <br /> <br /> This thing doesn't have you. Practice paying any give it a miss! 1/2 * from *****
