Recap: Full moon The big werewolf is hunting Not for the flesh, not for blood (Not that it is thought to be bitten on the way) but for friends He is hunting for women, whether girls, women, innocent women. (And being a werewolf, even though she doesn't know) (After the first scene) and the old woman, the bag is something that can stop it, or even know that the thing that killed and consumed a lot of people around the full moon is a werewolf. Darkwolf This powerful werewolf is approaching women. If he receives her, humanity is doomed. Now the police have to find a girl to convince her that someone is a werewolf who wants to rape her and may kill her. But she is a werewolf herself Then they have to stop him ... <br /> <br /> Comments: This is one for boys, teenagers. Many scenes with semi-nude girls are more or less important for the plot. Most are less I think you need something to fill in time because of the thin (expected) plot and unfortunately there are little girls besides to help the storyline from breaking. One often turns into two main themes: nudity, examination, special effects, hmm ... There are some things you might call an effect. They are not very special. In fact, to be blunt, they are not very good. It seems that this movie will suffer from lack of funds. They can't buy clothes for some women;) and cheap effects Some changes between the werewolf and the human body made by the computer are obviously bad. You may overlook things, but Darkwolf itself is a rude person, and you will never see killing. Only the remains that were damaged later And there is a little blood that is surprising about the movie that should be drenched with blood. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what to say about actors and characters. Most of the time they do well. Unfortunately, there was a stopping work as a character. (Or actors) just lose it Some of these losses can be connected to the problems mentioned above. Like a bad impact or a bad budget (?) That might explain why there is a slight shot, even though the character has a weapon like a small army and the target is easily visible. (And not moving) but hey, when you're really in danger, there's nothing that can save your life like a good airline ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can't explain the moment. Cop, Steve, only one person Those who know how to deal with werewolf problems are running away when the only thing he can be sure of is that the werewolf is coming to find the woman next to him right now and he can't. Let it have you But of course, it helps the creator to extend the end. <br /> <br /> But I don't mind seeing other actors / actresses try again in other movies. <br /> <br /> Well, if you want a short summary: it's not the movie I recommend. <br /> <br /> 3/10
