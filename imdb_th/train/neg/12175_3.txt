Why must check a good movie when you can check "Trancers II" <br /> <br /> Oh, this movie is lame. I can imagine actors and teams driving around LA with a video camera, adding to the excitement of making a stupid monster makeup at Tim Thomerson, a poor star family. It is because the full moon cannot afford the "real" extra money. Lame effects, lame sets and such complex scripts will take more than a year to unlock all the clues - this must be Trancers. Classic <br /> <br /> And yet ... and still ... it's a rule. Please note that this is the same thing I say about "Trancers IV". I say because it's true. Things that can beat the old man in the coat that is carved on the zombies and go out to look like "Do not worry about women, they are biodegradable"? There are many things that should be better. But still a good thing <br /> <br /> My only important reservation is Megan Ward, which is the beginning of the venture. She is a great rival for the character of Helen Hunt - both of them are small pieces of the eye, and it will be more effective if they compare a little more to the real thing. Oh you don't have everything At least the device's excellent plot "Long seconds clock" is back and we have the least reliable Hap Ashby athlete in the history of the movie. (Oh, wait a minute - he has a rival in the form of David Ogden Steirs in the "Creator") <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this recently, but I remember Martine Beswick running away. Times during the final battle Cheers for the continuation of the punch! Is one of many highlights in this great movie
