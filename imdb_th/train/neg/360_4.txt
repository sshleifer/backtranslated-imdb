I read the book and enjoyed it from start to finish. However, when I watched the movie, I was very disappointed. First, there is no disrespect to Deborah Raffin, but she is too mature to play 24/25. Christopher Reeve at the end is the same reason - according to this book, there will be about 30 years. His friends grew a little more, his friend Dang, Elly's journey to see him as an important part of the story development. In addition, Ms. Beasley also had a wrong idea when the book said she was a plus size woman. I know that this film doesn't have the budget of "Bridges Of Madison County" which I believe was released at the same time. <br /> <br /> But for me, this is a movie with a very low budget. As someone said, I hope Miss Spencer will retire and write a screenplay for her book as it should be. She knows that her character is better than anyone. I hope she will consider casting. The movie made me disappointed!
