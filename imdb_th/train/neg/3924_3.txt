The movie is terrifying and endless. It seems that director Bellocchio is enchanted by the face and shape of his actor Detmers and who can blame him. But sometimes he should pay attention to making good and interesting movies I hate when sex movies poses as "Art movies" in order to become more "respectable", hot and frequent sex scenes are the only reason for this film to exist. Whether they are worth it or not, having to sit and watch the rest of the picture is strictly a matter of taste. (*)
