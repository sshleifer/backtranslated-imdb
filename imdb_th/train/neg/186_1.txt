I don't know whether to laugh or cry in the misrepresentation of Canadian history, especially the damage to the history of the horse police in Yukon. <br /> <br /> I'll leave it with Pierre. Burton A historian born and raised in Dawson City, Yukon and the author of the clear history of the Klondike gold rush, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899, to express my exasperation with this stupid film. : <br /> <br /> The American concept of seclusion, which is controlled by each hero with a six-gun weapon, continues in The Far Country. Another story about the cowboy from the West of America.- Wyoming this time - drive cattle, cattle herds into the gold country The image is a nightmare of geographic impossibility. But the real disagreement is the main assumption that the plot will change? That there is only one policeman riding in Canada, Yukon, at the time of the gold rush, and he could not handle the lawlessness When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reached the Yukon border with their cows, the customs were empty. <br /> <br /> "Where is the police? Brennan asked <br /> <br /> "Up on the Pellie River. Problem with Chilkats" There are people who reply. He has a really difficult job. The police patrolled ten thousand or twenty thousand square miles. Sometimes he didn't go home two or three months at a time. "< br /> <br /> The historical truth is that the Yukon land is in the Gold is the closest thing to the state. The British North American police have seen it before. The northwest horse patrol is stationed in a large number of territories before the Klondike strike. They control every route to Yukon and they are not ridiculous. They collect customs duties more often than the arrival of newcomers, making arbitrary laws on the navigational point of the river and turning people back if they don't have enough supplies or if they don't look good. In typical Canada, they put moral rules for the community. In Dawson, God's Day Act is strictly observed. It is a crime that is punishable by your logging on Sunday; And the plump young woman was caught in what the dictator called "Let the theatrical performances in the theater" In general, nothing more than a significant dance on the stage in a very revealing stockings. <br /> <br /> In that community Guns, ammunition were not thought out. One of the famous bad guys from Tombstone, who tried to pack his hip-to-be weapons, was released by the police personally, who had just released him from the living room because of a terrible crime that spoke too loudly. The bad guys leave like lambs. But protested when the police discovered that he was carrying a gun, telling him to deliver it. "No one took a gun from me," the American said. "Okay, I take it," the police said softly and did so without further opposition. Many pistols were seized in Dawson that they were auctioned by the police for a small price and bought as souvenirs to keep on the shelf. In the year 1898, the great years of stampede were Not a serious crime or Let alone murder? In Dawson, the difference with Skagway on the American side is a lawless city run by Soapy Smith, a confident man in Denver, but in The Far Country Dawson is seen as a community without any laws which are Soapy Smith characters from Skagway ?? He was called Gannon in the form ?? Can be easily controlled (In real life, one of Smith's men who tried to cross the border had taken all of his equipment and had been frogged back again by the police sergeant installed.) <br /> <br /> {In the movie, Mount Alone said} "Yes, I am a law. I represent about fifty thousand square miles of law in the Yukon region." <br /> <br /> "If so, why are you nothing more?" > <br /> "Because yesterday was wild, we didn't expect you to Pouring in thousands, now you are here and we will protect you. "<br /> <br />" When "<br /> <br />" will be posted here in Dawson during Early May "<br /> <br />" What will happen between now and May? What will you be like? "<br /> <br />" Part time "<br /> <br />" What about the remaining time? "<br /> <br />" Choose a good person to swear He comes in. Does he act like a marshal? "<br /> <br /> The movie Mountie went away and didn't appear in the picture again. His amazing suggestions ?? That the American city Marshal, along with the Tin Star, will swear by a group of city dwellers living under English law? has been accepted Naturally, they wanted Jimmy Stewart to be a sheriff. He obviously fits the part. But Stewart was portrayed as Loner, the number one caretaker and another man was chosen to shoot and he did. The others were shot, even Walter Brennan was shot. Eventually, Stewart came to the unwilling conclusion that he had to end all firing with his own shot. He pinned the stars and he and the bully Gannon blasted each other on the inevitable climax of the west. <br /> <br /> For everyone with knowledge through northern Canada.
