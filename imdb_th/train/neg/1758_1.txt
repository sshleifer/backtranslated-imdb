If you still don't see this thing, I say that just walking on, walking in the garden doesn't have to waste time. Both situations and performances are not worth your money. * Spoilers * - I can't decide what is worse: Baldwin's movie or hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's acting ability is very suspicious. I hope she can improve at any time. Unbelievable story American police cannon that is deeply involved in criminals in Europe on his own The infamous Mafia Slavic is protected by two hunters ??? Emotional art teacher brings a brutal gang ??? Stupid Spanish police executives than Warhammer sacks ??? Let me take a break. There is only one good thing about this movie: At least the cost of production must be lower than "12 oceans" which has no meaning.
