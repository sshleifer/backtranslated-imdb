I love movies, zombies and I like amateur productions and Meat Market 2. I started to promise to pay homage to Fulci's classic "Zombi". <br /> <br /> So I sat down and waited. Impress OK, some makeup is great for movies that don't have some budget and performers. (Vampires and chefs) really stand out, but nothing else. <br /> <br /> I'm not expecting Romero here, but there is no single sequence in all movies that have little suspicion or shock. The director is sure to know how to make body rippings and interesting eating habits, but now (after two parts) it's time to learn more. <br /> <br /> In MeatMarket2 Gore Rhymes with bore - for me That is not enough - sorry. <br /> <br /> ** From *****
