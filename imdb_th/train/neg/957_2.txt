So I was assigned to act as Trent Harris, who taught from time to time in the movie department at U of U. I think this is the only way to make everyone see his movie ... < br /> <br /> <br /> The documentary at the beginning of the drag Yes, this kid is a workaholic. But not good enough to make it interesting. <br /> <br /> Seeing Sean Penn dressed like ONJ is the only highlight ... and after about thirty seconds It loses all humor. <br /> <br /> When Crispin Glover plays Larry, the story is better. But I can't get anymore ...
