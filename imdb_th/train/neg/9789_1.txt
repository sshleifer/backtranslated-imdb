They should call this movie "Adopted Mouse Brother that was slightly inspired by the vague memories of someone of Stuart Little, who is a little book type. It's a better review. < br /> <br /> But seriously, do your children like them and let them read They may learn something instead of giving their hearts a tea as we all know that Hollywood is a movie. <br /> <br /> Stuart books are not about mice, like a mouse. He was born. For his parents not to adopt This book is about his life and eventually departing from his home and travel. There is a cat named Snowball who thinks he is food and wants to eat him. But Snowball can't speak. <br /> <br /> In the movie, they do the whole thing. I think the only thing they keep from the book is the boat race and the name.
