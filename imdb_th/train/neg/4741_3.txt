Wendy Wu: Homecoming warriors have a very good and strong plot. But destroyed by magic details throughout the movie I'm a younger teenager and don't enjoy this movie much. I think the effects are awesome. But they may look fun with young children Matrix makes your actions worse. Did you know that it's fake? Then there is the Yen Lo, an evil spirit that possesses random people and temporarily returns home, where Wendy struggles to overcome. Everything ended up like a movie that feels good when Wendy and her cousin Shen beat Yeno (and destroyed him forever). In the end, Wendy learned the lesson ... blah, blah, blah. next
