This movie is one of the reasons that IMDB should allow to vote 0/10. The performance is excellent, although some people here are praising the Carpathia characters! It seems that the script is written in haste. In one scene, the black preacher left behind when Buck asked "Dan 7" in the computer graphics. What does it mean? "Daniel 7, * Chapter * 24" He may refer to VERSE 24, but the filmmaker. Missed this error Perhaps the worst part is that the doomsday position of the movie is not Biblically appropriate. While many Christians support the interpretation of the film, the end of time events such as interpretation * in my opinion * are a mistake. To understand these shortcomings, read "Christians have to go through hardships" by Jim McKeever and "The Hope Hope, a Bible study about the second generation and pride" by George E. Ladd
