Firstly, there are some good things about this movie. But it is everything that is slow together with teen movies In advertising this film that I saw very important was the fact that Denise Richards was there. But she is a poor actress Related to the movie) and with that look, what do you give everyone? May be part of the character But as I said, acting ... even the writing was good. You know who it is throughout the movie and you can predict what will happen. But not in an annoying manner I think the books that are referenced from may be well judged by the plot. But the next time I will read the book to find more than look here.
