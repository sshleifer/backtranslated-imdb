After coming out first, you think brothers and sisters can come up with new jokes. Even if I can't guess If the first person is not bad enough, this person is so bad that it must be painful. With all the actors they have in this movie, you think they can create a little more clever. Even if they can't But they have to do funny things like jokes, all things from the first story, and it is put into this movie that people will laugh at Although this thing is, I didn't laugh at the first time. They try to make these movies funny, even if they fail at all levels. Most times it's just a random joke that is nasty and obscene until it's hard to watch and enjoy it. Then, when they tried to make a scene that was a parody of the movie, they ended up resting in the 20-minute scene, which could be a joke in the entire scene. For people who say it's not for older audiences and real children, I fit into the age range that should be funny. While people say that people have different ideas of funny things or not, if you find this funny, you may not be an adult or a wise person around. It doesn't use a lot of skill in writing a script. Even though you want a more intelligent and fun movie, go to the Spaceballs movie. It is a parody of good and realistic movies and does not require disgusting and obscene jokes to make The funny title
