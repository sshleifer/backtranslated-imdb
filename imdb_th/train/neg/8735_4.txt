This movie disappointed me. It looks like the movie Jaws when Hopper is telling the mayor to close the park as Roy Shider tells the mayor to close the beach. They both said that there is no way in the summer! But the box says that Hopper must go into the killer's mind and think like that. But he didn't do anything interesting or too exciting I do not believe even a little, he and his partner have experience working in the police when they are in the office, wondering how they can solve this problem. They say that the police work and we will solve the problem. And what happened to all the old men with pool cues I didn't believe that they were the leader of the group. Then the guy wondered if the crowd chose to deal with the murderer. By cutting his hundred dollars and thinking that his Di @ k is the size of a school bus Come what strap I think he will hit him with a baseball bat like in other movies. I used this movie and will not buy it again. I advise you to skip this movie. Oh and it was funny to see the microphone above the scene that jumped out to buy coffee.
