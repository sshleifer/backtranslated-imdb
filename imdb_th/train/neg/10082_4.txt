I laughed all the way to the rotten movie. It's unbelievable. Women leave their husbands after years of marriage. What happened? The office manager came out and offered her a job !!! hilarious! The next thing you know is that two women are doing. Yes, they are lesbians! Nothing is true in the movie. "Lifetime for women who have nothing to do better" such courageous dialogue "I do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I have the opportunity to be happy and not using it." Unbelievable black woman in 2003, this movie was created. Hattie McDaniel must change in her grave. This woman has a husband who is crazy and wants to care for a teenage boy. Sheesh! Not the rest of the words
