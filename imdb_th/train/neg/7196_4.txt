INSPECTOR GADGET (1999) ** <br /> <br /> Starring: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Andy Dick, Dabney Coleman Director: David Kellogg 80 minutes, get PG score <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> Disney's new movie "Inspector Gadget" is about a police officer named John, who survived a major accident and was rescued by a modern experiment that turned him Represent a robot like a machine There are all types of tools and contraceptives created in his body. When he says "Go Go" only to be called Inspector Gadget! <br /> <br /> The structure of the actual movie is similar to the creation of the body. Inspector Gadget himself. It's noisy, scattered, energetic and consists of a group of half-hearted contraptions thrown together to do things that are not very similar to anything else that exists. In general, this film is a series of funny action scenes that consist of characters and uneven stories that only children aged 6-9 years will enjoy. <br /> < br /> The police that have been very creative are Played by Matthew Broderick, who until "Inspector Gadget" Get a successful screenplay like His "character" became the inspector of the device after facing the tough villain of this movie called Claw. He was played by Rupert Everett, who had been disastrous this year with Scare "William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Nights Dream" <br /> <br /> There are romantic subplots in this film, inspectors of gadgets, strange body parts and mechanical elements. It has a device and claws drooling from the charming character Brenda, played by Joel Fisher, both her appearance and the knowledge of the unique invention of her deceased father who had previously been killed. By claws The competition evolves into the fight scenes and the many reasons that occur in the movie. The main character is the Mobil gadget, which is like a car that was invented for self-examination. It was voiced by D. Hughly from the comedy "The Hughly's". <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" is a movie that I find quite bad. I know I'm not the exact target group of the filmmakers. But even my ten-year-old cousin found that the film didn't like him. The movie is full of different flaws and obvious problems. I never found myself interested in characters. There is no emotional development beyond the finely opened credit, which is much different from the movie "Mr. Magoo" that was much worse in 1997, which opened using clips of the original cartoons. Is it too much to ask for the same type of thing in this comedy that is not funny and unbelievable? The overall production design is nothing but a mess of imperfect eyesight and contains a joke: the Goofiness of the Inspector Gadget is wrong. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the audience needs something to help. Give birth to something that can happen And things that cannot be in the "inspection equipment" do not have such scope This is true, nothing more than a party for actors who have lots of fun. I thought of another comedy that had just been released a few years ago, called "Blankman", which contains a lot of props and energy, and the actors had a fun time with all the gizmos and props. But it lacks something that is necessary for every movie: the participation of the audience. <br /> <br /> The character that I found to be left is the daughter of the gadget, which at the end of I still don't know what your name is. She used it as a plot device only - and I asked if she could use the plot more. For her appearance makes nothing relevant or useful to movies We never knew of her reaction to the work or accident of my father. So this is someone who may be completely abandoned and will not affect the movie a little. <br /> <br /> In closing, I want to say "Inspector Gadget" is a bad excuse and not enough. For funny kids And believe it or not, I found myself comparing this film to the past year with violence and action-packed movies that are anti-child like "Blade". I'm saying again that I have quite a movie that doesn't have What happens more than everything happens "Device inspectors" do a lot at the same time. It makes me feel dizzy. <br /> <br />
