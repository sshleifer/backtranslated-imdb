Within 15 minutes, everyone in my family took root so that Goldie Hawn's character died or at least the character of Steve Martin would leave her in 40 minutes. We closed with only a few years. We try to open the annoying that we can't even stomach it long enough for the story to be established. <br /> <br /> Normally, I like both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn and I remember enjoying the original Neil. Simon, so I pounded New Marc Lawrence and director Sam Weisman, including the "Whats The Worst That Can Happen" and the author of "Miss Congeniality 2", and I guess this is what we get.
