A great opportunity for director and director Indy to create an interesting film about rock musicians in the star's mouth. It may be a good movie if it will deal with John's past, Livien's wounds and how to torture his mind. It is a ridiculous attempt to identify the life of John Livien and John Lennon. The suicida mother's hero, John Livien, is John Lennon and she wants him to be powerful and plentiful, like Lennon, instead of focusing on the screen musical abilities John Lennon and his great ability in revealing himself to others to learn something about their lives. It shows that Lennon's legacy is spiritual. Addiction, man. I'm a big fan of John Lennon and the film reminds me of those "crazy" people obsessed with Lennon's killer, Mark Allen Chapman, the killer of Lennon. Lennon is brutally murdered by other people who have an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we need to be reminded of that? John Lennon gave the world something good with his music and honesty, and I was pushed to see another disturbed person because the main character in this film was obsessed with Lennon and didn't show it. His beautiful participation around the world Yoko Ono was honored by the grace of John Lennon by creating a memorial in Central Park to allow his fans to show respect and remember John. But the director of the film chose to use it. That website for attempted suicide I found this disturbing and disrespectful to Lennon's memories. He was a person of peace that died of brutality, innocence, and seeing such violence in the vicinity made him feel like a serious wound for other Lennon fans. It completely destroyed my movie. It may be a good movie. But it gave me a bitter taste in my mouth Let John Lennon and his family rest peacefully and don't have to think about his major murder from this irresponsible movie.
