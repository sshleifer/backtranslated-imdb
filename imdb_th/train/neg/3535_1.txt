Who is it? Who gave Revolver 10 out of 10, did you stumble your head with Ecstasy pipes? There are you guys Do you do for courage? Is this some cult? Or Guy Richie himself, applying for 788 times under different names? <br /> <br /> Before I say anything else, I will say this. Just because you don't understand the movie doesn't mean it's not good. Maybe you have a bad day at work or you sit down to watch a movie after you have contacted your wife and not in the mood. Maybe there are more fundamental obstacles, such as you do not have the mental ability or philosophical feelings that are developed high enough to join it, however. And this is a very big thing, but very large elephant body XXL, but ended up <br /> <br /> Please do not confuse the complexity and please do not confuse this two hours with a really interesting movie. You may think you're smart. You may think of yourself as a romantic, independent thinker who supports masterpieces to lull hunters like sheepers. Don't be embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Pistol wastes everyone's time. If you think it will be a few minutes, you will remember as well. It is the actors' waste, crew loss, waste of food organizers, and of course wasting valuable time. (You can't get them back as you know) of everyone who is unfortunate enough to sit through sloppy nonsense. <br /> <br /> "No - wait." There is a dark voice. "You just don't understand. It is not linear. This means that the story is not in STRAIGHT LINE. Actually, this job is a complex and complex task of AUTEUR. It answers already difficult questions. CLUB When it comes out for the first time - don't you hear - because They don't The car cope with the complexity they are eating humble pie now, you love to hate the films of Lynch or not? <br /> <br /> Hate to disappoint you. But I'm a big fan of Lynch. I like Memento more, so informal storytelling doesn't have to fill my fears. And even though I studied only a few years ago But the philosophy was very interested in me I don't like pistols for these reasons. I do not like it because it claims to be a topic that is weighty and has high intelligence. But involves them in such a superficial way that is insulting I'm not a chess player But Richie's idea of ​​chess work seems to be about four years old. I do not like because the character without exception makes me completely alienated. "Oh!" Cried Richie apologizing. "Men are smashing their hats at Britt." Maybe you're right. I think it is more likely that he will not be able to write a good script for toffee. <br /> <br /> The Revolver comparison with Fight Club is a true suggestion. Fight Club has an acidic conversation that makes Laugh Revolver has a fortune cookie that doesn't accept anyone who makes your ears bleed. Fight Club has a great change that makes you evaluate everything that is happening. The pistol has as much as I can tell that there are many things that cannot be understood that are distorted because ... they are not reasonable. If you pull the carpet out from under people, they will drive you out of the house. Then they locked all the doors and windows And they won't let you come back again. <br /> <br /> Guy Richie seems to think that being a philosopher causes the resonance of the buzz phrase. Most of them are talking But often they flash on the screen by reasoning It is almost pathological. <br /> <br /> But what makes this film special is the way in which something that is difficult to understand and cannot marry neatly with all the mobsters that are tired. People in the world Eventually it was not reasonable. You don't care about anything. You don't understand anything. You go home. <br /> <br /> Actually, there are a few things that I really like: Killer who is confident in the crisis. He's wonderful, but I can't recommend you to watch this movie for See him He is in just a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Please believe me. its very scary
