"Raw Power" is a special version of Love Boat that is sleek and distorted, along with additional kung fu fighting, crazy human monks, white slave trade, powerful zombies and fleas filled performances. It is not surprising that this film is included in the recently released "Grindhouse Experience 20 set-box" series.
