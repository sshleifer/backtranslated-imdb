The battleship is sinking ... The survivors hang on the nearby life raft, sitting there without doing anything while we enter their hearts to find a long-lasting event. The only person you noticed during the credits, everything in the movie is because of Lean. And for technical terms it is very good. David Lean just knows the movie from the trip There are many moments when Coward's educated conversation takes a second seat and the sense of sight of lean is in the middle. Try to let the soldiers down from the boat until the end and from that scene Tracking the shot to sing the hymn, the scene where we were in the house that was bombed. <br /> <br /> Noel Craven is one of the worst actors I've ever seen He is totally wood, not showing emotions, characters or humanity. You can see in his eyes that he does not listen to what other actors are saying. He just waits for them to finish so that he can hurry off his line. <br /> <br /> 7/10 /> <br /> The scenes are repetitive scenes and obsessive events. Stories: There are no important stories that they will move forward, just providing general knowledge about the characters. But still, it's an interesting movie to watch - and it's a good debut for Lean. It's not a movie that is deep or penetrating and is a propaganda movie. But it is something that shows the lean editing skills - it's about the combination of parts.
