While I watched this movie, I tried to find the reason that they cared about creating. Although the main plot of the movie may be good But there are many sub-categories that are not relevant / unnecessary. Marketers in Hollywood must tell many bad people forever, twice and men and women who are too close and have sex. It's strange that we see them having more sex than we do with his president and beloved. Many plans and sub-plans make this film too wide and without proper character development - I don't feel like I know any characters except that everyone is corrupt and evil. The ending is not perfect - it makes me more than just wanting to be what may be But what should be In the end, there is no explanation as to why everyone is doing what they do, except that it acts as a more damaging character that acts twice across. I was surprised that many actors (and good) agreed to make hollow films. It seems that movies created by students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd projects When making a movie
