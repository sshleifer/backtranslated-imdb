The easiest way to describe this movie is satire. The goal of ridicule is from the US government to American organizations. It's not a satire <br /> <br /> Think of this movie as a film that combines Kentucky Fried movies, planes and series, Police Police, made with a much less funny budget. I can see that the movie This is a satire about the catastrophic film from the 50s and 60s. I see that this movie has a great influence on Mars Mars attacks of Tim Burton. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. Genetically modified giant tomatoes are "crazy" and start attacking people and cities. At first there was a cover, and then it exploded into a full war. <br /> <br /> The film has the character and character: Lois "Fairchild" (Lois Lane). Very ambitious Secretary Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (FIA representative who has not worked since the Bay of Pigs), the president is useless. (Which seems to be able to sign and attack New York), inefficient parliament Marketing CEO and Mason's team consists of East German female swimmers, divers, parachutes, World War II and experts disguising African-Americans (disguised as George Washington Abra Humboldt Lincoln, Hitler and finally a tomato) I forgot to mention a lot of tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes, from small tomatoes to giant plastic tomatoes, smashed tomatoes to tomato juice, and finally there are people dressed as tomatoes. <br /> <br /> You also have Music numbers as well They are not good and seem to be called The best refinement is the theme of "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes". It's too catchy and you may have to hum or sing in public. Be warned. <br /> <br /> Most movies are quite amusing and Showing the absurdity of various real-life situations, including various entertainment types I do not believe that I was convinced to laugh. But mostly smiling and scratched my head I recommend this movie for fans of grade B and C movies, but only for rent. <br /> <br /> - Celluloid Rehab
