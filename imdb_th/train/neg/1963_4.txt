This movie is similar to Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it has more graphics and not as good as both. It's slow and quite well predictable. It has shades of Deliverance and Amityville Horror.plus, we get The new era that was mixed together and some of those scenes came out as inspirational and inspiring sermons. The film is a sublime scene of almost everything, even though it is full. With blood In fact, they look quite cheap. There are also clich√©d conversations that are really scary and I won't say when But there is a point where the actions of the two characters are not true or reliable according to the situation There is no one in their right mind, what to do in this way, when you watch a movie, you know what I mean. There is also a naked nudity for the sake of the nude. It is not necessary. The good news. Actually, the performance is better than this movie. It deserves s.so after weighing the evidence in detail. Id said that this movie can pass. But not good at the Tooth Fairy decision: 4/10
