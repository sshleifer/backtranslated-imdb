Famous writer Mark Redfield (As Edgar Allen Poe) tries to overcome old-fashioned addiction and start a new life for himself as a magazine publisher in Baltimore, Maryland However, unconsciousness and rejection threatened to hinder his efforts. He also wants to rekindle romantic love with old lovers, an opportunity that has significant flaws as to what happened. Mr. Redfield is also the creator of Edgar Allen Poe's mysterious final day drama, Redfield. It takes a lot of black and white photography, color and trickery to create emotions. Kevin G. Shinnick (as Dr. John Moran) works well, can say it is not enough.
