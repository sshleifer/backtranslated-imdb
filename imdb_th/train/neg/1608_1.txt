Behind communism Che's charm and perspective are related to his symbolic proportions, as well as misinformation published by leftist left-wingers. (Like this movie) About him <br /> <br /> I don't know what is worse: being caught by one of Che's assassins or having to sit through 4 hours of garbage. Soderberghian The question is not caused by this pet project. But things that take a long time by "them" I mean, of course, Hollywood, left wing and love "secret" of the Marxist tyranny (Lenin Castro ... choose I am intrigued to take decades to become one of the Tinseltown's least talented independent directors. Finally, use an irresistible bias propaganda project. Where is Oliver Stone? Every year, Robert Redford, Tim Rob City Island? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney Barbra Streisand yet? It is a mystery. These exaggerated "artists" often pamper themselves in one political project. In any way, Che Guevara, the most popular and well-known communist, is not yet in their movie titles.> <br /> "Guerrilla" has the epic story of an American reality story. There are enough facts to be found here, as well as elsewhere in Hollywood with political budgets such as fairy tales such as "Malcolm X" or "Gandhi". The film is starring Del Toro as a famous Argentine revolutionary. However, this man's actions may be a controversial and illegal matter. One thing that no one can take away from him is that he is a genius from a wealthy family - which is why Del Toro is suitable for billing. Only eyesight, Del Toro may be a charismatic actor and he may look like Guevara, but he doesn't have any intellectual qualities. So he makes Guevara Come out like the original The selection of ordinary people like Bratt, Philips and Franka Incompetente is underlining the lack of judges' voice. <br /> <br /> This movie is very slow. (Not surprised at all) and not attractive Even the best director of Kubrick had to carefully consider whether to release the movie for more than 3 hours. Therefore, it is rather said that Soderbergh, who had created one or two solid films and thought that in the beginning Of his career The greatness of his ocean depends on the mission. If you think the length of the movie indicates that Che's life has been shown here - try again. Soderbergh focuses on the final stage of Che and many movies are boring, boring, full of Guevara's alleged ideals (psychotic patients are not ideal) I suspect that the highly regarded director must really choose to ignore Che's previous life. He thought it was not too dramatic? The massacre of 600 people has no interest for the audience, right? Amazing. Some of the more talented directors, more than those who are praised, this honorable person will not fit the two perfect biographies in the 4-hour movie. <br /> < br /> Soderbergh, on the one hand, became a dark conspirator - more than 90% - of Guevara by publishing this historical inaccuracy without ignoring the ugly truth. (God forbid him to make Che's sacred image) unclean. Soderbergh proved himself not a fake human-image, most of which was a Hollywood artist and a pop-supporting musician - but contrary: he only cared for ideas. About the people that these ideas were tested (As well as guinea pigs) Soderbergh and similar things are the worst elites; People like this tend to be insulting. "proleteriat" (silly words). They should be in favor. <br /> <br /> Half of the students around the world wear Che's pictures in red and orange shirts. But don't know why He became an important person for people without knowledge, often ignorant of the idea that he had the face of this man on their breasts, which made them look "frustrated", hip or interesting. In fact, wearing a Che shirt will emphasize the overall shallowness and interest in self-study. (Do not you want to find more information about the person before starting to advertise his / her face around the world?) Wearing an ancient image now becomes a common thing as having a Bart Simpson coffee cup. Put Che "Those should know a lot more about Marge's blue hair than they read about Fidel Castro's dead partner. <br /> <br /> After all that was done on behalf of Marx Will think that these "ideal" mongrel will be placed in the end It seems that humanity will not learn Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Pol Pot, Castro, Milosevic, Ceausescu, Iron Curtain. Hundreds of millions of people die more than physical and / or psychological remains through this system ... billion? <br /> <br /> The fact that Del Toro won the Cannes should be surprised by the truly incompetent people about the work of Cannes and other European festivals - and voted.
