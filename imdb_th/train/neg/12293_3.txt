This thing has been beaten just because of actor David Hasselhoff. So let me smash it Compared to the garbage they call horror that comes out today, this movie is not bad. It has a beautiful Leslie Cumming. She is super hot, but doesn't speak well. There was a wonderful scene with her when she was raped above nature. She boasted her good body. Linda Blair didn't do anything here like Hasselhoff 3/10.
