If you have plenty of time to lose ... It's ok. It's moving quickly. But to pull this movie out, it will take a little longer. <br /> <br /> The performance is ok. Mariana Klaveno, as the caretaker, works best and believes the most. br /> <br /> William R. Moses plays a fairly good role as a husband. <br /> <br /> Gail O'Grady's wife has a weak part and the reason for her return to work is not developing. > <br /> The ending is stupid. Like most movie nanny ... There are some interesting parts ... but overall, it makes you wonder why you spent time.
