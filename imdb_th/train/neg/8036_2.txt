Do you want to know the secret? This movie. Actually, I don't know, because if you let yourself indulge in the original copy of the original movie, you might find that this movie is surprising. (This movie is a copy of my copy, knowing what you did during the first 30 minutes of this movie is based on a typical story setting. A group of teenagers called cool guys who like to relax in Florida and be themselves by acting like children. The only insights we get at this point are the extent to which the director succeeds in acting. The decline of teenagers in the characters The second half of the movie received a slight impulse and began to show the beginning of an unprecedented killing. The third half hour of this movie will certainly be a mystery to me because I closed before I fooled myself into thinking that the movie might still have interesting things. As far as the story is concerned, it can be easily explained in a few lines. Many teenagers go to Florida on vacation. While they are busy with the party, they gradually (and I mean slowly) start being killed because they know stupid secrets. The only thing that makes killing is that every victim has attended general high school One thing that surprised me about this movie is Betty. (I'm not sure about her name .. The blonde character) looks like Reese Witherspoon. Another thing that surprised me about this movie is that it made me jump from my seat a few times. Does that make it a work of art? Not because my 12-year-old niece made me drink a glass of orange juice because she "booed" me when I was just passing through the guest room door ... What was the difference between the director and my 12-year-old niece? ??? <br /> <br /> Do you want to know the secret ??? I'm not sure about you, but I don't ..
