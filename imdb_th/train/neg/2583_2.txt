Another American Pie movie was pushed into our neck and this movie is one of the worst movies. It's not worthy of the American Pie name. They should stop at "The Wedding". <br /> <br /> This movie feels like an idiotic porn that they slap the American Pie name. When I watch this, I feel like Watching another drama It's not like American Pie. It has a different sense of humor and it's more rude and has more sex scenes from other American Pie movies. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend. In fact, I don't recommend movies. Any "American Pie Presents" just capture the original trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
