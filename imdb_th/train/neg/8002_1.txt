It's a terrible movie. Rotten tomatoes also have good scores. Do not be fooled by positive feedback. It's not scary. It's not funny. It's not wise. It won't get your attention. I just wasted 2 hours in watching this shit. Monsters created with computers are interesting to see the first few times. After about 15 minutes, there will be no more entertainment. Bad conversations must be translated. Another notable disadvantage is that the stupid Americans 3 are shown and they all lack the intelligence and judgment. Now I will write a few lines to make this sheet because we have to have 10 employees at the video store. Should slap me to bring this name to the counter
