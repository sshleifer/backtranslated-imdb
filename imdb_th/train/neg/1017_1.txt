Oh dear god This is scary. There is not good then there is this thing. This movie is not reasonable. It ran all over the map and was unclear about what it said. It seems that music is trying to be like Batman. The fact that 'Edison' is not a real city Since I live in Vancouver, watching this movie and recognizing these places makes it unbearable. Why don't they make it a real city? The only thing that was well written was 'Tilman', which John Heard did a great job. He is the only actor who can play his role perfectly and not over the top. In fact, it's a shame that John Heard plays a terrific bad guy with a lot of time on the screen. Very bad. Hopefully someone important will see and at least give John Heard credit in the event of credit Matured and hired him as a bad guy, leading again in the list.
