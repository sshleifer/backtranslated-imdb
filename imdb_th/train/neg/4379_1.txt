<br /> <br /> Okay, I rented this movie while I was getting up on the killer pain and let me say it didn't help. <br /> <br /> The movie is about. About a man who bought a car while he was facing a middle crisis, he loved the car more than anything around him. One day, his wife decided to borrow a car. Because I don't want to spoil (Not that there is anything to spoil) I will let your imagination figure out "Zany" (and I use the word gently). The following trait <br /> <br /> I have to fight to awaken in the movie For a minute and I would like to say that if you dare to go into a movie store and are thinking of being an adventurer, please do not do this. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Then again I may be wrong ...
