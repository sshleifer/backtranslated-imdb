It should be Freddy's last movie (and it's been over 10 years) - do you think they will try to make good movies? But they made us get the worst series. (And that is very talkative) the plot is not reasonable (I don't really remember) All the main characters are idiots. (You want them to die) and Freddy's group is worse than usual. The only good thing from a distance is a short (and funny) pendant by Johnny Depp (the first movie "Nightmare" for his first time). <br /> <br /> At first I saw it in the theater. Is the last part (Freddy's new childhood calculation) is in 3-D. Now - three dimensions are boring - faded colors and images in and out of focus. The three flying skulls are horrible (I think). There is an opposite reaction from my audience. Everyone laughs down Look worse on a 2D TV. Pointless and stupid - very boring. Skip this and watch "Freddy vs. Jason" again.
