The worst movie ever made !!! Please see the real movie reviews from the pro in this movie. Check out Rotten Tomatoes on the web to see great independent reviews about this movie. The comments that appear on this website are from people who are financially interested in this movie. I find positive comments that are very misleading. I find it surprising that the negative comments are very bad for this movie and the positive comments seem to be the Academy Awards. This movie retarded !! I don't want to believe that this movie will be created. Why is Hollywood wasting time with this kind of garbage? This movie is the best effort. I asked myself what loose things would make their money produce trash like this. I went to the blockbuster and the participants told us not to waste our time or money. I don't listen and waste time and money. Please don't make mistakes too! It's "the worst movie ever created!"
