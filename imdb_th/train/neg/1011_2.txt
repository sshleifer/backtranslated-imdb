JJ Morgan Freeman Dylan McDermott Kevin Spacey John Heard Elwes Cary Roslyn Justin Timberlake Sanchez - Wait a moment Justin Timberlake? And he is a star? I should know better than renting EDISON FORCE. In fact, I know better. But in times of weakness, I definitely rent this STV. When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in STV, you know it's one of two things: Indie or dog. As in sat-on-a-shelf Which this thing does And for good reason Such a plot involves a team of corrupt police killers la la MAGNUM FORCE and "journalist" Timberlake is the only person who dares to reveal them. He has a goal for his efforts - or maybe I should talk about his terrifying performance. I closed it after one of the villains was shot through the forehead and still had an idea before turning to shoot and smile before collapsing. Just great The real tipford in the flick of this evil is to see Freeman on the cover and throughout the movie with a stubborn beard. You just know that the director doesn't control. Freeman is clearly bumping.
