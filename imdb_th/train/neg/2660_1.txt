However, this is an amateur film, an expressionist - or an attempt - which is interesting and brave, like an emotional book of a high school student full of death. Sure to disturb the audience that is being disturbed But that success was caused by himself, not the director To receive it truly under someone's skin must have a sense of discipline, techniques and abilities, including eyes and ears. This film contains images that are shown as still images. (And also used in video cases) but without development that leads to or goes out of it If the director has eyes, he will see that it is a possible starting point for an interesting movie, that is, a movie.
