This film is a good example of how to deal with the media. You can sell movies that are not more than unsightly TV series. In Puerto Rico, the most popular daily newspaper has consistently written about the miracle of this film, almost causing others to be silent. By chance, the second-largest newspaper is owned by the same owner. Weekly is the only newspaper on the island that analyzes the format and content of the film and points out the defects. <br /> <br /> Just because the movie is part of the audience. Laughing with jokes that are easy and clear, and because anyone can remember the actors and the scenery doesn't make it an acceptable movie
