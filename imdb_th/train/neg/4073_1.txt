No spoilers. <br /> <br /> I love horror. But this must be the worst attempt to create it. Calling it "movie" is also a stretch. "The random clips of this violent and tacky and ugly woman who tried to make sexy things that were edited together were not good enough." <br /> <br> Watching this is as interesting as watching Pictures of random family holidays and quality close to what you expect when you send your ten-year-old son to the forest with new cam videos and tell him to make movies. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
