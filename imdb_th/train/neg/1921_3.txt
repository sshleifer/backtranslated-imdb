For some strange reason, the film world is driven by fashion. Someone made a movie about a killer shark. Then, suddenly, the ocean of the film world was filled with giant squid, killer squid and monsters in the sea of ​​every family. A man was hit by a former lover from hell. Then every movie character was stalked by a police from hell or a roommate from hell or a babysitter from hell. Then, when a large Hollywood company created a size budget The big, heavy burden of tornadoes, other movie makers went on the bandwagon. The fact that they don't have the budget to pull it out doesn't stop them. NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS is a matter. The part that makes me about this made for TV movie was the fact that it tries to hide by cutting the budget deficit to an ad break. Every time a tornado appears, the camera locks the actors' horrific expressions as they scream like "Oh, I'm gawd. It's heading this way" and "Running for your life". The screen fades away Special technical budget Unfortunately, the NIS OF TWISTERS budget should be increased to include better performers. Actors are not worse than this. But they are not impressed and lack the skills to carry a movie that is a character driven by Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood. Where are you when you want? <br /> <br /> And the last word in this story is cloning TWISTER ... .. Yes, NOT NOTT was released two months before the TWISTER, but the TWISTER had been hyped for months as a summer blockbuster of 1996 and NOTT had a sense of urgency which made me believe it was created and released. out To tie in with the hype surrounding TWISTER.
