I think it's an exaggerated PG-13! At least the performance of BRITTANY SNOW is good, and others like IDRIS ELBA are also good, but other people in the youth group, such as the cheerleaders and close friends, are unbelievable The killer is stupid and looks stupid too. Death is stupid, boring and not completely indigenous. This movie is very boring and very overrated. It's not even a little suspicious. I'm almost asleep. Another thing is to create a bad PG-13 again. It's a really scary IMO movie. The ending is very stupid and Climax is hasty and boring. The movie was quite slow as well. Overall, the only good thing about this shit festival is Brittany SNOW. I think she gives good performance and IDRIS ELBA as well, but other than that, it's a completely scary and remake movie that scary That's just my opinion. I give it 2/10.
