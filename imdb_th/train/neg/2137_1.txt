Even the first 10 minutes of this movie was scary. It is hard to believe that anyone who is not John Cusack will bring money into this. With the anti-military / anti-war movies that have been destroyed in the box office, almost impossible to imagine that all studios will want to relate themselves to this script. <br /> <br /> At first it may It seems that the derivative of some political motives of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack again, but only about 90 seconds in the movie, it is obvious that this is an effort without DR STRANGELOVE's ability. <br /> <br /> I like many Cusacks movies that I think I risk to see this DVD. I have to say that I don't know if Cusack has enough consciousness for me or not even watching another feature starring him again, unless someone else can guarantee it. Cusack seems to be severely damaged by his hatred for George Bush and the Iraq war, which he is willing to commit suicide in his career. Tom Cruise has never been so far away. Not close.
