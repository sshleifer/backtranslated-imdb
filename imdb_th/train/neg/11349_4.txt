In fact, this is a lie. Shrek 3-D is the first 3D animated movie. I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago. Bug's life didn't do that as well? I thought it was at Disneyworld in that tree, so I said before they went and used it while having a logo. In addition, Shrek 3d is also a motion simulator at Universal Studios. They should also consider it. The movie because it appears in the "theater" and you can buy a DVD. This movie is cute, at least a little flies. I like IQ. I agree with animators. They make a mission to create movies from something that is an adventure outside and after. I recommend family and children
