I accidentally saw this one in a lazy summer afternoon. It was playing in the HBO family program. At first I painted with what I thought was Disney animation. But after a few minutes I found myself searching for a remote so I could find 'INFO BUTTON' to find out what the world is on my TV. I didn't resist Harvey F. I enjoyed him in many of his films. But one thing that he is not an artist who dubbed Of course he has one unique voice in Hollywood. But it can only be used as part of a larger image package Sticking his voice to a cute duck makes it look quite difficult. For the remaining actors I think that working in this movie does not attract good sound beyond ability. <br /> <br /> So weak voice talent Gay teenage dudes? I do not understand. There are many examples of love for teenagers and homosexuality, whether or not we have to turn to use animated ducks? A cute story and like the title, this movie I find difficult to love like an ugly duckling.
