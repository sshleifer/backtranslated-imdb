What is the point of this movie? What is PTSD? I don't know. Shaq can't do it. People don't know how to control and I'm Kazaam! Jeanie at the rap? Maybe Eminem or Linkin Park may be in this movie. I remember I watched this thing to kill time. It didn't really interest me. I just remember thinking, "Who makes Shaq in this movie?" The whole story seems too stupid. It's not reasonable. I guess that the unrealistic virtue of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto. I can't comment a lot because this movie is terrible. Nothing will be interesting. I "wish" this movie will disappear
