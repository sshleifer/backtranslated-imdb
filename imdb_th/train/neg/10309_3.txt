"CIA Codename: Alexa" is the classic movie of "La Femme Nikita" (1990). This film is about women who were trained by CIA and forced to do a secret mission for them. (The same story structure is quite similar to La Femme Nikita.) Lorenzo Lamas and OJ Simpson's combo may be the worst in history. Lamas' "acting" movie is a bad imitation of Steven Segal. This movie is a delightful experience. <br /> <br /> The writing and acting are terrible in this movie. Sometimes it is ridiculous. There are many action movies, "conventions" in this film. It's ridiculous: exploding unnecessary cars, people flying through glass, terrorist windows, bad ponytails etc. Musical scores are similar to David Michael Frank's score for "hard to kill "Which uses the Steven Seagal theme in this movie There are many martial arts in the movie and very well done for the production of low-budget Americans. Unreasonable actions and great performances never give up and I have to admit that I have been entertained gently. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lamas has the look of an early action star. The 90s, but he is not an action actor, that is why he made soap operas and not action movies. My advice is to skip "CIA Codename: Alexa" and see "La Femme Nikita" instead.
