This friend rented this movie. Her choices are normal. I read the front cover first and expected to be a good movie, even though it's <br /> <br /> a horror movie. Which i don't like But there are no horror stories that happen while watching movies. It's boring. <br /> <br /> Movies that are not fun. The appearance of Denise Richards <br /> <br /> It's happiness for the eyes, but that's it. We (the four of us) <br /> <br /> We were a little disappointed But don't hesitate to watch this movie and <br /> <br /> Judge for yourself.
