Recently, I watched this movie at the 30th Gothenburg Film Festival and said that it was the worst movie I've ever seen. Do not understand me wrong. There are bad, funny and fun stories (such as "Manos ?? Hands of Destiny"). Then there are many bad things. (This is in the latter category) The movie is unbelievable and not in a good way. It feels like a camera technician intends to keep everything out of focus. (Except for shooting naked nipples) the light is something between Actors are not as good as soap actors. But not as bad as a porn actress and gives the impression that all lines are all surprise The only ransom feature is the look of a masked killer, a classic look of la Jason Vorhees from "Friday the 13'Th". The plot is terrible and the ending is even worse. I would like to recommend this movie to anyone who wants an example of a horror movie that should not look like or may be insomnia that needs to sleep.
