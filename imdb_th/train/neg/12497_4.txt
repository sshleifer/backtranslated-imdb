I am sure that people on the Texas / Louisiana border will have a good laugh or two when Paramount's B unit produces this story in public wars. Only the area adjacent to the Sabine River, where the film was launched as a cotton country, as well as the rest of the lower southern region, or at least the south, is the Civl War. There is no large herd of cattle there. They are in the west. Far more than in Texas, far more than Richard Dix and Preston Foster can ride to set up their kingdom. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with two partners in the boat. Once at the river, and Leo Carrillo tried to steal their services without paying him haul his cattle they raise livestock. And that is the beginning of the great Ponderosa like a ranch. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Foster is married to Dix's sister, played by Frances Gifford and Feuds with his little neighbor. They also have to continue to run with Leo Carrillo. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the Westerners who like the West tend to ignore the geographic scandal and it still Is a good western from the factory Harry Sherman, who produced all Hopalong Cassidy in the west for Paramount. The key point is to blaze and I mean, actually, a fight with a gun that should be used in production A <br /> <br /> But I won't have a girlfriend. Westerners watch
