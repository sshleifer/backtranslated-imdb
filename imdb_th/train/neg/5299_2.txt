I like the slasher movie, but this movie is really scary. The show is quite bad. The screenplay is bad and the atmosphere doesn't really exist. The plot is as follows: The gardener who is wrong, Charlie Puckett, killed a small American man right - this is The original plot, right? "The Night Brings Charlie" is not scary enough. If this movie is not scary, at least they should make it bloody. Avoid this cheap trash. All expenses If you want to see a strong slap, you can see "Madman", "The Burning", "The Prowler", "Just Before Dawn" or "Humongous" - just don't waste your valuable time too. Worthless waste
