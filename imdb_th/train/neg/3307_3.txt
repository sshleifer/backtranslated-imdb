My opinion may be a little spoiler for something worthwhile. Stop now if you care enough .... <br /> <br /> Grace's economy should be called "Some excuses for tall British women on screen" This movie is dumb. The trivial music creates a nuisance to the obvious and periodic songs that appear periodically to comment on the lecture ("Spirit in the Sky" etc. - Oh, I understand). Cheech and Chong with the packed English language setting and the overwhelming power of Brenda Blountine that creates a feeling for the audience using only her voice. Indeed, I heard people at High Times magazine get their happiness more than a large "bud" that dumped this image. The worst scene? Easy. Brenda tried to sell her illegal products on the streets of London in a white suit that was noisy, funny. Not genuine. Not interesting. Not a good movie. Scoring 7.2 is the result of To zealots over-vote, do not waste time ...
