I will deal with the usual comparison with some legendary filmmakers who know the neurotic people of the New Yorker because they are fairly straightforward to compare with the loser. Josh Kornbluth, who insults I would avoid mentioning words that satirize 'Office Space' in the same breath as the Holocaust celluloid. However, can I compare it with waking up during your surgery? It's painful to see and you wonder if the surgeons really know what they are doing. The Haiku Tunnel is a type of movie that you want them to pull out the plug in the early stages of production. It is cruel to let it live and cause the audience around the world to be tortured. <br /> <br /> Proof of this film ?? If it exists? Not worth talking But for my sake, Josh Kornbluth, a highly committed temporary worker - fear of offering permanent jobs His main function was to send 17 letters of high importance to his boss. But laughing, he couldn't do this simple task My reaction to the big story! Isn't that true? It's the best idea - a story that should pass through a self-respecting filmmaker before. <br /> <br /> Leading actors ?? If you can call him ?? Is a clumsy buffalo of a man whose fat features have decreased, untouched hair and a set of facial expressions, ranging from flattering to ordinary disturbances Where did the director meet this schmuck? what did you say ??? Is he a director? Oh my mistake Playing yourself in your embarrassment in a movie is one thing. But I wonder if Korn Bluth did not believe that it was human. Rest assured that this is not an assassination of a pointless character. But I never felt angry before the actors' screen! My frustration is even more confusing with the continuous dialogue of the camera during the scene. I mean, as if the audience needed a one-ounce intelligence unit to understand this miracle Tell) Who is this man who thinks he is? He has no charm, charm, and judging by his hawaiian style. His casting agent should be an empty shot! <br /> <br /> Supporting actors do nothing to alleviate the boredom that I feel. Patricia Scanlon shows a funny look while Helen, the former secretary-general who was expelled from her old boss and made the phone call from her basement while holding a flashlight under her face. This makes me laugh with myself. But the time passed and I went back to check my watch for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The name of this movie is a name that is wrong. Hai Ju tunnel is not related to ancient Japanese poetry. Do not be tricked into thinking that this is a home movie because it has a name that sounds exaggerated or is the fact that it can be played in a few movie theaters and not making money at the box office ?????? There are many good reasons for that! <br /> <br />
