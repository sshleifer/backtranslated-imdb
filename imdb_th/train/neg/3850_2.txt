I saw this movie at SXSW, with the director joining. There are a few people who walk out and the audience can hardly even gather gentle applause. At the end of the 60 or 70 movies, the stories that I watched in this festival, Frownland is one of the worst movies /> <br /> At 106 minutes, it's at least 95 minutes long. You'll watch the main characters who fail and try to get real-time communication. Verbs and syllables repeatedly, over and over and over and over and over again - we get points. <br /> <br /> One site compares this job to Mike Leigh. You will have to use what drugs to create. That sentence? Because Frownland is Captain Beefheart's song, you may have to enjoy Trout Mask Replica to spin around to appreciate this movie. Unbelievable that this is a jury award at the festival. You can bet it does not win audience awards.
