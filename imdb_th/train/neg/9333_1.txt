Poor !!! I do not want to delete too But this movie has an apocalyptic IQ of a disastrous monkey. I can't believe how bad this movie is. The conversation is very strange and the topic is off. Just scary music, sometimes like the soundtrack of Lawrence of Arabia. I just watched this movie to see how bad it can be. "Actors" who kicked the side corners are all disasters But my thumb and toes That can hang down on my body falling to the ground. Harvey Keitle is a great actor But who knows that he may be in the financial crisis to participate in this film .... This movie should be presented to all students in every movie school to teach a lesson about not making a movie. How does this matter?
