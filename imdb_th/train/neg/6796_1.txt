Linda Lovelace is a victim of the hateful Chuck Traynor. I do not understand that having sex with dogs (Which is also animal cruelty) can be found fun or funny Linda Lovelace is a virtual prisoner who is forced to create these movies. I know some people will criticize this comment. But I feel strongly that this type of film is a fuel of hate and hate for women. This society still shows that women are sexual objects compared to humans. We call ourselves "civilized", but I feel that we have a long way before we scratch the surface of civilization.
