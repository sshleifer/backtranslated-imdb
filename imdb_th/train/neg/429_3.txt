I was tempted to watch this movie with its strength. But in the end it was all given It plays like a Greek tragedy rather than a modern thriller about corruption in a big city. Its greatest flaw is the ability to anticipate and lack of doubt. We know who is the bad guy from the start and just follow as they fall like a domino. Movies that give credit, do not refrain from violence and free sex But have forgotten to substitute good romance, clean or excited in any other way All flavors of cola, good food, coffee, no caffeine. "Questions & answers" that occur in New York are a better choice as well as "LA Confidential".
