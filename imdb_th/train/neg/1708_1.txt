Ok, I don't have anything to say about this movie anymore: I've seen over 4,000 movies in my life and over 2,300 stories are horror movies. While I have difficulty in deciding what is best (As opposed to what I like, which I can tell you is DAWN OF OF THE DEAD of George A. Romero). I can tell you without hesitation even though ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, the worst horror movie I've ever seen <br /> <br /> There's nothing good I can say about this movie. The dialogue, the director, the makeup, the music ... every aspect of this movie is lower than what is acceptable that makes me not realize that this story will be released. <br /> <br /> Even if you are Kill horror movies or zombies. Be careful of my warnings and don't waste time on this garbage. There is no joy to receive from this viewing. You won't even laugh a little from the utter nonsense on the display ... believe me please.
