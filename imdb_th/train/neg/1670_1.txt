The location of this film is spooky: a woman is pregnant when kissed by a stranger in the bar. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the film begins, the horrible opening scene takes place. It's a great Star Trek and X-bit file, but more than anything else, it's boring. <br /> <br /> When this movie starts, everything is predictable and boring. Seems to be 2 parts in a bad sci-fi TV series. No suspense and no excitement. But not because of lack of effort There is a lot of controversy that can be predicted between the main characters. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time.
