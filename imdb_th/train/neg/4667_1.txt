The messy eyes see less plot, incredible garbage, incredibly numbing. Not close to the better work of Greenaway. Avoid all costs. <br /> <br /> Overlapping 'screen' effects do nothing more than confusing the movie. This is very dark at various times and the composition of 'art' has the meaning in the end. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to suggest about this movie for sure. Even if nudity is not uncommon to see it fill the entirety of the movie soon, it is very boring He showed more talent in the Star Wars series and was saying something. <br /> <br /> I've never been impressed with the movie before since I saw it. 'Ogilby Derby and Little People'!
