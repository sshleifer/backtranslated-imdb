A huge disappointment from the writer Hamm and director Dante. Their previous collaboration in "Homecoming" in the first season was twisted and hilarious in the right way. Dealing with this poor evidence makes me dazed "returns" that should show that the general alien that extracts something from the brain of an infected psychosis is not completely satisfied and does not explain anything. If the issue is about "Cleaning" outside of the world of human disturbances. Why are they about this sadistic, unreasonable and unreasonable matter? Why not just letting the deadly virus "The Stand" of la Stephen King instead of the male population kill women? I hope that now will be better while I watch But it is more pretentious and miserable Religious subtitles seem to be forced. But it is clear that Sam Ham had to think of it deeply by the weight he gave I like both Dante and Hamm's work.
