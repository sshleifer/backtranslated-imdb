You all know the story of "Hamlet". I do. <br /> <br /> The phrase "whether or not" (not my own words) has been smashed to the ground many times until very interesting Start with). In fact, I found that "Hamlet" is a good drama. But played very exaggerated It's not the best of Shakespeare: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo & Juliet" are ten times better with "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Othello" not too far away "Scotland (knocking the table of You leave the drawer. The naughty child will pay the OW!) "It's not too bad. There are many other people better than this by Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I won't comment too much in the movie. But I will cut out the most terrifying MST3K. <br /> <br /> Okay .. Mike and the Bots win the card game. Choose the movie .. They ask "Hamlet" Pearl to send these things to yadda. yadda yadda .. and prepare for the most boring Sci-Fi episode of MST3K (admittedly, I have never seen CC Ones) <br /> <br /> while "Blood Waters of Dr. Z" makes Viewing The episode is scary because it's not a movie rather randomly connected scenes. (I think of Mike's line from "Future War": "Maybe this is a short chapter that doesn't have a movie.") Many SOL crews have taken many good cracks. Can't say the same thing here. <br /> <br /> The riffs are down. The hosts (as usual) are the best, medium and when the movie (which is not bad) is better (I mean as a quality movie, not a camp. Same as "Prince of Space"), rather than the MST3K version. Did you know that acting must not be good? I laugh (the last time I saw months ago) Oh, maybe eight or nine times I tried and tried to be entertained - but I couldn't. Only on certain occasions, such as "The Master of Hail Queen Dilbert!" (And when it is the most fun episode now, Ahem) - and sometimes I mean every ten minutes or more, maybe I laugh at The second time I tried to watch it, I didn't laugh at a few jokes that I had encountered before and surrendered forty minutes before. <br /> <br /> The movie isn't scary. It's just a German version of Hamlet. The actor is good and although the dub is not great But that's not the reason to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Hamlet"; Three yes, three for the MST3K model. <br /> <br /> PS: Why, why? MST3K!
