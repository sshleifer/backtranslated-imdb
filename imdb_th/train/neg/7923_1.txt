I'm a big fan of Ted V Mikels and "Corpse Grinders" is the original main reason why. But this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Even the legendary cast of Liz Renay ("Desperate Living") was unable to save this worthless waste. This movie should be a lesson for filmmakers both past, present and future ... When you succeed as a traditional "Corpse Grinders", you should let the dog sleep and you should not try to restore it. More than twenty years later (Unless you have the financial support to pull a superior sequel, such as Herschel Gordon Lewis, do it with "Blood Feast 2: All U Eat"), even if you decide to do this. More money than you do in the original and for the sake of God ... Never filmed a movie on video ... Why the filmmakers tried to do this when everyone knew that the quality was about to become scary ... Personally, I have Haven't watched the only movie that did this, it was worth the flour to blow to hell ... If you can't create a sequel that is better than your original movie, you have to sell the rights of this movie. To those who can ... and what Ted V Mikels is thinking about (Or smoking) when he wrote this deity Pleasant script? I mean, come the "alien" dog and cat from another planet? A cardboard box that looks like a machine that can destroy the human body ... bones and clothes and all right? If these actors, in addition to Liz Renay, receive more than five dollars for their horrible performances than they paid too much! Avoid this movie at all costs and watch original movies instead.
