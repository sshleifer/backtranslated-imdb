"The Incubus" is a combination of goodness (The mystery of interesting murders), bad (script that is not connected, sloppy resolution, bad attack scenes) and strange acting - the character intends to be "wacko" really No) Not nearly as repulsive as famous. But not particularly successful as well (* 2/1)
