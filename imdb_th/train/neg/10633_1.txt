I watched this video at a friend's house. I'm glad I didn't lose this purchase. The video cover contains scenes from the 1975 film Capricorn One. The movie begins with several explosive rocket clips, most of which are not related to manned flights. Sibrel's smoking gun is a short video clip of an astronaut preparing to broadcast a video. He edited with his own voice instead of letting us listen to what the crew said. The video ended surprisingly with the screening of Zapruder. His claims about radiation, defense, shooting stars and others made me believe that he didn't know or had some ax to crush NASA, astronaut or American in general His science is not good and this video too.
