I am looking forward to watching this movie for a long time after seeing "Return to Paradise" which I found to be brave. I'm very disappointed The most realistic thing about this is an unpredictable ending that I think was stolen from "Return to Paradise". <br /> <br /> Maybe I expect too much. <br /> < br /> On the positive side, Danes Beckinsale and Pullman are excellent in their role. Although I do not like Danish characters and be the first and find that she is very annoying. <br /> <br /> I can't see what is really about the movie. It should be done better, for example, may focus on real prison conditions and horror. It was too cheerful that the movie would be realistic. There may also be more action and tension. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the "tragedy" ending. I can't predict. But at that time I didn't care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
