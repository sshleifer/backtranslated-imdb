As a girl, Hinako moved out of her small village to Tokyo, leaving her two best friends, Fumiya and Sayori. She returned as a surprise woman when she discovered that Sayori had died when she was teens She reunited with Fumiya and they were shocked to learn that Sayori was mysteriously resurrected through Shikoku Island. Oh, boy. I rent it because I like Asian horror and I think Chiaki Kuriyama is a good actor. Unfortunately, if I had to explain Shikoku in one word, it would be a "fruit". This movie is boring, boring, filmed badly, emotionally, and most importantly, not cluttering. Kuriyama has the least screen time while Where Sayori resurrected and her character received only a small amount of work
