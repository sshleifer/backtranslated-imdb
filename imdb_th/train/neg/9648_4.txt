Vipul Shah has done impressive work as a filmmaker in the past 'Waqt - The Race Against Time' and 'Namaste London'. Fun and interesting. 'Singh Is Kinng' is a fun story that he did. His latest outing as the filmmaker 'London Dreams' occurred when the weakest career <br /> <br /> 'London Dreams' had a mediocre story. Agree it has potential But when you watch 'London Dreams', you wonder what happened. This movie may be the worst climax in the past. Vipul Shah, the writer, makes Vipul Shah the director. <br /> <br /> The first hour is boring. The second hour is better. But the important point again is scary. Who will forgive the person who decides to destroy you? I won't. Suddenly, Ajay Devgn decides to go to India and forgive his diaper friend. Thank his uncle Puri when he arrives in India instead of spanking or abusing him. Salman welcomes him with a baja band and says he is the reason behind all the failures? Vipul Shah's will shows Salman's character as a god? If yes, than you completely failed. The only question I would like to ask Vipul Shah is, would you welcome someone who destroyed you with this great welcome? Write what you feel. Don't fool us. {Audience} We have reason enough to understand what is good or not. <br /> <br /> This is a stage play, but Shankar-Eshaan-Loy's music is terrible, not one song. <br /> <br /> Salman is a wonderful person. He carried this film on his shoulder and was really good in the mood. But again, his character shows that he is God, which makes him look like a mentally retarded. In the end, Ajay is equally good, but Salman has made him completely shiny. Completely broken and what is the great talent like Om Puri in this movie? Rannvijay Ham, but Aditya Roy Kapoor is very good. Brinda Parekh is as good as vamp. <br /> <br /> Overall, this dream is still a dream!
