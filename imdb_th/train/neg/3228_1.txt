I have seen other Guinea Pig movies like Mermaid in Manhole & He Never Dies and while they are sick, they at least have a little sense of humor for them. Although the trials of the devil are nothing more than a bunch of filming, the punks send the girl to various ways of torture and violence, and there is no planning and no exchange of any value. Far, except perhaps the idea But it was disgusting and of course I wouldn't call it entertainment Now I don't have good taste in movies and I like garbage and sloth. But it's really too much for me In fact, I am everyone who is disturbing me. Find things that are disturbing when possible. But it is quite large The young woman was kicked, beaten, being sent to the noise continuously through the earphones until the drop, then pressed with raw meat and the inside and left in a hammock in the forest. If you think it sounds great But it made me not have to see anything anymore from Guinea Pig 1 of 10 absolutely disgusting
