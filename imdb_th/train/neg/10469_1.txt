Yes, I admit that I cried in this movie. It was very frustrating that I couldn't help myself but cried. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) has done it again. First of all, by having a Million Dollar Man (former professional wrestler) on their list, and now this thing <br /> <br /> Omega Code follows the flow of religious films. It's quite fun But at the same time it was disturbed to find that it was not biblically accurate. The movie tracked what is called "Bible code" instead of following the scriptures in truth This movie was created very badly. From writing to directing to scary performances It was depressing that people actually tried in this movie. It seems to be a late night movie that some people will watch in the USA channel or video straight to the home instead of the movie that plays. <br /> <br /> I suggest you do not watch this movie even if your life Depends on it
