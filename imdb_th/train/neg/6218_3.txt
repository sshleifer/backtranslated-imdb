My thoughts about movies 9 <br /> <br /> It's not good. The sight is great. I'm satisfied with pacing, camera angles, etc. However, the character? Eh, so kind. Plot? <br /> <br /> This movie looks more like a new age than anything else. Religion that has been presented with cowardice and fear Science doesn't show better than this. It creates a monster weapon that kills everything ... but the "soul" has the power to destroy monsters and live life. <br /> <br /> That's what bites my ass. Here we have CGI movies ... created with science ... and they use it to make the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that the spirit will help us. At least they are suitable to have a character. <br /> <br /> "Okay, now what?" (Or something like that) I can't hear it well. Too, because the crowd immediately rose and stopped to leave. It was "okay ... it was just fun enough to sit here for the entire movie. But now we go out here as soon as possible! "Exit type <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you can't think of if you want to enjoy it. Just looking at the pictures and nodding cutely. Any ideas that are "what is the point" will suck you out of disbelief and make you see the exit sign with desire. <br /> <br /> Ok .. . Spoiler tracking <br /> <br /> So basically, scientists create "Machines" that are capable of creating other intelligent robot lives. Evil humans use it as weapons. However, scientists realized that he was wrong as well. He gave his intelligence to the machine. <br /> <br /> Go to Skynet in the unification of humanity and get rid of all living things on earth. Finally, slow down. However, scientists can survive and create a walking puppet socks. Each person has a piece of the spirit of the scientist. <br /> <br /> The last person # 9 wakes up without knowing anything about the world. He saw a strange device nearby and picked it up. He goes to meet other people like him. # 2 <br /> <br /> Okay, # 2 was the last robot that survived. # 9 Find yourself more and set out to help. # 2 <br /> < br /> They are successful. <br /> <br /> # 9 Notice that there are holes that fit perfectly for the device. He inserted it and the machine came back to life again ... pulling out the spirit of # 2 in the process. <br /> <br /> Then the movie will continue with the action scene with # 9 at <br /> <br /> Finally they succeeded and destroyed the machine. They freed the souls of fallen friends who had gone up on the clouds. The rain fell and we saw that life was coming back to the world. <br /> <br /> Hunh ?! <br /> <br /> It's not reasonable. No, why the heck scientist wants to divide his soul into 9 homunculi. What is it successful? Are they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine is dead! Why bother !! <br /> <br /> Why do he expect that nine little reptiles will succeed when nothing happens? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but use "souls" to fight the first thing .. At least it seems to have a chance to succeed. <br /> <br /> Why do they have to Have their spirit sucked into the device and destroyed the machine and released the soul to bring life back to Earth? Why not wait for the machine to stop and bring life back without having to use all the remaining steps?
