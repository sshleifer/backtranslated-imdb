Yes, this movie has kids going to the space camp and it's getting good enough because you have kids to meet and learn about the ropes. Then they introduced Jinx, a robot that could not exist in the year. The boy became friends with robots and robots, restoring the kindness of the child by shooting him and the other children in this camp out of the world with a lot of oxygen and radio, and without signs to reach space This camp is not as fun as it should be, because these children are truly trained and the instructors do everything to complete the failed mission or not do the right thing. Let them rest. They are there for fun, not to be an astronaut, just letting them experience space flight, not military like a camp. However, you will see Joaquin Phoenix in a rather fast role. Therefore, in the end, movies that try to be true in some areas But with the introduction of Jinx and other factors, you may have an alien space fighter fighting over everything that happens in the movie like This movie is fun, at least for me. It may be because a few other people, too, who want to see Kate Capshaw's face tear off strange alien creatures.
