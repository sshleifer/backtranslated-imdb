This reboot is like a processed McDonald's food compared to Ang Lee's "The Incredible Hulk" which is very good but has been underestimated. <br /> <br /> Ang Lee's "The Hulk" is The comic book movie for those who think The Hulk takes time to appear (about 40 minutes), but when he sees us seeing the conflict at the core of our protagonist He tried his best to avoid losing control. But when he accepted when he was angry, he liked <br /> <br /> Now compare this to Edward Norton's eyes without conflict. In his personality and he became a Hulk every time he was excited and his pulse rate jumped 200 times per minute (not 183, not 197, but equal to 200) for this critic. Similar to bringing midi-chlorians in The Phantom Menace, which says that "strength" is as strong as one, as if the mysterious ability can be measured through blood tests. In the 2008 film, Bruce Banner's entire Ed Norton must do is maintain the pulse rate. Under 200, which is checked by the device that holds the wrist And for recording, it is very difficult to get a pulse rate of up to 200, even though it is a very exhilarating moment, especially for those who are physically fit. <br /> <br /> Driving emotions Drive Eric Bana's Hulk. He suppresses memories of his mother's death and father's role during childhood. He was on a calm surface. But under that there was a major anger and anger enough to fuel Hulk when it was released, but the Hulk never intentionally killed even his attackers. Most of them want to run away or close to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He makes his photographers incompetent and in just one important scene, saving jets from chasing him. <br /> <br /> Movies of 2003, the visual effects are there. But as necessary, the action scenes (and there are many) need to use a plot that is different from the 2008 film that has action actions for action. He will make it into the "escape" story. Ed Norton loses interest in the feelings of Bruce Banner about Hulk. For him, the Hulk is a dangerous side effect of experimentation. And Louis Norton, the director of Ed Norton's queue, failed to add any emotional dimensions to the relationship of the banner - Hulk. The story can be summarized as follows: pursue the banner and the Hulk Crash kicks, Banner tracked and Hulk kick butt. Repeat as necessary. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is compared to the 2003 film is that it may not be true for the 2008 comic book version. Where i am Fans of the comics I like movies that are not true to the comics fan's dream as a boy. But have more hearts than loyal cartoons But producing and endless Heart
