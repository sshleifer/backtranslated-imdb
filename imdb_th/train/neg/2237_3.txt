I got this DVD from a friend who came from someone else. (And that may continue ..) even DVDs look cheap as all movies Gunshot and fist fight with slow sound effects. The worst actor I have ever seen in my life. The plot is simple. It makes me laugh until stomach ache! With very little financial resources, I have to admit that it looks professional. Regarded as a movie, it is one of the 13 gangs of Savannah scrambling for dozens that no one is waiting for So if you're tired and want to laugh cheaply, watch this movie. If not to throw out the face differently
