My death, .... The director should be embarrassed. Why do people feel that they need to make a movie that is worthless? It doesn't make sense for me. When she died, it made me laugh. I had to change the channel many times throughout the story because I was embarrassed to see such bad performances. Hope that the people who play Heath won't work again. Moreover, I hope the director will never create another movie and bring his check back to shit.
