I can catogoricaly and say unequivocally that in my 51 years on this planet, which is a worse movie (Suspicious children) that I have seen in my life. <br /> <br /> I took my three grandchildren to watch and Although they tried to add a smile during the entire 90 minutes of winding I will go out another day. But they are not like the movie They should pay you to watch, not you pay. It's really scary. There is no other way to explain. People who create this movie should be used to receive money under false pretenses. <br /> <br /> Apologize for mistakes in my spelling. But I am very sorry that it wastes my time with my grandchildren
