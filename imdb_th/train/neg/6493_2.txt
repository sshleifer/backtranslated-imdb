Oh dear ... As a small British and Welshman who is a big fan of Anthony Hopkins' work in the industry ..... To this day I'm really disappointed. <br /> < br /> Do you see that I have no one who is hoping for better? So my opinion is like 'straw in the wind', but that's the point. Isn't it? - I don't have an ax to crush the commercial value of the job. I am a great member, never taking a shower. Go to see a movie that will take you to another place. Yes, suppressing belief for a short time, but not going into an entirely unbelievable state. <br /> <br /> If this happens by an unknown author and director It's a pity that it's not, and I'm left to widen my eyes and confuse. After seeing the crazy comments from this event, I am very worried .... <br /> <br /> Maybe it's something I try without prejudice to see each movie with its advantages. Regardless of the author, director, studio, or even the misbehavior of the content, <br /> <br /> My advice is many before I: Don't write and direct the same production. It's full of danger Movies must also be screened to maintain credibility. <br /> <br /> As they say in the school report "Can do and do better ..."
