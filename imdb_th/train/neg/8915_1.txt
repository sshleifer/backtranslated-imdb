My opinion about this film was deleted twice, which I felt quite offended because I tried to judge this movie with others. Please be patient with other people's opinions. Obviously, writing with the spirit of Nietzsches's work is not understandable, therefore changing my opinion completely. <br /> <br /> I think this is a really bad movie for many reasons. /> <br /> Subject: One should be very careful in making movies about the sages that even today people do not understand. One of the philosophers agreed that Nietzsche was a great thinker. Therefore, creating a movie about his life, including his 'ideas', is something we should be very careful about or should not do at all. Wisdom begins by knowing that you don't know anything. Some people may think that this is not a movie review. But this movie is not about the characters in the imagination. It is about the lives of people who actually live and influence the world of yesterday, today and tomorrow. If someone tells a story about tomatoes, I can express my thoughts about this. But about the selected subject, which is tomato There is a responsibility for the producers when they make a movie about the actual facts. In this special case and this responsibility is not being used. <br /> <br /> Screenplay: One of the first things I noticed was the ridiculous accent. Why? It distracted from what should be Nietzsche and the truth he found. It doesn't help to put things in a geographical view or the right time! Come to make it suitable or better in English; German! Even Mel Gibson has that part ... Let his characters speak Aramaic, which is gibberish in Passion. <br /> <br /> Second, it's a good thing. <br /> < / 3d
