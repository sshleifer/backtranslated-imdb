I truly insulted this movie when I saw it at the age of 6 or 7, because I was a big fan of Robin Williams and nothing he could not do well Until today This perfect trash destroyed Robin for me for a long time. I just recently recovered with a funny part. But seriously in his father's day But then he still made mistakes again. Bicenntinial man I thought it was called. Robin should be able to get a much better job now, and now he's back to show the slime that comes from this 'classic'.
