I have to precede this thing by saying that I am a very romantic person. So I really want to like this movie. So I wrote my thoughts to help you who are left with the disappointment that I felt watching To meet every leap year A very romantic place based on great short stories and with actors who do not feel that you are watching Jack Neo. If so, why is it so bad? Firstly, I felt that the filmmakers thought they were filming music videos because they chose to replace the true storytelling and emotions with predictable action montages. I was upset and embarrassed to be one of the first few people in Singapore to watch The Leap Years, but we in the movie theater would agree that our groaning in acting is very valuable. My hope is to watch a romantic movie that is more than Forever Fever, Singapore's best romantic comedy, until now, and The Leap Years has not come close. Some of the blogs are called The Crap Years, which are severe but ultimately true. Don't waste your money or emotions like I do. This movie will make you love forever.
