This serial is interesting to watch as a MST3K feature, but for today's audiences, that's all it is. I was really surprised to see the year it was created in 1952, considering that the only truth made it solid (lowly?) 2 in my book. Cars that don't look contemporary, they look like objects from the 30s. It's Cody's story. (The salvation of the world alone, Cheshire talks about insulting others, like soldiers). However, Cody is in the flight suit of his ring with Graber and Daley, two minions. * SS Gun player carry Quite lame in their own right to enjoy If you want to see a really good serial, see Flash Gordan. It's full of rockets that attack each other and nemesis. Good evil and good looking women don't have that. And the flash is 15 years old before this shit can make you slack Something that happened in 1952. This bad thing deserves 2 from Nuff. Let it be 6. If you watch it as MST3K, they are fun. Twist the nipples here, twist there and I'm flying! And now it's an added bonus. I brought the Commander Cody Theme song you sang by Joel and his two character Bots, Tom Servo and Crow on the Love Satellite for Episode Eight The Enemy Planet: <br /> <br /> (Singing at the very beginning of the credit <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVO singing) CODY Your audience ....

Be careful ... CODY is there. <br /> <br /> You will have his hair like him under him. Helmut ... and because we can't think of a good musical rhythm. <br /> <br /> That is the end of the music commanders. These ... so they He will come back with GRANITE. <br /> <br /> And see the eighth chapter as the cause of the enemy planet.
