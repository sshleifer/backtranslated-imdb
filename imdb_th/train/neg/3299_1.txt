This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, I expect to have a bad movie. But I was surprised that I was caught or not The story is traditional, including all the ancient ideas. <br /> <br /> The conversation is so bad that you laugh when the half-descended actor is trying to make it true. The picture is not too good. The song is malplac√©e. It makes me angry. The actors didn't even try to make the script impossible for you to expect from people who have been performing for over 30 years. The scene dealing with the lack of "action". Actually, <br /> <br /> I don't understand why these bad movies are still moving forward. Where is the screening? And why on earth could not have actors in this role? <br /> <br /> There are millions of Hollywood movies in this category without having to go to the cinema. Professional in comparison. <br /> <br /> I can't say anything positive about this, except for the name that can be explained all. I feel robbed for 2 hours.
