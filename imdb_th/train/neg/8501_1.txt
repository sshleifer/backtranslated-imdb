<br /> <br /> This movie sucks big time. It reminds me of the movie Resurrection (Christopher Lambert), which I find very boring as well, and "Semana Santa" is a movie that is all the worse Most of the actors doing for this movie is Alito. Alida is one of the greatest women in European film history. I love her mania in "Suspiria" and "inferno" (Dario Argento). I will not spend more time dealing with this movie. I'll tell you another good story about this movie ... use it if you want to sleep quickly ...
