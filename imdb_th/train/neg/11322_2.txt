There is a word for this type of film and the word is "drifting". It floats when it is rented. VHS and it floats on the satellite again. The name known as Kistofferson and Henriksen and the beautiful Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> There are some curly women. <br /> <br /> If that's all you need. From a happy movie <br /> <br /> It's still floating.
