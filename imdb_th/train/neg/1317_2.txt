When the people at Kino Video have collected their "Slapstick Encyclopedia" collection, choosing a silent comedian for many tapes, many decided to start the first part with ONE TOO MANY (1916), which is a one-reel joke In florida Oliver Hardy, very young This decision is unfortunate for One TOO MANY, a very poor movie that almost discouraged viewers from continuing to watch. As with general matters, this story involves deception that is inspired by greed, panic when plans are distorted and complications increase to the point of absurdity. But different from one person, too much, uninterrupted and annoying It is hard to say at this point that the plot that creates despair is the result of missing film or improper filming. But no matter what happens in the middle, even the most watched audience doesn't know. And at the end, no one is interested anymore. <br /> <br /> The only point of interest is to see a 24-year-old "baby boy" that is stronger than he would have received in the next ten years. When he collaborated with Stan Laurel, but anyone who was full of youthful energy In the opening scene, wake up with a hangover babe performing a highly backward movement out of bed. Trust me, that's the most funny thing that this movie will receive. If you read this before seeing the first cassette of Kino's "Slapstick Encyclopedia", I suggest you forward this quickly and skip to the good things.
