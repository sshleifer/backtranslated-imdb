OK, so Chuck Norris found a way to create this sequel. I have one question - why do anyone who read this script say "Great sound! This movie ejects regurgitation that I will not spoil my intestines as well. Of course, it is another story that follows the tradition of MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force and Chuck Norris. Of course, it is a man who can do the same America from the bad guys. He doesn't need a gun even once. It is a foolish jargon. The only big surprise to direct these Norris movies is Eric Chuck's son, Eric Norris, working primarily in the father's movies and all TV programs. This does not affect anyone who is a sign that he has no talent? Afterall, he is the same director as in the same story as before ... The only difference is the name of the character. If this should make me love and encourage the United States more than our country has a much worse shape than I imagined. Hope this will be nailed in the coffin of Chuck Norris.
