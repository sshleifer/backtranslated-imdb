When I saw three versions of the same movie, I feared that this was the weakest point because Scott was rather boring and a leader. His emotions were soft throughout, making it difficult to participate in the movie. Alistair Sim plays an unlimited role. When Scrooge is in his sense, you will not feel that Scott is talking in a very convincing dialogue and when he gets to change him. It's unbelievable too. I can't think of any actors in this movie that match the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and the straightforward Muppets) still perform better. Very disappointing
