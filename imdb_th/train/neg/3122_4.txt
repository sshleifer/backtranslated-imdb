I can't give a bad rating or criticism for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. This film has the potential to be a thriller and has a slightly disturbing element that is psychologically inclined, which is what this movie will be. Focus a little Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon, which is a good night DJ that is facing a personal problem: his lover moves out and Gabriel has what appears to be a blog of a storyteller. One day he received and read stories written by a 14-year-old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete tells the story of his life and the abuse that his parents had to suffer. He lives with an adoptive mother and social worker Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and begins to be friends with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel tries to find him and finds that there is a possibility. Pete Boland may not exist I will not detail, because I do not want to make the movie broken. But I will tell you that it's quite predictable. An interesting atmosphere for storytelling and good performances from Robin Williams and Toni Collette, which I think is the main character of this film. Collette is without a doubt one of the talented and captivating actresses. the best Her ability to delve deeper into the mind and character of the character that she plays is a very scary thing and I hope to see her win an Academy Award. (Hell, I think she might pull a better actress.) This movie started with a thriller psychological film. But is a movie that can be predicted If you want to know if this movie ends and is bent or not watching another movie, I'll rent a thriller called "Hide and Seek".
