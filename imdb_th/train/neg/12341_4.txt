Counterfeiting is not just a story of the 21st century. Before the 'Scary Movie' series, there were some examples of this type, most of which were in the 80s. Some effects or mistakes such as 'Elvira, Mistress of the Dark' are mostly higher than that. But otherwise, like 'Saturday the 14th' and it is the sequel that failed to laugh But from all these movies, there are especially great offenders and that is 'Transylvania 6-5000', which is a big loss for many reasons. <br /> <br /> Pros: Excellent actor who did well. Some humorous humor that is amusing A recurring song, but capturing some good Transylvanian places. <br /> <br /> Cons: Threadbare storyline. Walking mostly boring. Most humor doesn't cut off. The monster will get what needs to be done and the screen is a little time. I think this would be a pseudo-monster movie? A weak ending that might make the audience angry. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: Is this a joke, right? If so, why is it a bit funny? The comedies should make us roll on the floor, not rolling the eyes and yawning with them to finish it. I do not want to believe that Anchor Bay will release this tired garbage. I will admit that it's not the worst movie ever created. But it's not worth anyone's time or money, even if you're a big fan of the actors. See 'Transylvania Twist' instead of <br /> <br /> My score: 2/5
