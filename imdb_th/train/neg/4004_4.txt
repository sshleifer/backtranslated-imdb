As a big fan or nutcracker series, I waited 7 years for the next filling. Now I'm afraid that it's not a legend. <br /> <br /> Fitz returned to Manchester after 7 years for his daughter's wedding and was involved in the murder investigation as a soldier. His duty tour in Northern Irland is fun to kill. <br /> <br /> What I don't like about now is a very comfortable way to set up all the ways to bring Fitz to the murderer. It has been so far away. <br /> <br /> But there are some good scenes in the back flash from Northern Irland which was well shot.
