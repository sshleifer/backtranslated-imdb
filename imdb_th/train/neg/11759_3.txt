For those looking for the sequel to the South African mini-series in the 1980s, whether it's historical drama But it is a boring fantasy that is not related to Shaka history But use his name to give some stamps to Sinclair's silly story about an African superhero who is a mixture of Lincoln Superman Jesus. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there was a time when the laughter rang when Shaka cracked the cross, which he chained and kicked a serious saliva. You know, like Jesus did, if he was not an idiot. <br /> <br /> Actually, I saw only 98 minutes, but I can't imagine that this shit is twice as much. Would be better. <br /> <br /> And what is the name Mungo!
