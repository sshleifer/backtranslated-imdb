This movie may be an interesting character study and may give details about it. But the real problem of this movie is that it has nothing in this matter. It does not provide any insights or solutions. It is just a picture of the 'old' male sexual addiction and problems that arise in everyday life and his family. Why do you want to see this thing? It is pointless and totally meaningless. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help anything that the main character is a guy aged 50 years or older with wrinkles. You will have a difficult time identifying yourself and being sympathetic to him. He seems to be a dirty old playboy who is a woman and has sex continuously. He had sex of all kinds 3 times a day with different women and not just But with only prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It doesn't have a bad looking pattern. However, it all looks better than direct production with most videos. Who knows if filmmakers get better content in working with this movie, will deserve better faith? <br /> <br /> The story has been ridiculed at times. There is a plot of some nonsense that often laughs more than it should be. I'm talking about, like the whole Ordell plot. Everything is getting worse when the movie starts heading to the end. There is also a storytelling throughout the story cut between the events that occurred with the meeting of the main character and his psychiatrist. Feeling cheap and simple. <br /> <br /> But as far as movies that are not Good This is just one of them. It's not better or worse than random flicks that match other videos with similar concepts. <br /> <br /> Still strange and amazing. This little production is not as simple as this. Think they are desperate for work and money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
