While I and the other half are big fans of Trash Horror, we can't help but make movies that are both great and exciting! However, for the 2004 film with the cover of Freddy Vs Jason, this is a shame! The worst movie I've ever seen But worth laughing if you can get through it Etc. There are no strange storytelling stories that do not make sense and the script is terrible! "From one vampire "You destroy my cigar" is a response from a man who looks like Jesse Uncle from Dukes crossing with Santa!
