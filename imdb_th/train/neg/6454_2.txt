The monster from Enemy Mine came into a small mountain community where he lived. He was hunted down by a female doctor who turned the vigilante out to get rid of him. This female killer, who looks like a fugitive from the Motley Crue video, rides a motorcycle and tries to help a number of children who choose to have Big Chill on the weekend. A lot of rotting and blood is the main attraction to get away from the limps along with the bad version of the island. Moreau (and yes, it's worse than the one with Val Kilmer)
