I was really surprised that I sat and watched this thing. I love independent movies, horror movies and zombies in general. But when you add your ninga, have crossed the line that should not cross I hope people in this movie have a great time creating it. But at least not a waste You never know by watching it script? Are you kidding? Acting? I think even the trees pretend to make movies? I had to have a camera there for a period of time. I didn't think there would be a real plan related to this film. Wasting all the time, I will not extend the time by commenting further.
