I can't believe that someone will create a joke about problems such as homelessness. Of course, Brooks does not create jokes about homeless people. _Real_ There is no mention of drugs, prostitution or violence on these streets. The people we meet in this film are not living in fantasy lands, so the only difference between them and us is that they don't eat often. Brooks' movie has been getting worse over the years. This is another nail in the coffin.
