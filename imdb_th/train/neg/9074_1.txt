Another adventure in the realm of comedic adolescents located on a campus that has a cold pursuit and the way he decides to blackmail three popular athletes, makes him a woman. It was done before and all was done satisfactorily. The basic humor that makes teenagers flick, such as "American Pie" and "Dude! Where is my Car" that has been popular, is completely removed from the context in this sector, appearing completely random, where viewers can tie eyebrow This film is not well written, the actors have never succeeded in doing anything, even this story can be tolerated. I will not honor this terrifying image by revealing because it is a waste of my time and yours. Best of all, Slackers never manage to entertain or cause laughter, and the worst is that it is not good, almost bleak, and sometimes can't be completely examined. <br /> <br /> Jason Schwarzman, who created the impression of Rushmore, embarrassed him by appearing in this picture and wondering how quickly his career will end in the bathroom. Please avoid, please avoid saving money.
