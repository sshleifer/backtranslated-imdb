A disgusting and disgusting thriller with a young couple doing cross-country research about America's most famous murder scene, becoming a business partner with a sensitive girl. Arty and alienating the sound of the movie. This story alternates between deceptive temptations and stupidity. Maybe well done But finally laughing Brad Pitt's acting as a low-rent killer is a serious matter * from ****
