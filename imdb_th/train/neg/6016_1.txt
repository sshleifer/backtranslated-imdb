This film, which is published directly on the video, should have a warning label that is harmful to human health and may make the viewer tired of boredom. It is another vague mask which is evangalizing "forgetfulness". Religion movies with good people (believers) disappear and bad people. (Those who are not believers) leave behind. It was an interesting idea, especially when we saw that it happened on a flight that was captained by an unbeliever who had a sinful relationship with the waiter on board (There is no need to say that the sinner does not disappear as well!) Unfortunately, not all pilots who believe in the plane are distorted or the movie must be kind Although this is interesting if there is no religious browsing heavily But the full movie made the gag only once. The performance was horrible and the simulation that the computer created was very fake. In addition, it is another movie that Canada claims to be New York City, empty me ... I will read the Bible.
