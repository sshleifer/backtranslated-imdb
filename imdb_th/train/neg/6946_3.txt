I have watched this movie for a long time (about 10 years or so) and like it. I remember the day before and decided to look again. The second time, the show is not satisfied, 'So the plot is unreasonable, unreasonable and predictable. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I'm sure it's not a stretch for the actress. Play those characters. Plot ... There is no way in the hell that women can get with the first robbery less than the 2nd time. (Note on the side: Why TT didn't even know that even though she had a lot of money? So much for the court day, she would ask if she was looking for Or from any place and she is no sensible answer! ) Dead black women, for example, are scary in general saying that the only way black women can 'overcome the system' or get a lot of money is to steal and not use intelligence or other resources. It plays too much with comments. Sympathetic b / c, all of them eventually die (Chada bar) but not sad (You are thinking 'They are very stupid. They deserve to die.) You don't really care about the characters unless you are superficial. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that this movie has more than 5.
