I started this review with a big giant spoiler about this movie. Don't read more ... Here comes to close your eyes! The main heroine, a female survivor of the movie Slash, was killed here. There, I just saved you 79 minutes in your life. <br /> <br /> This is one of the cheap movies that were thrown together in the Middle Ages of the 80s, even killing the heroine. But this is just a waste that is not standard. <br /> <br /> Both priests and college students receive bad punishment here. They are seen as people who are overly normal, have too many internal social problems to deal with what looks like university life in the early college ... and students on campus are even worse. <Br /> <br /> Just put it on your VCR when you have nothing better than this, although I recommend watching your head cleaning tape which is more fun. <br /> <br /> Here Is an arrangement Quench (R) for physical violence, vulgarity, female nudity, and sexual references. <br /> <br />
