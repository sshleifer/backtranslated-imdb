Restraint in drawing 9. dir: Matthew Barney <br /> How do you know that you are in the middle of a pretentious art movie? Have only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of the movie? When Bijk wears anything that looks like a giant feather pita on her head in a pseudo-Asian ritual. Perhaps when using mammoths and spine poles in whale experiments Or when you are ready to kill the songwriter to score the lowest score and annoying In any case, the Drawing Restraint 9 is one of the most pretentious art movies that 135 minutes. It increases the pretense by boredom in the boot. I will run using amazing colors and an interesting opening sequence. But the rest of the movie seems to be filming for the Discovery Channel documentary, that is, until it seems that they are trying to film their P-ss Christ movie, but that will happen later. <br /> <br /> At In fact, some of the documentaries are the best part of it. The surface plot is about a whaling boat and there is a ritual about making fat whales. Then there was a guest in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney, who was greeted on board by the ritual of humiliation, including shaving the head that had passed away. Don't forget the giant chaos. <br /> <br /> Matthew Barney writes that this is about "The relationship between self-defense Almost like that "If you do not understand, you are not creative in your interpretation, so avoid it because I am an artist." Oh, wait. That is the POST-modern interpretation of that sentence and what the movie is about if it's a POST-modern. Should be a modern art There's nothing about the art itself. <br /> <br /> So, let's start to bit all these interpretations together? The following lines are only 3/4 serious and should not be considered as a realistic attempt to interpret movies. <br /> <br /> The first half hour involves pearl divers and the creation of giant ramps. Clearly, the ramp is a symbol of the need to upgrade yourself to the standards that you love and pearl divers are looking for the pearl of wisdom. Then, on the whaling boat, they created a crate that looks like it was in the form of a whale. Clearly, it is a rough element of speculation. <br /> <br /> On the boat, they create whale fat within the shape of a whale and pull out the fins. They replaced the spine and later became a giant. These things should be the status of the movie itself. When fat is entertainment But not good for you When a spinal column, the "important" part of the movie or spine will speak. Then the giant chaos is the bowels of the movie or when the crap movie <br /> <br /> Bjork and Matthew Barney arrive in a separate boat. Or indirectly, one suspects that they have no money and Barney is trying to quit smoking So they put the patch on his head They passed a ritual and learned about the boat from a Japanese philosopher who told them that the ship had a scar when another boat collided. Mistakes or intersections if you will This inspires Bjork and Barney, who are different, to go outside to start cutting each other's legs and eating them so that they can become whales and be the same person. They intersect. Oh, I forgot to say. How about this in Robbie Williams' video? Then the pearl diver then came back with their mouths filled with pearls of knowledge which they let go to create a stupid Venetian diagram. Barney made it through the 8th grade geometry clearly. Or at least may have social education. <br /> <br /> Oh and I forgot the ears of the Bjork grooves that I want to kill you? Sometimes it is hypnotized. But in others, you just want to assassinate you. <br /> <br /> Art movies are one thing. It becomes a devastating joke. When do you cross the line between being a joke in terms of art? Dali and Bantuel made a surreal nonsense. But it is more consistent and / or more fun than this garbage. Un Chien Andalou has the feeling of stuffed as many symbols as possible in less than half an hour. <br /> <br /> So can I recommend it? Only if you like the movie HIGH ART with symbols and flat images. <br /> <br /> D +
