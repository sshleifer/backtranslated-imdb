I love Alex Guinness And that is a lot of talk after this movie In fact, he's not bad in that. It seems that he will stand side by side as a gentle and happy person. But invest Nada Obviously, the girl he had paired was very heavy, even though he was an experienced French girl. Sir Alex will not choose her when he is young and is clearly not happy with it at this time. <br /> <br /> An interesting character is the weird brother of "Suzanne" who is strange. The eccentric "Donald" aspires to be the French Heathcliffe and I wait worthless for the source of his mystery. He hid a dark secret behind him. Did he fall in love with his father's mistress? Why did he throw Susan's hair when she planned to bring the different parts of this turkey together in the country? Or maybe he will have enough disgusting performances That would be a great story! People with two lovely experiences in a beautiful city after the fall of World War II Why do some people not do that? I recommend watching Alec Guiness in "The Card", a well-known movie but worth it.
