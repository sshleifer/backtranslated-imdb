Difficult to categorize movies I never paid attention to it by 110% and as simple as I thought I couldn't tell who was doing what the American FBI characters were and what their role was. I can't take Irwins seriously as a movie character when all of their chapters and scenes are in the form of his performances. <br /> <br /> This is not a big deal than when The famous Discovery TV shows, with the most insignificant subplots occurring that seem to go in the way. However, Irwin's performance is always worth watching. This movie should be worth watching as well. But not on Christmas Day I'm better to do more. <br /> <br /> High 4/10
