This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen all my life. I'm not kidding It was not well built and the actors couldn't do it. It's a waste of my time and money. It looks like a movie that my friends and I can collect by themselves. In the case that the movie is disguised Nothing in this movie looks like a zombie in front of the case. It appears that the director or makeup artist just put a black eye liner under the eyes of someone called Zombie. Credits at the beginning of the movie take almost 20 minutes of the movie. Which credit viewing is the best part of the movie This is a really scary movie and I can't believe how it was brought together. Jumping scenes from one scene to another and sometimes you are like "What's going on?" Scary sounds and action shots seem like two teenagers play funny to create fake fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting or buying this movie It's because it shows that it's really scary. I hope I can watch it before I rent it.
