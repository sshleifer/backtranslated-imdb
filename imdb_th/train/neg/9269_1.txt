Since seeing part 1 to 3, I can honestly say that they shouldn't do it. Episode 4 Everything from good tastes and I mean scores, tastes that are not really good at acting. > <br /> I mean part 1 to 3. Keep strong feelings in Damion's plot, but without him in this, it's not the same. Of course, at the end of episode 3, I was bored with the ongoing story. But it was a good closing at the end of the third chapter Again, there is no reason for Part 4, even if they are able to work better. I have to sit and watch. Hahaha. One and a half hours, my life will never be seen anymore
