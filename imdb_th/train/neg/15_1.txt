This is one. This is the worst movie ever created. It beats everything. I've never seen worse. Retiring trophies and giving to these people ..... No comparison. <br /> <br /> Even three days after watching this (For some reason I don't know why) I don't believe like crazy. This movie is scary / it is bad. Far from anything that can be considered a movie, story or anything that should be created and brought to our existence. <br /> <br /> This thing Makes me ask whether humans put this world or not. Do good. It makes me feel tired of myself and our progress as a species in this universe. This type of movie hurts us as a sincere society. We should be ashamed. I cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we must prevent these initial misrepresentations for our own goodness. It is shameful I do not know that in this world, there are actors, writers or directors of this movie falling asleep at night because they know that they have a role in creating "loads". > <br /> Being said that I love "bad" movies. That's good. I love Shark Attack 3, I like Bad Taste. They are very happy. I told all my friends to see them because they were "bad". <br /> <br /> But this ... This thing crossed the "bad" line to a whole new dimension. So much, this is a bad thing that you know everything that will happen every line, every action, every death, every sequence before it happens. And not just two or two before I mean after watching the first 5 minutes before <br /> <br /> editing "effects" every time this adverb is repeated over and over again disgusting I never wanted to see the "shaky" effect of the "urgent drug" camera or jump, cut or swerve or cut FANCY CUT once again. It's boring, meticulous, repeated and torturing the audience. <br /> <br /> But ....... and ask me to be specific here, the most disturbing thing about this movie is production. A good amount of money is used in this excretion. Personally, I grabbed the director's shoulder if I saw him and made him surrender by calling him to run home and swallow a two gallon drain, or I'll do it for him. <br /> <br /> If we want New inhumane torture for our war prisoners in foreign countries, just show them this movie in the cell. Trust me, I think they will become more extravagant by means of suicide after 72 years of sitting through <br /> <br /> Stop these movies. They are just the most vicious of society. Please. Stop. Now
