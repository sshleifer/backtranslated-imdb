When I went to watch this movie, I was expecting a lot, but I was wrong. This movie is like every horror movie. It is a virus, zombies and others like Resident Evil and many other movies, but the difference with this and other movies is that this is a very good week. It's a bad actor and boring music. The picture is ok but the rest is all shit. Can't see this "horror" movie. See Ring 2 or another movie that has more stories. I hope they stop making horror movies that have viruses and viruses spread and make people into zombies. We have seen enough. The only good thing in the movie is when they stand on the roof and shoot famous celebrities.
