This is one of those movies that are anti-smuggling and stupid in the 80s that are foolish and past. <br /> <br /> The idea that kids and basketball stars can "Changing the world" can be quite far "Children's demonstrations for peace" and "Celebrity protests" are available and live Learn from "Silent protests" in the West are laughable. <br /> <br /> How does the Cold War end? I dare to say "Reaganesque", America's stamina and socialism's internal failures. It's not peace, march, "death" or movies like "Amazing Grace & Chuck", "Miracle Mile" or "Wills".
