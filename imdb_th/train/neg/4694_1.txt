I was interested in the name and description of Big Rig while attending the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas. However, I was eager to leave the seat immediately at the Big Rig. The Big Rig ended with a driver. Many "big rigs" that travel to transport goods across the United States. The characters are all wonderful. However, filmmakers never dig deep into their complexity as people. The story comes as crooked as the movie map is intended to be a guide, but has never done so much. We lost our way - the audience - at the end, not going anywhere and like the direction of storytelling. But without direction or plot Why are we here? Where are we How do we come here? The storytelling is sloppy and the director's intentions in the story "Humanity", which is a group of people that they perceive as "overlooked" and "invisible", passing through without knowing it. The problem here is at the point of view of the director rather than the truck driver. The director brought his own naive assumptions about the truck driver ahead and then edited the movie to confirm those assumptions. Overall, the story lacks any tension. The film is too long. (Should be a 15-minute sketch) The big question of "So what" never answered and this movie is a watch-through propaganda either. There is nothing to add "enlightened" (as the director demanded) the outside world about large-scale drilling equipment.
