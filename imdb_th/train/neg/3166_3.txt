I confess that there is an uneasy feeling about ghost movies and sometimes I enjoy the genre when it comes to horror. But when it comes to comedies, they must be really mad. 'Over Her Dead Body' seems to be serious about the afterlife and fail in my opinion from almost every aspect that I can think of Of course, it is completely incredible and unsuccessful in convincing me, whether in cartoons or in emotional registration. The choice of a great actress is terrible while Paul Rudd is at least handsome and looks good. But the tastes in his female characters seem to have been seriously improved since Eva Longoria looks too old (sorry) for him and Lake Bell doesn't seem too beautiful. (Sorry again) The romantic story that has no good reason for love is due to failure from the beginning. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane are really better, but they only have support for the role The rest is not interesting and does not receive attention, with flat movies and cheap jokes borrowed from successful TV comedies. Nothing really worth seeing. Nothing to remember.
