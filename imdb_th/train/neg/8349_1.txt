Men are walking around without motivation ... I will never get two hours of this life. The man still assumes his identity and unfaithful to his pregnant wife. What am i thinking Why does the price win anywhere? I understand that he loves his father. But other than that, this movie has no reason for me. What is the purpose of walking a lot and going to the funeral of strangers without a clear reason? How can this make his life better? Why do we have to see an old woman dying in her underwear ???? !!! Why ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I'm even though it's deeper or more interesting. I do not recommend movies even when going to sleep ...
