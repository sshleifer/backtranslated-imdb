I saw this movie a few years ago in the BBC. How did I sit through it? I don't know. This is the way it is in the charts. "So bad." Goodman, Baldwin and Pullman must cringe when they see it. Now I think Woody Allen will work wonders with the plot. Foreign and Baldwin One part should be able to play with Leslie Nelson.it's gusto again. Tonight I tried to watch again. But life is too short A few minutes I watched the cute Nicole that she was hot about 93. Has Baldwin ever made a good movie? Pullman plays his stock in a "good but dim" trade. The F-word character that came out of his mouth when a woman from "frasier" miscast ed as a detective accused him of murder seems to have been wrong.
