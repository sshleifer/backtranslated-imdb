IMMORTALIZER is interesting. Of course, it didn't kill me during the past half hour. But it didn't make me very impressed A group of children were kidnapped in the alley by muscular head mutant. (In the scene with the least convincing sound effects of the movie) and being taken to a fancy house in the suburbs So that they can have a youthful body again Hey, this is remade quietly with a big budget a few years later as FREEJACK! Who knew that when you transplanted the elderly brain to a different body, their new sound would sound like their old voice? By talking about the whole pineal gland and using a glowing green serum, you can almost see the picture from BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR dancing in the head of the producer. But the real production doesn't have the courage to pull it out I never understood why when someone created a horror movie with a small budget that they didn't put it on the edge of the frame with blood. The performance is also very bad, with only the best results from Clarke Lindsley as an assistant to Dr. Pryce, he laughed wickedly Another thing to keep in mind about THE IMMORTALIZER is that there are many people who make their own stunts seriously. Most actors use serious shocks with old people.
