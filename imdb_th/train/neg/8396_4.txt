... but I see it better. <br /> <br /> The story here is predictable. - The movie team tried to shoot horror movies in places where murder occurred. Three guess what happened This is not all the bombs. The actors are quite good with the advantages of John Ireland Faith Domergue and John Carradine that give the best performance. It can be done fairly well - for movies with low budget. Do not expect to have nudity, swearing, blood or blood. (This movie has a very weak PG rating) I never got bored completely - it was ok. Watched in a quiet night. I saw it in the video - it was a boring print - very dark and some scenes were impossible to see. Even though I didn't hate it and it had a cool ending that surprised me - in general, nothing happened until that time. Worth watching But if you are the most complete horror movie
