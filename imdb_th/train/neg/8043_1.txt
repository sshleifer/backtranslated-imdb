Normally I don't have a problem to walk away from bad movies. But this is a special case This movie was so bad that I had to sit and wait until the whole time was about to pray. It would have a good movie to watch for one minute to show the half hour that was broken. Needless to say that I was mercilessly disappointed. Located at a beach house with a group of friends, the college is celebrating holidays. This film has many problems that make it not worth watching. The first is that there is a breach of the plot. Secondly, very little on program C (I don't dare to call them B). Actors can make themselves interesting, so any scenes that may fail miserably. Thirdly, the rate of this film changes very quickly and is awkward to watch almost all the time, making creating a movie theater very difficult, leading to very little surprise for the audience. Fourth, and most important, the ending is against the climate, partly because it ends (setting / who is the killer) and partly because the conversation is cruel. Movie Credits It's the only movie I will say is the worst movie I've ever had, and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> So, like a bad joke you will have. Get the joy that has never been heard before. The next time someone asks you if you want to know the secret you will shout, no you don't do as you go in the opposite direction.
