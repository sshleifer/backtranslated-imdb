Look at Hulu (too many ads!) So it stops dancing But still, it's like watching a terrible buddy movie from the early sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, both of which are played by Jerry Lewis. Worse and every woman is wise. They cheat music videos to sell in western style and use many western models, so men can touch them. I always enjoy Indian movies a lot. But this is a big disappointment, especially for modern Indian movies. The story doesn't happen in India. (Uncle refers to when Mac will return to India) but I can't know where it should happen.
