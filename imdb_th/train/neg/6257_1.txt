SPOILERS, tasteful and generous people have reviewed this film. Allow me to increase the balance by pointing out the following: <br /> <br /> Script: Scary as Tom and Dan "Getting to know each other." Speaking about movies, the words are clear as a matter of one person and I wonder if it is a director who works carefully to get a wise voice. At one point, Dan asks. "Have you ever heard about the HIV virus?" And it sounds like a natural thing. "Have you communicated with all nine alien tribes?" <br /> <br /> Performances: white teeth and faces that do not make the actors sensitive. Speedman works well with what he gets. I think, but Marsden is terrible - not sympathetic, unbelievable and radical, serious and unclean throughout captivity. There is nothingness for his performance (please see Interstate 60) <br /> <br /> Synopsis: Free me! The time of the half escape is not exciting. But annoying and weak From CSI and other crime drama <br /> <br /> The most important thing, the most dangerous, evil and disgusting is homosexuals. (You decide from outside or inside) In the movie that HIV is considered a weapon Tom said that Dan might remove the condom or not use it - sorry. Where is Tom while they have sex? There are some villains of the allies that have come out as bad guys in general. <br /> <br /> Total: Be careful!
