This story and morals both left a bad taste in my mouth. For me, it seems that Borowczyk will be disgusted with sex and both films are a warning about what will happen if you have sex. As a movie, it doesn't do well - some performances are not really good (like "American women" with French accents). The flop girl flips from worrying about marriage to have interest (When it seems that it should be another way) and the sense of the secret of Aunt's young man is not reasonable Not explained at all I do not like how the relationship of a daughter and a black man is presented as a symbol of the perversion or voluntary of her family. The main idea, the idea that there is This "sexy beast", if you want to live in the woods, may be the foundation for a perverse but fun story, but instead use it as a basis for nasty sex Delete moral play
