Okay ... It seems that until now only Barman's fans have commented on this movie. Be careful that this writing is * long *. <br /> <br /> For those who are not in knowledge (Most are not Belgians): Tom Barman, the director of this film is a well-known person. Rock band of the late 1990s here in Belgium Essentially, they have created a new album that is unique and is a double album and is quickly famous in the country. Then Ego began to hurt and the band broke down, with Barman and a few other people remaining to make the album under the Desktop-Monster machine. The way it always happens in this case. dEUS after decay is a lot of trainers and less interesting than the original They tried to advance to the international level with the album "The Ideal Crash" in 1999, presenting a song style that was diluted earlier. They didn't do it quite. However, the ego is still quite large. It seems: big enough for a bartender to consider himself an artist enough to try to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> Often, these things are a big mistake This The film did not cause an exception. And the bartender went for * art * in this one clearly. Another big mistake For one thing, he is a musician, not a movie director. For another person, the dEUS that makes the best is fun and inspiring music. But nothing close to what I would consider. * Art * It shows <br /> <br /> So what is this movie? Basically, it tells the story of a group of people who don't completely care about doing things that are not as interesting as on Friday, which is not entirely interesting in Antwerp because things that are not interesting happen to they The characters are superficial, plotless, totally pointless, and the film does not have any other redemption features to compensate for these shortcomings. Humor? This movie makes me smile (slightly) about 3 times and actually can laugh for 5 seconds. One (not so loud) emotion? Does this movie seem to show any emotions or feelings? Good (* Minor spoiler *) The idea of ​​"wind people" that inspires the name of the movie is fascinating, like a banana pepper pizza - not much, and has been made a thousand times before (who remember Johny Destiny - one of the worst traits of Tarantino in the movie to date) (* END MINOR SPOILER *) and it is art * so do not expect the real action to compensate for what happened first This page In other words, except for a small smile, it makes me weary of shorts. <br /> <br /> So what is left? The soundtrack is quite good, although it has problems from the same problems that other OSTs have shown recently: First, it makes the movie seem nothing more than an advertising CD. Secondly, it gives the impression that Barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the movie behind the quality of the music content which is ineffective. In the end, it makes the movie seem to be nothing more than an illustration of the song. And sadly, the Barmans contributed to the soundtrack that received the most attention, even though it was the weakest of all the soundtracks that I was concerned about. In conclusion, it just shows that Barman knows music more than movies. The operation of the camera is also OK, even if it's not everything that will make you scream in delight. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this movie that makes me watch is the factor that I see. Since I am from Antwerp, enjoy playing the game. "Guess the position." I hardly think that this is a quality thing. <br /> <br /> In summary, the opportunity again disappears for Flemish movie I still noticed that recently, the best Belgian movies have come from parts of France. Mostly because at least they have something to tell and manage to tell in a sharp and emotional manner (Daerden brothers came to mind). Perhaps the filmmakers in the Flemish house should try as well.
