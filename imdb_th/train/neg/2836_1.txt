I saw this clearly visible festival on the video rack. And before I got the first VCR, I thought I would do it with this little gem and it was the worst movie! <br /> <br /> The conversation is hilarious, unintentionally. And it has a cameo with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is mysteriously in there. And like Christopher Walken, who seems to want to perform in every bad movie in the following years, this movie is Quinn's Country Bears. <br /> <br /> It looks like "Shut up and let me fight !!!" <br /> <br /> And "You say a lot of shit!" <br /> <br /> And a precious return: "Unfortunately it's sh_it. , sh_it that is very angry! "<br /> <br /> You will be shocked by the fighting scene while bowing SOMMERSAULT on the billiard table! And a good kung fu kick when she comes out of the roll! Chop Action Socks and T and A are excited !!! <br /> <br /> Which schlock movie fans can ask for more? Oh, and when Mr Quinn's character killed himself and came back to haunt Bo as a ghost, she asked him why he committed suicide and dealt with a debilitating illness. He said, "The real person doesn't eat Quiche." <br /> <br /> Ah, yes. If Bo is a smart cookie, she will call for the shaman immediately!
