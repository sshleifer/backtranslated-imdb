I can't say that I like this movie very much. But there are some amusing moments But seems unable to decide whether it is a comedy or drama But it didn't work the same way But it doesn't make a lot of sense. Things that seem to happen without reason and it's very complex. Will say that the ending is a climate against But that means that the rest of the movie actually created what it didn't just end, and that I didn't find it really boring. Kills reluctant and weak 3/10
