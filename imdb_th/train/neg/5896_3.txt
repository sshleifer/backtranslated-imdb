Unanswered calls, another Asian horror based on mobile phones I just rented a Korean horror movie using a mobile phone named "Pon". The only missed calls are boring like that. Maybe the phone may not be scary or something But this move is boring and boring. There is no tension or excitement for me and the last monster looks frustrating and merciless. This film dragged a lot of parts and felt too long. Not interested me It seems that the phone is difficult to make scary. It's like trying to make the vending machine creepy. And it is ridiculous to compare this with "The Ring". It seems that all Asian horror films will be compared to this. If wanting a horror director - remove the phone from the request as a horror device
