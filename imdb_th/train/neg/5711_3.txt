National treasures are more valuable and higher than possible. Nicholas Cage is not a reliable action hero and this movie is not "Indiana Jones". People who compare this movie to the classic trilogy of Indian Jones has fallen out of serious wobbles. <br /> <br /> I can't understand what kind of target audience that this film was filming. Maybe the audience before teens will like But I think it's definitely ridiculous. I can't imagine that an adult or a young person will find that it is a great movie. Just put on: It's okay. The best. <br /> <br /> National treasure. No one expected and without mercy. What it has from "Da Vinci Code" I would like to wait for the film to be released in 2006 and through this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​being able to easily steal the Declaration of Independence and run Went around Washington DC and Philadelphia with it (while never breaking it once) while fighting with "bad guys" and experiencing what should be "Non-stop action" is ridiculous. I like the scene, especially the Declaration that folds in its pipe, resting in the middle of a busy road while the car strikes without destroying it. Oh, brother! <br /> <br /> Remind me to think of the episode of "Brady Bunch" where they go to the amusement park and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plan except the Brady Bunch episode is much better than this movie! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a large treasure that no one believed was buried inside the US secret ruins. Indeed, there are thousands of "priceless" items in this treasure trove! nonsense!! <br /> <br /> The worse and the speed and precision that Cage finds and thinks what should be "hard" for these ancient riddles that existed before the latter! Oh .. humanity! <br /> <br /> The performances by Cage, Voight and other actors in "National Treasure" are stiff and flat as they come. However, when you work with scary conversations, it's hard to make a 100% wrong actor for that story. <br /> <br /> National treasures are movies, okay to see once. I can't recommend more and will not buy these things on top of foreign treasure hunters. <br /> <br /> Rent if you have to see it first .......
