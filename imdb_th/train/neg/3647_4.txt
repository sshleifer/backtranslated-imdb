It's a good thing that I didn't watch while I was pregnant. I would cry and / or vomit for sure. It is a gruesome story. Personally, I think the cute baby in a way that twists himself.

Almost cried when she scratched the cat with a blood membrane But as being creepy and scary as a baby, I was rooted to live and twisted into a movie that I was so intrigued to see the sequel ....... ....... .. ....... ......... ......... ......... ...... ...
