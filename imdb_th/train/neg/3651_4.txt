I expect the movie to be very funny. But I got a movie that had a few jokes and many things that didn't work. I do not like the idea of ​​bringing the descendants of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty to confuse them. Would be funny if they just had a new person instead of Moriarty resurrected Something is funny. Bert Kwouk is very funny. As always, McCloud on the horse is a joke. McGarrett from Hawaii 5-0 can't be like McGarrett. It's obvious that Connie Booth is very good with accents She came from Indiana But playing English and New Yorkers well Unfortunately, she didn't offer anything in the script. I expect to be more funny movies. But I get a movie that is quite confusing with bad scripts Ironically because both Booth and Cleese were together in this Maybe they will break up in 77
