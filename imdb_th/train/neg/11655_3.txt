I am very disappointed with this movie. I think "Scary Movie" even though it's not a great movie. It's good and very funny. "Scary Movie 2" On the other hand, it is boring, not funny and silly. br /> Amityville's illusion / cheating is probably the best part of the movie. James Woods is a wonderful person. <br /> <br /> Now I will admit that I'm disadvantaged because I have never seen a few movies. The story that this parody is different From the first time I saw them all But bad jokes are still a bad joke. <br /> <br /> The real pain of this movie is the moment that destroys something that might be a good joke. Scenes and gags go a long way. <br /> <br /> There are also repeated jokes. For example, the bird that speaks OK, it's funny the first time and maybe the second time. But it is still being repeated to the point that is annoying Routine between a guy, a wheelchair and Hanson (Chris Elliott) is a joke at first. But it still gets repeated and stupid and even tasteless. <br /> <br /> Some jokes are repeated from the first movie, for example, 'creaming'. I guess you'll call it Cindy ( Anna Faris) is a joke in "Scary Movie" because Cindy tries to keep her boyfriend's sex for a long time, that is, he has blue balls from hell and It's funny when he 'creams' her, but this time it's out of place and not funny. <br /> <br /> Bathrooms and sexual humor in general are more fun and time out first. Sit's humor is too much and is not necessary in the second movie. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling is annoying and there is no place in this movie. <br /> <br /> But I enjoy Shorty (Marlon ) Wayans), in my opinion, is the most fun character in the first movie The scene with him and the potted plant is one of my favorites from the second movie. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me wrong. I love Wayans family and their humor. That is why this movie is very frustrating .. They have more comic abilities than endless jokes.
