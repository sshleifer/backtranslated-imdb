The camera works - why is the camera working on this movie so scary? This is annoying and distracting. Fixing - the flash of still images is too short. Many scenes are too short, too. Just blinking sounds - background music is too loud and muted. One should not have to go back and play repeatedly to catch what is said. No one checks these things and makes them do it again. Please reduce the background music volume in the future. Adjusting the relative volume is the work of the editor Julia Wong or not? The plot has a way that is too loose. The basic story has potential. I think this movie needs more work. Hurry? Maybe they may run out of money Like many movies, it's a great start. But just finished talking I don't really understand this. You know that you have a storyboard before you start production, so why aren't you taking care of the storyboard? <br /> <br /> Sorry, very important
