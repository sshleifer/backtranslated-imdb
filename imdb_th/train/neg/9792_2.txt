It should be the first time I read manga and have my content based on differences. <br /> <br /> This anime makes me very disappointed. The things left behind are just chaffs of what might be possible. Many characters lack the depth seen in manga. Alucard is not a sympathetic character who wishes to die secretly. Walter's story lacks betrayal. And the villains of the Nazis who planned to swallow the world in a completely absent war Anime gives villainous gangs an identity who defeats what seems possible. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is not that anime is different from cartoons.
