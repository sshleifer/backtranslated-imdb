It seems to be true in the movie style starring Dolph Lundgren. That's terrible! I don't know if it's true that the story is full of holes or that dolphins are bad performers. There is no spoiler here, he seems to be over-set, pushing and pushing and grabbing and touching things in this movie. In my opinion, it is surprising that some of these projects find funds to enter cans and theaters.
