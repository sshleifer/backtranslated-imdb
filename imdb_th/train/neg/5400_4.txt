This is just a short period of gore-filled festivals with the story of Stephen King. Two tabloid journalists, one person in the season (Miguel Ferrer) and another one that was unsuccessful (Julie Entwell) began to believe that serial killers A stranger than a stranger is a vampire. Today, he doesn't have his wings naturally. But by Cessna Black, he sought his victims. The blood is horrible when the film approaches the final scene of stupidity. Please note that Mr. King is not involved in this film I admit that it's a little scary at night.
