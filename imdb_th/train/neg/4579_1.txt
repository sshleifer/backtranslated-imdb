"What do we know in the treble!" Was one of the worst moments I spent watching movies. It is a movie that is less and more special after school. But at the same time, nothing special The attempt to tell the story that they have based their ideas on is completely pathetic, which almost everyone will tell you. Marlee Matlin in her underwear shouldn't happen I won't be with it What I will reveal is the criticism that many people cannot determine. This film, while boring, has problems in reasoning. It is frighteningly controversial because it uses manipulation to become the creator of your life. Interconnections have been described as a big party of our existence. However, the movie encourages us to control the environment with our minds. It's completely ignored that there are others who have a mind that can control us, which seems to be more than that. Or at least the building that we have is very limited to us. In this way, the movie is improperly modified. Persuasion and interconnections only But don't mix unless you are a great God If you are, you will be impressed with all the exquisite things that this movie will reveal that you can. If not, you will be greatly disappointed or both. In addition, the name is ridiculous. I have a problem warning people not to watch movies because I feel mentally retarded. Embarrassed by everyone involved
