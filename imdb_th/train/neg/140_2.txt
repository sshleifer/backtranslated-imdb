Valentine is a horror movie This is what I think: <br /> <br /> Acting: Terrible. Katherine Heigl can't do it. Another story is not better. <br /> <br /> Story: The story doesn't matter. This film has the potential to be a great movie, but it fails Remember Prescott? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: don't see Valentine. It's a very stupid movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br />
