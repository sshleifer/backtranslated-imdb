As a big fan of the Flashman book by George McDonald Fraser, I look forward to seeing Flashy on the big screen when this movie first debuted. Sadly, it was a big disappointment, so I left it alone for 20 years before returning again. But it's not better than the second time. Mr Fraser is a highly skilled writer. But I'm not a fan of his screenplay with Richard Lester. The passion for hurt makes 'The Three Musketeers' for me and the same way here. For me, the tone and all the feelings of this movie are incorrect. Flashman books are funny in some parts. But is an adventure novel There is a serious adventure that Flashman has - he is involved in a dangerous situation. This is a relay in the novel. But did not get any media in the movie due to its funny style It is a shame to have a great movie if it has been altered in the form of a more honest book. When I first read that this book would be filmed, the article said that the film was a star Oliver Reed. I'm glad to be the best of Flashman. How do I love to see him in this role? Malcolm McDowell is a good actor. But not suitable for the visual image of Flashman created from the book (Looks too unsightly! Flashman should be a big friend.) Never mind. Reed is excellent, just like Bismarck. The thing that killed this movie was that it was created as a comedian. The only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of this book is the scene in which Flashman kills De Guatre (Tom Bell). The great shame as being the production of costumes, costumes and other great things And the casting is excellent. In general - everyone in this film is different from Malcolm McDowell. It is possible that the director of Richard Lester will be responsible for the adaptation of the film Each of the adjustment was on the radio recently, of 'Flash For Freedom' was adapted by Mr Fraser, which works quite well. Maybe one day we might see Flashman doing justice on the screen.
