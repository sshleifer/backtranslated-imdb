Just watched this after hearing about the bad and wanting to see myself Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments here, you won't be able to understand how scary the movie is, although it must be one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen! Never bothered to post comments here first But this shit is really guaranteed. <br /> <br /> At first, the plot is totally ridiculous and ridiculous. Brother of the lead character (Either Ben or Arthur, I forgot which one and honestly it was not very clear) wanted to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in the eyes - 'T then there are other scandals About a gay couple's ex-wife who tried to force him to marry her again at the point of attack This leads to emptiness. But giving the most fun conversation in all "movies" - "I don't make sense, right? You don't make sense! <br /> <br /> Then there was a brutal performance. It must be seen to believe. My personal favorite is a civil rights lawyer thrown with stones that is clearly she is reading her script clearly. Enough. Gay couples are less convincing. There is an ambiguous and innocent man who is attractive and his boyfriend looks like a small little cartoon of Bistro. Only fatter <br /> <br /> "Movies" have been filmed by people who cannot hold the camera remotely, and the number of errors throughout is amazing. The whole thing starts with a fat man on the bed with a pair of boots. Yes, <br /> <br /> However, we all know how bad this thing is, so I want to highlight the most precious funny moments that "Movies" give <br /> <br /> - When the fat people put the church in the fire and like a six year old girl across the parking lot to escape hilarious <br /> <br /> - Brave! There is no idea what her relationship with the main character is - sometimes they know her, sometimes not doing anything. But she appeared in some hilarious scenes. <br /> <br /> - Lawyers threw stones. But she is funny that she should be worth talking about. <br /> <br /> - The dinner of the evil brother of the crackers he put for his guests. <br /> <br /> - Against the evil brother, gay potion <br /> <br /> - The cat of the evil brother <br /> <br /> - The ending that I will not give up because it must be believed. I remind you, make sure you don't eat at the time !!!! The main character of the lard / director / producer has been naked. It stinks. <br /> <br /> In general, Ben and Arthur are terrible. But didn't intend But it's the most funny thing that you will find for a long time unintentionally Indeed, there is nothing good about the excuse for this film. The director's fool can also create a credit to open a joke by writing his own name about 15 times.
