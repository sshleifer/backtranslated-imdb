Please collect your money and go to see other things. This movie is nonsense. I don't want to go But I have to think so I think I will laugh at least once. NOPE is not a single laugh. It's scary! Chris kattan will not receive a good comedy after this and "One night at roxbury". Listen to me and stray from this movie as much as you can!
