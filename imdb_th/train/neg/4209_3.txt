"I'm a cartoon!" "You are an example!" What does that mean! This plot should not be worse than when the boy who feared everything bravely at the end of the movie because he entered the library. The only purpose of this celluloid is to encourage American children to read when the cheaper and more effective ways to do this may be an advertisement! Even the abilities of Macaulay Culkin (as a child), Christopher Lloyd (as expected "that he is a Page Master" librarian) can record this pointless movie from a boring plot. Even the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, (even) Leonard Nimoy, or Hollywood God of voices, Frank Welker as a cartoon does not save lives. I can explain that it was 1990, equivalent to the terrifying adaptations of Water Babies, even in 1978, because ordinary animations make this movie worse, not boring updates!
