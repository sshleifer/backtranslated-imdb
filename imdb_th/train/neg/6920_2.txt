Body Slam (1987) is a very scary movie. Low budget reeks. Directions are pedestrians. (The best) and writing and acting are lame But if you enter the old school wrestling (around the 1970s and mid-80s), you will get more entertainment than the general audience. I have to warn you, this movie has a foul odor on the ice. I give both because I feel like being generous. This turkey is "directed" by Mr. Hal Nadim, the star is Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and Scop wrestler and c-list performer (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> Summary of "The movie" This story is about promoters who want to include me rock "and wrestling, but others who don't want him to succeed are more, but I don't want to destroy it for you. If you can show a story that is not good and ridiculous, there will be a few surprises that are nearing the end for wrestling fans. <br /> <br /> I won't recommend this to a worse enemy. me (And I mean)
