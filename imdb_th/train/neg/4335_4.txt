Movies and performances are not bad and J Hernandez works well in playing Calito Brigante, but this movie will forget that it should be a popular movie. The creators of this prequel do not look at the traditional way of Carlito, or at least not interested in continuity This movie is a prequel, which means that the original movie has given us a history and this movie should end when the original movie begins or at least leads to that movie. Not one of Carlito's old friends who appeared in this film. They didn't talk about Luis Guzman, Pachanga in the original in the movie. But he plays a completely different character The originals originated in 1975 and the prequel occurred in 1969-70. Considering this movie happened less than 5 years earlier, wouldn't you think that one of Carlito's long-time friends would appear? In the traditional way, Carlito started out of jail after spending 5 years in prison. That was only a few months between the end of the prequel and the beginning of the original! *** Semi Spoiler *** We know from the beginning. Carlito spent 5 years in prison, so when Prekie gave Hollywood a happy ending, it was the insult of the original fans' fans. What happened? Up to Gail? It's a lack of continuity that makes this film straight into the video release.
