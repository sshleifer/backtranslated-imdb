This story has to be one of the worst movies of all time. Scary performances, scary scripts ... and they are a good spot! Who definitely missed! Jokes if you can call them as a pathetic matter Pamela Anderson still rely on her body to divert attention from her performance like plastic! I sit to give a chance, hoping that it will improve, which, alas, can't! If it's an option between this book and I suggest you read that well! I like Denise Richards, which is the reason why I released this movie. But why did you let her cast in this movie? It's over me!
