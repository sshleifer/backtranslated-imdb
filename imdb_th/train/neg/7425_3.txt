This boring Las Vegas watched the movie robbed in almost impossible to watch and participate in what you 'watched' if you had nothing better to do. The only good thing in this movie is that both of them were attracted to Stella Stevens and the other one spent the whole time hoping that she would fall in one of the stingy tops she put Many great pictures in the mid-70s of Las Vegas (when it's still a great place to visit) and the fashion of the day is also good for giggling as well. Otherwise, one big yawn The Rhino DVD has a very good widescreen transfer. But even under 10 dollars, it is still not worth my humble idea
