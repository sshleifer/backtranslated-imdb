Weak, lame, weak !!! 90 minutes, cringe, festivals 89 minutes, too long The setting is full of atmosphere and possibilities. (The abandoned convent) was bombarded by the stench of the script filled with ridiculous and ridiculous conversations that were too stressful. Most are just embarrassing and the efforts of gonzo horror fall (example of the dialogue of this movie: after showing up on her big gun and shooting a dolly quickly to the powerful character of Barbeau? Bad performances, funny, silly, homophobic and judging from the monster effects. It seems that the directors watched 'The Evil Dead' too many times. <br /> <br /> I owe my big friend for Renting turkeys and letting them lose for ninety minutes, they won't come back. Something boring
