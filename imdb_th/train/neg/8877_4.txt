'Major Payne' is a major film that makes life a living hell for his small boys in the sea. This film has nothing to do. But it has many fun moments that are worth watching Don't expect it to be a memorable movie. Just expect to laugh your way through movies and other people's expenses. The confrontation between Major Payne and the fat boy is a joke, and that's all I remember about the movie, except the boy who wanted to revenge Major Payne again. You want laughter
