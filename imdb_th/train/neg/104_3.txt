On the way to the small town, laying the exit along the beaten path (But looking closer to the expressway suspiciously) A female journalist ran to a stranger knot who agreed to help guide her to her destination. The strange man tells a terrifying pair of tales that connect with the area: in the first story, the plan for a married couple to commit adultery to kill a woman's husband. But eventually suffered a worse fate when they were attacked by zombies; And in the second story, the group of the camps had a short holiday when the outlaw culprit used offensive with his grave. <br /> <br /> Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and the director. Brad Sykes, creating a zombie poetry is a good idea. But there are only two things that will be greatly shortened And that is not the only way that the flick of this low budget fails to deliver: the performance is scary (with Joe Haggerty as the storyteller Ebenezer Jackson, who tells this story to the most bizarre performance I've ever seen. ); The place is not affected; Boring script There are sex scenes that do not have nudity and the ending ... is the belief that begging <br /> <br /> For justice, some of Sykes' creative cameras are effective. (Although the technique is used as a character that runs through the forest as a tad Use too much) and Joe Castro's stabbed blood is eager: the ears are bitten, the eyeball is pulled out, the face is removed, the brain is squeezed and the head is cut. These advantages will make this film able to watch. But should be warned. The Zombie Chronicles did not walk in the park, even for viewers with z-grade trash experience. <br /> <br /> Let me give The Zombie Chronicles 2 / 10th place, but increase the rank. Unselfishly 3 because I didn't watch this movie with the advantages of 3D (although I have doubts about sneaking that the extra dimension doesn't make a lot of difference)
