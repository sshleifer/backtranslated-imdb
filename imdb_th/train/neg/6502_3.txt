Given the opportunity to write, direct, and act in my own movie, I might choose something about a female robot with a gun. However, Anthony Hopkins decided to make the strangest movie ever. "Slipstream" is a strange movie that even David Lynch might look at the person next to him and say 'What happened?' <br /> <br /> This is the first movie in the scene. A man crosses the road towards the yellow car facing the right, which suddenly turns into a pink car facing the left. This is a movie that the two characters have conversations with, people laughing and insects climbing up the wall. This is a movie that a man started talking about "Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers", specifically for the actor of that film that will appear as himself. (And disappeared in the air) <br /> <br /> This is a movie that decides to leave the corresponding plot needs out of the window and use fifteen different modifications while doing so. To change from black and white to color without reason. <br /> <br /> But I have to praise Mr. Hopkins for choosing his actor in this movie. (Some people show many characters) All those involved throw themselves into their roles, even though they may not know what they are doing. My favorite place here is the Christian Slater gangsta in an impressive hat that is ridiculously ridiculous and singing the American anthem. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins claims that he made a movie. This story is funny and that may be the best way to conclude "Slip Stream". It's a joke for the audience. You will watch from beginning to end, trying to understand what happened and hopefully the answer will come only to discover that the answer doesn't actually happen. What this pearl is a joke is that Anthony Hopkins only knows. <br /> <br /> I talked about David Lynch earlier and I am a big fan of the director. That I guess Anthony Hopkins will share his love for "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Lost Highway". However, "Slipstream" is not as satisfying as in Lynch's films, even though imitating many of his techniques. (Although I was surprised to find that no one spoke back in "Slipstream") It's too busy and random - when this reviewer points out that Alzheimer's disease is a movie version. There is no doubt that a small number of people can watch this thing and pull something from it. Unfortunately for the rest of us, "Slip Stream" will become an annoying and confusing experience that arises because of Hopkins' involvement quickly. <br /> <br /> See your own risk.
