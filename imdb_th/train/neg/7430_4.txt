It is interesting to see how Pierce Brosnan's career was before Bond arrived at the scene. In this "stressful" thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays as a gentle Patrick, who works with leading slum children in "Confidence course" He loves a woman who has children lining up on the middle standard called Eric. The drunken ex-husband of the woman came to the scene and became involved with Pierce. <br /> <br /> In one step, Pierce was doing "vegeburgers" innocent. The vegeburgers, then the husband, attacked Pierce, a small piece of half-meat carnivore, calling from Pierce's mouth. The fight ends immediately without showing results. This is as good as the movie gets. <br /> <br />
