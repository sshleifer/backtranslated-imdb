Not my vile thoughts But I want to cover myself As executive producer, Morgan Freeman wanted the audience to overlook the absurdity of the characters in 10 items or less, with films that were intentionally indie and absorbed in the advisor / everything. You can do it - the theme he played as a universe. The real Morgan Freeman alternative that was cleaned in a semi-formal way is the Econovan by the children to Carson, CA from Brentwood to study the role. His next film Why is Carson so enigmatic? Living in Cal, he can record travels and go anywhere in the San Fernando Valley and find the same elements. Paz Vega looks cute, opposite between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, playing an unsatisfactory grocery checker. In a large local market But slowly, which is clearly the best source for Moragn Freeman's research. His character is known as "He" only, referring to the actors being praised in real life by the common people - " Psst, that is 'He', etc. Unfortunately, I felt too distracted that he had all kinds of worldly wisdom, but unreliable advice returned to his home in Brentwood, without cash or debit cards. Or have the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him if a high opinion of themselves if they believe they have the answer. Everything like he did, so I had to see the cash and the berry that showed good intelligence and survival instincts in order to keep the big ego that he had. Of course, nothing actually happened in this movie. Believe that the two main characters Changed from their confrontation with each other, it played adultery with the idea of ​​adultery But after that I thought that making this murmur for me was similar to Steve Martin's Shopgirl without sexual relations.
