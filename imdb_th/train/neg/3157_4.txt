Of course, it has some good movies. The story is good, if not polite, and the performance is good enough, even though I don't understand why Olivia d'Abo has such an obvious Australian accent if her character should be raised in the United States. However, my biggest problem is with the wardrobe. I know that, as a rule, the average American is considered an angry dresser by Europeans who respect themselves. Anna's color combination is very scary !! And a sad excuse like a potato sack for the coat she wears in this movie makes me break into hives I think the idea is as real as possible. (How many school teachers have walked in Prada?) But simplicity does not mean that it lacks true taste. Smart words ...
