I seem to initially be an interesting film, a Spanish horror movie in Madrid that is interesting today. But it's not like that. Actually, it's an interesting movie for future film directors who learn about things that shouldn't be done. Despite having an Oscar winner (Mira Sorvino), it is not enough to justify the $ 3.00 that is used to watch this movie. Go home, lead where and boring, weak and bad. Don't spend time or money in this movie.
