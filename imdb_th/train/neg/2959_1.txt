No matter what you tell, you have just the truth. "Possession" in the film industry, for example "What you have for this movie Greenlight" Religion doesn't have anything to do with it. But have a common sense That is, if your head is clear and you have a good mind to decide. <br /> <br /> At many levels, I try to rationalize that this movie will entertain .... star ? a story? Ideas like no other Buddy movies that children will love dinosaurs and black women? Next, my virtue! I'm sure this is a "thought". It sounds good, but somewhere during development ... Someone should point out that the idea cannot be translated into entertainment that anyone wants to watch or pay .. . Unless they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs And see some of the things that the rest of us can't see (What plot?) And the group Whoopie received a salary But I would be embarrassed to receive it I hope you will shoot your agent / manager / publicist in this career. Obviously, no, she went to make a movie that wasn't more good. And movies that do not improve, sorry
