I give this to 1. There are many twisted plot that you can't take root. Total physical assault Everyone is killed or almost like that. I'm tired of cross-hairs and changing views. I can't give the plot. Complicated and crazy If I had paid to see this, I would request a refund. I hope the review is more honest.
