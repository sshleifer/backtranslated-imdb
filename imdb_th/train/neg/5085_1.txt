This movie starts with an ordinary funeral ... and it is hard to confirm this ordinary funeral feeling that I lost interest in 5 minutes of watching and started crossing the scene. It seems to me that anyone who makes this film stuck in the boundaries of being permanently trapped in a terrible trance can not consider anything other than death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of the dark children from Southpark. I want a movie that within 10 minutes makes me an interesting story. I will not sit and watch 10 minutes. Nothing except the funeral preparation .. my grandmother last year. Then she was intrigued by the funeral. Maybe she would like this movie.
