Ok, first of all, this movie is terrible. But check why The proposal that the machine can change matter into energy, store and send and reassemble, at least interesting. But as far as they use this evidence Instead of penetrating deep into what might happen if someone created this type of machine, they destroyed the nasty things. This may be a good proof. Living with the responsibility of this kind of power and dealing with the constant temptation that is .. People who don't see it, but not .. They destroy the nasty things and Lembach wants to leave. So Doctor Jerry pulls. Things come together and try to transport themselves. Just to get up by the beautiful secretary But it was his mute (see) which would not have happened if Lembach had not decided to leave So now he is roaming the country, killing people because his small trials have failed and they will not give him money. Then will make the movie worse, throwing a barren English relationship between two semi-professors. The power employed to help him During the time that they loved, they tried their best to find him while killing half of London. All of this can be aimed without destroying the damn mechanism which will not happen if Lembach does not leave. This movie tries, so I give honesty to the 2 stars for the effort. But it would be better if they didn't destroy the damn machine. Damn you Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
