In most cases, this film feels like an effort. "Made for TV" The direction is Ham, punch, acting (except Fred Gwynne) is overwrought and soapy, especially Denise Crosby sent her chapters coldly for them to read the cue card. There is only one thing that makes this movie interesting and that is when Gage comes back from "Seminary". There is something disturbing about watching young children who kill people, and this movie may be more than some people can manage for a reason. that It is very scary. This film only does the right thing. But it knocked one thing out of the park Worth seeing only the last 10 minutes
