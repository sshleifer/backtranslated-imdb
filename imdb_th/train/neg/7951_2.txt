I get a low score. 'Kôhîjikô isn't because it's a bad movie. But because it didn't do anything worthy of praise, <br /> <br /> I didn't see any work of Hsiao-hsien Hou before, but for those who were not trained. (Also included) The ad 'Kôh' jikô 'is a homage to Yasujiro Ozu (Japanese director whose last film was released in 1962). <br /> <br /> <br /> Yohitoto plays the role of 'Yoko', a lost character from unemployment spent in a local coffee shop or exploring Taiwanese songwriters at her. Like Tadanobu As ano plays her friend who works in a CD shop and sometimes makes him interested in Otaku in the train And that's all. <br /> <br /> We watched that Yoko drank only one coffee ... walking around ... waiting for the train ... holding the train ... falling asleep on the train The worldly reality that everyone in Japan can see each day. Hou captures the normal moments of these characters' lives. But without any meaning to these short articles, it is a pointless movie that will be created or viewed.
