I just watched this DVD at home. We loved westerners, so my husband rented it. He started to apologize to me through half the saddles, costumes, accents - everything was closed. The part that made me very angry was that the man did not shoot "collectors" with his bow and arrow while he was sucking the souls of the fat people. His only excuse is "He left only 2 arrows." We watched it all the way and while others said ... Too many bad things to distinguish the only reason why it was sucked. I mean, the fact that the boy grabbed the bad stone from the collector in the same month and day that he found it. And why is there a grave that everyone died on April 25, but the people of the collector's spirit still walk around? If you want a fun movie after drinking a few beer, this may be your movie. However, if you want real Westerners, you will hate this movie.
