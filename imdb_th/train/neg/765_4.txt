What do they think seriously? Over the years, Columbo has experimented with new things and distracted from the usual successful formula. In general, this movie is different from other Columbo movies, but the difference is not for the sake of movies. <br /> <br /> The important thing is that this movie makes a difference from other Columbo movies. that No murder occurred. All the evidence of this film is completely different and placed the Columbo character in a completely different environment and situation. Overall, it is totally different and more 'modern'. <br /> <br /> Director Alan J. Levi made other films in the past, all of which are attached to the usual formula. It also makes it a strange choice that he was chosen to direct the film. <br /> <br /> The Columbo character felt very different, perhaps because of the reason he put it in the environment and circumstances. Totally different When he helped his nephew after the bride disappeared after the wedding The lack of good relief and the humor of Columbo didn't make this watch look good or fun. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie isn't so bad. And more ridiculous stories. It is a stupid kidnapping thriller written with stories that are becoming more and more unlikely. In addition, this film could not be viewed more and more. This is a slightly interesting Columbo that still doesn't know how to entertain the audience in some way. <br /> <br /> It's not. Has helped so much that the supporting actors are not the most talented people. Although his characters are in a completely different situation and the film was filmed in The style is completely different, but Peter Falk continued to hold well. Can you create a picture that this movie will not have him? It would be terrible and cheap movies that I can tell you. <br /> <br /> A strange Columbo program that could be described as an experiment that failed to distract from the usual formula. <br /> <br 4/10
