The first scene in the 'Problem Child' has babies facing the nuns. For this movie, there is a witty 'joke' that is disgusting and heartless. It is not appropriate for many levels as it beggars beliefs. John Ritter is a kind-hearted father who accepts children from hell and admires him to maintain his dignity in the attack of a memorable and laughing performance. Jack Warden is doing in this story? Directly directed by Dennis Dugan in an attempt to open confidence when it ended with rudeness. The movie that made out was terrible but never thought that The lowest light of all is Michael Oliver, the most disgusting child actor and unlike any other screen ever Believe me, you will slap his mouth immediately.
