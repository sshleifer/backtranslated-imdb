It makes the actors in Hollyoaks look like Royal Shakespeare Company. This movie has a jaw dropping in a scary manner. Turning off the DVD player is not enough. I want to find a responsible person for this disaster and slap them around the face. I can't get it back. Never is it possible to create a boring and spiritless drama I can not think of actions that will relieve boredom. Writing the desired ten lines is incredibly difficult for an embarrassing movie piece. What can you say more, emphasizing how awesome the show is Please avoid
