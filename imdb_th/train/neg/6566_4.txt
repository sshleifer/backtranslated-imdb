I watched this movie after having a lot of problems downloading via shareware. And I have to say that it is not appropriate. <br /> <br /> Parinda is so hyped that I waited to see it. <br /> <br /> Palin is one of those movies that Failure to comply with the standards set by other good Indian filmmakers, even though there are great stories. It's more pathetic than knowing that the story itself is not original. It is based on the classic "On the Waterfront". <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor was frustrated, especially when he came from America. The lack of quality, many times, except the scene between the two. <br /> <br /> Give this script to them. Amazed <br /> I'm not saying that Parinda is terrible. It's not good enough.
