I like many people who have seen this movie in theaters when it was first screened in '97. It's the best movie below average. "Masterpieces" that challenge these "Titanic" Boyfriends all want to make it true. First of all, DiCaprio is an awesome actor, no matter how you look. People like him because of his appearance. His "skills" are mainly acting, including talking about a lot of magic and trying to show sexy. Secondly, this movie has a plot that is quite boring and simple: the girl falls in love with the man, sends them to the sink, the scene of many cheerful love, everyone with IQ above 50 will know This thing is not creative in any way, not original. Plus the director felt that having to drag it out for more than 3 hours, I was able to compress it into a 1 hour blog without losing any plot. In conclusion, "Titanic" is the most updated movie. Up until now Why is it getting attention and money that is above me?
