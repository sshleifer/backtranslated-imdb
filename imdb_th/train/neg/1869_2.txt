The veteran Bruno Mattee stayed with it again with an exciting thriller that reflected the voice of Joel Schumacher 8 mm clearly, but as expected, Mattei made his movie in Economical - to make it look vague when it was just launched. <br /> <br /> After her daughter was kidnapped The kidnapper belongs to an international organization that directs this movie as long as special customers pay well. Searching for her daughter not only But led the mother throughout Europe But also including prostitution She went to bed with some men to receive her clues. Finally, when she contacted the organization led by the mysterious doctor Hades, she was in serious danger herself. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good to say about this, even if it starts a contract. The problem is that this movie is not a movie that is not as hard or clear as anyone would expect from a director who created a movie such as BLADE VIOLENT SNUFF TRAP (which was first released in Russia!). Nude and sex to attract the attention of the audience The plot is not as special, except perhaps for many different places throughout Europe. The ending is very disappointing. The show didn't stand out as well, except for Anita Auer, who played Doctor Hades: She looks very eerie. You don't want to meet you like this in a dark alley. (Or your bedroom for that) <br /> <br /> All SNUFF TRAP attracts attention from Bruno Mattei's movie collectors, but it is good to see this man come back to take the helm again. : It was his first thriller since 1994.
