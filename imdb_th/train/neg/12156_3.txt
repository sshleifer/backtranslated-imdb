Jesus Christ, I can't believe that I wasted time watching this movie. I just watched because there was a crush on Jordan Ladd. But watching this movie made me almost make her This is terrible! I should have watched more of the Survivor Series 93. <br /> <br /> The leading actor in this story is polite and extraordinary. I would love if Mistuharu Misawa Tiger Drove, the great '91, got his ass through the glass window. I'm angry every time he says "lake" and "cabin". I'll kick his ass. <br /> <br /> Jordan Ladd. On the other hand, it's great. True angel But she can't help the most of this joke Sadly, she acted as if she didn't act when she used that medicine. It looked hilarious. <br /> <br /> I like the bit that Jordan accidentally made six yogurt with her. It reminds me of the time ... Never mind. <br /> <br /> Anayways watch this movie because it's terrible.
