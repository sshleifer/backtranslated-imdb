This movie is slow. But boring and the performances tend to float in the ham land Redgrave's character is not interesting, while 60 women try to compete with Thurman 20 stories to love the Fox character. (Why over me) The name of the movie should be "People on shallow lakes" actors play like they are in rehearsals. Horrible predictable end to boot I can't believe this is a joke on this website!
