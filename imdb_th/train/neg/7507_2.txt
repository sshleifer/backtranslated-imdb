This movie is bad news and I'm really amazed at the level of talent that has been seen to appear in junk like this. I imagine that there are a few strangling agents spread across Hollywood Blvd as a result of this failure. What really gets you is that it's a good thing. Star directors, appeals and stories are enough to generate interest and sell tickets. But this is a failure Many stories are arranged from bad images to ignorance at the end, and you will feel like a mouse in a maze looking for pieces of cheese that have become rotten. The hindrance is the revenge of the Italian people who might have overcome him when he was a child or insulted him because of the large number of films that made the old and obnoxious Italian people Like the movie Spike Lee, some people think that the photographer, the photographer, is stimulating and magical. He has the talent to grab your mind and lead you to his vision if there are only a few memorable scenes. But the question remains ... You can endure the head scratching for 2 hours and watch the clock while you are wondering and wait for the ending to be somewhere.
