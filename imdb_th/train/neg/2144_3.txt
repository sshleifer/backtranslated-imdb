I always thought that Cinderella II was the worst movie I have ever seen (followed by Peter Pan 2 and other sequels such as The Lion King 2 and Notre Dame's Hunchback 2). All of these films were created with the same concept. Since the movie does not have a plot, they try to do that by filling out a joke. I'm not saying bad jokes But they do most of the movies The first time I watched a movie, I would give 1/10, but now I miss it. Most kids don't care how good the original movie is. They just care that this movie is entertaining. I still think that this movie is a bad sequel. But that doesn't mean it's scary. Now I think it deserves 3/10
