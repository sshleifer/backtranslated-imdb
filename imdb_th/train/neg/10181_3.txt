This movie is very funny. It was the actor Scott Backtela as some coach. But that is not important. The important thing is the big black friend who plays the first base. First of all, he must be at least 75 years old, but still playing second league baseball. He started the movie on the field, even if unable to walk. Coach Backula cleverly claimed to claim that when he tried to run, he Still in the same place for too long. Backula shows a more excellent coach strategy at the end of this film (SPOILER). He told his young players. The "city" to hit a home run, obviously. He hit home runs and won the game for his team, which is a minor group playing in the film, which is a major in the film. Now, if only the Royals manager Tony Muser would be a smart coach like Backula and tell his players to go home in every bats, The Royals will never end the game.
