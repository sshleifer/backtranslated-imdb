First thing first: I'm not a conservative person. And even though I don't call myself liberal or democratic But I disagree with the war in Iraq from the first day. I think it's safe to say that John Cusack and I may see eye-to-eye politics. Actually, I'm sure we will become drinking friends if we have to mention how great Adam Curtis's BBC documents are. My point is: Do not discredit reviews, thinking that I'm not part of the choir. Cusack is preaching in War, Inc. No questions. The politics of WI is designed to attract my population, but the problem is cutting. The stitches were not so good and the movie Cusack co-wrote and produced the stars that were worse than the cheap suits. <br /> <br /> When they said that "The road to hell is paved with good intentions," Cusack, his co-author, director Joshua Seftel and even related actors, has no doubt had the intention of creating an anti-war movie every time that bite and joke like Robert Altman M * A * S * H ​​Unfortunately for the audience They ended up being unconscious and unwise, like Michael Moore's Canadian bacon. <br /> <br /> The current state of US politics, foreign policy, and the "effort" war are nonsense and result in tragedy. so pity And sad comedy - just watch The Daily Show and see for yourself The bottom line is: You can't write funny content like Bush gives us every day, so why try to compete? <br /> <br /> WI's main problem is that it feels like it's hurting to put together to accomplish Cusack. In general, Grosse Pointe Blank (one of his best films) changed the setting and crammed in the shopping list of ideas raised from Naomi Klein's collected works. Most of these ideas were In the first twenty minutes of the movie, and what makes them nasty is that there are no jokes or jokes or clear references to Halliburton, Neo-Cons and US occupation of Iraq. Written blindly by their own beliefs, they felt that just citing these problems, the movie would be funny and overthrow. The problem is ... It's not right now. These thoughts are news of the past. And if you are not under or rock or blinded by ignorance, refusal and foolishness (read: right-wing Christian) these jokes insult them. <br /> <br /> Maybe WI may be able to use if It is more delicate than being destroyed and fatter with thorough research / career insights. As it is funny and funny, the whole surface is bad and with a little finesse or sarcasm. They do more than make me groan. Homer Simpson once said, "It's funny." Because it's true. "And The Daily Show has proved this every night. War, Inc. proves that just because it's not true. Make it funny. Bottom line: No need to be hyperactive when talking about Lamphun US / Neo-Conservative politics ... It's a fairly big joke. <br /> <br /> http: //eattheblinds.blogspot. com /
