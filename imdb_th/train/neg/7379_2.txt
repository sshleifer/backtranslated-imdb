What is Steven Seagal thinking? I mean, at first I loved Seagal. I loved all his movies until the middle of 2000. His first thing was the best in the genre. However, this is not in the name of the great attack force (along with supporter Marshall Lawson {Seagal}). It is expected to be an action movie that doesn't care about Seagal in the form of a single ass kick. normal However, what we get is the mystery of the crime that is surrounded by political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is always in the shadows because of his weight. I can't follow this story. There are people who mutate into superhumans when they take medicine. What happened in this movie The voice of Seagal is a disgrace to the peers and disgrace. Why dubbed the man? The story is terrible. This is a 2/10 from me because the scene in which Seagal asks to have a reservation, even though there is an army with him and a hilarious fight scene in which Segal hurls his hand like a girl turns the camera! "Revenge is a two way street" Siegel said in this movie ... Forget Steven's revenge, you have to redeem!
