Not long ago, I was almost obsessed with the predictions of this film. When seeing it today, score 5.8 is completely understandable. I think if you expect something so much that it becomes a terrible need, it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course, The Hills Have Eyes 2 has its time. It has a very cool and well-developed story that is really linked to the product, but things are pampered to become difficult to follow. And if it's not for Wes Craven's production in this movie, it probably doesn't have to do with the original remake. <br /> <br /> But all makes you "This should be a horror or a joke, right?" Because there are many ridiculous jumps, random shoots and stupid torpedoes (IE "have hands on sh ** er!" Or "motherfu ** uh! I will kill you all. B ** tches! ") And the show (God doesn't remind me how bad it is. <br /> <br /> STORILE: (This part has a spoiler. Be careful. !) The movie begins with a woman who gave birth to a mutant baby (ooh la la!) And the screen faded to black, with the movie name appearing and speaking alone. Then we went to this office with a puppet. Random war battles, we find that this is for scientists God's people Of people who are looking for box mutations to track lost audio feeds and everyone dies! After opening the audio settings, you expect more. <br /> <br /> Then we go to this team. Training a new recruits in Baghdad while their parade captain "Good work in foolishness" The last day of training was in New Mexico, which is the desert of the family during their stay. Use them stuck While in training, things are wrong. Eventually, people die and ... Do I have to tell you again? Because now I have the interest of the goldfish that forced me to sit here and type this thing. <br /> <br /> The wrong thing with THHE2 is that it doesn't work. There is no backward story here and the ending is quite safe ... but with a twist! The fool is that I'm pretty sure the super super cut director, hologram and tickets to The Hills Have Eyes 3 will show all other endings. But at this point I'm not sure I'm interested. > <br /> So, by all means, if you love their first lot, it's almost a sin to not see this thing, all by seeing it. But if otherwise avoid all costs For your own benefit <br /> <br /> 3/10
