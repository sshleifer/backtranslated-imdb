1 of 10 <br /> <br /> This is the type of movie that you don't believe you will die for 2 hours when you see the credit role. I honestly think that I can create a better vampire movie .... and I don't know anything. The only thing that not only sucked (more difficult than the Vampire) is that Jason Scott Lee .... His character, at least, is a little bit cool. There are puzzles and a little butt kick
