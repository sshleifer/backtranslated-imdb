I have high hopes for this film, because I think CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first film) is absolutely great. The absolute low budget movie I have ever seen. Utterly and flat The scene behind the scenes seems to be randomly mixed without thinking of a story or character. <br /> <br /> Is Claire trying to escape from being a prostitute? It's hard to tell why she was fooled at the airport if she wanted to escape from that life? Why didn't you pick up the tricks when you needed money in Seattle? Why do we have to see her dyeing her hair with the same true color? Why does Claire accept some parts of John and not others? The filmmakers don't seem to know. <br /> <br /> It feels like everything has been improved. (Although I understand that this is not the case) and the filmmakers hold the camera as if they were creating. True documentary <br /> <br /> After the screening of the film I saw, Kerrigan defended his narrative selection by condemning the film as a political conservative. It sounds like the rhetoric learned. I think it was the police
