I can name many funny movies. There are comedies that are set to be funny and have Some movie trailers such as Gymkata are serious. But ended up with a joke. Ladies Man is a movie that tries to be funny. But may not be less funny if it is about a man with a lot of chicks in the middle of the ruins of a nuclear disaster It's anti-funny. <br /> <br /> I don't think I'm laughing harder than laughing in this movie. it's easy It's boring, dumb, berserk, bothering, incredible, but not funny. I'm not interested in Tim Meadows in particular or the characters from this SNL, but I expect it to be better. It's like the script writer had his bag on his head while he was typing and he couldn't see the key that he pressed. They told the "origin" of Ladies Man but didn't include motivation for passion. With his bizarre performances as if it were still seventy The movie tries to make humor out of a man who seems to be satisfied with pornography shortly after he tries to hang himself. Is this funny? I like to think of myself with a sharp sense of humor. (It takes a lot of time to write a comedy as I do), but maybe I'm not bright enough for this movie. <br /> <br /> Very funny, like Tucker in something about Mary. So much here I pleaded with him in the head to close. <br /> <br /> At the end, I smashed my chair, mumbling under my breath, and if this film disappeared again. This movie may not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it's the first movie that I see near. <br /> <br />
