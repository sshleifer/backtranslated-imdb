This movie is probably very good. (Because it has some interesting places), but it was never too tall than a caricature of arrogance The show was severely flawed and there were times when I cringed so violently that I thought I was going to fall from the theater seat. No, and I mean, I've never watched this Godawfull piece .... Danish cinema has received many benefits in recent years. But if the parts of .... cross the border, I am afraid that no one will have a Danish movie. This movie is the reason I chose to register here. I feel that I have to steer people away from this thing .... My sympathy goes out to people who go to the cinema to see this.
