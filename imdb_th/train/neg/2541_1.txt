Never seen the original movie in the series ... I just hoped it would be a better movie than this, or the sequel created in 1980, as if it were not a cruel sequel to these two sectors. This film has a very good leadership when they advertise to show in an old independent station that had been in the past. It looks like it's a scary movie. However, it was a movie that would make the Walt Disney movie look really dark. This movie is just a bunch of fluffy, almost no life creek creeks to see. Only true vision near the end, when you see its shape during a very heavy rain, and there is no sign of a truly disappointing creature like a child. Will have to kill everything they see and after the creek and living creatures go out to help them or have random people in the forest that like to pull random boats through the water Not worth watching But I wanted to see the original, licensed by the manufacturer, which would make the living thing worse in the 80s, but he made a very good movie in the 70s "The Town the Dreaded Sundown"
