As a real Elvis fan, this movie is completely embarrassing and the script is a disaster. This film was released with the beautiful son "Stay Away" and the scenery of the Grand Canyon makes the audience hope for something special. Elvis came into the picture and his talent wasted a lot of time, especially the rest of the song. I sat watching this movie twice to make sure it was rubbish! 1 out of 10 !!!
