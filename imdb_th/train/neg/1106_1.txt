Don't waste time on this ship's wreck. As shown that the characters do not have a ransom and watching them interact is truly torture. "Gothic" is entertainment. At least this is nonsense. If you like to watch poems that are stupid and stressful spoiled to outwit each other Lord Byron shows that completely jerky and why others choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly amazing. Mary Shelley seems to be the only character with a spine in any way, but she still comes out of all the tests. Wasted time looking at Gothic instead. I still remember seeing another great movie from the same story. But did not receive the position I hope it will be like this. But without such luck is not recommended.
