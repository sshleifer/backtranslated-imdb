There are a lot of unusual things in this movie. <br /> <br /> Begin with the first twenty minutes of the film, probably compressed into five or ten. The overall film is short (compassionate), but this may have been created by paying a little attention to Mean Lion. (Missing references to "The Wiz" in there or not) and running his sub Closer to the main plot In short, the script has a seed of great ideas. But need to get a little more repetitive work. <br /> <br /> Second, it can be done without having a rough sense of humor. The original has something that can be done without But at least there will be almost at a later date - here the bloating and urination are so rich. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, acting is a little too self-conscious. The original series is as good as the first movie. But here it is way too much Brendan Fraser's joke is slightly superior. (And why not mention "New Ursula"?) Other speakers of the narrator, in particular, a few interactions near the end, have a good feeling. <br /> <br /> Fourth, a little more attention for CGI work At first, it was hard to say that Shemp was not a real elephant. (Except based on behavior) but here CGI stands out like a sore thumb Ideal special techniques should tell the story that they are good or bad and at least they succeed in that matter, so it is a relatively small problem. But still there, <br /> <br /> everything said Christopher Showman's performance while George was good enough It lacks the charm of Brendan Fraser. But Christopher really failed in a specific comparison - he still managed to get George a little deeper, which is probably the most important thing in the movie inspired by Jay Ward, but not here. Julie Benz, as a new Ursula, surprised me that it was better than Leslie Mann in the traditional way. <br /> <br /> Most other performances have a fairly good standard without being outstanding in my opinion, both good and bad.
