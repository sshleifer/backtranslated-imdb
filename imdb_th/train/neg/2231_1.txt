All I can say after watching Snitch is, please stop Mr. Cahill. Obviously you don't have an understanding of what you do about movies. If you insist on making movies about gangsters, I urge you to do research. It looks funny to watch movies with ridiculous gangsters that sound more ridiculous when they speak. <br /> <br /> I laughed when Mr. Cahill went to a school with only 3 students. This film is especially difficult after school. Who has the idea of ​​wearing a hat that says that the gang came from? I wonder if the real gangsters don't wear hats that claim to have a gang. That may be stupid if considering a new law that increases the length of imprisonment if the person is related to the gang. <br /> <br /> Snitch'd is the worst gangbanger movie ever created.
