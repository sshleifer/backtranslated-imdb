I have to watch this movie because the story is very cruel and this movie depends on expectations. In fact, it makes it look awkward all the time. Unlike Meyer's other movies, sexual comedy is minimal. Some scenes of violence are unnecessary and inappropriate. The story is messy and some parts of the show and the script are scary. <br /> <br /> This film is a strange combination of fantasy. Sado-Masochik combined with the cruel and immoral windows of slaves. As if Meyer tried to compensate for sexual intercourse / sexual abuse with a higher moral message Meyer knew that we felt a bit guilty about being activated by the apparent overwhelming meaning of the early scenes, showing Lady Susan swinging a whip in an exciting set. Then he tried to go back to the right path by turning into a movie about the victory of goodness over evil. However, since they cancel each other, you don't have anything. <br /> <br /> Because it's terrible in many ways, so it's worth it to see if you appreciate the art of making great movies in the worst. Possible taste Probably because it's terrible. We almost let Meyer escape with unacceptable things.
