Qualify for the exchange of this show One of them is to adjust the theme to have the appropriate melody. The show has good evidence. In addition, I may be in a minority group. But i like wanda I like the fact that she is more concerned and is the mother of Tim. However, despite all this, I do not like this show, it is not a excreta. But I think it's very annoying. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's the best animated movie on Planet Earth. When I use that word for an animated TV show, I miss the year. Peter Pan and the pirates I miss. Darkwing, Doug. I miss Scooby Doo and I miss Talespin and I hope I'm not the only one who likes Wild Thornberrys and is not happy with the fact that it's fun. I don't think that a rather strange ruler is the worst animated film on Planet Earth. I admit that it's annoying and overrated in some aspects, but it's not the worst show in Nickolodean, that is chalk zone. The gods that cannot be overcome But the worst animation I have ever seen is Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get a clue which is a rude, nasty and frankly moving picture. <br /> <br /> One thing I don't like about This show is a character animation. Forgive me if I disagree. There are many strange faces and many backgrounds that are boring and lacking colors that make Spongebob Squarepants and Wild Thornberrys look very good. Characters with Wanda's exceptions My Found that very annoying I do not want to believe a talented actor like Tara Strong (also known as Charendoff) voiced by Timmy Timmy. I do not think the lead character will be satisfactory. He is annoying and sometimes a patron. And he is also a bad decision maker And his voice makes me stressed. I like Strong but not on this list. Another annoying character is Cosmo, a comedic character supposedly But his jokes are not as obnoxious as they should be, they have either a) planned or b) more familiar Tim's parents have a terrifying character who doesn't throw about their son and their personality looks slender. <br /> <br /> The story that has been told, mostly I still Thinking I've seen this before Later on the arrival of the baby, I thought it couldn't be verified. The worse chapter is a very funny, innocent, unstable and suffering from complete lack of energy. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not the worst thing ever. But poor for animation fans and quite uncomfortable sitting through 3 / 10- with redemption properties and I completely understand that people like Bethany Cox
