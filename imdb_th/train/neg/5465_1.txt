This movie has a special place in my mind, the worst movie I have ever seen. It's as fun as working hard with hands and stomach cramps. The movie starts to get worse. (I will rate the first few minutes of this movie 1/10). Then it gets worse every minute. The only way to score is the amount of minus that has increased for ninety minutes. Unfunny is not a word. Real vocabulary But best describes the humor in this video Anyway, the video manages to even make the cute girl, scantily clad and sexually see and grotesque. This movie is amazingly bad. I will say that it would be better if you are locked with the TITANIC theme that is played over and over again and with Buscemi's characters from ESCAPE FROM LA that are in your ear rather than watching this movie. The sequel was not bad. If you have to rent Troma movies, get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock, I would like to see 5 Tony Little infomercials back to the back rather than seeing the NUKEM HIGH class again. Make this horrible movie, and if this film deserves a reward for the horrors, this is it.
