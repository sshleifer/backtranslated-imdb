I rented this movie because I was watching a horror movie for a movie that nobody heard of and could be a possible jewel. I saw this, and since I was a big fan of violence and blood, so I understood it. The EM score, which means: very mature. Else i have already received The warning on the box answered: Severe violence, violent attacks and nudity. "The most violent" reminds me of The movie ends with a bent flick. It has one or two scenes filled with blood. But I look worse in the movie PG-13. Of course, the amount of blood in the movie isn't something that counts, right? You have a plan with a boring storyline and nothing special about it at all. Don't rent it. I say the truth. I can't imagine that someone will enjoy it to the point that they say: "I'll rent it again." It has a time when it keeps you going. But I won't go to watch that movie again
