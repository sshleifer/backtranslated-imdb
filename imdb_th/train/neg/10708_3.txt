This film has the potential to be really good, considering some elements borrowed from the action movie THE HIDDEN Cider and Dolph is interested in his role. But somebody really dropped the ball on this one Against the gods for 2000, he had to fight with the spirit-based minions that jumped from one body to another, like hidden and Jason went to hell. The subordinates need the keys in order for the devil to come out. Along with driving an annoying female archaeologist and her and Dolph being chased by a corpse with a minion The rhythm is quite uncomfortable and sluggish. The best performances and fighting scenes are bad. Dolph sleeps through his role and talks about the worst conversation in his career. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor that really picked up at the end when Minion fought with his army Firearms at Phra Flick the rest into snoozefest. <br /> <br /> Terrible. I really want to like this.
