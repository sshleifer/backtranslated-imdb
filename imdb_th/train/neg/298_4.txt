Daraar started quite well. The first scene left me at the edge of the seat. I wondered what would happen next. In addition, the first half of the movie is BORE. All in the first half of the film is Rishi Kapoor, who falls in love with Juhi Chawla. However, you don't think he will give you a bit. <br /> <br /> Most things began to come alive in this movie when Juhi told us about her previous husband; And he is crazy! He is a very self-defending person and a really hot person! He used to beat Juhi without reason. Good! One of the reasons I don't like this movie is because I can't see Juhi (the favorite actress) being attacked. In general, this film has too many ways of insulting and bloodshed. I think it's very boring. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all I try to say is if you think of renting Daraar, you should put it back on the floor where you found it and choose another!
