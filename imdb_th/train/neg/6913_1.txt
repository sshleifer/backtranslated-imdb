Believe it or not "Woodchipper massacre" makes me gonorrhea! Correct. I have a rainbow sprayed out of me just because a group of children go to play with the camcorder and make a deal with the devil and get some distribution. Is it beyond my understanding that anyone with moderate intelligence can tolerate the loading of this film? The only reason I deal with all matters (Don't have to try to commit suicide many times) because first of all, I'm bored with boredom and the second - I think I want to explore this new discovery of hate. I'm experiencing ... The film is a horror / comedy about three brothers who left over the weekend to look after aunt, an elderly woman. The youngest child was accidentally stabbed by an old-fashioned Rambo-hunting knife. They then split the aunt's parts with tools (apparently she didn't have one blood in her body!) And took her. Went to their father rented a chipper ... her prisoner son stopped by looking for the mother and the children ended up crushing that stupid person ... I don't remember ever seeing an annoying actor who made I feel nauseous Seriously that the voice of a blonde girl makes me feel pain all the time All actors are truly cruel - just send their fake voice and jokes that must be written by a chimp who doesn't care! Now I can appreciate the effort of freedom. But from those who can realize that other people who are not their relatives may see this! I do not need to see a 3-minute car image pulled out of the driveway and trimmed, long-suffering turf and painful by editing the melodious music. In addition, why the hell in this movie box has a bloody piano ?! There is a piano in one scene and no one is killed nearby! I went through the remembrance of this movie again. I recommend everyone who has half the brain to avoid trash.
