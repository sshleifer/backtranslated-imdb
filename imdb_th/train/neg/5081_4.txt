Plus this movie? Critics who do not know anything from video games can detect errors in games that can occur. There is no damage that is clearly visible at the beginning as the main example. <br /> <br /> And I may miss something, but Super Mario Bros. 3 shouldn't be a game that has never been played. Before? If that is the case, and I don't miss anything ... Fred Savage's characters and girls know about this game. We are talking about things that some people don't know about their second or third play. <br /> <br /> In addition to the actual errors and low quality game play of general movies Nothing here is truly memorable. The boy was still playing the game in the video as bad as seeing a lot of children that I knew back in those days with significantly more experience. Above all, acting and the story are just their best point. The characters are polite and not completely interesting. 'The Wizard' (the youngest child) is a truly creative and quiet child in a little boy who almost never spoke because of injury. Not that it's unrealistic, it's true that it must be thrown into the movie in order to start creating a plot that is more than 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Actually it's the only value. Will be found here is the nature of nostalgia If you grow up with this movie, you will like it, whether it's good or not. It's about kids who play video games and when you see that you have obsession with NES as well, but if you don't like it as a kid, there is nothing that will make you interested and very few. That will prevent you from closing it. <br /> <br /> Never mind. I don't like it at all.
