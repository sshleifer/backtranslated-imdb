Today I visited the Athenean Cinema with my two children (aged 6 and 8 years). Pay 3 x 12 Euro (including about 45 US $). Not to mention gas, popcorn and soda. Please return my special 3D glasses. After leaving the theater and "being forced" to see what would be a great 3D movie masterpiece But proved to be "Cold War, for example," the propaganda movie that is not as comfortable as I have seen in the last 20 years ... and this is supported Is a movie for children ... in the name of heaven! <br /> <br /> PS 1: The average Greek who works can make no more than 850 EUR per month (about 1,050 USD). <br /> <br /> PS 2 children My like it ... but then they again No more than babies> in Greek: mora, morons> like those who write the script and others who make this "3d disgrace" happen. <br /> <br /> 3D animation of the PS 3 Excellent .... !
