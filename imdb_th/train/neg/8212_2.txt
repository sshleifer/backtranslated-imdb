I read all the comments in this movie. I am a wonderful person. <br /> <br /> From the Dalai Lama. For this reason, I read a book about this film based on <br /> <br /> This movie is an ugly fictional story. And miserable in truth I do not criticize <br /> <br /> edit the small details or events for the amazing purpose. <br /> <br /> Not a documentary, but the script will change the reaction. <br /> <br /> Realities and changes in every main character <br /> <br /> The true relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. <br /> <br /> From a ridiculous competition for Tibetan women. (Which destroys the culture <br /> <br /> of Tibet) as a gift in Harra's music box to change <br /> <br /> Harrar's heart. Everything about this movie is false - except <br /> <br /> For stunning photography I understand that the picture of <br /> <br /> Potala (Wang) was smuggled out of Tibet. However, <br /> <br /> changing the true story about the relationship between two people. <br /> < br /> One of those things is very important for this world to make <br /> <br /> sad movie stars
