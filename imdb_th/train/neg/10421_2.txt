I saw this movie as a very young girl. (I am now 27 years old) and it makes me scared indefatigably for many years. I have a nightmare about every aspect of this movie from the way it was drawn into music to (obviously) violence. My parents still argue that someone allowed me to watch it and both said that He won't let me watch this movie. I think they just But said that I knew that I had a strong feeling like this. 0) I was reading a book. (From the curiosity and the fact that it is classic) and it is really wonderful However, I don't think it should have been a cartoon ever. Perhaps today, children may find it strange. But it made me a nightmare for weeks and weeks and I still felt the difficulty of watching the rabbit drawn in the same way. Causing a slight tremor every time Yah i'm crazy But I strongly recommend that parents who want to show this movie to their children, read the book instead or look before to make sure they approve the content. Not everyone who thinks it's annoying as I do But we are outside that 0)
