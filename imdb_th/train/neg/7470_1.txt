In Sao Paulo, Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel, a middle-class teenager, just entered university and on the day of classes they went to parties with drugs and alcohol. The next day after school, the day that Cristiano arrived the night before his home and the three friends raped that girl. The young women died, they panicked and decided to eliminate the body. But Cristiano's mother arrived, shocked by Gabriel and rolled the stairs, breaking her neck. The three decided to leave and burn the body in the landfill. But throughout the night, other tragedies occurred. <br /> <br /> The controversy and disgrace "Cama de Gato" is a scandal about youth distribution And is the worst Brazilian movie I've seen for many years Stories that are shallow and gloomy are funny stories that are bad tastes. The screenplay is not a joke, it has boring and boring dialogue and dialogue, provocative and ridiculous pictures, with interviews of teenagers who are morally at the beginning and the end. The performance is terrible, obviously there are many adjustments. But without the ability and I was disappointed with the appearance of Caio Blat in this trash, the camera made frames, filmed movies and models with expertise and very low quality. The sound is terrible and in many parts it is impossible to understand what actors and actors say. (This may be a benefit because this flick is terrible) Gang Bang looks very realistic and used to promote this movie in a market that doesn't have prostitution. My score is one (terrible) <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ("Bed of the Cat")
