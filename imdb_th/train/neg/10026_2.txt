I expect this movie because it has good stars and it is the return of Aachay and Saif. I hesitate to watch the movie because this person is doing the Dhoom franchise because I hate Dhoom 2; But if comparing Dhoom 2 and Tashan, I will say that Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I see the credit at first, I feel good because it can fit well. That first scene made me terrible. Then the main drawback of the movie is the action scenes. Me and my friends are all laughing together. It's like Akshay. With 30 gangsters and gangster, everyone even has a machine gun! Wow ... You have to see this thing to understand how bad the action sequence is. <br /> <br /> Another thing about this movie is too predictable. It reminds me of some movies in the early 80's. <br /> <br /> Okay, the only thing that this movie is worth is the sexy carina that looks hot in this story. 2 of 10 <br /> <br /> Please .. Please ... don't see this. Think of it as a real gangster movie. You can watch this thing to laugh in a bad fight scene. <br /> <br /> That's all.
