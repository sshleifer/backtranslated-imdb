Some children are climbing in the mountains and one of them enters a large tunnel and discovers a very old mummy fighter. He wore a fighter's helmet and spent the rest of the movie killing other hikers. <br /> <br /> This is the most ridiculous thing. This is a short list of unreasonable things: <br /> <br /> 1) Men and women are in their tents and they think they hear something outside. The guy went out to check and found someone lifted up outside. Then he heard the screams of his girlfriend, so they headed back to the tent - arrived the next morning! He was only 50 feet away. <br /> <br /> 2) Both dunderheads heard the screams of other women (100 feet away), but don't investigate because they are afraid of getting lost. br /> <br /> 3) Another person and woman are walking around and in their 10th scene together, the woman informs the guy because the protocol situation doesn't require him to be a teacher. What do I mean ... First of all, that's just a really stupid thing to say. Second, he never called the professor in the first nine scenes they were together. <br /> <br /> 4) Young women The injured Demonicus attacked and he stopped. She told her. Part of his warrior training teaches him how to make wounds without killing Um, yes, we noticed that she was injured and didn't die because she stood up and walked around but thanked for the delicacy. <br /> <br /> 5) A woman was bound in the cave of Demonicus and when Someone tried to release her, so she ordered this person to help her. Mmmmmmm. If she let you free, it will take about 5 seconds. No need to get help. <br /> < br /> and it continues, the mechanical part   งของภาพยนตร์เรื่องนี้ใช้เวลากับคนโง่สองคนที่หลงทางในป่าจากนั้นพวกเขาก็ต่อสู้จากนั้นพวกเขาก็กางเต็นท์และเพิกเฉยต่อเสียงกรีดร้องของเพื่อน ๆ จากนั้นพวกเขาก็เดินไปอีกรอบ It's very boring and pointless that I shut the DVD halfway down. <br /> <br /> These characters are not sympathetic, especially the characters who have received the most time of the screen. Laughing out loud every time I saw him - he looked like a boy in a Halloween costume which made his face look evil He runs or should I say that the people around him like him are gay. Special effects are funny, the performance is the most scary and there is nothing reasonable. <br /> <br /> Overall, perhaps this idea can make movies enjoyable if they spend time and effort. Increase It eliminates ridiculous conversations, creates a character with a personality that is really pleasing, with a flow of logic to action and may make Demonicus a female character in a sexy sexy outfit, but not but we get it. Worthless nonsense that will make you die
