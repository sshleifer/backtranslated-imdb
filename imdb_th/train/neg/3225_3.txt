Children like dinosaurs. It's part of their culture. But they have land before the original time. At least that movie has this heart. This movie is a pathetic story. Just because children love dinosaurs doesn't mean that you will slap old stories and show them to children. This movie doesn't have a plot. All places are stupid and it's more by numbers. Not sucking the soul like Dorje Rex But it is far from being a land before time
