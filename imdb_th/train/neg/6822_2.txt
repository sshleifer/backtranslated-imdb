Drones, ethnic drums, bad synthetic pipes, children sing "world music" with as many patrons as possible. This is a travel movie and a horrible movie. The thing that kills it is that the sequence is not continuous. India, Egypt, South America, Africa and others, etc. There is no change. There is no clear explanation of why we are ten thousand miles away without an idea in the picture. Just one picture of the third world that has "Basket on their heads" as other critics say, walking as if having a deep meaning If they want to make a 3rd world music video, all they have to do is head south a few hundred miles, which is the best part of Koya that was shot and the movie in Mexico That would be a better setting for "Life in change" <br /> <br /> But it's not what they decide is a travel that has noise, covering half the world and a narrow filter image. The only thing that will introduce this movie is that it doesn't suck as much as Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> RstJ
