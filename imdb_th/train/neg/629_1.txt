I want this movie to be 10 ... I really do. Some movies, especially horror movies, are a good budget. The clever ninja scarecrow that can use the corncob as a deadly weapon ... suitable for this 'budget-to-intelligence' system. Of course, the depth of the movie is the strength and twist and of course makes the audience at the edge of their seats. Drive ... scary ninja ... puberty - stricken ... students thirty years old ... drawing non-cowboy ... clever crack ... son of a scarecrow bitch down The limelight is horrible horror icon of the year. All I can say is 'You can dig' and recommend watching movies like Frankenfish. If you enjoy this hilarious horror movie, <br /> <br />
