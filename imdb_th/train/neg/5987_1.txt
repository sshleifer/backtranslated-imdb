I don't really like this movie. The storyline can be very predictable. In the American style, I apologize to the guy what the woman likes at the end. And London have monorail? Bank of London Bank of England is what is real !! - Anyway, I like the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbird. And the British are bad people? (Apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) What happened to it? Oh and they also talk about things like "Come here 'The Thunderbirds" "- but it's never known as' The Thunderbirds' in the series. Why is that? I want to see this happen again in 20 years with many British actors. I like the original series. Sorry!
