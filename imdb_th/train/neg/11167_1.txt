Jack Black often suffocated me easily. But in this movie ... <br /> <br /> In addition to the direction of writing, the lack of plot, continuous dragging (Help and support from shooting from the camera straight) and .050 batting average is still the most time consuming. The idea sounds promising. But what may happen is the lack of humor and the worst direction I have ever seen on this side of you. Mexicans are very negative. While there is no doubt that I really do not think that this movie is racist. I think that is the result of a "creative" team that is trying to find funny things in this mess. You almost heard them cry from behind the camera: "Hey, look, it's ugly. Mexican! Laugh people! Please, for the love of everything that is cherished, laughing. "<br /> <br /> Cost When you go down, it is anyone who takes money and a good time to watch the rest of the refried beans that should offend IMO.
