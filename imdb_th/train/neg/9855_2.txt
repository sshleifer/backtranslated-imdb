Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan. However, this movie is not for me. There are many deep discussions about trying to support the claim of the film that dragons may exist. The film discusses connections in various stories from different countries, but can not check them more thoroughly. The film uses (good!) CGI to tell the fantasy story that tells the life of a young dragon. This is combined with the popular CSI-style flash on TV to show that it looks like a scientific matter. In many cases, arguments / clues are drawn far away. In some cases, the clues that are used to represent the dragon may exist or fly or spray the fire incorrectly. To see this, it caused me to cramp on my toes. Even a fantasy movie that needs some degree of reality But this movie does not have a bottom line: it's a CSI fantasy documentary. Pedant is not worth watching.
