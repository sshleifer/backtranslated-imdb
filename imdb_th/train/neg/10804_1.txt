Examining KAZAAM and saying that it is a bad movie is not difficult at all - after this, critics at the time of it broke down all over themselves to stimulate the film - said it was one of the worst movies. The worst of the decade! So the fact that I said that is not good or someone else says that it is not good is not a surprise. It's like someone talks about World War II - in practice, no one says that that's a good thing, right ?! The question I have and no place in IMDb can answer is "Why do they do this in the first place ?!" In the end, it is clear that anyone who does not suffer serious brain injuries that this movie is scary. But movies like ED (chimpanzees are playing baseball), COOL AS ICE (starring popular vanilla ice), TROLL 2 (which doesn't have trolls at all) BABY GENIUSES (kids like Einstain Super Hero) And PINOCCHIO in outer space (huh!?!) Prove that any idea, whether it's a fool, can make it into a big screen! So the idea of ​​the best basketball player of that era starring Jeanie as a nasty little boy seems to be 'normal'! <br /> <br /> This movie starts with a child who jerks the locker key in the school hallway. Like the punk from WILLY FREE, this child is 'misunderstood' in any way (in other words, the rest of the children are included) and you know that no matter how selfish and scary he is at the end of this film. He will learn something. Only once I want to see a punk boy like this ends in jail or or dies at the end of the movie! In the end, while the bully was surrounded by an energetic crowd, Genaza Kazaam (Shaquille O'Neal) was accidentally released and insisted on asking for three blessings. But that kid doesn't believe him and the devil's magic looks fierce. <br /> <br /> Finally, the little boy knows that Kazaam is real. However, at the same time, Kazaam was forced to follow him everywhere - like his personal servant. And according to ancient ideas, you know that at the end of this film, Max and Kazam will become lifelong friends and tears will flow. Oh and Max will come to mind the father and mother of the missing fiance. (I'll close the mouth) Obviously, Mara is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a great wish. <br /> <br /> For Kazaam, Shaquille speaks in touch through movies and even breaks to Rap ... Terrible. I'm a middle-aged white man and I think I should be rap at least! He was an amazing basketball player and I heard that he was a good person - but a rapper ... no way! As far as his performances go, he's not great. But has a good personality in the movie, which is hard to hate him - even if they make him do stupid things. <br /> <br /> So the movie is scary, scary, like you've heard? Through two-thirds of this film, I wouldn't say that Shaquille seems to be trying to make the best of the unbelievable children and the bad script. However, in the next movie, the badness became scary because Kazaam seemed to be too much involved with himself to help the child when he really needed it. And nowhere, the plot will get really, really strange - while those who want to make Kazaam a rap star (?!?!) Become a gangster! And strange that this man seems to accept that Kazaam is a devil without hesitation! <br /> <br /> In addition, the last part of the movie consists of people trying to kill Max and his father. I know that this child is annoying. But it should be the movie of the child !! Which part of 'trying to kill a child' that the writer doesn't understand?!? Then, in the end, making this the worst child movie in history, Kazaam becomes a god or anything, and it's like a hallucination from medicine! This ending is more terrifying and bizarre than THE BLACK HOLE ... and the boy makes my brain painful !! Uggghh - The conversation is too scary to endure !!! <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a terrible movie, mostly from writers who lose consciousness. Yes, people with messy messages, unfriendly materials for children and scary characters are one scary movie. Sad to get ideas and actors, it's hard to imagine the final work that is worse than before !! <br /> <br /> If you want to see the Genie in a good modern world movie England created a television movie "Bernard and the Genie" - an exceptionally charming and wonderful movie from beginning to end.
