Obviously there are many talents behind the work of the members of this movie, so don't even look at the credits at the end. You will only hold them with them. It seems that no one is interested in watching this movie. Only 3 people are in the cinema. The two passed after 10 minutes and they were lucky ones. The 'monsters' were unemployed worms from Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan and rejected designs for life in space in the aliens. The filmmakers apparently didn't want to obscure the third ranked monster, so they hired an actor who was clearly not able to recognize their script. Some scenes do not have the ability to convey what should happen unbelievably if anything happens. If you are unlucky enough to be in a movie theater showing this movie and you do not pass, you will laugh at the horrible things or horrifying moments of the movie. The unbelief of many scenes will confuse you, and Stephen Dorf discusses the 'Queen Mary of the curse' regularly to convey the feelings of everyone who paid to watch. If you have to watch this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the trash. Bargain at the video store. If there is justice in the movie industry, one of the main actors will go to rent you.
