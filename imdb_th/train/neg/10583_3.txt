I'm sorry to say this But the acting in this film is scary The conversation grew as if they were reading their script for the first time. Maybe I get the version "Dress rehearsal" by mistake The director uses very slow movements during special effects, perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actor himself. The story is quite well written and the fight scenes are better than I've seen in many action movies. The fight seems to be true. But all of this happened as the actors brought two times and again, miracles escaped from automatic firearms, bombs, morter rounds and rocket launchers. Enemy soldiers are the worst image I have ever seen, especially when they have a truck fleeing in their sights from a distance of 30 yards and a tank fired every shot at least 50 feet wide. Those require serious calibration.
