My spouse & I found that this movie is very schlocky. It started well. But it was unbelievable and ridiculous quickly Most performances are not good, except Abbie. A really wonderful little girl. In addition, the dialogue can be predicted. & Lame - especially Gideon, the Angel's. In addition, without giving anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she rarely appears. At first we thought it was 'shock' but then we knew that it was a terrible script. We love almost all Hallmark movies and their heartwarming stories. But this movie does not depend on being one. There are many good people - don't waste time with this horror movie.
