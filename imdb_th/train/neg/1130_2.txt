A drama that is too long to be able to create real points. So she became an actor - then what? She learns to love - big stories, there are some irregularities between the characters and in dialogue and situations. But the bad thing for the movie makes it look ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix plays the words and behavior. Like a semi-retarded person, so there is no choice but to watch a movie about a girl with a mental retardation that created it in the theater world - which is clearly not the purpose We were told early (in the same description as "Barry Lyndon") that she learned to hide her emotions. In general, she walked around like zombies and her success as an actor was not reliable due to her lack of emotion. At times, this movie has a dull and sleepy feel of the Dogma 95 movie. It's one. I won't be surprised that <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix is ​​the sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the River Phoenix at the end of Nepotism. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Hollywood's Nepotism There are more than 350 images / works.
