This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. Plot and scary text There are too many errors in this movie which is impossible to follow. I do not even understand how this movie will be nominated. Let it be alone. 2. This is the reason: 1) Sam Lee shows off the angry / unreasonable detective story caused by disappointment from his father. Pros: He Anger doesn't matter. Cons: When he arrived at the scene, he could not convey the sadness / disappointment he had for his father. The crying scene is too fake, and it seems that he is shedding tears from the corner of his eyes. <br /> <br /> 2) To connect the movie with the name, the barking sound or the shaking dog sound during Fight scenes and rape scenes that are totally unrelated and confuse the audience. I understand that it should be a metaphor or something that is not ... but it's so stupid! 3) Why does the inspection of COPS not shoot the killer? What happened to this movie When the murderer began to stab the officer to shoot him He's dead! What the heck? There are many chances that the killer will be killed. But I don't know why he can't! 4) In the scene where the girl has a sore foot In that scene, it was clear that the girl's left foot was so painful. In the next scene she lent all the weight to the left foot. And is this the actress who has been nominated as the best new actor? WTF? 5) The sound of the movie is broken. <br /> <br /> 6) I guess this film is trying to raise awareness of the cruelty and violence among children in Southeast Asia. So why are people? bad Win, then the police join the fight? 7) This movie is too violent without purpose. The police are hitting CI for the pulp and then if they cooperate, they give them marijuana and coke. Overall, it's the worst movie. I feel that those who write this movie are sadists and sick people. I have never seen a disgusting movie come to life. The worst movie ever!
