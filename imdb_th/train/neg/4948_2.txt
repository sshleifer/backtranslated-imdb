I am always enthusiastic about the drama, which is a form of art that the BBC has done in the past. "Byron" presentation is unbelievable. Unbelievably bad! An awful script, a show that doesn't get all the attention and character. Obviously, Byron is "Crazy, bad and dangerous to know" and make every woman heart-flutter not in this production. Here he appeared as a little more spraying of brown, instead of a female hero and fighting for Greek independence. It is said that Byron walked limp. The depiction of this man is just a staggering journey. <br /> <br /> I watched two and a half hours waiting for things to spark in my life. Not splashing even without flickering It is the most boring if not serious boredom from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> There is no opinion that nobody is better than the poet of Avon. I believe that Byron's poetry is respected and My heart should be waving to the back and making the drama about his life likely to be treated the same. <br /> <br /> I think the BBC lost us with this.
