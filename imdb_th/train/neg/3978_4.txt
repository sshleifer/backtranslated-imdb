When in Rome there was a clear improvement in travel. The journey I found was too difficult and slow to guess, and to this day I still consider it the worst thing. However, while when in Rome is not a scary movie But it is not a great movie as well If I had to summarize it in one word, I would say that it is fairly It's great fun for teens. But I think adults won't do much. <br /> <br /> When in Rome, there is a good score. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are certainly quite good actresses too. I will admit when I am 10 years old and up. I really like them and in general I still like them. And I enjoy their movies, such as Passport To Paris and New York. Minute returns to the target. The two girls don't do bad work. In fact, they are very attractive. Plus their dress to die and the view of Rome is absolutely amazing The soundtrack wasn't half as bad. <br /> <br /> However, the movie was brought down in the story and script. The script is mostly conservative and with the advice of deja vu. The plot of most of the movies Mary Kate and Ashley is very predictable and everyone familiar with the work of other Olsen twins will find. Non-original elements Most characters are thin cardboard and you don't learn a lot about them and sometimes the rhythm is not the same. Sadly, the breathtaking scenery was destroyed by the work of a fast-looking slash-dash camera. <br /> <br /> Overall, there are good spots and can be seen for sure. However, for my taste, it was dangerous and predictable. Fluffy teen 4/10 Bethany Cox
