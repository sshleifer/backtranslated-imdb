If you are not an Evangelical Christian, be like the Egyptians and avoid like a pandemic in the Bible. <br /> <br /> Terrible - why heck, why is IMDb writing the best review on top of list Of these things that I just lost the end of things that started out as a good evening in this claptrap. <br /> <br /> The plot evidence started strong enough - I was drawn into the movie and interested. To the point That preached in the scriptures It's disgusting. <br /> <br /> This movie has a fire. I think I have registered with IMDb for the first time to complain about it. - I hope at least by doing so I help people. Others survived in the evening. <br /> What did Hay-Christian do on my part ;-)
