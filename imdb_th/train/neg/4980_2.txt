I just read the reviews to protect this film because it has a low budget. Now I do things. <br /> <br /> CGI monsters are quite lively. But was used in the worst way The fight scenes are not just one of the actors. But there are images of monsters that interact When the monsters do interact, it seems to be done in the pro paintshop. In my opinion, if you have a low budget, you should use a model and a puppet. They may not look fancy. But at least they interact with each other, just watching the first movie of Peter Jacksons. <br /> <br /> For Beowulf's performances, it is a descent. But the remaining actors didn't try or they forgot Where are they? <br /> <br /> The script looks confusing for me. One minute, they will say as if it were a modern day. The next setting you received was the Shakespeare Theater Club. I'm not saying that it should be 'thee' and 'be' but you have to find a balanced point to make the line sound like it came from the same person. <br /> <br /> I noticed. One part near the beginning when Beowulf mentioned the old will, which he found that he had not spent the rest of the movie talking about gods and signs. <br /> <br /> In the short term This is somewhat polished, slightly nondescript, but no less back.
