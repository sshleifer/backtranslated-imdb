Whenever I create the worst movie I've ever seen, this movie will always be with it. It doesn't have any redeeming qualities. It takes the intention to sit on everything and I will make my own blood out faster than having to sit and read it again. <br /> <br /> There's nothing wrong. or? Let me tell my travel story to see in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I went to watch the midnight show on Saturday night. I have only one person in the theater that is my own and the famous teenager is quite noisy. Rather sitting behind me. Obviously they have a good time on Saturday night and come to "funny" this story to laugh. Before the movie begins during the preview, they laugh and joke and make loud comments over time. It is an annoying borderline. If they are still enthusiastic in the actual movie, I might say something. But I am patient and caring for their lively fun, so I let it go. And they calm down when the movie begins. <br /> <br /> Why do I tell you all of this? Because you can judge the "joke" alleged by the effect. It doesn't happen to yourself only. But still in this gangster group <br /> <br /> Throughout the film's duration Not once Not myself, not a deaf child The perfect silence apart from the soundtrack. And when the film ends and the lights start to rise, all of us are slowly coming out of the theater, in a quiet, nondescript, truly quiet It should be a funeral. <br /> <br /> This is a "funny" effect created, not a laugh, not a pleasure. But it is absolutely enchantment It is a depressing and depressing movie that is not the smallest joke. Preachy is self-depressing but not funny. <br /> <br /> I think Mel Brooks "Blazing Saddles" will be on the short list of Funniest Movie. Ever, it still makes me very surprised that the same gentleman may be responsible for Least Funny Movie. <br /> <br /> Brief: If you feel too happy Otherwise, don't say I didn't warn you.
