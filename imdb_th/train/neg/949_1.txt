I never understood the appeal of this item. The performance is not good (Debra Jo Rupp is an amazing exception). The plans for most of the episodes are repetitive and uninteresting. The dialogue is quite weak, funny and painless and trying to sit and watch even half In addition, the link between this program and '70s' is more important than the style of dress and scenery and the background used for the show - seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with old scripts. Dressed as a painting of the show twenty years ago in the hope that it will make the audience think or something like that "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" use the same technique effectively. May more and are happy to see the contrast with the terrible and pathetic excuse for this.
