Maybe I have seen a lot of crime, flick, or maybe I didn't use the right medicine. <br /> <br /> This is the most funny movie, lack of plot, ridiculous plot. Can be seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> For direction, it seems that it takes less time to show this thing than to be combined. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems. In order to match the video before it is complete, <br /> <br /> It's a bad story for the character "Fr" Lang. Fritz Lang's classic movie starring Peter Lorre. You should rent better. replace
