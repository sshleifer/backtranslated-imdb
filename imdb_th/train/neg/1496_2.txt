Evil Breed is a very strange flick, which, unfortunately, is not good. The beginning of the movie seems to be promising. But overall it is a disaster. The conversation is quite bad. But not close, not as good as acting, mostly cruel and unbearable performances The character presents an awesome line, and although it meets the purpose, the method doesn't work because some annoying characters of killing are innovative. But it took too long to get them after about half an hour through the movie We received the first death. (In addition to the beginning) and then almost all other characters will be smoked within the next five minutes. Then the movie becomes a hoax with a ridiculous karate character that is unrealistic like fighting. A man gets his intestines pulled from * sscrack. There is no joke. It's just plain nonsense. The movie then turns into a particularly intense and pointless blood. Most of the characters are creative. The rest on the counter for 5 days, the dog breed did not laugh so badly, so it failed in the main mission. See the Texas Chainsaw massacre, before dawn or See No Evil for a strong hit
