Whoo-boy is one of the worst movies I've seen all summer. It's true that it's sci-fi and I don't see much sci fi, but men talk about the small plot with razor and two-dimensional characters as much as possible. <br /> <br /> The character is ready Plot and unbelievable environment, the vampire looks less scary, looks more funny and doesn't need to put special effects down to the right - horror and ending? The only thing that is unpredictable about the end is when suddenly the tomboy becomes a lesbian and begins to do it with a female vampire, which is not as hot as the last three seconds. You're close to "What?" Then "That man is hot." If this appears in the replay, God forbid not to watch.
