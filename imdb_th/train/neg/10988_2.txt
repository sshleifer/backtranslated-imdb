If I had never read a book, I would say it was a good movie. But i have read the book Screen that was once written, breaking the story There are many changes that are not worth the real name. Character changes, plot changes, timeline changes ... <br /> <br /> First of all, who is Henry and the investigator? They are not in the story. Henry has Mitch's personality. But Mitch is not a cop No, you create it. Roz helps 'sink' his body and uses it as Zenia's blackmail. Compared to Roz, the real blackmail called Roz thinks Xenia is sleeping with her son and wants. Let her escape from him Her son was blackmailed because he hid himself from his mother. Her son didn't really talk about it. I do not believe that he is his lover. Roz's secretary <br /> <br /> Tony and the West are not together at first. In fact, he is with Xenia while on campus. Apartments that are painted black are their thoughts. Tony recently visited. This is what Zenia and Tony meet. Become a quick friend. Tony hides her love for the West. Then Zia went west with cash from Tony, then West and Tony combined. Finally marrying at some point in the west, leaving Tony to Zenia again for a short time just to be heartbroken again Then back to Tony Zenia's blackmail for Tony, Tony wrote a test article for Zenia. Now, as a college professor, she doesn't want to let it go. I will say that the characters that play with Tony do it amazingly. <br /> <br /> Charisma is blonde. Xenia did not fool her about cancer while Augusta was still alive. She couldn't be there when Charis had a lover named Billy. Augusta's father, he was a conscript in the Vietnam War Finally, after Charis takes care of Zenia for several months for real drug withdrawal. Xenia and Billy have a relationship under the nose of Charis while taking care of both of them. Then Xenia turned to Billy the government and went out to board the ferry with him. Not with Augusta Charis, pregnant with her. Charis still has a split personality. Karen is her real name. <br /> <br /> Zenia doesn't die from being cut apart ... She's falling or Pushed out And landed in a fountain She has almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it is possible that she will recognize and fall when she can. She is dying of cancer at this time. <br /> <br /> It doesn't show memories of childhood or anything that is loved by the characters to the reader. This book is buried in its bare bones. Then again in the vision of others Why can't you write your own story along the lines of what you create movies? It is very different and I'm sure it should be more useful.
