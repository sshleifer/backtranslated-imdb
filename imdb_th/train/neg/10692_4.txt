Poor Ingrid has to suffer and suffer when she goes out to Italy, bored with Hollywood glamor treatment. The first time he suffered from the torture of a volcanic island in STROMBOLI, an artless failure to kill the career of a less flexible actress. And now is Euro 51, another boring exercise in the feeling of being soaked. <br /> <br /> And the story didn't do anything for Alexander KNOX in a thank you role anymore. As her long-suffering husband Of the youngest son At least this has better production values ​​and better interrelated scripts. STROMBOLI <br /> <br /> Bergman is still charming here. She could not cope with the sudden loss of her son, despite the kind-hearted male friend "Sometimes I think I will get out of my heart," she told her husband. Important statements in movies that do not have humor or elegance But it makes us feel that the story is moving in any direction. <br /> <br /> Bergman was inspired by helping the poor in Rome after the war. But being a social worker with poor children does not help improve her emotional health and from this point causes worse results. <br /> <br /> The overall effect of this film is that it is unlikely. Interested enough to do the project For the big star like Bergman, this movie wasted half time while Bergman became increasingly paranoid and her husband suspected that she was the second time. The story fell from there after she nursed the pedestrian through her illness. The last post of that story caused her husband to place her for observation in a mental hospital. <br /> <br /> Ingrid suffers a great deal of everything. (Except being compensating for the loss of her son) but is not useful Not one of her best films to speak softly. <br /> <br /> A little note: If you want neo-spiritual realism, you might be better off accepting leadership. Snake hole when it was offered To her by the director Anatole Litvak !! It will make her work better than EUROPA 51. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Rossellini and Bergman lack careful again.
