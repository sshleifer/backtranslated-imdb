And how did it make production surprised me? The main character is a terrifying performance that is not funny. I can't get to the characters at all. He's a fool who doesn't have anything to show. <br /> <br /> This comic is the worst in 10 years. Not funny. The story is both written and poorly executed. The jokes aren't as good as Disney's Zack and Cody. I don't like this show more. It is terrible and should be canceled. Even the song wasn't good. The name is worse Creativity and humor <br /> <br /> Johnny's test is gone far and fast!
