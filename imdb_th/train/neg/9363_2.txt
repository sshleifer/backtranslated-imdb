This film has a serious flaw in it, some people can walk through the back door of an incredibly secure medical facility. Then this person just walked around the place and entered the office of Dr. That is just a bad writing or a bad fix. <br /> <br /> The movie is very predictable. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this movie was created, except for filming. Made in Canada and may receive government support. <br /> <br /> I must say that those who play with Aaron, Cory Monteith do very well. <br /> <br /> If you are really bored and don't have What to watch on television It will kill a moment. But otherwise it is a movie that has no actors like their resume
