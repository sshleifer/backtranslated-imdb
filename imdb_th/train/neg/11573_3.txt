I came here to check out the night before to decide which TV movie to take, and what I found to make this film not to be missed. How much do I feel guilty? <br /> <br /> At first, it must be clearly indicated that this is the daytime film of the housewife. Every sentence is a "poignant" effort in the manner that daytime movies of housewives and soap operas are not always good and are based on predictable evidence and good men. (Especially soldiers) have violence and incompassionate The whole movie is about the 'drama' that is evident at the time when the male character threatens to develop the second dimension. <br /> <br /> If the sound is good (Or have fun) with Linda Hamilton's German accent, while quite good, distracting painfully - just like her face for some reason. Other performances do not doubt the cause. That caused shame to their offenders with certain traits that were painful and obvious which was the order of that day There are not many surprises. But don't forget to look for the infinite 'Monty Pythonesque' infinite food and drink supplies that appear from the soldiers of the hungry soldiers! <br /> <br /> I didn't expect to do it. Beautiful or texture or charging emotions What I get is 'Good feelings' of Christmas are not particularly good, which will make the audience smarter with all things. <br /> <br /> Watch it under growing circumstances: 1: Nothing else. 2: You are a fan of movies 'The predictable housekeeper for men and win' 3: The only way you can appreciate the true story is when Hollywood turns into a documentary film 4: You absorb enough to make your emotions easy by telling the story. not complicated
