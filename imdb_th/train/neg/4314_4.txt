I am convinced that the best Academy Award ceremony last year was in 2003 for two reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) MC Steve Martin is the smartest person of He: "I saw a team helping Michael Moore, a limo" and "I'm not talking about a gay mafia in the event that I woke up with a poodle, a head on my bed." <br /> < br /> 2) Surprising winner: No one makes Adrian Brody. Applause or Roman Polanski for the best director (genuine jeers and boos), but they win. <br /> <br /> The award ceremony last year was not bad. But there are very few surprise methods and I'm glad to see RETURN among the kings, sweeping the awards, although it's not the best thing in the trilogy (FELLOWSHIP is much better) but what makes the BBC news down is Jonathan. Noros received his partner around and pretended to be hilarious when they did anything but so when I heard Sky doing news for a British TV program, I expect Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to do it. associated But we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! Oh gawd if British TV is desperate for film critics (Obviously they are) I'm sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly to LA to express their sincere opinions to the winners and losers. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock is not bad. But he is not Steve Martin while the place seems to have a sports hall with seats in! My opinion is not much. The main problem I have in the ceremony is the style of the Oscar that "inferior" to the winners who are sitting in their seats! There is nothing as an Oscar "minor" and just because of the rewards for designing short animated dresses or the best outfits. They deserve a great movie award or an excellent director. All winners should be allowed to march to the platform. A disgusting technician at the school became an arrogant person and I agree with the opinion that this form is embarrassing and if not surprising, this may be the worst ceremony in history. For that award, <br /> <br /> Best female performer - Cate Blanchett is not surprised at the competition category. <br /> <br /> Best male actor - Morgan Freeman. No complaints. True, because Freeman is one of the most live actors in America. <br /> <br /> Best Actor - Jamie Foxx, the most anticipated prize of this night. <br /> <br /> Best Actress - Hilary Swank Surprise at Important because everyone thinks that Annette Benning is going to win just political education, but Swank deserves it and speaks the best of the night. <br /> <br /> Excellent director - Clint Eastwood. Important because everyone thinks Scorsese will be rewarded just because he has never won. In fact, I'm glad about this because if he doesn't deserve it for TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS, he doesn't deserve it for AVIATOR. <br /> <br /> Great movie - MOLION DOLLAR BABY. The heart is important again, because everyone thinks that educational institutions will share the awards for the best directors and the best images while I think of the Hollywood-friendly THE AVIATOR film. The voters <br /> <br /> What these awards may show is that this year, voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and reward those who deserve what they have. He never did before in the past. BEAUTIFUL MIND beat FELLOWSHIP of the Ring for the sake of! And educational institutions may vote with their heads longer than their hearts
