A different action movie with an interesting place, a young mafia killer (Chandler) must show his boss that he is a good person for service, so he went to California to study with a killer. Professional Beluschi) The first and most important mission: kill the strange girl (Lee) for all of them. But is she an easy target? The movie continues and is based on this core concept. But the result is just a bad routine Even the strange twist at the end was unable to record the movie. Good performance by Chandler. I give this one 4 (four).
