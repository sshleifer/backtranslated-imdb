The true embarrassment of "The Gathering" is not in a bad performance and is not in the plan. The real shame is that it is worse than the original series, even though it has a main attraction: Takashima. I like to see Laurel Takashima in the room with Susan Ivano. That even if only five minutes She has a cynic that is a person who has two aspects of personality that are both disturbing and cute at the same time. Unfortunately, the pilot movie "Babylon 5" has an incredibly boring story about the assassination of Patricia Tallman - who never returned to the series seriously until later. Lyta Alexander, who is more than calm I will leave you with the final idea - why Delenn looks like a humanoid outside space (Even though she was a woman) Thank heaven at Minari. Look later on the list.
