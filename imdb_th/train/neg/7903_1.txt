I think I watched this movie But don't say me because I might fall asleep while watching it because it doesn't "Catch my excitement and imagination" At least I know that I watched it enough to know that I will not watch again soon or ever. <br /> <br /> Jeez talks about lame. ... really lame, totally lame It won't attract the attention of a six year old child. In general, it does not have a huge impact on the value of zilch Nada. Just the handcuffs become funny wrecks? Should it be a joke? Ya cana deceive me-e-ee ...! <br /> <br /> Now, if aliens eat meat as indefinitely as in the movie "Critters", we may have human characters do something. Slightly deeper Than to be so cute, anxiously ... like yelling and screaming and running for their lives, so they won't be eaten, so the story can be more exciting than watching dry colors. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about this. It's not worth the effort. You can find more interesting things like watching dry colors or falling asleep.
