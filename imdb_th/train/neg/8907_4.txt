I rented this DVD yesterday and didn't know that it was a movie type. "Character education", so I tried to watch for about an hour before pressing the Stop button. <br /> <br /> Even with character education The theme, I can't get into this. Maybe it's my mood to want to see something else, or maybe I have other expectations, but in addition to that, I try my best to move on until the end of the show but give up the actors Good role But the unification around the world did not come together to preserve my interests. About the only interesting thing is that the sergeant's gun was stolen and he quickly bought another gun and sprayed black to appear as a police problem. I think this movie should be right. "Who stole the sergeant's gun" The scene was very well done. But combining it makes me feel robbed again for me to see. <br /> <br /> Since I didn't watch it until the end, I said that there was merit to rent this movie .. Maybe. For me, it's a waste of time and effort to look good. I will let you try But it's not like I would recommend
