I would like to thank you for hiring an acquaintance for this kind of 'horror' movie, but at least they should hire the right actors. Sergeant Major is guilty of using his monaural voice to subdue every line he has. But let's face it, the line isn't really important. There is no known plot, so most writing is related to the words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and other different languages ​​instead. The right conversation <br /> <br /> 'The story' as it is mostly composed of random blood and death that seems to have a 'surprise' worthy of cringe, which happens about 10 minutes after you see what That will happen not only this But there are many glaring plot holes and continuous errors (Why do they go in there? He doesn't have a weapon, isn't he dead?) So it makes the whole movie look as though it used to be. Decreasing many hours to fix them. <br /> <br /> Another movie that uses blood and blood instead of a true movie experience.
