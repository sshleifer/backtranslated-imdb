Spoiler <br /> <br /> Three words that guarantee you a terrible movie? Cheap Canadian production The brain fits perfectly with those words. Great script, stupid performances and hilarious special effects make this the thing that all BAD movie fans want. Hilarious horror movies. The post team seems to give up. What makes their brain admirable is in the second half of the real thing. It tries to do good things! Can ingenuity and consistency save the existing jokes? <br /> <br /> It's Christmas time. The mother and daughter were murdered by one of the most funny villains. The next day, a rebellious teenager faced a lot of problems when he was sent to analyze psychiatry. <br /> <br /> If the police head is cut off and the stranger has blood with him Some children do it. Who will believe? The things that began when the jokes changed and ended up when the brain tried to be serious. Children cannot be scared during the terrible time. The brain is a concept that is too funny to try and have courage. Psychological Research Institute is bigger than the major production plants! Our ugly villains and their friends are credited with pulling the worst performances I have seen. The discretion of the viewer is highly recommended.
