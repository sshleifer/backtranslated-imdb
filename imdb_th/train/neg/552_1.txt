I watched this series for almost one episode and can no longer receive it. It feels as if I have watched dozens of episodes and then hit me ..... nothing new here! I've heard jokes at Seinfeld. I saw some people fall like that with friends. The story of Happy Days has almost the same story. There are no interesting actors here as well! There are some good items on other programs (not here) and other programs are new items for careers that they should not attend. Avoid this smelly person!
