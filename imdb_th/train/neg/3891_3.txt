I think my favorite part in this movie is part of the absurdity, stupidity and irrationality of the trial, TED NELSON and his unmarried friend, the sheriff until the corner. Got Melting Man at the steps at the power plant Remember that Nelson was looking for MM for almost the whole story and MM killed and ate many people at this point (including his boss) and Nelson realized that MM was crazy and hungry. The flesh and blood <br /> <br /> The sheriff has his gun pointing to MM, which is and I give the props, movies and Rick Baker for this, which is the most disgusting and scary object in The human form that we have seen. And he shouted a very important question for Dr. Ted Nelson: "What will we do now?!?!?" <br /> <br /> Camera cut Went to Doctor Ted Nelson and apparently Ted didn't know what to do. Anyway Clearly, Ted was very determined about the problem of finding melting points. He never thought of bringing some control devices such as bola or cramped or mesh or dart, sedative or could be a new tape by Vangelis. <br /> <br /> So the panic and the sheriff's firing caused Melting Man to become berserk. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this could explain why NASA was tricked into the program. In the space of the moon in the past 30 years, instead of returning to the moon or going to Mars like everyone knows that they are doing, I don't know. <br /> <br /> Anyway. That is a lazy, lazy and direction that undermines every aspect of this movie. It's hard to say how good the actors are because this film completely insults their characters. <br /> <br /> Two incredibly painful scenes and add to the stupidity of the prosecution: There is a scene with the most lump. The old couple in the world trying to steal lime from the grove will only be torn by Melting Man. This scene is the nadir of the 70s movie theater. I guarantee that you will never see the ridiculous and very annoying setting. Go with this person who is looking for someone else in your life. And the attack of Melting Man and the women who live in the house where they collect horses stared on the wall, challenging every effort to process (BTW, I think the famous film director Jonathon Demme has a scene in this scene The narrow-minded husband who went to check the house first and did not come out again) The only thing that made the actors unable to chew the scenery was the real thing as I said that their horses seemed to pee And we were forced to watch her hysteria for at least two minutes than any SANE film director would hold a shot. <br /> <br /> Burr DeBenning should overcome the shit from IMM's director and photographer. I remember him from Columbo in the old episode, which he looks better than he does here - no one thinks that he will be the lead. But strong and unobtrusive But no one may not be interested in real life because his director makes him look here. <br /> <br /> Everyone has come out a little better, except for the old couple. (And shut down, I know they're playing for laughs But I'm not laughing!) But not so much <br /> <br /> This story is in disaster from the movie 'So Bad You Can Look Look'. Still, I will look again before I watch abortion in the era. 70 and 80 others ("Track of The Moonbeast" and "It Lives By Night" came to mind) and MST coverage is so fun. If you have a chance to see the MST version
