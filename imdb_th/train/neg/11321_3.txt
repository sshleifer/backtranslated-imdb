You can't go far when the story begins. It's not a great thing. The location of the desired blood of the robot is just a lethargy. <br /> <br /> The script is blas√©. The scene is staged in the desert to reduce costs. It's a trademark that if the background is desert, the movie doesn't have a budget. <br /> <br /> The lack of budget is ok if there is a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood of Champions" are examples of good work from no $, but this movie looks as if they have to change their changes together just to buy a sandwich photographer. Again, forgive if the story is not just sucked. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is the biggest crime of all: it doesn't end. the movie But the rest never came so strange. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
