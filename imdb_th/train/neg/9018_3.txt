This is a science fiction movie, Formula B. And the director didn't do anything. It is a story of a dragon revived from life by a science team. Everything that has been done is something you've seen many times. It is a weak script with no real characters. In fact, it is full of characters and fixed situations. The director attacked this by doing it as a formula movie without trying to fool us and that made this movie a little attractive Will see the best while you are cooking, cleaning and exercising Sort of fun, not interested Have a place in entertainment But of course, it's not something you sit down to chat with friends unless you're drunk and don't care. The overall rating of 3.2 should be fair. I don't think it's crappy like most people. But I was surprised that some people in the post thought it was exciting. That really freed me because I didn't see how to make this movie a memorable one.
