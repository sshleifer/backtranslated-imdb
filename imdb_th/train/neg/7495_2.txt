Fox "The True Story Of Jesse James" (1957) is a newly created film in a poor widescreen of 1939 Tyrone Power / Henry Fonda classic "Jesse James" I'm not sure where the error is. But the casting in this version of Nicholas Ray's main characters in both the uneven directions and the screenplay that focuses on ham must be related to it. <br /> <br /> In the thirties At the end, Tyrone Power is Fox's leading man. But in the last fifty years, his star began to fade away and the studio leader Darryl Zanuck began to groom a newcomer. Robert Wagner took over. This was a major mistake in Zanuck's part. Less suitable replacement With the possible exception of "Broken Lance" (1954) and "Between Heaven & Hell" (1956), it's hard to think of Wagner to distinguish himself in anything! In addition, Jeffrey Hunter is not much more than a Fox contract player before being assigned to play Frank James for Jesse Wagner in the story. "The Real Story of Jesse James" Last year from the studio last year, the iconic mark of this actor is the great performance and revealed in John's "The Searchers" classic. Ford But his play here with Wagner in the second half of James Brothers was nothing boring. Players do not use any personality or color in their roles. They completely missed the mark, lacking the talent and attracting attention expressed by Power and Fonda in the traditional way. The film was destroyed by many incidents and the Wagner screenplay that Robin Hood from the West of America was found in an unrevealed introverted style that you do not feel sympathetic at all. But it is a shame to see the best actress, Agnes Moorhead, barely looking like Ma James. <br /> <br /> The best aspect of Westerners who don't have a great Cinemascope / Best color film by Joe McDonald and great music score by Leigh Harline, a less-known composer!
