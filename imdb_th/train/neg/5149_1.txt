This movie is about a rape victim, a woman / comic book writer from New York, who decided to escape from the glamor of a scary big city and move to the dirty, running along a very small town in the middle 12 and nowhere at all The people of the city are mentally ill. But she invites the madman into her trailer Annoying is the fact that she has the ability to do the right thing to put herself in a dangerous situation after a dangerous situation. DB's acting, Sweeney, is the best high school. He is one of the cute young actors and smiles. Unfortunately, the job is not kind and the mother's nature is correct. The previous reviewer stated that the show was "very real". I agreed. Actually it's not acting. The two main characters are poor, weak and unable to fully decide and are healthy. In short, this movie is not like anyone else. Rent for laughs. True crime scene A cruel wooden list of trailers - enough to make ME murder And finally, she is an artist / writer, so she can't buy a double trailer and anything other than the Chevy Chevette sunny yellow to love God!
