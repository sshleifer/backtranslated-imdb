I do not see enough game shows on the TV to understand the attractiveness of SHOW ME THE MONEY, but I think it is appealing for many undesired audiences. The obvious question being presented, it gave me a lot of money for answering a few simple questions. However, the composition of the test was only a minor part of the prosecution, which I found to be a complicated, devious. For example, before answering questions, contestants choose questions that must be asked by choosing from the "A," "B," or "C" options, randomly. Does this have a purpose other than slowing the game? ? It will be much faster when starting with "A." Contestants can submit questions. But must answer one of the three questions in each category. <br /> <br /> After answering the question, the contestant will be asked to "lock" the answer, which is a delayed tactic again. The next mission of the contestant is to tell the name of a woman from a gogo dancer in a cage, about a dozen, to open the card indicating how much the question is The correct answer will increase the dollar number of the card to the contestant's total sum; The wrong answer will delete the same number. This process takes a long time and actually has some entertainment value, as it allows the audience to watch closely with the dancers that are consistently and beautifully beautiful. At the same time, contestants will be warned that choosing the "killer card" that unfortunately will end the game immediately. This causes the sweating of the contestants and causes more delays due to nervous competition. Consider the sudden loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. My suspicion is that the possibility of a sudden disaster is to attract viewers. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the whole process slows down, with many empty players between hosts. William Shatner and the contestants, along with Occasional routines by dancers locked in cages All these delays wasted so much time that the audience might forget what the original question was when the correct answer was revealed. <br /> <br /> JEOPARDY's 30-minute general episode usually goes through as many as 60 The first 30 minutes of SMTM that I watched are only six questions. (Mostly related to other TV programs) No one in his right mind will watch this program because it's fun to play by answering questions at home. That's three reasons why watching the show <br /> <br /> A. To see if the contestant responds to winning one million dollars just to lose everything in one stroke, <br /> < br /> B. To see a beautiful woman who shows sexual guidance dance <br /> <br /> C. If you want to enjoy William Shatner's sparkling cast wheel, <br /> <br /> My choice is "B", but women are not on the camera long enough to prove Suffering through an hour of this list.
