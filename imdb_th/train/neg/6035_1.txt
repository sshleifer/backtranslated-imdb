I hope I give this negative rating because I think I just wasted 83 minutes watching the worst horror movie ever filmed. Acting as a horrible god, I mean, really bad. The conversation is worse. The script sounds like it's written by .... I can't think of something scary enough to say and the day "outside" and "inside" The appointment made you think that the event took several days. Doing horrendously, directing, directing, writing, and so on to those who like to have lunch for everyone. Stay away from this person at all costs. If the grace that saved me from hell alone was good deeds, one thing is to tell the world that I don't see this shit. This movie is the exact reason why horror movies are never serious.
