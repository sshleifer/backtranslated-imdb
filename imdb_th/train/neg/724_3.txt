The concept of Sarafina seems to be a sound that is beyond the musical perspective. It tries to combine African rhythms with fast pace with stories that describe the cruel conditions and atmosphere that blacks are forced to endure when the film was created. The conflict of the two elements is too clear and the film never proves the rapid change between joy and fear. If it is just a drama that reflects these conditions, it may be a good movie. However, the scene of a schoolgirl shot by a soldier is not sitting next to the song. <br /> <br /> In addition to the bad places, the actors are Not the best as well. Goldberg gives a mediocre performance like the rest of the actors. Overall disappointment <br /> <br /> 3/10
