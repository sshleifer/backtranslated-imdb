I think I am quite sad, especially when I watch an impressive and torn movie. But not for this (Which surprised me!) And it's really surprising that I saw that there are many people watching this movie very high. <br /> <br /> There are many disturbing facts in the movie: 1. Despite There is a fault - Ben's true intention of saving 7 lives in exchange for his past. I find it annoying that this movie seems to stimulate this type of suicide. Some people may feel that this is a brave act, and some people think that he is acting cowardly. In the end, this is an annoying action for me. <br /> <br /> The 2 story lines of the movie are beyond reality But the reason is too easy The medical needs to be paired with blood types to be organ donors. At the end of this movie, we know that Emily has a blood type that restricts her opportunity to receive donors within a short time. However, it seems that Ben has a rare blood type like her that allows him to be a donor and convenient. Despite Ben's rare blood type, he can donate not only But his heart only And bone marrow, which in all cases not only But only need matching blood group <br /> <br /> 3 Why do doctors allow Ben's organs to donate, even if the poisonous jellyfish that he used to kill himself? <br /> <br /> I might analyze the whole story because of the story. This is just a movie. However, some of the facts described above hope to help you consider your plan to watch this movie again. If you go to see soap-opera movies, but you're looking for smart entertainment, miss this!
