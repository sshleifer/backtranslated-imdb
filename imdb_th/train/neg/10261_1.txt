Wow, I just saw this in T.V. It is one of the "scary" movies that they perform around Halloween. Is this the G rating? There is nothing to make this movie scary or scary. In addition, others say that this is a scam. But i don't think so For spoofing, you need something called "humor." This low budget shit doesn't have humor and it's not reasonable as well. In general, you have a stupid monster (a man in a rubber suit) coming out of the closet, killing people. The newspaper spun telling you that people were killed by monsters, so I thought it was good. <br /> <br /> Soldiers tried hard to kill monsters that were not much larger than men They have very bad goals. If so, the soldiers were great! Does this movie make the US military look pathetic? While difficult to kill, do not do anything other than shuffle and roar. Oh, and sometimes there is a second head emerging from the mouth and screaming of it. It is a little interesting. But it's the center of all aliens. <br /> <br /> What is the scientist who plays xylophone to attract monsters? It is difficult to understand many conversations due to poor sound quality. In addition, why did the monster carry the main man for a long time? Why did the monster not enter the closet when there was a chance? Why do I insist on trying to make sense?
