The nobleman who created this turkey must be buried alive. I'm sorry, but other critics have never watched this movie before. He must watch something else or have never watched the movie before ... 9 in ten stars? He speaks of things as good as Ben Hur or Gone With the Wind? Funny and unbelievable characters, ridiculous situations, it seems that it was shot in Griffith Park (which did quite well - MASH was shot in Griffith Park). A crappy script about everything that might be wrong with every movie. Into one package Should see every expected filmmaker as an example of how horrible the movie would be It reminds me of something that USC students might do to study movies. <br /> <br /> Let this pass, unless you take drugs and enter the high camp.
