To be completely honest, I didn't see many western movies. But I have seen enough to know how good this movie is, the worst west in the world today. First of all, is there a black person in the west forest? Come! Who ever thought that this might be a wall film that everyone would love a little, no one. The second mental retardation that day and women, especially black women, do not like carrying and using guns Asian chick is speaking perfect English? If the setting is Western, Asia is not where you go. Finally, the evil gay chick is too much, this movie is just a scandal from the beginning. Now, don't understand me wrong. I'm not a white or white skin. But this movie is a movie The worst presentation of black people I've ever seen!
