This is the worst Christmas movie I've ever seen. I took my two young children to see this. It was the darkest, most dismal plan. The family had no money. The mother lost the job. The father was killed in a bank robber. The bank robbery stole the car, the family with both children behind and after the high speed chase in the river. alone It is not surprising that her Christmas deity will disappear. The Christmas angel didn't help the children who drowned and Santa didn't bring the dead ancestors back! I think this is the worst message to send a child. Better to tell them that there is no Santa than acting like this !!
