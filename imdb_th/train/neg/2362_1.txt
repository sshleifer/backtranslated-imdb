The first film in the series was excellent and one of the best horror movies of all time. This is the worst thing. When I sat down to see this thing, I was actually thinking that the fourth and fifth bad things had to be good after the previous terrible. I was an incredibly wrong person. <br /> <br / > When I watched my first ten minutes, I actually wanted to close. But I don't think it can't. <br /> <br /> Not only horror movies, it doesn't have to be a sequel because the last two (fourth and fifth) are bad enough! In addition, how many times can you bring Freddy back! The performance in it is TERRIBLE. The story is predictable and crap, and it also has bugs. The way they do Springwood is totally wrong. Do not respect the first person To add to this, things seem really superior. <br /> <br /> Some people say that this movie is "funny". This movie is not "funny" since when Freddy Krueger should be "funny". ? I'll call it funny shit. This movie should be a horror movie, not a joke. If Freddie had a daughter, wouldn't that information appear like the first time? The ending is just silly and simple like the rest of it. This completely destroys the essence and identity of the first. Just show yourself. <br /> <br /> The shame that Wes Craven creates is a good start. But had to drag down because the trash in the trash They shouldn't even create this movie. Or other sequels, except the third The third person is the only good person from all sequels. <br /> <br /> If this is a DVD by myself and not part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD series that I received, I will throw it out when I have received. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: pathetic and pathetic efforts in the sequels. <br /> <br /> - The complete movie of the first movie. <br /> <br /> So please Don't waste time on this worthless garbage.
