You know that you are having trouble watching funny movies when the only amusing piece comes from the animal characters. It's a pity that the Cat and Dog parrot is only supported and not something else, because the humans in it are so cute all the time. <br /> <br /> If I was Paul Eva Lake ( Jason is what your name is) Jason and Lindsay. I will forget about acting and doing other things because all of you are as funny as watching the dreadful actors. <br /> <br /> The main gag in this film is one. A drama that is shouting that I'm not gay, which is funny, as if you can't. You may change your mind if you have to endure three boring and daring bosses. A very ordinary woman is the leader in the movie <br /> <br /> The worst movie I have seen in the past year and hope to see no worse again even though I expect.
