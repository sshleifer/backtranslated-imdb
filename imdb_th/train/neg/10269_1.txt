This movie is outrageous. By outrageous I mean scary I'm more fun to see the colors at my local hardware store on August day while suffering from migraine headaches and heat. The performance is getting worse as the "movie" and the director use drugs clearly when the final scene approaches. When the fog was shot dead, she decided that it would be prudent to blink the post. The postmod that is not wise is true. If you are deciding to play with a gun, nail it while intoxicated and watch this movie, remember that the nail gun might give you a better story.
