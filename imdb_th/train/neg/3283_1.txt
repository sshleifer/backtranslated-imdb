OK, we all love Daisy Duke. But what happened to this actor To start Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is no country about this woman and Daisy is not stupid! Uncle Jesse may be the closest person to the original. There is no fault with Burt, but I have never noticed that Boss HOg is so high that part of Boss Hog's humor is his size Do they try people like Danny Devito? Ok, now get them to throw Jessica Simpson, not everyone watching her husband? He paired Luke Duke with a T-shirt !!!!!! Clear, these producers didn't look at the appearance of the old members. The screen t never appeared on the dukes !! This caused the film to shut down from the beginning. I let this big thumb down.
