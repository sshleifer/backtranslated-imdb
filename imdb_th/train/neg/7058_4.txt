I came to NEW PORT SOUTH. I hope to have a representative film about the massacre in Columbine school, which is similar to ELEPHANT of Gus Van Sant. And of course the summary in the TV guide indicates that students against anti-rebel systems have impressed me. But this is a very boring movie <br /> <br /> This story is about Maddox, a high school student in Chicago who decided to use what he saw as a dictatorial regime. The major problem is that the characters are guaranteed and the actors playing with him, Blake Shields, cannot manipulate the bugs of the script. You have the feeling that Bond Dox should have Hitler's evil charm, Saddam or Bin Laden. But he never met anything more than a furious teenager and could not believe that he could gather his followers to give you a short lecture, to overthrow the only influential dictatorship to replace it with another regime Too clear, which means NEW PORT SOUTH is a totally unbelievable drama that is not worth going out to watch.
