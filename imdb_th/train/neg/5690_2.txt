First of all ... I never thought of myself as Uwe Boll Hater because I thought I had never seen one of his films. But after seeing a cheap excuse for the movie "Seed" (which is the serial killer name, this movie is about) I'm close to joining the hate club. This film has no meaning ... Synopsis is a joke and although Boll is trying to attract attention clearly from the shocking people, 90% of this movie is a boring story. You can summarize this movie: <br /> <br /> 1 Masked killer watched the tortured animal clip on TV. This is a real life picture from the farm. The movie and the movie opens for a ridiculous reason of "Make a statement about humanity" and give Peta's address because this film has no text at all and is the most painful piece of pornography exploitation, so you have a reason to hate movies from the beginning onwards. <br /> <br /> 2 Death by using electricity with an excuse to give what will happen later in this film that is printed on the screen for everyone to get problems. <br /> <br /> 3 The police watched videos of baby and female animals starving and disintegrating in the basement of the seed. There was a foolish nightmare and crying into their whiskey because the seeds were bad. evil Although the show is normal But this movie will dive every time trying to combine emotions ... <br /> <br /> 4 Police caught seeds in his house, acting stupid and being slashed in the dark. This sequence reminds me of a video game. You can hardly see anything except the torch. Seed is a high-level killer that is everywhere, and every police is stupid enough to be killed ... except the one who caught him. > <br /> 5 seeds have a chair and we see that their electricity is as long as everything in this "movie" ... He will not die and we are warned by the open statement that he must let Is Isa If he survived the crash three times, guessing what ... They just buried him as a solution to the problem. <br /> <br /> 6 seeds from his grave killed everyone in that part. Sore and find the main police for revenge. <br /> <br /> 7 The woman with her head smashed with a hammer in an endless sequence from the point of view, just for fun and worth it. <br /> <br /> 8. The seed caught the family, police lured him to the house, threatening to kill his wife and His girl After killing his wife with a nail gun, the police fired into the head because that's what Seed wanted (it was hard to get into those heads because he was not only But wearing his mask even in prison But never said anything ... The movie has any interaction, so don't pay attention.) <br /> <br /> 9 Boll reaches the destructive end, which Seed locks his daughter with her dead father. Rotten like the one we saw in the video in sequence 3. <br /> <br /> This is ... no message, no plot There is no reason, there is no face behind the mask, no background except the silly story that Seed was burned as a child. <br /> <br /> This film relies on a few important scenes and shock. I remember this empty movie of emotions or messages or entertainment. It's like watching August Underground ... Good to me. Some people will enjoy this stupid smell. But the hardest thing to stand for is the tricky message at first, and the fact that this movie was well built considering the camera's effects and even the performance was too good for This celluloid <br /> <br /> So how does Boll earn money to create "such movies" when thousands of talented directors work with shoestring budgets? "Seed" is not just the essence of absurdity. But is a proof of life that the free market is flawed ... Fortunately, we pay taxes to many German taxpayers to receive gifts.
