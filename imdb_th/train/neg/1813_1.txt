If someone wants to make a really bad movie "The wizards of the kingdom forgot" set up a yardstick that measured the depth of evil. <br /> <br /> Start by fooling Chewga Sega, the main character ... Some poor people wear colored clothes. White "long hair" that looks as if it is stitched together from a piece of discarded carpet. Work slowly, painfully with uncommon effects that reject the audience from stopping unbelief. Add a gnome in the garden (just heck) <br /> <br /> In the second thought, skip this movie completely and find other things to do for an hour and a half.
