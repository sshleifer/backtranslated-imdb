'60s is an entertaining movie from time to time. Most entertainment comes from laughing in movies. It is extremely uneven and has many annoying elements. For example, switching between black and white and color If done correctly, this may be reasonably effective. But due to poor performance, it became a disturbance and deviated from the bad experience Most movies have a strange feeling. The performance is not bad for flicking TV programs. But after that it was very embarrassing at other times Many inconsistencies and ends with confusion. This family is still in many important events in the 1960s. The ending is too difficult for my taste. Because it is a Hollywood style, everything must turn out in the end. I will recommend you. Don't waste your time with the 60s and do other things with your time. I'm glad I watched this in class and not in my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie is Bob Dylan's music collection. These are just my surfing ideas in the flick. I hope you take my advice and stay away from this.
