While I think The Exorcist is a horror classic, I have to admit that I'm not considered as high as other horror fans. For this reason I don't see The Exorcist rip-offs. And if Exorcismo is something that must pass, I must say that it is good because this movie is boring like hell Ninety minutes on it! In fairness to the cheating of other shamans, this is one of the worst and perhaps it is not the best place for me to start. It is not difficult to predict what the plot will be: basically it is the same thing as The Exorcist and sees a woman being possessed by a demon spirit. Then the village priests were called to come to make evils. As with many Spanish horror films, the film is the star Paul Naschy, who is the best thing about the Exorcismo movie, directed by Juan Bosch, who had directed the derivatives of the Spanish Giallo 'The Killer Wore Gloves'. His other films before But from the basis of these two things: I believe that originality is not his strength, there are many good things I can say about movies. Most of them are just plotting and the chasing scenes are not worth waiting. I certainly do not recommend!
