Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) intends not to be alone on this Christmas, not only to be a millionaire. But it was disgusting and guilty of being a great man Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) hesitated but was greedy enough to accept Drew's offer. Christine Walco (Catherine O'Hara) rarely said anything about it. But learning to sneak around ... isn't the same feeling as daughter Alicia Missy (Jennifer Morrison). Drew's girlfriend follows Drew and wants her people to meet his family. The real fun is in the store because of the pleasures of the choir becoming an unusual nightmare. Other members of the cast: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Funny but strange.
