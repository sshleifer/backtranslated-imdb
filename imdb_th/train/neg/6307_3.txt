I will give 3 just because it shows the history that we need to know about to prevent it from happening again. I agree with comments from gentlemen from the United Kingdom. This movie is terrible. The clich√© has no real plot. Many historical and technical inaccuracies Find the technical specifications of the DE 529 or Class Everts destroyer and you will see what I mean. I am now a black history month in the United States and I will be called a cynical class just to say this. But the history of this ship is not that great. They run some escorts, chase "submarines" that become the wrecks that they collide. Sorry, blacks can do a lot in World War II. This stupid movie gives them credit. This movie makes them look like people whispering. Let the name begin. I can handle it.
