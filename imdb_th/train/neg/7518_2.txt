Horror movies have lots of fun with low budgets, bad performances and beautiful costumes. I think this movie has just disappeared from dressing up because of a boring scene. After that, another scene, people shake hands. Nail that is not harmful in the air If it's not boring, it may be funny. <br /> <br /> Horror movies can go a long way with such tired concepts. "Students in a haunted house" in the same way that Evil. The movie Dead has a lot of fun with a similar standard storyline. Hallow's end, unfortunately, didn't go far. Actually it doesn't go anywhere. It takes a better part of an hour to create an intangible and anonymous character with what seems to be an endless drama between individuals. I have nothing to resist character development, even in horror. But it is a one-dimensional character (alpha-male, milquetoast, ... uh ... the character that doesn't exist, which is mostly used for sex scenes) doesn't have blood forty plus minutes that are with them More afraid than when the bloodshed started. <br /> <br /> Conclude that the bloodshed implies that when college kids become what they dress up as their haunted house. (A vampire wears O.R. Scrub and white pancakes) They watch the way they do in their amateur haunted costumes; The Dead Hate The Living uses a similar style as a masterpiece in comparison. Nothing to say about and not scary. <br /> <br /> I think about this from almost every way. If it should be a thrilling and suspicious horror movie (Which explains why things are moving slowly) pathetic sex scenes If it is supposed to be a true horror & horror movie (which explains the schlock) ... Where is the blood and courage? And the deterioration is one of the exciting endings for movies I've seen It is a type of movie that, even if there is no storyteller through the movie But was booked by voice-overs because of all the meaningless conversations. <br /> <br /> This is difficult ... coming out of it. I wonder if I just sit and watch Christian horror. Maybe " I know that there is hell. "From the opening does not mean that. But there are some hints (Or the wrong advice - I'm not sure which one) for all the vulgarity in the movie, such as "gosh-darnit" slipped a little and most of the crucifixion, the worship of the horrible gods and Satan-scared, especially after the T&A sex scene that was a lesbian > If it is a Christian company (Highland Myst's logo is still a bit similar to the cross), then this movie will be very heavy for atheism camps. Every living thing cannot be a bad filmmaker. <br /> <br />
