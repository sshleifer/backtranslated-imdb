... annoying child actors It seems that the creators of this movie are struggling to fill 90 minutes, even though the death scene is valuable. If not for the death scene, this movie will have a Disneyish feeling. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist of the child doesn't seem to be as afraid as it should be. If I am in the middle of the forest with a fairy toothed ghost killer, you can bet that I won't go out and ride a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> Overall, I've seen worse (that is, wait). But there is nothing that I will watch again or recommend everyone to bother with it until you are an avid horror collector
