This child is quite bad. But they do not make him a man who is smarter than adults and can steal a thief who has experience every time No, he is not a lot of children because he is a child with severe emotional problems. A good couple who is looking for adoption rather than adoption and while the husband is willing to give this child more opportunity, the mother is not through the strange Michael Richards character and Gilbert Gottfried. Annoyed all the time and you have a bad movie yourself with a few laughs here and there. I like the sequel of this film because I like the fact that they brought Amy Yasbeck back to be a more lovable character because there is one one character in this movie that is not like it is. Even this child is quite annoying at first and they are comfortable in the sequel as well. The plot is simple enough, even if the prospect of going to pick up this child that they think is good by the way the orphanage throwing a party while they are away. Add to this little hell, get in touch with some types of prisoners. Not sure about this character. At first I thought it was supposed to be his father or the real thing. Not everything is good But I will choose this one before that Culkin boy every day of the week
