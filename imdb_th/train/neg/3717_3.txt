Chris Rock is clearly desperate to get a warm star, which will draw his attention to mainstream white and black viewers who update the popular comedy "Heaven Can Wait". In politics He acted as a struggling comedian who was involved in a car accident in which his soul was taken out of his body too quickly - so his angels must find another body to lay him on and be able to be born. Depends on the white businessmen Rewrite movies that are gentle and sensitive like "Heaven can wait" shows that Rock's eyes are in the box office. (This is the movement of the organization prepared by the Hollywood mercenaries most) Why not try to find something better or more memorable than the comedy that comes alive again, which will come with the night. At apollo Great actors (including Regina King, Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy and Frankie Faison), do what they can, but Rock looks awkward and unsure of himself * 1/2 from ****
