How is this bad script attracting this actor? Nonsense, predictable and unbelievable. This is a good job and directed smoothly. But the content is terrible, it still has the same qualities as one of the worst horror ever. Not astonishingly good and not in a fun way. Avoid all costs even if you are a fan of someone on the blog.
