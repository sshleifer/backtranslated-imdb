I gave 2 because Natassia Malthe (as vampiress quintana vampire) looks very sexy in this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is very little logic for this movie. Flick. This movie might try too much. Will separate from the traditional vampire story Unfortunately it goes too far and makes the whole story not just unreasonable but ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There are too many scenes and there are too many scenes that make me feel sick. A good vampire movie should have more feelings that you don't need to see a lot of blood - we all know that when a vampire sucks human blood, he / she will do what the vampire will do. Wailing or a little screaming is all it needs to describe the scene. (For example, at the end, when Quintana tries to stimulate Rosa through sexual intercourse, all that is needed is a few moans, the rest is your imagination.) However, it's just my personal taste.
