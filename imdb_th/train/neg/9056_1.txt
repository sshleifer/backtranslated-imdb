I've seen crappy movies in my life. But this thing must be among the worst. Of course 100. The content (imo is) <br /> <br /> We follow two lovers, Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton, Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson. Like Darlene) and Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze is Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) in a single car on the road. Trip to Reno. <br /> <br /> Obviously Lonnie is not satisfied with his sex life. So he tricked his wife and Candy, who tried to have children in despair .Roy at the same time Day was not sure if his sperm is OK or not, so he receives a medical examination <br /> <br /> Now I've read the back of the DVD. But my girlfriend is not and She broke out after about 20 minutes: 'Yes, she's pregnant. But her husband could not have children Including tedious and annoying, no terrible nasty meanings. <br /> <br /> The movie's sample has a foul odor. Two couples set out on their big car to Nevada when they were stopped by two police because they didn't stop at the stop. They knew each other and eventually bribed both officers with beer cases. Not only this scene is pointless and unimportant. (Or even related) for the movie takes about 5 minutes! It's just talking and talking and never going somewhere. <br /> <br /> I still have to think about the ending. Clearly, Roy ISN didn't have a problem there, so he was the father of the child. How many times happened in the movie ... Try something new! Eventually, the deceased wife forgives her husband and best friend who has a relationship. Yuck <br /> <br /> The best scene of this movie ends with two Grand Canyon shots. Why don't they keep the camera for 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> Who will expect more from this actor (although Thornton will really try) but you can't blame them? The writer is ashamed of you! <br /> <br /> 1/10
