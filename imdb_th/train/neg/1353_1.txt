What is it? Is a mish-mash of strange patterns that recur (shells, Shirley temples, swastika and racism songs reveal too much among others) independently, in any order of lecture or plot Or character development All things make me a "Strange showtime" was nervous and I didn't mean only the unusual selection of actors. It is felt that the acid travel is not better than the level of drug use. One may refer to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie I can compare is Eraserhead (the second movie that I Like the least, forever) which is more depressing But I still find what it is? Waste all my time It is one thing that will allow me to look into the inner workings of other people's minds - even others who are chemically conscious - but it is another story that makes me see strange images that surprised me.
