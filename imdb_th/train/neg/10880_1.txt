This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have a lot of thirst for movies (and good). It can (just) handle the humor of a teen if it is a language that uses cheeks continuously. HORROR The picture is really funny, other movies like Plan NINE from outside the management area are funny while (seems) trying hard For the show, it seems that they will gather teenagers who died with their brains and ask them to produce all the programs. Compared to their Tom Cruise, it looks like Alec Guinness has one good interpretation: the old ghouls that are wide on the motorcycle.
