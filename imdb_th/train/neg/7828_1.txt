In addition to 2 days in the valley, I think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Another Tarantino tear line that appeared since Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere that the movie created was amusing during the first five minutes. But then the filmmaker made a mistake that could not be forgiven for allowing unnecessary violence You should jump over this thing better.
