Unfortunately, this film is not credited to the manuscript. Nicholas Cage is quite a wood that the actors come to decorate the screen with various skills ranging from not moving to the highest point. Support is not better. <br /> <br /> The plot remains the same in terms of the progress of the scene. But much worse There is not enough detail to allow viewers to see what is selling. It turns out that it's just a poor product. Faith cannot be suppressed and cannot be questioned. The only economical aspect of this film is that it can be seen as high as the media wants and anyone who spies the place should be praised. <br /> <br /> There are many laughs. br /> <br /> disappointed! Wait for the original to come out on TV, pour whiskey and enjoy.
