When I was young I enjoyed watching bad television. We are all wrong sometimes. But my excuse to see things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th century" and "silver spoon" is this: I am still young and innocent; I don't know what makes the item really worth. <br /> <br /> Thank you. Now, I appreciate the good stuff. Stargate SG-1 is not good. 12 year olds will love every bit of it. Everything needed Writing is beyond interest. Gentle and without inspiration, make one mistake. Star Trek: Voyager If your performance makes me want to get the worst trek of all time, you're in trouble. <br /> <br /> The movie Stargate is a pleasure. Great, very wrong. Egypt's amazing architecture and culture, excellent music scores and great sci-fi ideas With the exception of the original song, nothing makes the fun movie appear on this list. Even Richard Dean Anderson, which makes MacGyver able to see and is an interesting legend, seems to have almost half his sleep. <br /> <br /> The budget must be very low. Shooting movies is not much better than this, like vanilla and boring like a script. It surprised me to show more styles (such as Farscape) and matter (such as the improved Battlestar Galactica), with a small fanatical fanatic that was less than this pap. it
