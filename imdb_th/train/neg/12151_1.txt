This may be the worst show I have ever seen in a movie ... and what happens to the casting? The leading lady in this movie has some stuffy nose and is almost impossible to look for a moment without having to stare at her nose. You can go to your local grocery store on Sunday afternoons and find the top women who have more than 50 people. Look better. I made the wrong mistake of renting this movie because it has a DVD box. "This movie seems to be only a partial project for a multimedia student group at a local technical college. I would like to spend an hour or more to make this film to watch public television ... At least the special effects will be better and the people that are more attractive than anyone you will see in the movie.
