This can be viewed in many ways. This movie is terrible, or it's just a strange thing. The third seems to be the best explanation. It has a strange theme and has a strange story. Average or how good it is he But this is not bad. Christopher Walken is always outside the wall. He always enjoyed watching, no matter how bad this movie was. Funny, clever. It's quite funny. Of course, this means that it has a time period. (Although very little) but can be above the top and makes me feel that this movie is desperate to laugh. But of course not a good way This movie looks like it has more potential and he doesn't do much. Just very mediocre and doesn't seem to make much effort in making this movie. <br /> <br /> Writing is the key to a good comedy. Obviously this means that writing here has failed. The best is below average. Considering that it had a time when it wasn't too scary That's not a good thing to say about movies. <br /> <br /> If it's not for Christopher Walken and it's ridiculous, the ending I'll give you a lower score. He is often a character in his film. This style is just a strange movie with strange characters that don't go anywhere. Not completely scary But I wouldn't really recommend that because it's a very memorable movie.
