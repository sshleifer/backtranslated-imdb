I disagree with all the comments that say this is a good movie. This is a completely critically acclaimed movie. I mean, SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E. A strange story development. Mia Kirshner turns from an innocent girl into a fun chicks in a party without a reliable reason. In addition, every female actor looks too old to be a college-student. It seems about 30 years old - you think the rest. I watched only the first ten minutes and started sending fast to find sex scenes. All sex scenes are quite lame, hasty and important, without a forehead. All the sex scenes are ridiculous. Consider how many pieces of clothing. Do what you should do - put it down and save yourself a few coins. Summary: Story - 0, Sex - 0, Acting - 0, Score - 0, Out 10
