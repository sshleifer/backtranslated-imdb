Personally, I think this item is very insulting. Some actors are terrible. They went to do it and looked like fake. I can always tell that it will end in the first 10 minutes or less than watching because it makes it clear. It doesn't write very well as well. I like to watch it to laugh at it. Do you know that saying "It's very bad." That speech applies to this program. I also want to watch just to see if I was when I guess it will end. Until now I was right every time It's like a small game that I play. It's good when you're bored and you feel like laughing with something.
