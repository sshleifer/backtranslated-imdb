The sitcom "The League of Gentlemen" follows the lives of many strange residents in the village of "Royston Vasey". Different scenes are linked by their general settings. <br /> <br /> In the first series, the main plot of the plot involves a new road which will be built through the Royston Vasey. Therefore, more foreigners visit the small town, but Edward and Tubbs, the local "shopkeeper" who really Then far from The city does not like foreigners Whenever a visitor enters the store, they kill him. In my opinion, there are some scenes that are tasteless and not funny at all. For example, when the couple absorbs two engineers who want to build a new road. Edward drums while Tubbs is dancing half naked around the victim. <br /> <br /> Pauline lives in Royston Vasey. She works at a local job center. Although Pauline hates the person you have to work with But women do not want to lose her job So when an unemployed man was interviewed as a firefighter, she didn't allow him to go because he was not ready for the job. <br /> <br /> Then there was Barbara Dixon, a taxi driver who converted sex. Be a person Details about the transgender "She" <br /> <br /> In addition, Mr. Chinnaree, the vet, also killed the animal instead of the cure. In one case, he came to the farm and was taken into the living room where the dog placed in his basket. Farmer went out From assuming that the dog is a sick animal, Mr Chinnaree makes him die Seconds later, the farmer opened the door to catch the "real" sick animal. The sheep were on hand. <br /> <br /> Some villagers were husbands and their wives who visited his nephew. The friend was killed by the shop owner. Both were very tidy. They have towels that have different colors. Each color stands for one part of the body. In addition, they have thousands of keys marked with different colors and precisely categorized. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the actors play very well. By playing women, the scene becomes a joke. The suit is suitable for actors with Tubbs wearing scarves and crazy characters. Some people, like Edward, have unappetizing black teeth. The show has a dark humor. The set design reflects the mood of the series. Every village and house is gray and decayed around. Local shops often have fogs which strengthen the threat. Even the village symbol is ominous: "Welcome to the Royston Vasey. You will never leave." <br /> <br /> Although I think the actors perform well. But this type of series is not my taste
