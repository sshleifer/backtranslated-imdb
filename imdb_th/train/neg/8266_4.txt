What is it * bliep * with this movie? Can't they boast a better script? All in the movie 'Good' but ... It has been done more than once ... until the end. I think it's ok, but ... Returning to the past ... * barf * So ... Waiting for the gods to appear ... but wow, that didn't happen ... which is good. <br /> <br /> I love Big and Tom Hanks, but watching movies in the picture A new style with another child who wishes that he / she is older / bigger; That just pas√©. <br /> <br /> Just watch until it comes out on TV. do not get me wrong But it's not all
