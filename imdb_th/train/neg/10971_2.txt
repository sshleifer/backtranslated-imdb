Irish critics are crazy about this movie, more than I was overacted by the regular band of Irish actors dragging out for every Irish movie. The script is very bad with a strange habit (brown sauce). Romance with all the bad things about Dublin. The attitude of 'Ah, it's a dump. But not entirely sure. 'A lot of knowledge for American audiences (Boss, supermarket and commanding officer, horribly poem And the coffin in the coffin is the character of Colm Meaney. An excellent actor is forced to play this role written by the age of five. Something memorable The best thing about this movie is Farrell, and it's terrible when you have to say that At least he didn't put his horrible American accent. Foreign viewers receive a warning: stay at home and see the lock and lock stock. You will have a better time Halftime is the outer path
