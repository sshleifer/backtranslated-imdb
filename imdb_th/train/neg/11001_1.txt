I have never seen a funny movie that is very boring to sit ... no one laughs there. OK, maybe a little bit for Michael Clarke Duncan as a gay innocent black bald man. But the rest is not surprisingly funny. In addition to being voided, the laughter "Play" remains forever! Avoid this if you focus on your time and money. Scary !!! Worst!!!
