If this series should be developed as Batman - The Animated Series, I think it will fail a lot. Drawing a character is a punch ... (Catwoman looks scary ...) But what really bothered me is that it makes Batman seem like a boring person who can't take care of himself in the fight by No Help from two or even three close friends I mean, he is Batman for the sake of God! I know comic books. I know that Nightwing and Batgirl should be Batman's allies apart from Robin, but also ... causing Batman to say that he needs help from them .. What he managed a few punches in BTAS, he was able to face a dozen rivals without any problems ... Did he get older ... <br /> <br /> And another thing: I don't think that Batman will allow children like Tim Drake to fight in Slowly without having to practice hard for many years (And Batman is everything But the lack of responsibility) and the second is not something that happens in the cartoon. If we are still faithful to them, Batman - the cartoon series creates history. With animation, stories and characters ... that's the legend of Batman The new adventure series changes the legend into another Batman flick.
