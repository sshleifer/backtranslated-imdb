Unrelated, unclear, poor screenplay, shooting and bad direction ... It is clearly the first attempt to create an advertisement by good people TBN. <br /> <br /> TBN pictures Excellent Succeeded in the past by helping bring "China Cry" Nora's story to the big screen, but "Omega Code" is an unfortunate mistake. As Christians who support TBN and many programming and those who love "China Cry", I still find it impossible to recommend this movie to everyone. They do very well with the service. But this is not an example of it. Don't waste money ... rent "China Cry" instead.
