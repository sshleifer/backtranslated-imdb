OK, don't let my conclusion fool you. This movie SUCKS HARD, but is the worst movie? This movie is terrible in the way that people should not organize the brain to explain. But it's not worse than Manos: the hand of fate, hobgobblins, the horrors of the spider island or the small movie. Do not look at it without using MST or you may develop health problems. But there are movies that are worse
