This movie is worth watching if you stop after half an hour. It starts with a funny conversation in the bar and makes us expect to have good jokes. I can tell that it will not come. It will deteriorate in a few minutes in a film that challenges your patience and the embarrassment that the actors will expand. You may not be happy to be a witness. Heard that the director wanted to act in this film about the feeling of losing himself that followed him. Most people in the experience of globalization I was surprised to hear that. Do I live in the same world where he lives? OK, a lot of people walk around in the same clothes as me and listen to the same and all songs. But that didn't make me feel like I lost my identity. How did Khrzhanosvky think that we were not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watched? I am a short-sighted person or he <br /> <br /> My score is good: the good start of the movie helps not get 1, 4 good is my conclusion.
