In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed 'Airplane, train and car' which is a funny, hilarious and painful movie? The best thing he ever did Ten years ago he was reduced to reuse the plot of 'Home Alone' in the second sequel, which was not connected to other movies. Four crooks? Correct four! And one of them is a woman! Congratulations to Hughes for introducing this change in the series! ?? Was electrocuted by a steel chair with consciousness with barbells and blinded by color. Hahaha. While the new boy is less charming than Culkin, you think the departure of nearly two major players from the first two movies. That will make Hugh unable to do the old routine
