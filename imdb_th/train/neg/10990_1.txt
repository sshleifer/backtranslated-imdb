I watched this movie very long because I was fascinated by its stupidity and innocence. It seems difficult to believe that many celebrities (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gielguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc.) will be willingly involved in this, but perhaps in 1968, really * innocent people? The plot seems to be written by a Latin American priest, Marx confused with the agenda. There is a great power conflict and Russia is a really good man and the Communist Party secretary is a good person and has a spirit that suddenly after 20 years saw the light and was forced to relieve his conscience by releasing the prisoners. Priests from the Siberian cemetery Then the priest would immediately become a Pope with coincidence. We are allowed to watch the Vatican secret voting process, which is shown in the most religious way you can imagine. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the Communists in China have achieved economic success. Normal socialism of half of their famine Country to die In order to solve this little hiccup on the path that had not stopped communism, they wanted to start a nuclear war. (To spread the wealth of western capitalists to the poor in China) <br /> <br /> Our good old companions in general. The secretary was a little worried and called the Pope before his coronation ceremony would ask him to be peaceful. They met with Peng's fellow Chinese leaders who watched and acted like a 15-year-old child. You would roll on the floor, laughing about what people in 1968 thought Chinese people looked like. Comrade Peng urges Western capitalists to pay (Which is quite reasonable after all the capitalists do not have to pay for the socialist madness always) and the pope must also sacrifice something because of the altruistic cause Of equality and social justice <br /> <br /> So when the Pope was crowned in Rome, he pledged all the wealth of the Catholic Church around the world to feed the poor Chinese brothers. Ours in Christ And because of this, he helps to save the world from nuclear disaster. <br /> <br /> There are also many sub-plans that alas make the movie exchange unbelievably bad. I will give the Oscar three times for ignorance. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony Quinn doesn't seem to be a Pope. He has more reasons such as the Greek Zorba.
