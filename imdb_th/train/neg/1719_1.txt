In an exciting climax, a creature described by one of the locals that "The giant crocodile with fins" dragged it a lot on the ground to chase. It will be lunch before the bulldozer hits twice and it dies from boredom.

(Causing him to insult more laws), two narrow-minded boat charters that bounced, "prehistoric cave art" made in colored pencils In a painful scene, the fake magician and his wife / girlfriend / accomplice manage to add an additional 4 minutes of film by preparing how those stars can be seen in the night sky. Clear daylight Even in the constant forward movement, this moovie is sore and badly hurt. MooCow says calling a smoked machine. 'Because this cow really stinks! = 8P
