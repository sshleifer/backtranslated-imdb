The neglected movie of God, this story is about three stupid millionaires gathered in groups to play dangerous games and the winner will receive one million dollars. First of all, the performance is terrible and the movie has no reason at all. It's not scary, even a little. It's so stupid that makes me laugh, which is the reason why it's received 1 star. This movie doesn't have violence at all. But it's rather lazy And some characters are annoying and very playful Moreover, the monsters in this movie are wonderful and not terrifying, so you want to throw anything on the screen. Last but not least, it's terrible. I do not want it to go in case you are really strange enough to see this piece of garbage. Avoid all expenses !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not rated (but should be R) for nudity, vulgarity, and Mild Gore.
