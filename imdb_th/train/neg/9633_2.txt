Elizabeth Taylor is a wealthy and uncomfortable man, courting the deity of death on a fortress on her island in the Mediterranean, or she is reacting too much - or more accurately. In fact, both of them can be used in the direction of Joseph Loey, which is a messy story called "Boom", which is appropriately titled, because the mood in the lush and luxurious environment is almost ready to burst Richard Burton. Climbing Mount Taylor is not invited; She dressed him in a samurai suit with a sword. Although it looks good on a wide screen But the picture looks deadly But failure, even Liz 'n Dick-philes should be avoided. (Group of stars "What the hell!") Attitude towards the late 60s film career is the lowest point here). Pointless, confusing and frantic. "Boom" is disastrous - even though the screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who has adapted the drama in His own success "The Milk Train does not stop here anymore" is said to be quite cute! * From ****
