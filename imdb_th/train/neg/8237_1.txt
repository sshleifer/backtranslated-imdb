How is this movie published? It looks like it was shot on someone's mobile phone and brought the situation to the female victim screaming into a whole new depth. They literally screamed throughout the 90 minutes of the movie. And that's all they do No plot, no tension, no characters, and no performances. Just screaming and screaming more. <br /> <br /> I gave up after fifteen minutes and quickly wound up to see what was happening or not. The action that passes it fast forward causes another problem - no camera to speak of. Every shot looks like another shot - medium distance, one corner, blunt, boring, DULL <br /> <br /> It's not bad at all. It's good. It's not good at all.
