When Stanie's husband was killed on the day of their wedding, she escaped to a mountain house where she fell off a cliff and was rescued by a wealthy Morgan lawyer Morgan falls in love with her, which leads to a one-sided marriage, certainly spending time in a large estate in Chicago. (Which seems to be surrounded by mountains!) Stanwyck is tempted by Cortez. But eventually came back to Morgan with the resolution of the story that was weakened and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> This film has a great actor. But the script is crooked and useless at all times I'm ready to enjoy this movie. But in the end I was disappointed Still worth watching the actors and it's good for everyone who likes 1930's movies
