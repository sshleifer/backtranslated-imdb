Regardless of the meaning of his "message" - this movie is a very popular movie - a terrifying performance, bad camera work - I don't know why Carr agreed. Will try You watch the specials on the DVD and the way he has a camera to follow him - he absorbs it - he likes to be the center of attention. He is a bad actor. He reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker, Eric Schaffer. Carr has performed this movie in the Youth Centers and New Age Church, where the damaged people look for reinforcement and give Self-interest is babbling about the way in which movies have touched them and may be so strong.
