I think I laugh twice The lines that the main characters talk about coming from the streets. And then I forgot the time I laughed It may be the beginning. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the thinnest movies ever. Hollywood didn't realize that this kind of humor was disgusting and really sad. You can only insult yourself many times. <br /> <br /> 2/10
