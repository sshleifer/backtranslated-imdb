This is the worst action movie I've ever seen in my life. There's no real thing. I'm not kidding. "References to real / historical stories", all without excuses for bad performances It's a shame, because while others post the dress and the costume is great. <br /> <br /> The music is the song. "Asian style" in general, even though I can't identify where "modern" is. Love music came when Fernandez was in his bed, thinking of Maria. I don't know who wrote and sang a beautiful song. But it is as though Norah Jones was sent to the 1500s. <br /> <br /> The blood of Hershey's syrup in Phycho is more realistic than the tomato sauce that spreads out. br /> but is a show Oh, so painful. The lines that are sent like a gross drama are not good. If Gary Stretch wears a potato dress for County 4H Fair, he may believe more. At the end he listened like a thug on Little Italy. Sometimes I expect him to shout "Adrian!" Or even "Do you want my piece?" <br /> <br /> Favorite line: When the queen speaks to her lover (after barfing on the floor) "I will have children." He said, "Son?" I expect you to respond. "No, stupid legs! Duh. "
