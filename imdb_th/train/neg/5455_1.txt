See this work at a film festival in California. What is the director God thinking? The film director should use this film as a case study about things that shouldn't be done when making a short film. First of all, this project has no meaning at all. This film is only partially in the "The Waystation", which is a lifeless bar in the heart of nothing happening. <br /> <br /> Their performances are not good at all. Terrible. Actually, I think it's funny. Julia Reading, the lead actor, is a step below performing in most amateur porn movies. There are one or two good performances, including those that play Jacob and Fenners. But it is as if the director has no clue in the work or use them. The only worse thing than acting is the dialogue surrounded by nonsense. The writer (which I consider as a director) writes each character as if they were a villain in the comic book. <br /> < br /> The overall production value is quite good. But actually this movie is terrible It's easy to overlook. The design of the production is quite good, although the Waystation looks like an ordinary bar. Clothing and makeup are okay and I understand that production is a small budget. It was only when the characters spoke or they tried and pushed the plot forward. The movie was unraveled into the mud. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is very scary. It's like the director / writer looks at many sci-fi movies and throws all the pieces he likes into the blender and thinks about it. My only hope is that he uses other people's money because if he uses his own, he is all sucker.
