Have a lovely poem bit But actually it's just art - fartsy thrown together without direction or resolution. How do these people go through film schools? Who gave these money to create this shit? Probably more than that Go and live for a long time and don't come back to the camera until they have something to say. This is like a school of spaghetti throwing art that has recently been marketed for serious images and hopes that hope, hope, like hell that the poem emerged. That can work if the director has any vision or has a brain that knows when it has potential But here is just a filler space, no results I felt that the moment was coming to be lazy before it arrived and shouted. "Lazy lazy man" on the screen when the credit pops up.
