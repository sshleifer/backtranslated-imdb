This may be the first item in the detective series "Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat"; In O'Leary's movie, he was later portrayed by a younger actor Guy Kibbee. <br /> <br /> A group of relatives (all played by well-known character actors) gathered in the old house. Of course!) To talk to wealthy relatives who are in a coma. <br /> <br /> While they wait for him to revive everything that happens mysteriously, including two murders. <Br / > <br /> A creepy movie to watch!
