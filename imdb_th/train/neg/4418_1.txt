This is a movie that requires digestion. On the other side, we present a strong outer shell. But inherited from the Catholic Church only But still foolish and without knowledge In the inner layer, we are presented with the orthodox orthodox stories and what happens when people follow blindly beliefs that they must not understand. <br /> <br / > When looking at the first comedy, if so, Mr Durang had to open the dictionary because he did not know the meaning of that word clearly. Pale jokes, humor were awkward and poorly delivered. In particular, Ms. Keaton's performance is more delicate and superior than the quality of Annie Hall and her sleeper. Jennifer Tilly is another form of courage with her treble and whining voice. All of this may be forgiven if not in the last 20 minutes of the film, which is clearly a controversial drama in 1981. <br /> <br /> *** Watch out for spoilers in advance. *** /> ​​<br /> Everything begins with the appearance of the four former students of Sister Mary Ignatius (Ignatius, as the name of the man and the nun will not accept it after her oath under any circumstances. Just because of the fact that Just to show you that the research that is not tedious begins in the beginning project) when they accept that they do not follow the teachings of the church. The sisters continue without reason and insult them in Audience characteristics Believing that she can do it back in the recurring events of all sepia tones. When one of them admitted to having an abortion twice, the nun became more insulted until the student pulled out the gun. After fighting it out of her, the nun kills the student, presumably in self-defense. Then she ramped, screaming, killing former gay students because of his sins. The last appointment was a dead female student and lay in a position like Christ, as the shadow of a cross hung over her. Can you say that I know you can! <br /> <br /> I know that there are unsuitable nuns in the past and I know that many people are emotionally harmed by this result. But these images were destroyed in our neck, almost every picture In the wreck of this train of movies I have heard from writers and directors that this is a movie about hysteria and why people should not follow Orthodoxy religiously. This explanation is difficult to swallow because just because we have never received an oppressive dictatorial view of Catholic faith in some way. This film is just an anti-Catholic rag, in the name of justice and equality, meaning and lively. Hate. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that I would like to recommend for Catholics to encourage him or her. The reality of cynicism and what they face today, if it is `Rabbi Ray, describes it all 'or` Imam Muhammad explains it all', there will be riots in the streets and showtimes. Will lose all subscription But sadly, because this is a film that opposes what is seen as the majority, it is accepted and applauded by those who have the same view. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone The member of that actor is a practicing Catholic, so it's not just the ignorance that led them to create this movie. <br /> <br /> I give 1.5 stars out of 5, not because of the nasty nature, but because of it. Written badly, poorly directed and is generally bad movie Do not waste even less time.
