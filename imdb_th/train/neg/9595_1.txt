In the latest movement that will bring Asian movies to America, this is the movie THE LAST that should be published here. As a big fan of Asian movies from all genres, I surfed the net and found what will be published again in the US market, so I decided to try it before and rent it at a local video store. /> <br /> Believe me ... The action scenes are incredibly disappointing. Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey explode this movie completely out of the water. Jetle will fall asleep and watch the fight sequence. If you are looking for entertainment, martial arts, your time will be better with the flick of Jackie Chan !!! <br /> <br /> Moreover ... You think you are going to see the martial arts that are related. with The girl was lost in the vengence for her parents to die. But surprising !!! The good hour of this film is in the middle, full of dialogue, lack of action, lack of conformity, touch, nothing related to the place we touch. It relates to the relationship between her and the boy and the boy and his conspiracy group, which the producer / director dedicates time to explain and also devotes part of the film that draws the point. Probably better if they just cut that whole hour and developed their own story through another movie and focused on the aspects of martial arts. <br /> <br /> Speaking that I don't believe. Iron Monkey trainers have made action scenes in Princess Blade. I was completely insulted in the use of slow motion and rapid camera changes to show the physical speed of the hand. Whether divide I didn't buy it. <br /> <br /> Please ... I remind you, please don't waste your time / money on this movie. Attractions and trailers may tempt you. But I'm sure this movie is not suitable for the public. (Maybe in Japan But not in the state) and will be the worst movie that leads to the state from the Asian film industry.
