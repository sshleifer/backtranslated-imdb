Recap: According to the legend, Valkyrie Brunhilda challenges Odin and is chained to a rock surrounded by eternal fire. Only an innocent warrior could pass through the flames, release Brunhilda and liberate her from Odin's claim and have her own. Now the war is forming in the Norse lands and the king wants alliances with Berserkers. Berserkers are warriors claiming by Odin's valkyries, wanting to war, blood and meat, so they are evicted. But superior in the fight, the leader of the Berserkers is the son who defames the boar, boar, and his price for the alliance is his brother, the future king Barek. But after the king wins the battle, he refuses to leave his son. The only remaining of him destroyed his oath to the boar and betrayed him and killed his boar. The wild boar is recorded only by Barek and Odin's call, but this is only the beginning of the struggle between brothers and their final battle is about to begin in the next few thousand years ... <br /> <br /> Comments: I hope this is a movie created from Some Viking floors, too few quality movies about Viking, were already created. It started out very well, with details, lengths and armor, good and proper scenes and good fights. <br /> <br /> The legendary foundation of Aesir is thin and looks very damaging to me. Odin is vengeful, vengeful, vengeful and lacking more than I warn him from school and Valkyrie becomes a vampire demon. I'm not an expert But it seems wrong. <br /> <br /> But the fatal mistake caused by this film is to move the time setting from the original time to today. If two brothers fight at the right time with some appropriate battles, this movie should be much better. Now the setting will change to the current Stockholm. Odin is still present and is sending his Boar and berserkers to Brunhilda and Barek, which makes stupid scenes when wearing armor and painted sword and Barek in the industry. Beautiful mountains and forests have been exchanged for cement. And when being allowed to focus on a single fight instead of a big fight, as in the beginning I quickly saw that the fight and skill of the actors were slow and clumsy. <br /> <br /> The result is Sometimes Difficult to follow and other times, just stupid and the only thing that can be saved, that action comes from fencing that is slow, boring and clumsy. It draws from the legendary Aesir or Viking tradition. So the story and action failed and the movie wasn't as good. <br /> <br /> Finally, as a Swedish, this movie is quite confusing. All filming in South Africa still has a sign on the plate and what appears to be a genuine police car. However, the effort was not good and continued until the stage set in Sweden only. No name in Swedish (There may be Anya as an exception.) There are no familiar scenes in Swedish. They (presumably) speak a little (ancient) Norwegian, Norwegian, not Swedish. And uniforms, both police and medical, are not clearly Swedish If they will not try to do it correctly and give the illusion that is in Sweden, why bother? <br /> <br /> 4/10
