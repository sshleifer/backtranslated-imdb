I picked up this film to replace the depressing choices of television in the daytime and the thirst for the death of a young woman. Previously, it was better than the TV during the day .... even though I was not sure about it. <br /> <br /> It has a score, but after about 20-30 minutes, it's good. Made for television movies that put together not a lot of time to do things that will hold each other. In short, the sci fi movie genre is terrible. <br /> <br /> There are various points like dirty future like "Blade Runner". Shows ..... Of course, this is not "Blade Runner" "Captain Looks like feeling like actor Robert Forster, the person that we want to be next to. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it turned out to be a bad feeling. "Andromeda" Revival The muscles of The crew consists of a copy of the poor genius of the "alien". The mystery is the vampire Willow intensifies sex and the new captain may be like Jan-Michael. Vincent runs around "Danger Island" in "Isolated banana"; He wears a uniform with epaulets only. He has very little right to get it. They all run around with the power that appears in the boat. 'Eureka Maru' as they are fighting against a group of 'people' that occupy the universe and break into many different tribes or denominations Evolutionary features ....... Like Nietzcheans in "Andromeda" <br /> <br /> It may have redemption with Michael Ironside, but after a while, that person felt that he came in. Participate as a hoot! He may enjoy doing it. But it doesn't help much. <br /> <br /> It's ..... "Okay." Okay, in a way that might watch a DVD once without closing. If they watch with ads, they may change channels. Some people may watch it once .......... But a few hours later, wondering what it is that makes them watch it all. <br /> <br /> For me, that is a girl. Evil ............ when she was fighting
