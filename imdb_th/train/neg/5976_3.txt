Rumors are true: Women like COYOTE UGLY more than men. And the reason is clear as soon as it is determined The girl went to New York to become a songwriter. And after the first irritability without luck, women heard that there was a party of about $ 300 each time they did it last night. She auditioned at the bar where they worked and surprise! This place is full of "Two year old toddler" who dances with baby <br /> <br /> The story is not bad and some characters are especially fond of Cammie (the "fashion coordinator" cute) and liars. But facing each other, it was a scary and laughing drama from the beginning Violet and her father seem too ridiculous while they are involved throughout the story. And check violet on that keyboard with a break dancer! <br /> <br /> The first time I thought of In a short time with this movie, Hollywood can stand on both feet and show a new low point without any hysterics, but it seems that COYOTE UGLY aims to try to kiss the important background. Everywhere in the advertising world in the bar, but showing some paper "Pursue your dreams" makes every young man disappoint you as you target! <br /> <br /> And the last one is music. There is no break music that I found in this movie, especially when necessary. (Hospital scene) Every scene feels like a short music video that you want to stop until the bar opens. But Climax is the most laugher: 80s music that you expect Cyndi Lauper to jump on stage and jam with Violet. Heck, I think Bon Jovi is going to jump out with long hair and jam too. br /> <br /> In addition to the smart camera that works really well with coyote girls when dancing (Especially wet scenes) and a pair of cute cliches, UGLY COYOTE is something that is purely embarrassing about Whether you watch or create it, it seems nothing but killing time. Or waste, depending on how you look
