When we are in high school, some of our men sometimes leave stinkbombs. It is considered funny. But the producers, directors and actors of "Semana Santa" ("Angel of Death" in the DVD of video rentals in your area) are adults and they still sell. <br /> <br /> like Previous reviewer Who wondered if the character was worried about going down the scene and going home? I wonder if there will be more than one scene in any scene. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is hot in "Mighty Aphrodite" and others Highest rated movies seem to sell themselves to this project. Her performance does not exist, confine the zodiac that longs for, which should indicate that "Sensitive". How is it with the fate of victims of various movies? <br /> <br /> But let me remind you - don't be the next victim! Away from the DVD. If you find it on the shelves, Tbere doesn't get a good picture of Mira's legs (the single highest point I can find in the movie) and the supporting actors are of lower quality. Send bad conversations to conversations. Infamous with the "Spanish" accent that is worthy of the drama production school
