There are too many plots that do not have a main line. There was an overheating button pressed for no reason. They dealt with boring things in this movie that didn't say anything with all the drama elements that were there: death, divorce, money problems, raising problems. Suicide, psychological problems, acceptance, rejected love, travel issues, sex, model misunderstanding, robbery, legal issues, guns, medical ethics, " Another deep true love "? Would you think it would make a movie interesting but not? All of these events are secondary to some of the main things that are not boring. Not to mention that the "deep" (and very long) lecture for children at the end of this film is all nonsense. <br /> <br /> Oh, forget to mention: Every actor is quite good. That is what makes me unable to close. For their bad ability, they wasted. This movie was also filmed as well: light, movement and others of every episode - everything went in place. It's just a missing meaning.
