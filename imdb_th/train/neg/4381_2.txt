This is one of the five worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not that they didn't try. There is a good writing with the elements of the structure in it. Good actors and good actors. I'm not sure where it went wrong. But it's horribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some elements may have a bad structure and no important story. Better than being restricted) Some superintendents and bad editors I have enough time, one hour, tearing my hair out for about an hour and a half, and very excited in an hour and fifty minutes In addition, there is a sincerity about everything because I went with someone who had been a heroin addict. He felt frustrated that it was something to look at. There was nothing good for it. That was bolstered by a 17-year-old beautiful woman who fell in love with a 30-year-old junkie. <br /> <br /> And the harsh nature of the leader is open. There is a plot that starts trying to structure But the result is restlessness and never ending (With an irregular time line) colorful characters But it doesn't end, which makes me feel bad for the quality actors you haven't seen. <br /> <br /> Skip it. I assumed that this was the first director who attracted his turds. But he used to do this. Before I am confused that this and many other bad ideas find people who really give money to them.
