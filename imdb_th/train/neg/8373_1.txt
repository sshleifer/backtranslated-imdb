I was not impressed about this film, especially the fact that I went to the movies with my family in good faith to see the 12A certified movie here. For my fears, this film is full of stories. Embarrassing sex jokes (Which is not a problem for me as an adult But not good for watching with children) sometimes this movie is quite rough sometimes with jokes, farting, being hit in the groin, etc. and most of this film is not very funny. The location of the film is Calvin Sim, a 2-inch dwarf out of prison and stealing a giant diamond. But was forced to put it in a woman's handbag So the rest of the movie saw that he passed himself as a neglected child into the woman's house so he could get this diamond back. <br /> <br /> Until now, I'm happy with the result. Most of the work from Wayans Brothers - but this movie is bringing biscuits to <br /> <br /> Good advice, wait until it comes out on TV or cable.
