I'm not sure who is writing a review. <br /> <br /> That shining for this movie, but believe in STKINKS. I saw hundreds of horror movies and movies that were swapped and this movie. It's nonsense. It's only about 80 minutes long and believe me that that's what I can do. Poor plot. Performing worse. <br /> <br /> Even David Cocteau's film is better than this. Run from JIGSAW. I expect to hate acting that can directly forgive the movie if the plot is good. > <br /> This thing doesn't have a lot of fear. Gore. <br /> <br /> And a truly interesting actor. <br /> <br /> I watched this story with three other friends. < br /> <br /> I wish I could still talk to me. <br /> <br /> They want me to escape. Separated from the window I can't believe that everyone will have <br /> <br /> considering the tripe examination.
