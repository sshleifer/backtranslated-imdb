I want to watch the action comedy (As the movie was screened) but this movie caused me to be miserably disappointed For me, the plot was quite confusing and I quickly lost interest. I regret that John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff related to this movie. I will continue to be all of them. But only time can keep my feelings more One thing I can say positively about the movie is that Hillary plays the character of Yonica very well until I don't remember Hillary. I take a couple of scenes to realize that she is Luckily I rented it for $ 1 through the red box; If I pay to watch it on the big screen, I will really smoke !!
