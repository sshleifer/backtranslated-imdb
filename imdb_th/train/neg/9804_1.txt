Power rangers, which is a favorite television program for children from 1990, has become the most ridiculous and ridiculous TV program ever created. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this program? Rate plastic nonsense with children? There is nothing even remotely or interesting about this show. <br /> <br /> Look at the dress that looks like spandex. <br /> <br /> Cylinder style hair. Earrings and The fashion of the early 1990s looked completely ridiculous today. <br /> <br /> Avoid this show at all costs!
