I have a little opinion on this issue. "The Hurt Locker" won the "Best Picture" award from a group of critics more than other films this year. However, not only But I don't like it. I find it hard to sit through <br /> <br /> There are a little character planning and development. They disarm bombs, fight and disarm the bombs again. That is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst part is that the camera never stops moving and shaking all the time. This is a fashion recently created in movies and it should make it look more realistic because it is cheap. The camera shakes a lot. It makes me feel nauseous at the screen. <br /> <br /> Normally I don't care about war movies and "The Hurt Locker" is no exception. But you don't have to hold on to my words because critics love it
