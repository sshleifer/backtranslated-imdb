Okay, this movie "Unique" Actually, we will say Carey Fisher is the most talented person in the film, although it is said that she has a coke problem during the movie. But she said she didn't remember much That is her excuse. But what other people ??? I can't imagine that all of them have coke problems, no matter how bad it is. I mean, I think that the plot is ok and it has a funny time Even though the guy received that thing in his head was too intense for my taste. Oh, I guess I'm disappointed because Carrie Fisher is a great person and this movie doesn't do for you.
