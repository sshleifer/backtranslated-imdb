The biting stunts act like a comedian. Elvis Presley plays an Indian bullfighting champion who leaves from a rodeo to stay at a desert house scattered in the desert in Arizona, where the government's suit has recently invested in a family livestock herd. (Which needs a lot of studs). What the director Peter Tewksbury wants is the ability to tell the story, even if what he lacks in his assessment is done in a joke that is sloppy. (His social opinion did not clearly point out There are some funny scenes.) Despite the colorful revolutions by Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, the general bizarre slip away and there are too many hoopin 'and hollerin' to pay attention. For Elvis, he was always loose and playful, and despite being happy to see him having fun on the screen, he had to wonder if he had just stopped acting. The picture in this cinema has a different feeling from hell and even though the spirit is at a high level. But very low returns * 1/2 from ****
