I often read reviews before watching movies. Guess what I didn't do before watching TLB and I must say that I was very surprised to see the above average score at IMD. I find that it doesn't have all the stories. You have just been dropped. (And sadly, not on the way Saving Saving Ryan let us go into the movie) and it ended abruptly, which was not satisfying for me Very realistic for me, especially when having a low budget. But getting ready to laugh ... Some people are thrown into the air after the explosion as if they were Olympic gymnasts. Iron corkscrew or somersault during the First World War I was quite a lot for me, especially when it made countless hours in the movie ... <br /> <br /> But the part that made me laugh almost Will cry Is a scene with close combat Screaming and shouting German ... incredibly funny It seems that they are being spoken by a single actor / voice actor because they all sound the same, and it looks like the typical 'German' sound. <br /> <br /> I won't recommend this movie like Of course! To everyone except for those who just want to laugh because of its sad and repetitive qualities
