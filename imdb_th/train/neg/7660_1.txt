Christian Slater 0 *, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson Directed by Uwe Boll <br /> <br /> Based on the video game director Uwe Boll trying to create the game. New to become a nail game that is full of sad action. He created one of the worst movies! Although he gained a small reputation, such as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, his films lacked the basic necessities for a good movie, such as the story and the basic relationship of what happened in the dark. The movie bounces around and Uwe Boll doesn't have creative control and doesn't talk about bad CGI used to create monsters. Although they look cool and the food is good But a little crippled Honestly, this is one of the worst movies ever made. My final score 0/10
