Usually I don't have a problem with movies or stories that have a ending that makes you wonder how to solve the mystery of what really happened when doing the purpose ... <br /> <br /> But this movie gives a feeling. As if they had all been received, but 15 minutes ago they had finished knowing that they had the remaining $ 5 ... <br /> <br /> I saw it on TBS ... I recommend You don't spend money on it. If you catch it on the TV, watch all except the last 15 minutes then walk away and make your ending in your heart. <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie would be better if they fled. And come back with the Feds Poice State, only to find that the city and the car graveyard are missing and all of the things that have never been ... <br /> <br /> "Hopefully I will have more thumbs So i Can lift a finger to that movie 4 inches down! "
