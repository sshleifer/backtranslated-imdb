As others have pointed out that this film is a story of inspiration for those who do not care or punish us, we all know that after seeing Trainspotting And the acid house in Scotland is one of the first depressions in the world But different from Trainspotting And acid house without humor or realism of this genre is not effective And more importantly, if there is no suitable script, the movie will not work and there is nothing new, inspiring or inspiring ideas about the script for this film. <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie Won Bafta's performance twice. Unfortunately, the British film industry is now. I think the Australian film industry is quite bad now. Unfortunately, the British industry is getting worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. I won't bother even renting from the weekly section. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and give this movie. Is a wide posture
