Finding a winner Vargas is just a bad movie. There is no denial of advertising or dollar support for public relations by changing this sad fact. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Peter Sollett sees that he doesn't have the money to make the movie he wants to do and decides to use the easy way. Came out by creating a bad movie that mocked the current beliefs Maybe he doesn't know anything. It's hard to tell <br /> <br /> What is not difficult to say is the result. Except for some viewers who would create bad movies to become a true imitation attempt, a small number of people will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I know I didn't do it. <br /> <br /> You yourself like and pass in this movie.
