... If I watched it during my teens This movie provides gentle entertainment. What I like about Soul Survivors is the gothic atmosphere between the party scene and the constant variation between 'dreams' and' truth. <br /> <br /> If there is no movie like 'The 6th Sense' 'Don' don't have to watch now, I will be surprised by the ending.
