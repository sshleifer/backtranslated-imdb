... that seems to deceive people to see properties in this film that are not there. <br /> <br /> Near Dark covers the same territory. But there are many classes and actions. <br /> <br Why script to keep Their 'great secret' has long been a complete mystery for me - I guess at the breakfast scene at the beginning of the movie. By the time it was revealed to the audience, it was just a matter. 'The big story tells me something I don't know.' <br /> <br /> I found this as a pointless movie that might challenge the genre. Unfortunately, those meetings are horror movies that are stressful and full of real horror. This is bad.
