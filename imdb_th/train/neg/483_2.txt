I don't think France will make a bad movie. But I was clearly very wrong As previously mentioned, this movie uses the main character as a dead spot. The depiction of her life and her person is little or no real connection to the true Artemisia Jentilechi. <br /> <br /> The script is terrible, cocky, proud and vain and Repeated writing of facts is an unusual thing, even in the form that often causes distortion rather than distortion of history. In addition to the relatively good scene design, the physical charm of Valentina Cervi is The property assets of this movie, and it was clear from the outset that the filmmakers were aware of this as well. They do not have to waste time inventing the "erotic" sequence that is involved in excitement rather than planning or character development. Unfortunately, the attractiveness of seeing beautiful girls in sexual arousal conditions cannot and does not support this movie. The performance is not unusual and all scores are too common, even if there are two or more interesting chords. The movie is OK and has some beautiful colors. But there are some ridiculous scenes by using a distorted lens effect that is more suitable for the freakout era film in the 1960s than the drama series In any case, the script will let the camera stay in Artemisia's body too often and rarely in her paintings. <br /> <br /> Everyone says it's a failure. Near completion It's not smart or tasteful enough to be a serious movie, and it's too slow and pretentious to work as a softcore porn. So France can fail after all!
