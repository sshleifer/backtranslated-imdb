Ann Bancroft plays the dying Estelle, a Jewish mother who asks her dedicated son. (Ron Silver) sought the position of the movie star Greta Garbo at once secluded and recommended both before Estelle checked out. May have been called "Bancroft Talks" because the actress was raped, funny / provocative / sensational Would not be resized by the filmmakers - he put her in front of cute, lovely tears and ranting. Estelle became a drag in this situation. (Not that a very thin plot occurs) The star Cary Fisher, Fisher, Fisher and Catherine Hicks will receive very little money and performances. But acts as a star support * 1/2 from ****
