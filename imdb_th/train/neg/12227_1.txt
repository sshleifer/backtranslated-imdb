This may be the worst movie ever created. Streisand is not as ridiculous as a young woman posing as a man to study Judaism. The soundtrack is a torture story, with Barbara beaten by the weakest people who had filmed before. And don't even start with me You will be laughed out of this movie more than many comedy movies because it's terrible. Streisand's rampant ego thinks she can lift this stinker to the Oscar heights somehow lead to this disaster. I'm quite sure that the novelist Isaac Bashevis Singer hates this movie and never forgives Streisand. I can't blame him. This movie is like watching a wreck of a slow-moving car for two hours with the soundtrack of 'The Sound of Music' that is played back on the old record It's really bad I was surprised that everyone from Streisand enjoyed this movie at the intended level.
