Or listen to that matter Even the soundtrack is boring. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is not the worst gay movie I've ever seen. (That's about Billy) but it's very close to the bottom of the tank. <br /> <br /> This thing drag and drag and drag It's not that the story is ridiculous - in the hands of a good writer, it may work well .. Of course, it's probably a lot more fun There is no plot point that you cannot see for ten miles. The dialog is smooth. Old jokes To add insult to injury, it is filled with one-dimensional gays. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that makes me confident that the situation or relationship of both leaders is actually much less possible. Without chemistry, there is no power. There is no evidence why leading actors love each other... We just say that they are in love. Difficult to think when they have nothing in common and not being sexually compatible. Do they like the same book? <br /> <br /> The performance isn't bad. But the slow rhythm I mean almost Jarmusch-slow but without quality Jarmusch. In fact, it's a good barometer for you. If you like movies, Jarmusch avoid this movie.
