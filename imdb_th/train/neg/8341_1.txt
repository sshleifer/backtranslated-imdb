I love horror movies I can appreciate most cheeses (Facing 9 stories from 9 horror films from today is cheese) but it's ridiculous Great performances, terrible writing, hollow characters and completely unbelievable. (No Meisner actors here!) And lack of adequate body I hope I can save 79 minutes in the life that I just lost. At least there was a brother named Crook aptly. The only good thing about this movie was seeing Alicia Silverstone - wanting to be punched in front. The method that used to make this Sundance completely mess with me. The plot is mostly unrealistic, even if it meets the standards of the slasher movie. I mean, come on! Who would run out to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after the creepy draftsman just got out of their doorstep? incoherently.
