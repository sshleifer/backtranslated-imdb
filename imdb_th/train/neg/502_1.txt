This film is not only But is a very bad movie, a horrible actor - or presumably the actor - boring direction and unattractive story But also copied the scene from "giallio" "Torso" directed by Sergio Martino in 1973 (two years ago), one of the most famous thriller films of Italian movies and religious films around the world in "La Sanguinusa conduce la danza "The director creates a bed scene between a black woman and a white girl by watching Tom from the bedroom window. Naturally, the scenes in Rizzo's movies are ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charm of Martino's films, in order to have other black women, another white woman, and another person who sneaks into this scene is the most appropriate way to Prove that Rizzo's movies have no idea, no originality, no taste and nothing. I think things are wrong for the audience.
