I want to like the West like this, being a true fan and a big fan of "Buffalo Bill", "Wild Bill Hickok" and "Calamity Jane". Everyone is on this story. <br /> <br /> The problem is ..... it's not. I found myself watching my watch in just 40 minutes. In this story, tired of death. Jean Arthur's character is quite annoying and James Ellison doesn't seem or act like "Buffalo Bill" Cooper didn't get the best of him as well. Sounds too much wood. This was many years before he hit his prime as an actor. <br /> <br /> In summary, his western bullet Head up and see other people because most people are better than this person.
