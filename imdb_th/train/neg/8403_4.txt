I gave this four things with a purely historical context. It was considered lost for many years until it emerged from the blue in Showtime. In the early days, <br /> <br /> Moe was a straight man and Larry and Marlon acted as a couple. I think it has something to do with working on a ranch. I'm not sure because the plot of that story has nothing left in my memory. I remember that it was a joke in Western music. Even the followers are still moving. Overall, nothing is recommended here. <br /> <br /> If you're not a Stooge fan, you don't have to worry. If you are a Stooge fan, stick with shorts.
