Oh! This is what I'm talking about! As far as the bad horror / cheeky movie, this movie is actually in a class of its own, a real gem! <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is not in English. It doesn't matter because the voice is really great! This is an excerpt from the conversation I like. (And there are many more that come from) "I feel a little better, I'm just thirsty, right for your blood!" <br /> <br /> And what a drama! Is this a play by playing a summary of the interactions between soldiers and scientists? <br /> <br /> Scene 1? Scientists: "You can't? It will be disastrous! "- Batman:" That's just science fiction. "(Then he started to cause disasters like the scientists predicted.) <br /> <br /> Scene 2? Scientists: "If you do that, many people will die !!!" - Batman: "You don't know what you are talking about" (he did and many people die) <br /> <br /> Scene 3 ?? Scientists: "Don't do that? It will kill everyone! "- Batman:" That's ridiculous "(then he will kill everyone) <br /> <br /> Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (You get the idea) <br /> <br /> If that's not enough? There are some scenes that stand out as classic immediately! In one scene, the soldiers had 10 men pointing the gun to two men without weapons. The leader shouted, "Go get 'em!" And all 10 soldiers at a time, place the gun and fight with both enemies! Classic immediately! <br /> <br /> and don't worry No attention to detail left! The film also has hip / upbeat sound / synth / keyboard to create emotions! <br /> <br /> and trust me ?? I know this review may have some spoilers. But there are goodies in this epic, I have just scratched the surface This talent movie came out only once in a decade! True movie experience! Masterpiece! Wow!
