OK, director remakes LOVE ACTUALLY, director Nikhil Advani, after debuting with KHNH, doing his second half and waiting for <br /> <br /> He made a movie 3:30 + hours, which was impatient when watching. Hours watching this movie <br /> <br /> Okay, they have 6 stories, so it's necessary, but why? 6 stories? <br /> <br /> We have the story of Anil-Juhi that is convincing but boring. Did the TV show serials show the story? <br /> <br /> We have the story of Govinda-Shannon, which is the story. Funny and work well. <br /> <br /> We have stories. Akshaye-Ayesha Again believe But boring soon and focusing on more jokes and that is boring stuff. <br /> <br /> <br /> We have the story of Salman- Priyanka, which is the worst, not just showing words. <br /> <br /> We have the story of Sohail-Isha that will make you laugh and the trick can be used all the time. Thank you. Boredom defined by most other stories. <br /> <br /> We have the story of John-Vidya as The great part about /> <br /> In all aspects, but then all <br First of all, it comes in a piece that viewers feel tired and lethargic. Especially Salman's point - Priyanka. The story of Nikhil Advani's management is okay at some places. But weak at the Music venue (SEL) is a good story. But there are too many songs, all movies are good A different and functional surface appearance. <br /> <br /> Govinda rock actors, after being fired from BB, make you laugh and love him in this film, despite his age and weight. Anil Kapoor will Can do his part well He looks out of shape and tired with John Keng. In his part, Akshaye Khanna pretends to change. <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is too much - top and Isha. There is nothing to do. Anjana Suknani is fired. > <br /> Priyanka and Salman deserve a reward for this film that shocked you? <br /> <br /> Salman Khan is not acting just by saying that he is sleeping and a fake accent. Oh God, Priyanka overacts it as a standard that you feel like throwing something with you. You can do better until the end. Vidya Balan, Juhi Chawla is ok. Shannon is okay.
