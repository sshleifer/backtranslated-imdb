This is an insult to victims and their families from BTK killers. The events in this movie are not close to the truth. Why can't they make movies of real events that don't make any sense because the real events are more interesting? Don't waste time watching this thing for free. Low budget and depiction of embarrassing events that should not be a joke, which is what this movie does. If they would allow me to give -10 to this movie, I would The show sucks and it looks like it was shot on an old VHS camcorder from the 80s. Save time and money by not watching this movie.
