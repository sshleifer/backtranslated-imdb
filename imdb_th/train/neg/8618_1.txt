An incredibly scary movie I watched this part on the T.V. My jaw dropped when I watched the horrible plot and listened to the mind-numbing thoughts. There is no single line from one master of the ocean. Can come close to producing something that looks like a laugh. It was terrible that it made me want to dig Rodney Dangerfield's body, slap him around and scream that I know that many movies have been created hastily, hoping to be popular with actors or themes But please, Hollywood shows a little respect for your audience. It's sad and scary that people expect to pay to see such rags. The bottom of the toilet, even according to the television standards on Sunday afternoons
