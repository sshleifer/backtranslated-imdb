Wow and I think that Steven Seagull's movie isn't good. Every time I think this movie will not be worse, it proves that I am wrong, but the actor can't take it out. In addition, they also made many mistakes about the proper archaeological excavation methods. For example, you do not deal with inventions until they have been catologed and accounted for the biggest crime in casting, namely young archaeologists. She is a weak actor and I feel that her performance makes this movie less realistic. The whole concept of Templar Knights that are underground every year, these seem very stupid for me. I like the idea that they disappear and how things are almost depressing. I think the characters can't explain well enough. You don't find much background and make it difficult to relate to them.
