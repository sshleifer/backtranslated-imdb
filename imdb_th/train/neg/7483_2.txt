Anyone thinks (as I do) with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawk and John Kleise, the movie at least should be suitable for these stars (especially Martin and Cleese ) Created the funniest comedy of all time Not how others can be funny It hurt me when I saw these talented actors kill one of the weakest scripts I've ever seen. I still have hope for a long time throughout the duration of the movie. But failing to provide any entertainment regularly. <br /> <br /> Usually both movies and life I try. To avoid biased opinions and general conclusions But with this film, it's hard not to let go. I can rely on one hand, maybe two or three inches, a product from Hollywood that makes me bitter than this. This is one of the worst comedies ever created. <br /> <br /> I try to have fun --- I really do. But in the end, The Out-of-Towners Failed miserably If you want entertainment that saves time, just take your money and watch it spin as you wash it in the bathroom. Please do not watch this movie.
