How do you rate movies like this? Is it worth the movie too? It's a movie that tries to get as close to the film as possible. In general, all movies are all people. But tortured the girl Not attractive and, above all, really unreal. <br /> <br /> It's clear that movies try to be as realistic and shocking as possible. However, this movie is a fake that can be made as needed. The slap and stump are soft and fake, including sounding. They tend to kick on the floor instead of entering women clearly. The way that women respond to all suffering is tame. I mean, if this is true, she would scream out. There was more lament than screaming in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has a low budget and is clearly a brave attempt to try to do something shocking Do not think that this movie will have a huge impact, even at the time of release, even if it has to do good things because there are six sequels after this release. Blood is often disappointed by this film, although there are still amulets that will be kicked out of this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
