I do not understand why creating a remake became a trend. Every remake I've seen is bad, and this is not an exception. If anyone sees a quote from Ben Jones that is "lazy" junk, he is right. Why are they shooting great TV shows that I love, never miss one episode and have seasons 1-4. On DVD and destroying it, I never knew. TV shows are family programs and although Daisy has a body But really boasting or talking about the set record The family show turns into a dirty garbage and I won't recommend anyone to watch. Another thing I don't like is John Schneider and Tom Wopat. It's a great actor. (Including the original actors) and they are very cute Bo and the new look are not even cute. That is one of the drawers for the show. The casting is terrible. They have brown, at least for Daisy. I don't think Bert Reynolds is a qualified boss like any other role that he had played in contrast to all of this. The only role they have chosen is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jessie. But still no comparison Denver Pyle is all his own actors and that makes him perfect for the role. I think the selection of the actors is terrible. The story is terrible, and all of them destroy the great performance and become a dirty and scary movie. I will not recommend anyone to watch. I saw it with curiosity, plus a free ticket on the Season 4 DVD. I never paid to watch this movie, but it's free. Don't pay to watch this movie.
