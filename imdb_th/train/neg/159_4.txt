I always admire Susan Sarandon about honesty and integrity in her personal life, including her talents as an actor. I find it strange that she appears in movies that distort the facts. Helping her character from the South Pole was carried out by a Canadian charter company from Edmonton Alberta Bin, a plane that was designed and built in Canada's Twin Otter aircraft. Signed by the United States Air Force, the Navy and the same Coast Guard company, created a similar rescue a few years later to pull a man out of the South Pole base I felt that this film represented an interesting story and recorded a very brave woman who faced a horrible job. I failed to see why the manufacturer found it necessary to ignore the bravery of the rescue pilot and show the rescue plane as USAF Hercules.
