Jean Seberg didn't have a talent for acting. Like all of her films, 'Bonjour tristesse' doesn't look at her. (Although she may be the first of the modern women that Tom Wolfe cheerfully described correctly, "Boy and chest": The publicist definitely uses the word "gamine") but suffers greatly from Seberg's dull and boring voice in all of her films. When showing anger, Seberg is shown with the sound of listening. Not annoying, disfiguring and suffocating during repeated speeches. Oy. <br /> <br /> Preminger's adaptation of Françoise Sagan, an innocent young man, a fantasy drama about an opera. Water used for his film. But it is difficult to seize the opportunity in the French Riviera, and perhaps it will suit him, but of course, the employment of black and white images for the current scene in which Seberg's monochromatic narrative helps us to go back to the flashy colors. <br /> <br /> Juliette Gréco has a short time, a black and white spotlight, emits a nice sound. Dietrichesque Existing poems of the title song This period is today in retrospect rather than a bit bit. Except of course if you are a French man - especially if you are a French man "68-er" yearning for a glorious day of obstructions that surround the Sorbonne - and your children. The riots are to preserve the sinecures throughout life that destroy and make. France is derogatory. Economy: So you still believe in Sartre and Foucault and the unrelated theorists. <br /> <br /> David Niven plays the most difficult role by playing with gusto. Enough about all the thoughts of Sagan's teenage hips, cool, swinging ', "Copen Mon!" Father Deborah Kerr sent her like a professional. Seberg's indignant suffering, spitefulness, nose-jealousy (responses to the imagination of shallow adolescents shallow of the theme of "There is only one queen bee in the nest"); In fact, Kerr is a good and memorable moment. <br /> <br /> The conversation is not natural - I agree with the previous critic who said that it sounds like "bad translation" from French. Nature and Seberg's unreliable sound, and you can save that Valium for one more night. Above all, interrupting the voice acting after the filming is almost always noticeable and more annoying: this is true, especially winking for Mylène Demongeot because it makes her lose her blonde color. <br /> <br >> Hunky Geoffrey Horne received a brief moment of sticking here - a very nice young man who had suffered from an unattractive and fascinating voice that when paired with The buzz of Se Berg makes an unbelievable scene of puppy love. (Horn is, we can say enough in 'Bridge On the River Kwai', probably because his end was held by great film professionals like William Holden and Jack Hawkins instead of Seberg. In summary, 'Bonjour tristesse' looks beautiful, but it is a soap that has not yet reached the water.
