Where does that sound come from? It sounds like it was called <br /> <br /> Not that bad. Synopsis = Bad Accents = bad (even Dougray and we live in Scotland), Acting = bad, Harp = bad, sex scenes - Poor / cringeworthy <br /> <br /> Still, we watched it until the end of disbelief. How can calling a good actor do badly? Will they get a good job again? <br /> <br /> Not good, bad, bad. By the way we gave it 3 because at least we were tempted to watch it until the end because of its strange plot, etc. <br /> <br /> And for the old examiner - I agree. More like it A romantic comedy from the 1940s. How did it happen in 2004? <br /> <br /> Okay, OK. It's a bit OK. They have a good house in Bristol. Dougray has a good boat. The fir looks good in a small set, but why does the sister get all the guys?
