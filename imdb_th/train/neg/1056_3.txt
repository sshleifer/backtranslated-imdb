Diana Guzman is an angry woman. She used anger with the closest target. <br /> <br /> When she saw the violence changed and focused on discipline training in a famous boxing club, she knew she had found her home. <br /> <br /> The film proceeds from the moment when Diana learns the lessons that come with the skills necessary for a successful boxing routine. Michel Rodriguez plays a very good role, especially when conveying the anger that focuses on the young women who come in all areas and fight not only personal situations. <br /> <br /> The direction of every young actor who is weak compared to older actors with more experience. There are too many scripts to stop temporarily, which divert tremendous tension. The total tranquility of the movie drains out. <br /> <br /> This is a good picture to see once if seeing the power of a fully-recognized woman whose femininity is complex enough To combine her power, its limitations make it impossible to be in the category "Look over and over again"
