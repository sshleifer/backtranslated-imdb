"The Cobweb" is an example of many movie trailers with strong performances, sometimes with interesting performances and high scores. Unfortunately, shattered and slowed down noticeably from the darker and less interested in the audience, it shows Richard Widmark as a doctor working in a mental institution where life becomes chaotic due to family problems and ridiculous conflicts. Hard work, which seems to be a big deal. <br /> <br /> The story is horrible. It's time for the institution to get a new fabric for the window. the An old woman wants to cover her over. But many patients want to do it themselves And the nonsensical and unintentional conflict arose at the point where life was in danger and the family began to crumble It seems that the conflict will occur between young children. <br /> <br /> Asking questions about the logic of the storyline and whether it's actually happening or not is so big that one person only suspects that the madman is true. Who can buy it. Do not understand me wrong. There is nothing wrong with the Widmark show starring. The following consists of many other great actors who have been nominated. The Valle Ortega and Oscar winner. And sometimes there is a period in the movie that is well made But do not include stupid plot about window blinds Unfortunately there are too many dogs to hide and slow down the movie. The filming is very long and is made from the point of view of a single camera, which is based on slow pacing and lack of interest in watching. <br /> <br /> In a short analysis "The Cobweb" Is an unknown movie Why the general audience as soon as the plot comes into focus, which is quite fast It sounds fun and I tell you it's not fun to watch.
