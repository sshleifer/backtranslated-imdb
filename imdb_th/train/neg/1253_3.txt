I read that Hollywood should pay attention to making bad movies and leaving the classics alone. We can hope While this remake is not all waste But I still hope I can get six dollars back on the original DVD. A lot of violence and one of the worst endings I've ever seen This model does not add anything new. It only emphasizes why Hollywood should leave only good things.
