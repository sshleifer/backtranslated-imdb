This movie has a great actor in it! Unfortunately they forgot to practice I hope this movie will improve as well. But acting is a robot. It is doomed from the beginning. It seems that the actors may read from the script all the time. May be a musical score or director But one thing is for sure, artists who want to make up for a new job! The powder is so thick that you can see that it has been dried on the actor's face! Will not recommend this movie to anyone, not surprising that it never hit the cinema Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods humiliated because he refused to give everything. A good plot just needs a lot.
