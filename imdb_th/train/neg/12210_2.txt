This movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies that Stallone had created. This is a 80s movie that you have a man destroying the entire army by himself. "First Blood Pt. 2" is very similar to Schwarzenegger's "Commando", but there you have Arnold killing the terrorists. This film is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. Actually, this is the peak of the Cold War. But I'm tired of having the Communists or the Nazis always acting as enemies. There are many American movies that have this same thing. Why is there no movie showing that Americans are enemies? Who will believe that one soldier will destroy the entire army? What do you think would be true? By looking at it, the average American audience will definitely brainwash.
