I watched this movie in the preview filter and I'm glad I didn't pay. This movie is disgusting. It is full of funny pearls and fart and not proud of the action scenes. (For example, the penalty spot in "Little Germany") I list things that I like in movies .. and many things I don't agree. <br /> <br /> 1 Dave Foley's penis 2. Fart jokes 3. Poop jokes 4. Friends are pussy 5. No Gary Coleman 6. Taliban 7. Fun for Bush again .. We have already received that he is stupid .. step Next 8. Friends with blonde hair 9. Plot 10. To kill minors 11. Uwe Boll is in there 12. Most actors Just being aggressive and going out. <br /> <br /> Now, good people (a few) <br /> <br /> 1 The Dude uses cats as a sound collector in the game. 2. Action 3. Crotchy makes a return (and the postman's pendant) 4. Umm .. I don't have to pay. He made another crappy game to modify the movie. I would like to thank you. Boll 2/10
