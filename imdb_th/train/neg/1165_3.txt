I will keep this short, because I know I don't need to say anything. <br /> <br /> "Life" is a strange little movie that attracts the attention of some people. But I think it's annoying Almost the beginning This film made very little to make any character favorite, and sometimes the story was so complicated that I completely lost interest. As I said, I know that other people enjoy it, but I find that Kitamura's "life" is anything but the most boring and boring drama that disguises itself as a sci-fi action movie. Think I feel like being sucked into watching this film based on interesting places and exciting cover images. Uber <br /> <br /> My advice? Going through it for Kitamura's first attempt, which is more fun than "with" or riots in 2004 "Godzilla: Final Wars" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> .. And don't understand me wrong Movies of people who think well But not so There was a time when I was concerned about an event that actually happened in this movie. The conversation was heavy. The heavy conversation. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about boring things.
