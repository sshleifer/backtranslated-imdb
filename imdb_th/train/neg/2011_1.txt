This movie is pure guano. Mom always said that if you can't say anything well ... but even my mother says that I have to do my part to remind others of this movie. <br /> <br /> I can guarantee that This is the movie that Geoffrey Rush wishes to disappear. I hope Greg Kinnear will shoot his agent from the cannon that gives him the script. After this, Ben Stiller may pray for someone to throw. "There is always something about Mary." I am always a big fan of Wes Studi. Thank you for what you hold sacred that he wears a mask through the film. It began to tend to be stylistic. Fooled the movie of Batman and then lost something ... like a continuous plot and half the right effects. <br /> <br /> The joke has a telegram. One hour before arrival. If you want to see the effective spoof of the comic book world, see "Chasing Amy" <br /> <br /> RUN! Don't walk out "Brave Man"!
