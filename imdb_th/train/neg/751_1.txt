I honestly believe that everyone who considers filmmaking will have to suffer from this incredible failure, just like Edward Wood, Jr. 'movies'. The real filmmakers therefore use scripts to write a lot of energy, edit their movies, look right. This movie is a good argument for the studio screening process. If Mr. Hines is forced to endure the sincere response of an unbiased audience, maybe he will drop 75% or the walk / run / walk and edit the movie for another 90 minutes. <Br /> <br /> Film students should watch this movie as an example of how dangerous their work is. "Good enough" can be true. Every form of performance, every conversation, digital effect, every filter effect. Of course, every frame of the video shows the danger of struggling for ordinary people. Beginning filmmakers may find themselves tempted from time to time to think that "At least I have achieved some success" or "Just do this thing successfully." This movie will help them understand how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> Critics May benefit from watching this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment "The worst movie ever created" <br /> <br /> Beginning writers can learn from this film how important writing is and may understand the need for rewriting. Beginners can learn the importance of good screenplay and respect at a certain level that how difficult it is to write a script that makes the audience feel emotionally forced through the story Writers and directors who watch movies made from bad cable this week and think "I can do better" can see ideas from this film that it's really hard to produce even mediocre results. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that this film can be used as an educational tool to start. Movie maker Especially those who enter the craft in the current environment of Post-Lucas and Post Spielberg There is a reason for the filmmakers, like these, to praise their talents with special techniques. War of the Worlds clearly shows that everyone can't pull it out. Some people can't come to close it.
