There is one good thing in this movie: Lola Glaudini's ass! Sorry to disclose But it's true Unfortunately she didn't get naked. At least it made this mess resistant. We saw other chick's girls. But she is not near Lola And the Armand Astronauts are very old or anything The man looks shit! "Consequence" is the usual B-movie that you expect. Potential story It's as if they have a good idea. But don't know how to use it The movie shooting was terrible. Ugly! The director is not affected and the result is an incredible thriller with twists and turns. Lola Gaudini is fantastic like a fox in the right and cool way. But not to her. Helping "consequences" from being discarded and not funny jokes
