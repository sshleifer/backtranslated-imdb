Well, what do I say? <br /> <br /> "What we know that Bleep" has achieved almost impossible - leaving behind a masterpiece of genres such as "The Postman", "The Dungeon Master". , "Merlin" and fourth, it will go down in history as the only worst movie I've ever seen And that is, ladies and gentlemen are truly impressive because I have seen a lot of bad movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is a masterpiece of modern movies consisting of two parts interwoven, alternating between the plot. Stupid and inventive about the extremely annoying The photographer was abandoned by her husband and forced to oppose the oppressor to survive and the group of speakers who were talking about quantum physics should prove their pseudo-philosophy. Essentially, if you start a vacation to meditate with people who like Enya and Kenny G, this movie is for you. If you have a sense of humor, people who know how to have fun and great weeds, this movie is for you as well. Otherwise stay away Use my words. <br /> <br /> The first thing that makes me about "What You Know Bleep" is that seems to be resolved and compiled by the same type of people who shoot cheap weddings in The camera is equipped with pink heart effects, computer-generated sparks through the screen and other vitality. Anyone who lets these people close to theatrical performance is a mystery to me. I guess this is something that Kenny G did for you too. This film is full of wonderful GCI that you or I can produce on our own computer via video editing software. over-the-counter But never did it because it was too ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The script is _ob apparentlyly_ written by someone who doesn't have any writing experience, not only the characters and dialogues that are complicated and beyond belief, but "Writers" feel like they have to push all the relevant information or distort information, which is what this movie is about. My subject is not too bad of an idea. For example, the main character spends half the time popping the film, although it is obvious that it is not convincing enough, so there are at least two conversations throughout which refer to drugs to reduce her anxiety, especially in cases where the audience is not Can connect her pain and suffering She used a little white pill whenever she felt worse. Acting ... Well, I've seen better performances in Edwood's movies and not this is not an exaggeration. Heck, the little drama I play When I was 12 years old, it was featured in more inspiring performances. Actually, <br /> <br /> The story was interrupted here and there with random talk or a strange combination of randomness. the main Of scientists who specialize in medical expertise and self-proclaimed mysteriously about quantum Physics should give an explanation "" for the way that men or women create their own reality, just participate in life experiences. In fact, you will see that it is a field of probability of different possibilities and is set in stone when you observe to choose to observe it. What happens when more than one observer observes that they do not say anything? Listen, Enya, meditation, observation and you will be a god and no one gives a curse about stupid things and antiquities such as logical critical thinking. Etc. All the reasons were immediately dismissed because people were stuck in their way and could not achieve. "Paradigm shift" and "down the rabbit hole". Moreover, the Heidelberg uncertainty principle that proved to be a positive evidence of the realities of parallel universes and other things. <br /> <br /> Speaking of rabbit holes These people continue to talk about the rabbit hole. I'm not sure what is related to what they are saying or acting. But one thing I'm sure is that it's related to anal sex. In fact, this movie is _extremely_ against sex. At all times, sex is presented as dirty, ugly and against enlightenment. <br /> <br /> In any case, the talk of the main character, the main character, causes unity and enlightenment by drawing the heart. All over her body and walking around in a daze, even in her eyes more than you started. <br /> <br /> I need my life for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> This is a couple of words. Speak randomly. I remember: <br /> <br /> " Which I think does not really have become more true for me, and that I have actually considered being a little less realistic than not true. "- The head speaks something about the spirit of quantum physics. > <br /> "What will happen to a man who will have erection of it?" It's just one thought, nothing changes outside. He still has sexual emotions. "- There are some people who declare themselves to be the mysterious head of the school of enlightenment. <br /> <br /> [While looking at yourself in the mirror]" I hate you! I hate you! fat! you're ugly! I got you! "- The main character, photographer, fat and ugly
