I watched this thing almost without knowing anything except the short description that I read here. After watching it, I will say that the director shows the contract. But it seems that he is skilled, and I watched other things he did to see if this was his first movie or his second story. Scared, dot com. With this story, <br /> <br /> The story is terrible as well. Someone may fall in love with a woman because she is beautiful but has a child's heart? I gave 3 because there are some pictures that I like quite close to the end. But overall, this movie is quite bad.
