This is one of the worst movies ever !!!!!!!! It's terrible. I laughed through all the movies! The plot is so wonderful; Especially at the end This film transforms from the end of the world to disaster to saving eels! I mean c'mon! And I swear ... I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for eels! And having a scary kissing scene in the middle with two main characters who divorced How to predict! It's terrible that my mother, my sister and I can't finish it, and when we finish it, it's about a year later! The second time we watched it and we finished. At this time, we made comments like MST3K throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Look only if you are a movie basher. Hilarious comments. See also Hold to laugh and I mean a lot of laughs. Still watching mockery The parable that describes this movie: The film is a very shallow field filled with cheese and puppets, socks!
