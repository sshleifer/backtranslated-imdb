Let me use another ball. Or how about bollo * ks is more scary and embarrassing than the sarcastic effort Julia Roberts is a skilled actor, and usually her job is of the highest standard This movie has no direction, even though she is struggling to be proficient. She is usually a perfect professional. But I swear that in her eyes there are signs of confusion and despair. <br /> <br /> One thing that may help, this movement is the idea of ​​the director. Change the movie into a secret documentary about the actor. Unfortunately, the theme has not been explored as to its full potential. Too late, too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones is a Cusack, Cusack and Crystal should be attached to the show. The former star, two talented newcomers, had a different experience - the green was completely distorted, and Balfour used less. Very well done with Julia, which prevented this from becoming the worst movie
