Film director and chain director warns viewers at the SF Frameline Film Festival on Friday night that we are about to see the movie "Experiences". Experiment? Leaving the video camera in the back seat of the car, allowing the tape to roll and fix in the carcass that is pointless. Inside the winding Roadiche, it shows the Manqu√© where it starts and will not have viewers The undoubted violence that opened the film led to more than one patron from the Castro Theater. But my best friend wanted to go home and have this thing about seeing even the worst that has to pass. When it was time for the light to illuminate the audience Applause is not enthusiastic Questions from experts of directors who are satisfied with the product Avoid this film!
