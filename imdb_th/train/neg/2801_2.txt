After the music-Gothic music video, all the fruit, the movie begins with Cassidy, the lead singer who committed suicide. In the perfect world that will be, and the final credit will roll. We are not in that world. The members of the band faded, decided to go to the clown to contact her essence. When I say funny, I mean the real clown. He told them that they were going to die through Cassidy's ghost. (The Spirit has Dora, one of the band mates) We don't care less because all the characters are boring, cheerful, and have terrifying behaviors. And directed by Corbin Timbrook (after The Attendant and the Tower of Blood HAS knew he had made nonsense for life). This movie is a continuous fight. Between the ability of this film and the needs of the audience to be alert The blood is not enough to appease the blood of dogs and nudity that is sufficient to satisfy. In fact, this movie is absolutely nothing to recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Amanda Carraway gets the upper part <br /> <br /> I saw: Starz on Demand
