The name above is used to introduce the movie "Gen" to viewers. Gen is a young doctor (Doga Rutkay) with a sick mother. The movie begins with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job. While she was driving, we realized that she was not near the house because the hospital was in a remote area. As soon as she stepped into the hospital's garden, she saw the patient's body. This is the beginning of a nightmare in the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two policemen come to the hospital to investigate suicide. In fact, they must be in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather. All their communication with the outside world is cut off as well. There is no solution !! In those few days there will be more nasty murders. Now everyone is wondering. <br /> <br /> In my opinion It's really scary. Of course there are positive aspects of this movie. I like the very beginning of the movie. Especially when she drove to the hospital and her first time in the hospital The show is fine. Some people try hard to be mysterious and scary. I think the final shot should be spread through out the movie. What I say is that it is a good twist. But instead of showing it as a parody, we should finally realize that it is coming when we see what happens. The director needs to explain all that I think is not working well. The most dangerous patient in this film should be at least 48 years old, but his body looks young and is suitable for people who live most of the hospital. Finally, I want to say something about the director. I'm sure he will improve This is his first attempt. I just discovered that he was only 21 years old. That made me feel better about him and his future movies. I will not rate this movie * from *****
