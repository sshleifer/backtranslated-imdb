There is no going around - this movie is terrible. I have seen the old movie of Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu. I am familiar with the character and it's a continuous origin. But still a scary matter However, the genius of Peter Sellers continues to shine with the depiction of Nayland Smith, with the resonance of grief, tragedy and the brutal strength that perseveres through the patience. It was the work that I put on the image of Peter Kuching of Van Helsing. But can do in the tenth time of the screen collection of the movie "Dracula", all of Cushing If this film is made in a vein that is more cartoon like BUBBA HO-TEP on the AVENGERS TV program in 1960, this may be something special if you are a Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers completely. But it is an opportunity for everyone
