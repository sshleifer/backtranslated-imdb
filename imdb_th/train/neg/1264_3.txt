This movie has nothing to fear about the previous story "Robot Jox". This is the reason why the most common names are "Robot Wars" and not the alternate name. "Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars" <br /> < br /> "Robot Jox" is a fun movie because It has good evidence of giant robots fighting each other in the near future. This concept was abandoned for this film and it had a completely boring story that was not original or cleverly written. The stigma that tries to be very different from the previous version for this story may be a more fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Same as "Robot Jox". This is the movie B, but also a big difference to it. Very bad Perhaps this is due to the fact that "Robot Jox" originated in the 1980s when the B movie still has charm and class above it, although the movie was released in 1990. Has been said about this film It's a lame thing, badly done, bad looking and not excited enough. It has a ending that makes you think 'What is this? Is that all? '. <br /> <br /> The thing that this movie lacks is the main plot line that is really good. Perhaps a good main villain may be a good idea and other things, such as the true point of the story, certain actions or satisfying main characters. <br /> <br /> What do they think seriously when they Choose an actor For this movie All of them are not a favorite in their roles, and especially Don Michael Paul is annoying as the main character who behaves as if he were a gift from God for women. They not only get actors from the first film. <br /> <br /> For future movies with the idea of ​​having a large-scale puppet in it, this movie lacks action. If they bring the greatest action into the movie at least, this movie is probably more entertaining. But now we have movies that fail to make every impression possible. <br /> <br /> You can watch the episode "Mighty Morphin 'Power Rangers" for more actions and preferences. <Br / > <br /> 3/10
