This movie is not like "Office space" except in the location Hilarious office space I will not recommend this movie to anyone because I didn't laugh once all the time. Korn Bluth's own ridicule was more annoying than Jason Alexander, 15 people in the same room. If you decide to watch this movie for free rental or look at someone else's house so you can leave if necessary.
