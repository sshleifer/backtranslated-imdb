The brain that will not die is a scary movie that has a foul odor from the opening scene. It has all the classic signs of badness: unbelievable storyline, poor performances, low quality sets and lighting. The storyline was like this: when his doctor and his fianc√© were stuck in an accident, she was executed and he carried her head and took her to the lab where he placed her head in the living pan. Virgnina Leath, who plays head in the pan, takes time to wear a pan around his neck and squatting under the table. However, the doctor tries to find her new body and hire two dancers to The man she would have chosen to have her new body. Poor all the way. Poor to be torn apart in the Mystery Science Theater 3000.
