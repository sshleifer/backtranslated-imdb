Me and my sister are now watching that movie. We laughed with the deaf. Can you imagine the cover being nominated for an Academy Award? - First of all, musicians have a mix of 4-5 styles of music ... and the music is not synchronized with the scene and the animated characters ... <br /> <br /> --- Silvester's main drama didn't fit there. He looks like a Mexican Tarzan. <br /> <br /> ---- Russian soldiers are everything. But not the face of Russia :-) ----- OK. Main issues: 1. A plane called Charter painted in black .. <br /> <br /> 2. What is the idea when Rambo jumps from a plane But he was stuck with the rope 3. the best scene was when she died She is very meaningful to him. Has he known her for a long time? He cried for her ... O my samurai. 4. How many arrows do he have? His arrow bag is always filled with arrows. I didn't notice the scene that he had collected them - but I saw the scene where the arrow was in the coordination head of Vietnam - that's very important. 5. How many rocket helicopters can hold ??? (Real) I have seen 4. But Rambos has about 20 spectators. <br /> <br /> 6 main parts of Russia's special army helicopters do in Vietnam ????????? After the war? 7. The first scene when he entered Vietnam's camp ... His first thought was to release the refugees standing on the trees on the open ground. 'Wow, it's a new idea: 1. With a knife, can you cut the steel wire? May be made only in Vietnam? 2. Mortar - used for one hit, running? Oh my God, Americans must learn about real weapons! Do you know how much time it takes to calibrate the mortar? (I think the author has watched many movies from World War II)
