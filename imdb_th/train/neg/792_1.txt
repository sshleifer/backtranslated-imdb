Thank you BBC for this program. I've experienced a little complexity. I hate leaving home, talking to new people, and I have the overwhelming feeling that people hate me. However, after watching one episode of Non Blond 4, my destiny began to change. After Part 2, I started applying for a new job, wearing fashion clothes, and I felt really talented. When the series finished, I took care of the sales department at work, beat many women and won my local karaoke singing contest If you've ever had a crisis of confidence and don't know where to go, travel to Poundland and pick up a DVD of just 99 p.
