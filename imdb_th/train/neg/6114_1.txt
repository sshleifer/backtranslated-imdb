Because that's all she did in this movie, totally naked without a good reason. When Tarzan was bitten by a snake, she immediately removed her clothes when the boa venom contracted. How was Tarzan poisoned? This movie was screwed up. They couldn't get the animal species in this movie, but the Orangutang were hanging out with those chimpanzees? Why did he have to walk away from the movie scene better than caucasin? Why and why did Bo and her father paint the picture if they were to be eaten later? It might be just an excuse to show her breasts and curves again. While she was looking for a way and stupidly pretending around a cow elephant while standing near it, the real African elephant that was not from the circus will crunch the bottom of the smart hunter's mental retardation Who will start Shot in the minute he saw it and I couldn't help but wondering. If the camera is on LSD because it still shows various scenes that are moving slowly without a good reason, it doesn't make sense. Tarzan's boa constrictor squeezes with water. It looks like one of those 12 Ft rubber snakes. You can buy at Spencer Gifts in the area. Tarzan is eccentric, eechless. In this movie, probably from Bo, flashing himself a lot. I'm sorry. But this is a classic movie of Tarzan, black and white with similar stories. But better not to mention the plot with the same scene in it I saw that everyone forgot to mention * (SPOILERS ALERT) * The scene in which he tried to help Jane and her father make him stand near the trough too much, making him look like he was urinating the person below him. He and Jane are tricking around the beach with a monkey that jumps and claps. She is sure that she is dead. Her father is really good. * (The end of spoiler) * There should be a general surgeon's warning in this movie. Seeing too much naked in this movie will make you blind.
