Rather, it is said that the best reviews for the IMDb movie are from people who used to watch a single movie in their entire IMDb career. And yes, you think that this movie is "Parasomnia". That's a good, suspicious thing about IMDb for what became But a good movie as a tricky marketing But it seems to be transparent in this case. <br /> <br /> That doesn't mean that the Parasomnia is terrible, but it can't be stopped for a good or good movie that has the potential to be. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, there is a great baddie in Patrick Kilpatrick, who acts as a scary and evil image. I can see him easily that there are things to do to play a truly memorable baddie with the Hannibal Lecter. There are some beautiful images in the dream sequence. In fact, if the movie decides to explore that terrain more than this may be something. Better The true concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is also great. <br /> <br /> Although I understand that suppressing disbelief is a necessary thing to dip in any good matter. It is a sign of a good story. If you find yourself feeling annoyed at what you see without reason or nonsense, this story will get you lost and that's what happened to me in the picture. This movie Other critics talk about this here and I don't want to go into the spoiler. But I would say that the ending setting is ludicrous and disappointing, especially not to mention the different mental age of the characters that should be experienced. A few years of life, <br /> <br /> All have wonderful ideas here in spiteful hypnosis.
