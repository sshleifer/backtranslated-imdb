There's nothing like watching the battle of giant robots in the wilderness area and Robot Wars deliver. Of course, the show is scary. The little dialogue and the characters are one dimension. But it has a giant robot! His own special technique is quite good for that time. Of course, it's not contrary to the standards of today. But it has a low graphics computer and uses a small size instead, so it is quite good Its shortcomings are easily overlooked due to short films and some humor that makes it fun. I would like to recommend this to the fans of a giant or sci-fi robot that is looking for distraction, hours of distraction.
