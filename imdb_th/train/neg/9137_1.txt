What can I say? This is a great film creation that should have won an Oscar. Should keep a copy in a safe place for the safety of children It should be viewed for all high school students around the world. Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps a writer / director / producer / chef / babysitter / Wal-Mart, the smartest in the world of his film art. <Br /> <br /> How can I start with this? Every millisecond of Ben and Arthur is really amazing! And Mraovich as Arthur, wow. He was very interesting. I was surprised that he didn't go to Mr. Universe. I couldn't have myself during the nude scene. I borrowed this movie for my brother and he called me on the phone how Arthur's nude scenes made him gay. Of course, I fully support it because this film and a lesson that is elaborately created in patience. Why yesterday I burned a church and I wrote that "Let Sam and Arthur" in the ashes. <br /> <br /> The movie is the best thing about this movie. When the Fed-Ex plane climbed into the sky in Vermont's palm trees, I cried! Why I never knew that they had a palm tree in Vermont or people could travel on a Fed-Ex plane before this movie. It opened my eyes to a new realm of possibilities. This film inspired me to enroll in the school, wrote Sam Mraovich, acting, directing, composing, casting, production, Design, production and real estate I just want to say, "Thank you, Mraovich. Thank you for bringing this thing to the world. We can't pay you enough."
