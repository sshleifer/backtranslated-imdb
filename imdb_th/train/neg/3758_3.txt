When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it would be a good Saskatchewan movie. Usually when you have this type of movie, usually there is one sasquatch, but in here there are 7 or 10 people? The performance is good. The plot is ok. I like the scene where Squash kills the first few victims. The camera works very well. I expect it to be a movie full of blood. But it is very small This movie is better than Sasquatch. The channel SCI-FI wants to create a more sasquatch movie. I mean, I like Sasquatch Mountain. Abominibal is very bad. The person I criticize is ok. But the Sasquatch movie is not, but I'm not criticizing Let me go back to follow This movie is good for a rainy Saturday afternoon. But not for other opportunities
