This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Branaugh seems to have a lot of problems remembering his accent that he can't send his line. The story is certainly not worth the name of John Grisham. It is not surprising that it has never been published in book form or published in cinemas. I didn't see everything. I decided that I didn't care who would do it. Then realized that there was no "Investigation" for your interest!
