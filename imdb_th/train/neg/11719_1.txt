In the words of the character Charles, dancing in this movie "Bollocks!" There is no plot, no character development and the most unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Full of things that Not happening in the real world (Since when the British police examined weapons armed with a pistol in the shoulder holster) was full of errors (The Bulgarian train in London?) Is full of boring and inventive conversations and the governance / editing is terrible - shooting with a shaky mobile camera has nothing to add to the movie except the ambiguous feeling of seasickness. Confusion in skipping Unstructured <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipe's character is not sympathetic at all - why do we have to pay attention to what happens to him? Go to the video? Go straight to the trash!
