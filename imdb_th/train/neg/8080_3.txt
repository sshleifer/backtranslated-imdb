I have high hopes for this film because there are Charlton Heston and Jack Palance, but those hopes came to the ground in the first 20 minutes or more. The ridiculous Palance wasn't even Heston's performance or Annabel Schofield's beauty (or Short nude scenes) can help this movie Some space effects are quite good. But some of them look wonderful The plot is ridiculous. Even sci-fi fans should skip this grade. F
