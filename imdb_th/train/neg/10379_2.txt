The movie began in 1840 in Japan, where a man slashed her wife and lover until death and committed suicide. Is a sequence full of blood and blood Then jumped to the present day ... well in 1982, to be precise Ted (Edward Albert) Laura, wife (Susan George) and their annoying baby move Went to Japan to work for her husband They rented a house and - surprised! Surprised - it happens to be a house where murder occurs! The three dead are near like ghosts. (The makeup is terrible) and makes hell a family life. <br /> <br /> Sounds ok - but it's really hopeless. There was an opening and ending of bloodshed and nothing happened during that time. There is an attack from the giant crab, which is just an uproar! They look very fake - I swear that I saw the line drawn - and they muttered !!!!! There is a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes (probably just showing George's body), another about 40 minutes later (but that's what is needed for the plot) and chasing ghosts at Really foolish at the end The fight scene between Albert and Doug McClare must be believed. <br /> <br /> For the performance - Albert is okay because of her husband and McClel. ure is quite good like a family friend, but George - as always - excellent in a lousy movie She gave the elevator needed for this movie. But I can't save. I gave this 2 to her and opened and closed the blood. In addition, this is a very boring movie.
