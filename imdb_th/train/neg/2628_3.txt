Director Sidney J. Furie created a ridiculous masterpiece after a new era in the Hollow Point, which constantly challenged and surprised the audience. <br /> <br /> Sidney J. Furie dares to ask questions. What happened to the traditional traditional fatigue of the 'plot' and 'character' when you removed the crutch from 'Inspiration' and 'Reason' <br /> <br /> The result has made me have to say that my opinion towards him cannot be higher. <br /> <br /> One and a half. br /> <br /> PS There is nothing in this movie that is reasonable, lawyers are forced to differ from others, and organized criminals are full of insanity.
