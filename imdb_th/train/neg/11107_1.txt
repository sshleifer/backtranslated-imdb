This is a terrible movie. There is no story above all else when they cannot explain the blood and blood. (The only good part) ... They throw a few aliens! I hate when the director (Or whatever) exhausted thoughts and then blame the aliens! Watch this movie if you like But do not say that I do not remind you two things: how can Winnie say that "Welcome" when he doesn't have a tongue? Unfortunately, Mr Jones does not have a bigger role. The second thing that catches me, why do we show Vinny Jones's suffering and he cuts it off and makes it into a blue liquid? Why don't I not like to show anything and have nothing to do with the short story Bad story I will not waste my time - hopefully I will see the mirror instead.
