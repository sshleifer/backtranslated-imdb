I think at least it should be beautiful. It's slow, hypocrisy and boring. I almost fell asleep Have some good music But with this song at the end, which is just some men shouting "Yaowwww!" While some people knock randomly on wooden objects Being said that there are some beautiful songs But it is not worth it to watch hte movies rather than going to iTunes (with albums), previewing and choosing good songs. <br /> <br /> Half of this movie is about tea men That is a little exaggeration. But you will see what I mean if you see it That being said: Don't see!
