About the baby: Why does the big brother think he is hungry for a bottle or a meal or a diaper change? He should scream, not stop after several hours without attention. Of course, to take the baby from a safe place when he doesn't want it. <br /> <br /> And why is the road so amazing every time someone wants to drive somewhere? The trees that were uprooted fell on the road. <br /> <br /> I couldn't imagine that the police that blocked the road did not follow immediately after any young people had broken The danger to go there. <br /> <br /> Being said that it's good to have kids watch movies safely for change.
