After leaving the TV show "The Andy Griffith Show", Donnott gave the movie star a heroic effort with a crazy series. But full of humor. Unfortunately, "The Reluctant Astronaut", which was filmed at a cheap price (As with most movies of Knotts) is worse than others They want him to be a new janitor! Some people may say that the weak words take advantage of the fresh fever of Americans in the new age of technology. But the flick is a really dark excuse that makes the child restless. It starts well with the OK setting and the place you miss. But it will become more spiritual and stupid * from ****
