ba ba ba boring ... This is next to the world of battlefields in mischief in science fiction genie francis (Laura's general hospital) plays a small role as a reporter and in itself should tell you That this movie must be bad .... with Ben Kingsley (Award-winning actor, academy) Good actor. You have to wonder what rights they have in deciding to make this scary movie. The song goes up and down very much as if it were a major drama. Even if you pay attention to the impossible story The effect is moderate and looks very old. All actors speak in one voice and do not have the truth about their conversation. I can continue to say that this is a bad movie, at least with Battlefield Earth. It's terrible. It's funny. But this is just b o r i n g. Avoid if you don't want to sleep.
