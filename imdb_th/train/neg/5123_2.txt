It is interesting that 90% of the comments with high votes are "* random user names *" from "United States" (without pride of the state or not) which everyone speaks the same thing more or not. Less with the same syntax style All of this is a film that lacks absolute perfection. I will delve into this suspicious trend. But alas, this is a review of the movie, not my own review. <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I am both a Christian and a real movie. That fan means I have seen many great movies since Good to bad things and can say that actually Facing The Giants is not a good movie It has good intentions But failing to achieve many basic standards (if any) that I associate with the quality of movie filming experience. <br /> <br /> Acting: Terrible, most, most appetizing. Hearing that most of the volunteers didn't surprise me. <br /> <br /> Conversation: Clumsy, wonderful, the script came out as a long version of skiing that you saw on Sunday school or youth. Rave Review robot group function is very happy if not "Words that are not meaningful" but the strenuous truth is that these words are part of the real world. Suppose that the average head coach of the team in the state championship game has more to say than "OH NO!" When things don't go as he wants. <br /> <br /> Plans: mind that Unpredictable There is an opinion that this movie is not a clich√© movie and it is like being drawn directly from the creation of the Underdog Sports Movie for Dummies (including a virtual romantic sub-plan) and just having a Christian theme. Don't lie or brag when I say that I have almost all the important details of the plot and the sub-plan that has been identified as soon as I start working. There are only people who have never seen a good sports movie before in their lives to get the excitement from the story presented here. <br /> <br /> Director / Editor: It was created. Almost like a typical Underdog sport. Movie templates Even so, there were not many stupid people, so at least the confrontation with the giants was so technical. <br /> <br /> Message: Ask Jesus and He will give you all your wishes. Part of me hoping this movie will end with the team's final defeat to emphasize all. "If we lose, we praise you." Partly because in the real world, you will fail at one point or another. For that. But in the world of encountering giants, if you fail, obviously someone is drunk or cheated. Another interesting question is if the Eagles enter other teams with religion. Will they be caught in endlessly dramatic plays and last minute recordings or will the universe explode? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: For the crowd of Christian hard-core parents who lament the wickedness of Hollywood. Facing The Giants will be the best medieval Christian film to stand on. The pedestal is a model that needs to be modernized. Making movies for others With The non-Christian would not lead to repentance. But is insulting I gave one of these two stars for one scene that I didn't take my eyes and one for the basic technical ability at a low price.
