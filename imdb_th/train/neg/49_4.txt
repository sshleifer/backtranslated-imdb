Scary and boring road-themed movies with the intention of being modern and modern, showing in a montage style and strange camera angles resulting in sleepiness only. <br /> <br /> The actors lose their writing at Stupid and pretentious The only worthwhile thing is Lalo Schifrin's great soundtrack. It's really cool and it's a very original and interesting opening sequence. <br /> <br /> Run if you can. Bad comments and comments Comments on this flick deserve altogether. It is really pure garbage. Of course, it has the charm of watching movies that everyone won't leave a glass of beer if it's flammable. But kept on a stormy day that you didn't have to do anymore
