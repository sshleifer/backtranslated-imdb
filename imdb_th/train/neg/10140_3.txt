Shouldn't create this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the budget. <br /> <br /> Please hire a reliable actor and make the right movie. The plot is very thin and unbelievable. It's almost hilarious and that's a shame for action movies .... <br /> <br /> Not worth it. <br /> <br /> They still play the "match" of the plane. Invisible. You've seen it, and it's not worth it to return to work 3 or 4 times. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to retire from filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Movie his Getting worse every time <br /> <br /> Black Dawn and Submerged are bad But this movie is worse
