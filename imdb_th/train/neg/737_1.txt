WOW! <br /> <br /> I just received this movie from my friend who bought it at 1.98 at Walmart and he felt he was caught! It was too boring. Most scenes were filmed on the green screen. The performances were quite temporary, as if they had no Martian CGI scripts. I can't stress how bad this DVD is. <br /> <br /> Example: In one scene, the Martians are tortured by a female prisoner. She changed from a green screen woman to a CGI copy of that woman. The change was clearly noticeable, and when she was killed, you can see that it was a computer image. It looks like something from the game. Back in the 1990s! Cause disaster! You can download two movie trailers from their website and see if God is really scary!
