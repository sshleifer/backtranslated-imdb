I appreciate the patience of Paul Muni, who spent many hours in the make-up room every day to see Zola. Muni is one of the greatest stars in the 1930s, and I wonder how many people are cute today. Classic movies don't know anything. He is a giant in the business for at least a decade. He was able to win an Oscar for this performance, which would make him two consecutive times as he won Louis Pasteur last year. My own opinion is that while he is always doing too much, I still think he is one of the great actors of the "Golden Age". You were pinned to the screen that watched him. <br /> <br /> Unlike the role of Pasteur, I think this story has little impact on what we have seen in the last 60 years: Go out. In order to free the hero, even in 1937, Hollywood was unable to suppress cynicism to the police or the military, which is the point of telling us how those organizations were "corrupt". With power to be challenged and defeated In that regard, this film is a way that is ahead today because we have seen a great deal since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> However, there must be a record of facts supporting this story. It did not diminish Zola's success as a social reformer. Anyhow, get rid of some good evil for him! I hope they will spend more time performing than focusing on one experiment.
