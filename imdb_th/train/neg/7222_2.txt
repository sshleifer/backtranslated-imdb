When learning about Enki Bilal for a while and then having to watch this movie I think this will be a good way for artists as Bilal to publish his art and ideas to a wider audience. I still think this will be a good movie to suggest and I think I will enjoy watching it ... I'm wrong! This movie is a torture story that will look real. This idea has the potential ... but the film is too much to be desired and basically everyone who sees this movie has the impression that he has done better. I will not advise whether you should watch this movie or not. There is a chance if you are reading a page that you have seen or you will see - but prepare well for 102 minutes.
