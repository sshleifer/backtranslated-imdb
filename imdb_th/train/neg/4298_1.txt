Unbelievably puzzled, laid out and finally laughing ("Horse, Oh my god, horse!") Sometimes it's creepy. But it has one of the worst chapters ever written for horror movies, see that in the last 10 minutes everyone "Amazing" do what the plot wants to happen How to solve the problem "How to be polite" The leader is generally unusual by Richard Lynch. Transferring video into a real hacking job cuts half the scene and makes the movie more difficult. 0 out of 4 stars
