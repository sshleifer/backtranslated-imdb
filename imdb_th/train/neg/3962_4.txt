I hope to see many after seeing the amazing debut of Renoir, Whirlpool of Fate. I have read that Nana is his best silent movie so I have high hopes. Sadly, this feels like a step back. <br /> <br /> Catherine Hessing is the main problem of this film. Her performance is superior even though it is a silent movie. Her performance is like what people expect in movies from early adolescence, not in the late 20s. She always has the same face, which reminds me of someone with stomach pain. It is very difficult to believe that any man will fall because of this evil woman. There's nothing charming about you. <br /> <br /> This movie has been drawn quite a long time. The camera's work is not interesting. This story reminds me of the Pabst Pandora's Box. It's interesting to compare the two because there are only 3 years between these movies. Pandora's Box scores every level that Nana has failed. <br /> <br /> Movie This is for the complete Renoir gamer only.
