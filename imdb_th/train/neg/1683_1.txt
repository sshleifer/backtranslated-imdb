Difficult to call The Grudge as a horror movie. The best, it made me jump from a little surprise in a short time. <br /> <br /> If anyone forgot the horrible dimension (failed) and looked at the other side of the movie, he was disappointed again. The performance is ok. But not great The story may be quite interesting at first, while one tries to make things happen. But in the end we understand that there is nothing that can be understood much It seems that sometimes "scary" elements will be added to the script without reason ... <br /> <br /> So ... (yawn) watch this movie if you have nothing more interesting than that. Doing like cutting carrots or looking at the clouds
