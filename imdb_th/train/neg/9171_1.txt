What can I say? I don't care about the review and go to see it myself. Condemning the comment is correct It wasted money when thinking of it as a budget. <br /> <br /> The good thing I went to see Kill Bill after this <br /> <br /> To see a really scary movie > Bottom line - I like "Girl in Gold Boots" better than this shit.
