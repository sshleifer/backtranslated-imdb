Mike Hammer lives in a penthouse with a golf bag attached to the corner next to a large cathode ray TV and a chaotic fireplace. No, he had to knock twenty bottles of non-filtered rye and camels on the sofa or office floor with flies or in the stench of the house in LA town that had the smell of L. That's how Spillane wrote the book. Paperback, of course garbage But how can you make it worse? Let some manufacturers plan to check the emptiness because he thinks that Noir, the crap movie, will be sold at the box office, adding hot tomatoes all over the hills and in general will make the story worse. That's how!
