I actually saw this movie at the cinema. As soon as I sent money to me, she said two words that I had never heard at the theater before or since: "No refunds! As soon as I heard those words, I should wave goodbye to the money and go home. But not stupid. I went to see the movie This movie doesn't make anyone laugh in the cinema. Not even once. did not mean to! Most of us sit there in silence every ten minutes or more. Someone will shout. "This movie is a story!" The audience is enthusiastically applauded, then sitting still in a dull and dull trance for ten minutes.
