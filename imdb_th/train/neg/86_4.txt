As a Southern Baptist missionary, I felt pain that I had to give a lower score than the average for a Christian movie revealed There is not much that I want to discourage filmmakers from taking advantage of. Still, I must say honestly that "Forever love of love" is a low budget, usually a non-mainstream Christian movie. The plot is predictable. Moderate performances (I'm kind) and bad fixes. As a TV movie, it may be slightly above average. But as a documentary, this will make it very desirable Keep trying You must have a movie about true Christians in you. I suggest you turn to G. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration.
