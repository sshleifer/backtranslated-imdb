Do I miss something here? This "adaptation" has everything Brookmyres's first novel has, in addition to stories, laughs, black humor, political intrigue, characters, plot and some feelings. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Godamnawful from the beginning to the end, they made a mockery of the plot. They had a love between Parablane and the police and what Dr Draughter was shown to be Observers and anyone who Annette Crosby should Who seems to have adapted for three hours and then chopped them down to 90 minutes (even though 90 minutes seems to remain forever) please do not do this with other Brookmyres books (especially " Country of the blind.)
