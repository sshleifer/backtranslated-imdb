This movie has an interesting story. But the performance is quite poor and the script is not good I'm very disappointed The moral dilemmas that the main characters must face are interesting things. But due to poor writing and casting, the place that could win was robbed 2 out of 4 people in the theater for about 45 minutes and 2 others laughed when this movie was bad. I stick it to the end But I have to admit that I played blackjack on my mobile phone to be able to play in the past 30 minutes.
