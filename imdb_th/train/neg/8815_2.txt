Yes, I will just tell you about this, so don't read if you want surprises. I received this name Christmas Eve. There is also another Christmas horror movie called Silent Night, Bloody Night, while Silent Night, Bloody Night (not to be confused with Silent Night, Deadly Night) has many potentials and is close to being a good person This person is not very good. It started interesting enough to watch the villains. (If you call him) See the children in the area and write a book about people who are naughty and good. But after awhile, you are looking for some action and this film does not deliver You must have character development. But this thing will go down to the sea and you are not sure why the heck He spent about an hour killing three-quarters, while the crowd looked in fear and the person he killed was not their goal. But they just make him fun This is one of the unsuccessful attempts by the killer to knock Naughty. He then tried to kill others and he tried to break into his house by squeezing into the fireplace. He was immediately stuck and could barely go out. He then entered the basement and tried to kill the man by covering him in his bedroom. It seems that he can't kill people like this, so he grabbed a star from the tree and slashed his neck. What trees have happened even in the bedroom at first? Oh, yes, the killer before this killing will stop at the party and enjoy. That is about it, except the people in the city chasing him with the torch and the unresolved part with his brother and the music he wants to play. what is it about He talks about something that is not really explained. How will it end? You ask well, because I have a spoiler. I'll tell you. He ran down the road in his van and went looking for it. Let's take it. !!!!!!!!!!!!!
