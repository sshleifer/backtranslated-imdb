Please don't waste time. This movie is the worst reverse of Dracula (Van Helsing) by Bram Stoker, Anne Rice's Vampire Lestat (rock music and silly scripture references) and Blade (high tech toys). I like vampires and novels. And there are many good things But not with this bad smell Not even the soundtrack can help. Mostly because the movie turns to use a more sinister classic song than "Kick-ass metal". Some people report I hear a few metal sounds. Most of the violins were tortured. Avoid it like garlic and crosses.
