Memorizing the dirty details of this insidious "movie" is like digging into your chest with a salt-and-salted spoon. Perhaps "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992) is quite predictable have But the pitiful excuse for this film is only one of the most unscrupulous commercial bids. The boy is fighting a spy / terrorist when he is home alone in a suburb of Chicago along with chickenpox? nonsense! Why must create this movie? I am a type of person who believes that even scary movies don't waste time. But learning experience However, this is a real waste of time. Should avoid all costs
