The production of Spanish is unbelievably high and unbelievably high and continuous about ... Okay, let's see how I can get close. The film opens with a woman with one of her cats killed by a young girl. Then she asked the lover to take her to another place. He called for work and needs that he lost her vacation time and she said he would pay for this. What is related to this is to guess that everyone thinks that at the end of this film, because of the dark-colored male photographer Patty Shepard, the beautiful queen of Spanish horror movies seems to take her bikini. out She went out for lunch and then assigned him to the Witches Mountain - for another reason that we never gave up. Before they go, Patti must stop at home and resound "eerie" chanting in the ears of our heroes. Again this will not explain This film continues when the two stop at the hotel, walk to the mountains and eventually know why the mountains are called Witches Mountain. Did you know that there are many aspects for this movie that make it better than bad movies? It has some atmosphere. Actors, some characters are quite good. (Especially the caretakers of the deaf and old women) leaders, at least enough and the pinnacle - although it is not reasonable - well designed (literally) with witches in white bras and long black hair It didn't make any sense and that was the big one for me. I can watch the movie ten more times and still don't know much more than when I first watched it. That was a major problem. The Witches Mountain is a curious movie from a low-priced, European-style horror film that is covered by that decade. If you can take advantage of it more than me, the power is better for you.
