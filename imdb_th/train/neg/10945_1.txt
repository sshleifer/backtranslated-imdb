Words cannot describe how horrible this movie is. Last night I watched a video and I didn't want to believe in what I saw in general. "Snakeeater" was a story of a former soldier (Lorenzo Lamas) and searching for his kidnapped sister who was captured by the Rednecks. Release style The acting, directing, shooting and editing of the film is a pity, along with a song called "Soldier" which must be one of the worst songs of all time! <br /> <br />. "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) from "Welcome Back Carter" is in a movie that plays a laughing person who is laughing. Otherwise, please avoid this clutter at all costs.
