It spelled S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S I'm happy when the main character flashed her chest. It's quite tight Before and after that the movie was quite a blast The show is like an E-list and can be played well in movies. Not to mention it is a very low budget that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie play by the same person. The whole movie seems to be taken with a camcorder instead of a half-way movie. Another reason I like this movie is because Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper are funny. They talk about many stupid things that make me laugh. In addition, if you watch this movie at Blockbuster, everyone likes to hide it behind Lawnmowerman 2. Anyone who thinks this movie should be mentally assessed
