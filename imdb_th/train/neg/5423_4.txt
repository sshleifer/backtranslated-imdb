I've been using IMDb for many years but haven't written a review before. However, this movie disappointed me. (Even with the lowest score while writing 6.4) I can no longer be silent. <br /> <br /> The sound is the story of the New Yorker (Tim Robbins) who is disturbed by the noise pollution he uses. In altering the ego is like a vigilante "The Rectifier" and destroying every car he finds with a car alarm. <br /> <br /> I use the name of the movie to be the wrong name. Although there are other sources of noise, 1-2 times, but the real importance of our protagonist is the car alarm. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms There is no other focus. When the movie tries to tie the example of noise pollution to the warning signal, the car seems to be thrown to make merit with the actions of Robbins' character. <br /> <br /> Yes, we Everyone is annoyed by the sound. No one likes car alarms. Of course, all of us have an inner need to bring a baseball bat to the car, screaming and this film uses that truth and the only truth in selling this movie, I say 'very beautiful' because There is a sexually invented relationship (Including three completely unnecessary sexes) that were obviously thrown down for movie viewers who wanted things to be thrown into. In fact, it was a fascinating story. <br /> <br /> Robbin's character, which came into the movie shortly It seems less that he decides not to endure the noise anymore and more than that, by focusing on the sound he has started to lose consciousness. In the first half of this movie, the story of how he changed from an angry friend who smashed the car into the hero of this little one. The Rectifier However ... the change didn't happen. He just changed his own name. <br /> <br /> I'll go for a while. General annoying social explanations come every time, then add to the pretense of the movie and smug smug, which never leaves the face. Robbins didn't help either. <br /> <br /> Overall I think. That it is very clear that this movie is trying to do something because it pushes your neck down But in my opinion, it failed a lot. Just a comment of a man. Cheers.
