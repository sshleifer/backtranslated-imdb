Model Margaux Hemingway was brutally raped by Kathy's younger sister (Chris Sarandon) (Mariel Hemingway). He was taken to trial. But without any charge at all. Then he raped Kathy! <br /> <br /> The movie was raped and nasty. This film is advertised as an important drama related to rape. What it is not well written and (mostly) the drama does not perform well. It claims to sympathize with the victims of rape. But pushed the image in our face However, frankly speaking, Hemingway's performances were terrible in the sequence that lost the real impact that may occur. Experimental scenes are boring and predictable. And this movie went too far when Mariel was 15 years old, raped (thanks to not being shown) Rape is disgusting. <br /> <br /> The performance doesn't help. For example, Margaux isn't an actor. Of course, she is a beautiful woman. (And is a true model that I believe), but her performance makes her want it, reduce the film. Mariel is ok, but this is one of her first movies Sarandon does what he can do as a rapist. He's not bad. <br /> <br /> I remember hearing this story in 1976. Some women stood up and cheered when Sarandon was killed. I found that It's boring, simple and really sick. 1 Along the way
