... and even now, even though they can live without seeing it In fact, this movie (If anyone thinks of calling it) is really interesting, just for slavery. Bettie Page's fans will definitely not learn anything new (and I don't mean * nothing *) and guys. He will not enjoy the familiar experience, love or cherish the warm fuzzies. <br /> <br /> Don't be interested in the screenplay. Theater performances are less than the community. The lack of direction, lighting, crappy lighting, or the rest of the basement production, the rest is "Hey kids, let's make a movie!". I think it should be thankful to one who at least knew how to use the camera. No, I'm sorry to say that there is nothing that can make mistakes. * Wrong. * * * * * * * * * * <br /> <br /> Young woman Playing Bettie Page is a saffron girl. For the Queen of Curves, there are dark hair and most trademarks are used. But could not bring anything to the role beyond the intention to bind and shut the mouth Obviously this is a good thing for her acting career before and because of the excess suffering. But not for the distressing character, which consists of a number of B & D characters that are intertwined between the scary biography of the scene. And close the credit more than the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled. This is not a worthy companion movie for "The Notorious Bettie Page". This is not a worthy movie. This is an amulet that sells with the charm of one of the greatest pin-ups of the time and does it without studying without style and without the real sense of understanding any aspect of Bettie Page. No Bettie Page fans at Indeed, it was found that it was nothing but disappointment. I guarantee that <br /> <br /> avoid all costs. If free, remember that time is money as well. You may not be worth it. But I bet that it's worth it for you to regret that you wasted time with it. That's it. I'm done. You have been warned.
