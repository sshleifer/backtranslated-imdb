This movie is not good. If you are thinking of watching, there are just the right scenes in the movie and it takes about 5 seconds (Amanda Carraway's nude scene). The rest of this film is scary. I think playing high school seems to be a better performance. The story is not reasonable. This set is quite lame and it's not good to make fun. It's boring and terrible! I watched this on Starz, so I thought that at least would be appropriate. The small explanation sounds like it doesn't matter. The girlfriend committed suicide without reason at the beginning of the movie after you had to watch the horrible music video. The transition between the scenes occurred suddenly and as if someone had taken the clip into the movie without thinking of changing. Just cut from one scene to another, without smooth Like my random switching from talking about the badness of the movie to explain why the story is bad The sound is low. At some point you can hardly hear the sound. It will ring with a scream. Gay horror 'horror' in random spots in movies It is the same sound every time. Now is the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Acting: 0/10 Effect: 1/10 Story: 0/10 Song: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Lame-meter: 1,000,000 / 10
