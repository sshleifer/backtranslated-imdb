METAMORPHOSIS I am traveling through Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and METAMORPHOSIS Is the seventh film in the series METAMORPHOSIS, published in 1990, seems to be a remake of "The Atom Age Vampire", which also focuses on scientists who strive for similar results. METAMORPHSIS is not my current horror movie. <br /> <br /> University researchers are working to decode the human genome to create a serum that will prevent wrinkles. Was pressured by the administration to publish his documents And create some results (Or risk losing money) Scientists decide to use themselves as guinea pigs! At first he thought that he had not received unwanted side effects. Finally he found that the serum changed him in an unexpected way! <br /> <br /> The performance is boasting. And the show made me interested in the movie. The lower score was pandering and the science behind their experiments and discoveries. But only mistakes, it's ridiculous; it's nonsense ?? The best. <br /> <br /> As others say, eventually will become a 30-minute rule that seems to be endless. I will call this, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the living creatures from the Black Lake. Meet the house alone."
