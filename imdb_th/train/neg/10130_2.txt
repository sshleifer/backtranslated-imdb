I own almost all Seagal movies. (Yes, even this low-priced story) and I must say that this may be the worst, not just his movie. But in every movie that has been done The only highlight of this movie and the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is A. It is Seagal and B. Seagal has a sweet action scene, especially in the shop and whenever he accepts. With the whole army Next time, 90 minutes for Seagal, killing people and not having to bother with the story because the story not only works, but the performance makes the fact that F-18 and F-14 changed to F-16s and the fact that That Stealth is as fast as the F-16. Stealth has never been fueled ??? And since when Afghanistan was seen as an enemy from the Air Force standpoint The last time I checked Afghanistan, there was no US Air Force (USA) controlling the sky. In addition, this top secret mission also plays through speakers to all crew members in the room. But the Admiral still whispered to other men as to how Seagal's secret went from the bottom of the truck to the top. Please tell us why they had imprisoned him since when the Air Force pilot was a great commando. (Unless they are Owen Wilson?) And when their drunkenness in Arab countries Moreover, since the Arabs listened to orders from women, such as # 2, the highlight of this movie is Seagal. Certainly killing people in the shop and another 50 people he killed with a knife and a lesbian scene. Short and totally random at nowhere
