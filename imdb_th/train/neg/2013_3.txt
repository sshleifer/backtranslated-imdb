This film has a rough look: the legend of Cinderella's future. But there are songs and sex scenes that are quite tame! This film is not sure what it wants and is very organized. It looks more expensive than most Al Adamson's movies. But not at the same budget level that viewers expect from sci-fi movies The actors are quite bad and unlike most of Adamson's movies, there are no former actors or actors. Some songs are ok. But it's easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for many years.
