Great performance by Alix Elias highlighting the pile of mistakes, mistakes and confusion. I have watched this movie 12 times and each time I found that I was less happy. Why did Munchies have a strong desire? Was that ever explained? They are a reflection of our barbarism. If so, why not make it clear? Why not just look at the subtlety that caused the disaster in this film and make the connection clear? Another part of this movie that bothered me is not the end - a motorcycle jacket that a small monster wore on the cover seems to suggest tourists 'clever roads'. All of this, I'm ready to meet with the Muppets. What I get is Munchies (1987) What helps? Adhered to the Gremlins series. If you are a small, clever and definitive reptile puppet fan - it will give you the treatment you deserve
