This trip was a scam that never came close to the intelligence and madness of the great adventures they had filmed in their first film. This sector tries to divert attention to capture new blood from jokes, but it must be wrong to turn and travel that is interesting or funny, nowhere. show They do rock concerts (And many people look at "Free TV" - Since then, when will it happen?) The script writers can do more creative things. See how the random elements of all the first films link together in an orderly manner by converging at the scientific presentation. Not in this movie, which ends with the Bill & Ted franchise. The joke ends. <br /> <br /> Grim Reaper is thrown into the mix for whatever reason. This medication, like all plans, is poorly done and lacks spark for the audience or audience participation. Has the highest impression from ZZ, which has no reason at all With smoke lights, sound mirrors But nothing really creative or funny. <br /> <br /> skip this mistake
