While I disagree with one critic who explains that Charlie Chase is a disgusting person in this movie, he certainly is. It's a shame because I suspect that other investigators have to see just a few. Charlie Chase and guessing that the man is not funny. Movies like MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and GOOFY. It's a very good Chase movie so he's really funny with good material. Unfortunately, in this film, he has absolutely nothing, even though the good combination of Oliver Hardy is often foil, doesn't help anything because of the basic evidence. (Boys want to marry women But the girl's father thought that the boy was fussing) and the porch was very poor It's a shame because I want to love this movie a lot, but I can't. <br /> <br /> However, for those who have watched Charley since the mid-1920s, you will be very surprised. As a sports chase, there are no glasses or mustaches - and look very little as you would expect.
