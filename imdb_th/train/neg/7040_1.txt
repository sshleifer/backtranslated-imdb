Just bought two VHSs in this movie. Am I losing money! Hey I dig Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Gilligan Island" Louis, but hello! This third production rate is a new form of dozens of biker movies. A group of enthusiastic cyclists are riding in a peaceful city, conquering everyone and everything. From then, brave heroes are defeated by humans. Adam West looks part of the hero. But he doesn't have his coat and batman outfit Sorry, not the same Tina L. looked nervous and scared of all the performances. But at least we know what happened to "Jing" when she was rescued from the island ... The biker was a Motley group and knew that they had done it again or at least shouldn't have a Hell Riders. Is a hell to watch!
