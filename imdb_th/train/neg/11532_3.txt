I rented this movie last night because without my girlfriend or myself, I never saw it, even though we had heard from friends together that "It's great." <br /> <br /> Now I'm quite conservative in my view, but I know it's going to be a liberal that defines it. I think before the film begins, Michael Douglas will play very popular among people who love and sympathize and will have a conservative opponent as his enemy. But I think that is where the political statement begins and ends. <br /> <br /> Agree. The plot is stable: the single president falls in love with a twitch. Ok, this thing has the potential that I think will entertain because the plot is unique. But then the movie became an infomercial of liberalism. This film is about gun control and environmental issues rather than the relationship between President and Sydney (Annette Bening). <br /> <br /> There are many ridiculous places. In this movie: 1) The Sydney character plays this role. The counselor persuaded six members of the parliament to be "close". Will she be better? She is constantly disorganized and looks scared of everything almost "near" I am a salesman and you can't "close" selling a glass of water to a man who is thirsty for thirst. <br /> <br /> 2) Secondly, there is something more ironic than Richard Dreyfuss, who plays a fanatic, right? This is the most liberal man in Hollywood and she is playing right wing ideals. Let me take a break. I like the way he uses his conservative character and makes him the most terrifying person he can. <br /> <br /> 3) The last words are ridiculous. Line about "I am a proud card that holds ACLU members" is a joke. For the first time, no president would accept anything like that as an enthusiastic member of a special group. Second, why use something like that? You strangely separate the movies that the audience is watching more than half or more conservative. <br /> <br /> I think the story is great and unique. I think Michael Douglas is a good choice as president. But the movie changed from being a "movie" to a left-wing political statement, which causes the film to fail. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see the great plot destroyed by Hsu. Hollywood viewers
