When I saw an example for this thing on TV, I thought "Okay, it's a good werewolf movie." But it's not. It's not scary! The show is good. The plot is terrible. Military bidding is just a silly story. I think SCI-FI can do better than this shit. This film makes it seem that Arron becomes a werewolf. Instead, he turns to mind and bites some doctors. If you've read my other reviews about other movies, there are all positive things. But this isn't just because the story is terrible. One of the top 10 I'm sure you all expect werewolves to flick. But I bet you don't expect this, other than Loch Nes, better than this movie. Heck, every movie that is in sci-fi is better than this movie
