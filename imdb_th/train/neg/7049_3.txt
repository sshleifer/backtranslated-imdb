The only worse thing than surfers without waves is a movie about surfers without waves. For viewers who enjoy surfing, this movie will be a big disappointment due to the number of minutes of video playing, the struggles that will go through. <br /> <br /> This story is part of the life of a person. Play by the beach Perfect wave But for any wave, JC (Sean Pertwee) is a very old and committed surfer with his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones), while he is about to find increased happiness with the woman he Love the three surfers who turned and persuaded him to go to the beach to look for a monster wave at Bone Yard. The problem was that there was no wave until the end of the story. <br /> <br /> Most performances are normal. Sean Pertwee has a little funny time. But most of his performances are common. Ivan McGregor is a person who likes to take drugs, especially the most interesting and strange things in the group. Probably the most enjoyable performance by Peter Gunn as Terry, which transforms his body shape into a continuous joke. Catherine Zeta Jones sexy as usual But her character doesn't have enough meat to show her ability to perform. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to comment. I rate it 3/10. It's a real beach idler.
