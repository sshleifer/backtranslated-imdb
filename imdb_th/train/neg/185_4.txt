Five or the really good westerns that Mann does is like a set in Hollywood. Even John Ford never made a lot of income with many qualities. All that is curious about them is the imbalance. My Darling Clementine is worth about two and a half of them. Or at least two <br /> <br /> Their true hero, apart from Mann and Stewart, is Chase, chasing responsibility for the great Red River. Chase wrote the country far from the bend of the river and may have some other people. But nobody has done it like My Darling Clementine, but there are very few movies that are Western or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Mann's five films have a large space or six stories to watch, Bend, Far, Man of the West, Furies, Winchester 73 and yep, six, Naked Spur. Each one has a beautiful scene after a beautiful scene with a gaze that is quite missing. But the Red River is still the greatest west ever So perfection is not everything. <br /> <br /> But The Far Country has a big loophole. It was tepid and lively when Stewart and Mc Entire were locking him. The rest is a beautiful sidewalk, except for Mann's camera. Mann's camera is a man's course in movies. It is as good as anyone who has been behind the motion picture. It is almost never wrong that never ever. <br /> <br /> Far countries have a fantastic time. And as usual, it came from Stewart. There was no one in the history of the theater that had been physically punished with the authority of that man. He was amazing: looking at him in Bend, Far, Winchester and Man from Laramie: In Bend was beaten and hung with a thread of confidence and boiling. Being shot out of the raft with such violence, it seems convincing that you wince and, of course, when he was dragged through the fire in humans, you find that you are looking for burns. When he was beaten before the hotel room, as well as anyone who had done it <br /> <br /> But that's Mann's land: look at Gary Cooper fighting the Jack Lord in Man of the West is painful like any fighting scene The ever recorded Cooper, while not as convincing as Stewart, however, he is equal in his tired look at the end of the fight. In short, no one, but no one, but no one has ever shown that humans are in a mania like Mann. <br /> <br /> Being a great director. <br /> <br /> See. Every western he had done They are his true memorials, even though they are scetchy. But what, when he roared with their wonderful scenes, they were also good, including Ford. And all six of his western people as a band are the best things that everyone can do in time. <br /> <br /> Thank you Anthony
