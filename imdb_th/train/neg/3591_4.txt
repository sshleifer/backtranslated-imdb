First of all, let me say that I am a good believer in what Fanpro has. I see it as a way to continue to perform well after being canceled. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are examples of appropriate efforts. So I have a weakness for the fanpro thing, which means I will overlook the things I tend to do badly. <br /> <br /> So go to ST: HF. First off, keep things good. Enthusiasm is an important part of reliable performances and most of the crew of all ships seem to have a good time with their roles. Next, the effect is not bad for trying to do at home without anything that will truly shock you. The story is not too bad. Nothing is innovative. But there is enough stability and at least there is an arc of the story. <br /> <br /> But there are many mistakes. <br /> <br /> First of all, though they are quite clear. In order to cut Star Trek videos, backdrop, music and effects, I do not see the reason why they performed cutting other Sci-Fi music scores. Everything from aliens to starship vehicles will be Head of the orchestra band at some point Similarly, most images come from other movies. CGI will act differently. For example, the gray warship, although it is clear that Star Destroyers from Star Wars and the station is quite clear, Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga from Starship Troopers. Sound effects from various Star Wars movies appear. Up in space combat between fighters as well as animations above the video. In one scene, in the first season or the second season, I think you still see two TIE fighters flying through during the fight, which barely suppresses your beloved. <br /> <br /> The performance is broken. Differ according to the reason Painful to see Everyone is well developed when the season progresses. But expect to make the screen very much, especially at the beginning of the season They also selected interesting performances as well. Suppose the food imitator on this list seems to be permanently set to "cake" and let it be like that. <br /> <br /> The makeup effects are generally effective. But they should be the club mercilessly to die. The people who decide to use the Ferengi and Cardassian masks are cheap for other things besides using the background or images "through" them beyond being unrealistic. Every time I see one of these things (In addition to trying not to laugh too much) I expect the unfortunate soul to wear it to pull out the gun and declare that "This is horrible!" In one scene, "Cardassian" really speaks while wearing one of them. Lips do not move, not only But the mask does not have an opening that should be Some people need to slap heavily for that. They can't use a craft knife for the benefit of goodness! There is also a good makeup job. But unintentionally funny, like Herman Munster, has the same style Instead of using the script as well as the continuation of the DS9, with ships heading out of the DS12 in various missions, the new enemy "The Gray" is not very scary and the plot of the story is related to them. Is the work of the Borg thread effectively, such as Starfleet. Meet Gray, the Gray has tremendous power, Starfleet barely escapes their lives, then through technology they start to find ways to fight the enemy. etc. The bones of the fight is a dialogue. Star Trek writers have the ability to write "insert technobabble here" for a long time in the script. It usually means the expression of the latest plan to fight with enemies using "Quantum term discriminators" or "isolytic fees", etc. In other words, nonsense that tells you that they are in the case and resolution.> <br /> The words are really gibberish. I have no problem with this, but at ST: HF is a mess that is where they combine opinions in the real world with this concept. <br /> <br /> Tactical advice such as "We need to regroup." Sounds good, but not when talking by three characters standing in the group. Similarly, when asked what the situation is, tactical officers will hear the answer. "We count three battles." Do they really want to count them? C'mon! I expect the questioner to ask him "Are you sure?" Or "Can you check again?" But my favorite comments all the time are: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we create two-way communication?" > <br /> Comms staff: "No, we can only send and receive ..." <br /> <br /> Okay, well !!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> When it is said, the performance will improve with the 1st and 2nd seasons, rather poor. 3 shows show improvement, but 4 and 5 are clearly better starting points for the season. 6. Until now, it seems reasonable. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with choosing media for the Quicktime show. Quite frankly, and soon they moved to divx / avi format. Even better Some of us like to show our downloaded items and watch them on the right size screen and not peer at the small QT window on the computer screen. Quicktime not only makes it difficult But the 320x180 resolution displayed is not resized In fact, it makes the list look as though they are a copy of the tenth version of the VHS tape. The least they can do is include a high resolution download option. <br /> <br /> However, Show there is a contract and I start to like some characters But that is the episode 40 episode, so I'm not sure if this thing speaks a lot about character development. <br /> <br /> But what you can say is free .... <br /> < br /> PS: Based on 28 votes, 19 people rated this item as 9 or 10.
