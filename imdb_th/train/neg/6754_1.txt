The only reason I am distracted to comment on this movie is to save your life for 97 minutes and maybe your money. <br /> <br /> I bought it before. The rent is 3.00 pounds. It looks interesting. So I took the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Within a few minutes after turning on the device I knew I had made a mistake. All actors should be kept until the winter and throw on the nearest log where they will meet them more. <br /> <br /> For Devin Hamilton (writer and director) He should be a shame that he should do before he created this garbage. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you see it in a runaway shop. <br /> <br /> 1/10
