Has anyone edited this movie? Or is it just the launch of a DVD with a big gap of thirty seconds between scenes? It was ok even though I slept for the first time. Then I fell asleep in the second and the third time. The real plot is not the worst thing I've ever seen. But it's close The worst show I have ever seen ... but it's close to production .... well, I can honestly say that it's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life! Don't try to have bad intentions, but Unhinged may use more production. <br /> <br /> Please don't think I'm a horrible horror movie. I just felt that I was laughing in the movie more than I felt myself laughing with. That horrible moment didn't do badly. But can do better even with a shoestring budget. <br /> <br /> The characters seem to develop slowly or neglect each other. <br /> <br /> I would like to avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
