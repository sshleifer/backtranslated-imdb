Final Justice has the great Joe Don Baker running around Texas, shooting people who shoot people. Then he went out to Malta where he shot more people. He was imprisoned many times to shoot people. Then he collided with a villain who dressed like a monk. The boat was chased and Joe Don abandoned the prison again. Finally, Joe Don, with the help of Elaine from "Seinfeld", killed the bad guy, blasting one or two boats, and some were shot in flames. All this and the catchy song like Mitchell!
