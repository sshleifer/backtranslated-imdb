"Scout Tiger I Know" It will only be shown in big cities for sure. It is one of those movies SO artsy that there is no reason except the director! I hate those! And all those who try to find alternatives / art try desperately to find "Metaphors" in what is a distinct horseshit. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, no story, no morals, no events. Or even touching For me, it's a scene that is thrown together, which doesn't involve anything, and all for "shows" to show that "art" and "pictures" that they can do. It is another attempt on the teen angst. But can't miss every level that is humanly possible Then the credit will spin! I'm looking forward to making sense! I'm waiting for the "good part". I own about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which may be called "home art". This will not be among them. You will be very angry at yourself, paying to watch this movie much less than you have ever bought on DVD.
