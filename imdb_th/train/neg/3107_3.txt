Woody Allen created "September" to prove that even the genius would miss. This is Mel September's "September". Stupid, silly, boring and bizarre. I have to admit that I didn't watch it until the end. The ranking flicked among the infamous few people (such as "The Money Pit", "Out to Sea", "Spitfire Grill"), which made me sleep or forced me to reach the "Back" button and I say this sadly. As a dedicated Mel Brooks fan, he should show comedy and social opinion alone. The same friend who makes "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" can throw this dog out like this. To avoid all costs
