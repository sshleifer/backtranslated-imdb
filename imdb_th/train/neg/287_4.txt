As an Altman fan, I have been searching for this movie for many years, thinking that with a great character, it must be bright at least. <br /> <br /> Big mistake <br /> <br /> This is one of Altman's big missions that are thrown together haphazardly and unexpectedly. (Or give feelings) in the hope that it will not be gathered in the editing room. <br /> <br /> When Maltin points out, this turkey is only outstanding for acting. Alfre Woodard's first time that featured animals around her But other than that, avoid all costs. (Which is quite easy to do - it has never been released in the video - for my knowledge - and the presence of Halley Comet's frequency cable)
