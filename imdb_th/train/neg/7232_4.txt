I thoroughly enjoyed Bilal's graphic novel when it came out and was surprised when I saw an example for this film and, moreover, when I found Bilal self-directed However, this movie is important. The picture is nowhere near the surface that is filled with the richness of original art and the story has been told badly. Bilal seems to choose to focus on the exotic aspects of the graphic novel, and he does not do a good job as well. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of the original graphic novel. The relationship that hates friendship between Nikopol and Horus They both left the time and the right place. Most importantly, they are not funny and cute. Here, Nikopol has no visible personality. In any way, and Horus is a proverb that wants to be placed. Although this movie is in French, Horus doesn't have to be! <br /> <br /> We've seen movies that we like. But do not advise anyone for any reason I will not recommend Immortel to anyone except it may warn you not to access your abilities and resources. Bilal is the main storyteller. But apparently not the boss of all media
