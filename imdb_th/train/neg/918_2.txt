When George C. Scott plays the role of "Patton". You see him directing a tank with a fist pumping into a German dive bomber with a pistol and spraying vulgarity to bosses and subordinates as well. Most of the actions we received from Gregory Peck as "MacArthur", a number from the war that was more successful, debatably was when he knocked the mapboards with his finger and made his eyebrows famous. <br /> <br /> Comparing Peck's performance with Scott may not be fair, but the "MacArthur" truth that was created by the same manufacturer and graded by the same composer is similar. About the fact that both films released along with generals. Obviously, I, the filmmaker, want to mimic the movie that won the Oscar a few years ago. But while Pec looks more than he had ever done, he dropped out, mostly with a feeling of less drama than Wikipedia. The advice of MacArthur's career <br /> <br /> "To this day Those who think he is a dangerous population and others who say that he is one of the greatest men who have ever lived It is a complex after the general dishwashing about people who bring America's army most of the time. But what we get here is not the MacArthur perspective presented here, not angry or inspiring in his life. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph Sargent, who had been Help the famous turkey "Jaws The Revenge" to color according to numbers. Jobs that have a gentle fighting cost and clear use (For example, when China attacked the US forces in Korea) while the script of Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins truncated MacArthur, who had a good temper. Drowned in his public image <br /> <br /> Here you see him stepping out of the landing craft to return to the Philippines. You see, he spoke to Congress in his speech "Old Soldiers Never Die" for a long time, as he sat in the theater in Toyko, waiting for the North Korean to cross the 38th parallel so that we could reach the story in While the picture of the movie details of Japan increased from the ashes under the rules of the Buddha. The actor joined Peck Marge Deyes as his dedicated wife. ("You are my best soldier") and Nicholas Coaster as a loyal loyal servant, scorched eyes in the eyes of colleagues. <br /> Although he argued with others, Peck Did not send his voice and most would win his argument by thundering When Admiral Nimitz proposed to delay the occupation of the Philippines, which was a personal pride, including MacArthur's MacArthur tactical concerns, came back with the comment: "Now, when I Listen to his plan. "There is no doubt that the real Nimitz will have something to say about that. But the characters in this movie bowed and accepted the insult of President Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> The only person in the movie that MacArthur disagrees with is Harry S Truman, which Ed Flanders works. Well, even with an artificial nose that makes him look like the Toucan Sam, Truman's MacArthur burn is probably the highest point. But here it happens in a quiet conversation where Peck plays MacArthur no less than the martyr martyr. <br /> <br /> I have never been sold by Peck stands at the pantheon on the top of the star screen; He has an excellent presence. But lacking complexity even in many roles that he knows best But it is not fair to compare him so much, as he has received a little help in determining MacArthur for something else. Except for the two scenes, one scene in which he broke with the surrender of the Philippines ("He slammed the old glory and ran the sheets!") And other scenes in which he had a small sub-scene while waiting for Incheon's attack. He's at the White House, Peck, playing here, really, not a complex character that inspired Zebia, the famous "American Caesar". The real MacArthur may be worthy of this kind of comparison. What you get from here is worth less than Shakespeare than Shakespeare.
