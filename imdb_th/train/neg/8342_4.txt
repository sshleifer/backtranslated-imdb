Salvage: 4 out of 10 from Groundhog Day. Meet the Christian Coalition horror movie. Okay. Maybe it's not that bad. But it is close. <br /> <br /> Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) is stalked and probably killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry, which is quite dangerous and cruel). Did you wake up and it was all a dream? (Q song) <br /> <br /> The basic problem of this film is the plot of fifteen minutes. (Can do quite well the first time) over and over again And because Claire wakes up every time and every scene is a dream or reality, the choice I just stop taking care of what happened to Claire and start to wonder if the end of the twist at the end will draw things This together (Which honestly will make more sense) but there is one of those that is too clear by the half surprise ending (Think of the village or below) Yup. The movie collapses faster than the director of Donnie Darko. Cut all the great ending in the horror movie The Sixth Sense, the original Invasion of the Snatchers, Happy Birthday to Me works because the audience can't. Expecting to have a description on the left (Heck, even a canoe that ends with Friday the 13th, is worth it to shake) <br /> <br /> Conversely, the screaming ending with Every scene changes Another nagging error is a single piano soundtrack. (Although the music is good) Good time (Claire cooks, Claire's mother's subplot), the way Claire says the killer around <br /> <br /> There is also a secondary acting role. (Especially Claire's mother, played by Maureen Olander, who resembles Mary Kay's Zombie) shows that> both intelligent and half-wise, not enough to salvage the interest of You just have to see how they can solve this problem. The problem is that they can't really do it.
