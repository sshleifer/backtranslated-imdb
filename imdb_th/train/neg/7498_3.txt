Spike Lee has fallen since his first success, and this mess doesn't help anything. I watched the clock, often hoping that the movie would end or that point. Lee's first film with white actors is a big disappointment. <br /> What is the point? Italians swear and like having funky sex. But not with the wife? If I want to see Scorsese, I will go to see Scorsese movie. The incredibly weak Godfather character adds to the image only. <br /> <br /> I admire Lee's movies. This movie is a waste of time.
