Watching this movie made me think continuously. Why are they causing problems from broken brakes? There are millions of options to slow the car! In the movie Speed, the author misses the good reason why the car can't stop ... <br /> <br /> There is something good to say about this movie. Every normal boredom of their appearance, the actors are not very good, the story that is leaking is the grill, etc. that makes this movie a waste of time and money.
