And it didn't help the case of rohmer. A few years later, Syberberg came along and worked on a large piece of the same story. (With a little help from Wagner) <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie can't be 'Don't be insulted when it comes out without a cyberberg movie to compare, which may be taken in a smaller sound stage too Less resources I do not remember whether or not there is a horse in the cyberberg movie. All I know is that the German version is pure magic, while this seems to be the college production recorded in movies for archival purposes. <br /> <br /> Music ... la musique ... not credited here in IMDb ... but there are people according to 'broadcast from the 12-14 century "or something ... well it is not a great help in this movie It came out to be unlikely. Believe and magic, comme le frommage mon Cher !!! <br /> <br /> Rohmer is one of the French people who like his top men. In general, it's not as interesting and that doesn't help much. syberberg is cute and can be viewed on German TV today Selling some special bikes that he invented .. <br /> <br /> I'm a shiver who thinks that watching the syberberg in the video is like I remember the last time I watched a movie in a movie theater. Terrible that the experience took up to 5 hours to imitate. But even then, it has to go through what this generation has to fear me. <br /> <br /> Points for seriousness for the chutzpah, but ... This movie only requires a single coup. It doesn't look like the original in the Middle Ages, but it looks like CHEAPO! BON MARCHE !! Oh and yes, it just ended unintentionally with Parsifal. Going to the church and showing this wonderful love is inserted ... blah!
