Usually when a movie receives one vote, it may be because some people don't like and feel annoyed that there is no lower rank, so decided to drag it down as much as possible instead of just a low score. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0/10 movie. It doesn't do anything right and has no chance because it doesn't try to do anything. There is a story of an exotic D&D plot that is not together and lacking in all forms of performance. It is clear that no one involved in this project has made serious efforts because even the hard work of those who are not completely patented will increase. A truly scary movie
