What you need to know about this movie occurs after the opening scene in which a man fell into the lake and ate. Then they started rolling the credit. Title: You saw "Slug!" In large letters, followed shortly after by "Movies". Whew! I was worried I had intended to adjust to "Slugs: The Musical" or "Slugs: The Game Show". However, from there, the movie deteriorated at the festival. You saw a man cut his hand because he had a slug in his gardening glove. Two people were attacked by bullets while having sex and a woman fell on his back in an underground passage It's a rather stupid movie in the category. "So bad." It was shot in a small film until you were shocked to learn that it was created in 1988 (I guess it was 1974). Stay here because most people here do not give love to this type of movie. But if you want a movie that is trying to make you scary But in the end, laughing. This is one of your best choices.
