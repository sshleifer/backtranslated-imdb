When the movie "The Dukes of Hazzard" came in at more than $ 75 million, it caused an incredible sadness about our social condition. We may be too stupid to be away from the trash like this, or maybe I don't know that trash that doesn't have such an effort will attract a lot of people. A good movie because if leaving garbage, people will see it anyway because there's nothing on the screen. This is that I walked out even though I received a free movie ticket. The conversation couldn't be silly. Acrobatics may not exceed the possibility and evil Perhaps this is the picture "Bigger than that, big" attracted attention from Texas. But it doesn't attract me or others in the theater. There is no "big" name in the flick of this career, except Bert Reynolds, who tells you what you want to hear Jessica Simpson - Don't make me laugh. <br /> <br /> I won't even recommend this movie for a video, even if you're desperate. This is all about deceiving the public in order to have enough money after opening on the same day or doing better. It costs through marketing. They do even if they are warned in advance. Very foolishness
