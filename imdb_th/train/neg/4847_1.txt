As usual, I am a fanatic of movies that I haven't watched when receiving an Oscar. I am looking forward to seeing this movie really because it seems to be my alley. I can't give my life to understand why this movie is so popular, no matter !! People winding around Iraq One day they were here, exploding bombs. Tomorrow they are driving along the countryside at least and start shooting sniper. Don't wait here. They come back in Baghdad. There is no strong story. The three main characters have an appearance that is beyond reason until just a caricature. By which I mean we have a sweet child who is afraid of death We have a strong military that can be deployed and want to return to safety. And then we have a daredevil cowboy who doesn't follow the rules But there is a weakness for the little Iraqi boy who is trying to sell military DVDs What do you think will happen ??? Do you think that the cowboy soldiers who do not follow the rules will go to get a sweet child injured by his betrayal? Why? Yes! Do you think that the Iraqi boy, a cowboy soldier, has weaknesses, is killed and makes him crazy? Why? Yes! There is no story here. The script is young and predictable! The camera vibrates so much to see it as "art" and for all of you who think this is a great war image. Rent "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Platoon". Don't waste time or money on movies. This boring!
