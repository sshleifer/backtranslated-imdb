It's just Robert De Niro's movie that I really hate. It's a stupid movie that has a terrifying performance. (Of course, not De Niro) For me, Brian De Palma had to make his mafia movie like Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I still love De Palma's mission: Impossible (1996) De Niro works with Palma twice, like Greetings and The Wedding Party I think the wedding is ok as well. (I didn't see the greeting) <br /> <br /> The screenplay is not good and it's not really fun. There is no scene where I can smile even once. The film lost the opportunity to be a bit funny in the "Be Black baby" scene and I didn't like the scene in which the male genitals appeared. So it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Worst I hate that
