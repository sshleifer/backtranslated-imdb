My friend borrowed this video for me and I was quite excited to see it. But after ten minutes of James Hetfield's slow treble and Lars bumped into his drums, what seemed like a slow motion, I began to think Do I watch this? That question will pass your mind in 5? 10 minutes after you press Play. I give the tape back on the same day as you suspect. Don't buy or watch. <br /> <br /> Just my opinion! <br /> <br />
