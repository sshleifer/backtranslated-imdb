Bert Kennedy was a very good director. But you never knew this This film looks not only cheap, but most of the fighting scenes are raised from the "The Last Command", which is superior from 1955 and the pictures taken 32 years ago. Look more contemporary than everything in the picture. A few action scenes that were actually filmed for this movie were confusing, confusing, and incompetent, only viewed as the remaining images. This has the look and feel of a bad student movie. (And the budget doesn't seem to increase at all) it moves like molasses, most performances are over-the-top ham or comatose at the top - although Raul Julia is better than other actors Big, historical inaccuracies Moreover, it is a way too long. If you are going to make a boring movie, try to do it in an hour or so and finish it. Do not stretch for more than three hours. If you want to see a good movie about Alamo, check out the 1960 version of John Wayne or even the 1955 movie that this movie steals action scenes. It is hard to believe that it requires six manufacturers to create a movie with this punch across it.
