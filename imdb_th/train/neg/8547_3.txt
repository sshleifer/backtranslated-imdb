This is a fairly creepy movie. I found that music is effective for this. Photos taken by Mario from the village were also horrified. Anyway, I have three problems with this movie. One is that the light is very dark, so sometimes it's hard to say what happened. But this may just be my copy The second is that the start is not very well explained and I'm not sure what has happened. The third problem is that I do not understand the ending. But apparently some people do Of course, there are the usual problems of people who do stupid things. Concluded and see But not close to being a favorite
