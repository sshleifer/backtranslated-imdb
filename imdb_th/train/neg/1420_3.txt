[I saw this movie when the public television station, so I didn't know whether it was in the video or not] <br /> <br /> This is one of the "Baby Burlesks" (sic) that Shirley Temple did in the early 1930s It's hard to believe that everyone will let their daughters live in a lively little movie that today might consider this aspect of "kiddie porn". <br /> <br /> The Shirley Temple star in This movie is 5 years old. They are all in the fabric. And in a car that serves milk instead of alcohol. "Cash" is in the shape of a lollipop. <br /> <br /> Shirley plays "femme fatale" up to the bar and talks to the soldiers at Commenting on her (!), But Shirley doesn't want their lollipops / cash because her purse is full of other "men". <br /> <br /> While the black boy Small, guided dance on a nearby table (!) <Br /> <br /> Strange movie .. A lively conversation on the role as an adult in the living room. Who thought of this in some way?
