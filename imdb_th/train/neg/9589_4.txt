This movie is terrible if you pay attention. It is the perfect movie if you just watch colorful images, dance across the screen - each picture has an unclear connection. I rented this movie because I am a fan of David Bowie and I like music. In the end, Bowie was in the movie for ten minutes and the song and dance sequence were sparse. The moral of the story is really confusing. I can't tell whether it's about racial issues in London in 1950 or not. In the first half of this movie, I laughed at how wonderful it was. But I like the message that "Not all sold out" when black people begin to be murdered. I think my tape is dirty. Maybe I rent two movies that are half different or Nope has a "Keep Britain White" song and dance sequence. I'm sorry, but WWII isn't something you can write about At least there is no music that can be described as a "camp" because I have many times in this review. Overall, I think this movie is a lot better if it's done by yourself and makes the actor better (and put David Bowie in there for goddammit anymore!)
