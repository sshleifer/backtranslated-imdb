I'm not a big fan of Rajnikant at first, but Baba was very disappointed. During the scary story, the action and music are just moderate. The story became very sermon. Instead of running to work like NTR or MGR, Rajni seems to be working in the next big gurus of Tamil Nadu. My wife told me that since this movie came out, Rajni vowed to make the movie anymore. <br /> <br /> At first, we were lucky to buy Babu (an old man from Sivajiganeshan) online accidentally when trying to buy. This is .... that is a great movie created to buy this look ... except it makes Baba look worse when comparing <br /> <br /> Brian
