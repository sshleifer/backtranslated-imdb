Twilight Zone has achieved some myths about this story as well as Star Trek. That is because there are many dedicated lovers in the show, regardless of whether every episode is a winner. They are the people who give the performance score of 10 people each and cannot evaluate the show objectively. For this reason, while back I checked all the original Star Trek episodes (good and bad) because the overall score and comments are too positive. Now is the time to do the same with The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> While I got a lot of points 10, but this one is 3 because it's bad. Writing in reality is not good, embarrassing. Two people from opponents in the great war have seen lost all the time. After a while, it was clear that they were only two people left on the planet - as you learned in a foolish and unbelievable conclusion. Normally, the twist at the end will make this great - this one killed it!
