I bought Unhinged because I was sucked by the blood on the cover. If you want to see all the good parts of the movie, just look at the back of the box. And I can honestly tell you that they look better on the slide than they do in the movie. <br /> <br /> Have to say that let's see each other better. A group of college girls drive to see rock concerts. (Along the way of deep and dark forests in one of the longest driving sequences ever recorded in celluloid). Move out of the road. No visible damage to the car. But apparently it was enough to make one of the characters in a restless state in the rest of the film (Or maybe she may read the script and be in a coma before starting filming)> <br /> The remaining two girls wake up in a separate big house. The house is incredible and plays more drama by its presence than the actors in the movie. But for some reason, this house has no roads The only way you can go to the main road is by trekking five miles through the forest. The girls spent the rest of Unhinged listening to strange conversations between a big female dog. (Which looks like George Washington is being dragged) and her sexually rebellious daughter Obviously, girls don't have to rush back from that concert because they collect more clothes than actors from Gilligan Island for that three hour tour. <br /> <br /> When we reach the audience The killing scene is no longer interested. We hope that someone will kill us just to end the suffering. Finally, Unhinged ends with a shocking story that deserves a much better movie. One good idea in the film was written before. Then the author tried to create a movie that led to success. <br /> <br /> Finally, Unhinged is a boring movie and has a bad performance. An inappropriate director and a story with a hole more than a leper in porn (Sorry, I'm not sure where it came from) You will get an idea of ​​how bad this movie is during the opening credits, when for some reason never explained, the screen will darken for about two minutes while the character Drama talks about things that should not be worth remembering. Don't waste your time. You will just feel Unhinged and need time and money back.
