Warning: The examination consists of a little spoiler. <br /> <br /> There is a parallel universe there, which disappeared in 60 seconds. It's a dark and frustrating independent film. Unfortunately, in this dimension, Gone ... is a moronfest testosterone that is invigorating, active, nimble, starring Nicolas Cage. <br /> <br /> For reasons not worthwhile at Will go Fifty cars are expensive. There is only one vehicle with alarms. This crew consists of a guy with funny ears and rumored to be a new superman. The man who runs the electricity in The X-Files; Former professional footballers and two black men tokens. <br /> <br /> Their enemies are police, robbers, robbers, competitors and Bilbo from their Manchester-style flat and wide accent crackers. Up for American audiences. Things from Daphne in Frasier. There are also Angelina Jolie without characters. Save to be able to support the sexual desire of men. She and Cage should be an old flame, which is strange because they have never got close to the normal conversation at the time of 135m. This movie <br /> In fact, Anyone who has a "moment" violin plays in the background to emphasize "emotions". There is no spoiler to reveal that Vinnie Jones (the creator of his famous "hand ball" strategy Paul Gasgoine and is quite dangerous when silent) Only one line; Not because he cannot speak, which is an important component of the plot But because he had concluded the suspicious morals of the movie after appearing quietly along the way as a joke, allegedly after he struggled through it in "not-quite-acting-but-it-will-" London draws Cage sound "I always thought that you came from Long Island." My ribs, as you might imagine, were really good and accurate. <br /> <br /> In reality, humor is an aspect that is not developed. The most, from cops, witty, unwise, to two black characters This sees the biggest aspect of Hollywood. Why did black people not be able to appear in important movies without knowing all the time about his skin color and talking endlessly about it? The youngest man, who spoke like an old man, spoke nonsensically throughout the period, declaring: "We, black people, do not like the cold ... We are tropical people." Then he expressed his desire to smoke. Joints and watch the roots Of course, he was a parody of the image of black people. But how funny is it? His older partner could not speak without talking about himself, and hence his color in the third person. "My black ass" This "my black ass" that nobody knows that black people who say that really? Don't think <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the movie is almost non-stop and has increased the volume of some songs - especially the Apollo 440 of "Don't Stop The Rock" - very loud. More than sound effects and conversations The surround sound system will separate the two to a level that makes the sound like two different movies work together. There is no background music concept here, it is equivalent to the ears of trying to watch a movie while some people at the back of the cinema have their stereo turned up full of bombs. "Keep that song down to the young man!" <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie in the world, and I like it in many ways. It's just predictable, lazy and witty. A little bit in construction Obviously, the box office expectations have declined significantly for this film. After being forced to leave the garbage for many years, the general public began to wake up to the truth.
