This is without a doubt that this will be the biggest waste of film, settings and cameras. I know you can't set your expectations for the 80's high slasher, but this is too stupid to be true. I ordered this movie for $ 0.89 and I still feel like stimulating my money back. You can imagine how difficult it is to be caught. <br /> <br /> Who is the violent killer in this movie and what is his inspiration? In fact, you can't care less. And why you should This junk manufacturer is not interested. They didn't try to create a bit of tension. Director (Stephen Carpenter - I think it's easier to earn money with that name) and make Kendered (1986), which is quite fun and when Soon he is a survivor. Do the crap completely But at least Eliza Dushku has this junk. Daphne Zuniga has been released !!! (Who ??) Yes, Chick Melrose Place Her memorable character died about 15 minutes after opening the credit. She is the second person to die. The first victim died directly in the first minute. But it seems that no one talks about or misses him after that. Who will be interested? The rest of the actors ... They don't really deserve the stage actors. It's not interesting. You hope that they will die quickly and painfully ... and not just their characters <br /> <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
