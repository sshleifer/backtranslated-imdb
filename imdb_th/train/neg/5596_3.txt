The model group is looking for an apartment to live and will be displayed by a real estate agent in the area. Models and agents are not known. However, that is "Hell's doorstep" is in the apartment and when being crossed by the demon "Deathman" will be called to kill everyone in his path. Sam Bishop tells the story of a journalist accused of murder. <Br /> <br /> Although I am a low budget, small budget and independent film But I can't watch this movie The creator takes pride in the filming schedule 24 hours a day and has at least one actor on the DVD of his acting prowess. But I can't anticipate this subject Why do you have to create a movie in 24 hours if one or two hour revisions will make a difference? And why your pride in acting is not good, ridiculous and results in bad signals. <br /> <br /> Through many movies, models are showing part of the apartment by real estate agents. The dialog is clearly advertised because there are no script writers that can use such empty words. The agent does not know anything about housing clearly ... She focuses on the aspects of the house that no one is interested in explaining the wrong source of heat. (She didn't see the radiator) and said that the insect problem would be solved. When they are called "endings", please write the script - some deviations are ok. But this is a messy story. <br /> <br /> And why are the girls moving in style? Their career has no plot issues, and this seems to be a forced situation. At one point, the actors, the characters divide and say something to the result of "Friends, they're going (Upset) "which sounds more natural than other lines, even if it's out of place. <br /> <br /> The demon doesn't understand I appreciated the effort to explain that "the limit of hell" jumped to a random place on Earth. (Including the fireplace in the apartment) but why not explain where the devil came from? His background is related to a man whose love is killed by another man. How does this make you a demon? (In addition, why do we want all this Victorian events without talking and looking over the fields? The character Sam Bishop is the worst character with an interviewer in the back. All questions must be paused, funny pages and replies ... followed by pausing, funny faces and replies? I was very disappointed. For me, the only point is to drag the time away ... but I want a good thirty minute delivery rather than a one hour terrible delivery. (And again, wasting more time by rolling the credit twice) /> <br /> Who is the character of Sam Bishop? He was accused of "seeing" all this and was accused of killing women. Yet he never participated in the story with women. So how do they see them? And if he didn't do it, how did he know that Dethman killed them? And if he doesn't see Dethman, how can he know that Dethman is the spirit of Apostoles? I'm lost ... There is even an outline of the story when writing. <br /> <br /> The only thing I found in this movie is the scene with a model in the bathroom. Not that it's really important or whatever. But it was just a break from the boredom I received I wonder what the director Felix Diaz is thinking. His music is very good. (Watching the DVD behind his sudden play) But I wonder about his filmmaking skills. Although the best part of the DVD is an example for his "Superhero Excelsior" (the only example is better than wasting all this time) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I have to be very serious. It is a test of what can be done in 24 hours or may be just an experiment for fun and the idea never creates a quality movie. But if the "Superhero Excelsior" is any indication, Diaz can create quality ... so why? Chose to avoid this? Maybe the world will never know
