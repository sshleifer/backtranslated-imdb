If you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, let it be a child. But prepare for bringing your hp on the radio. <br /> <br /> After watching a good movie like Arisan (2003), it is very scary to see what happens again in Indonesia. It seems that the only idea is to make money. But there seems to be no one who is serious about working with the image of Indonesia in the entertainment world as a 'world'. It doesn't seem to happen in the minds of filmmakers in Indonesia And because the Indonesian people have swallowed everything shown to them as 'Made in Indonesia' With the taste of the West, they fled. <br /> <br /> OK, this story started well. And it can develop into a good flick But the director never thinks about the fact that music requires first live music or at least plays well and the second good choreography? In this movie, playing SO BAD makes you want to cry in the cinema. Every single word you hear followed a few seconds after an actor or anyone singing, playing and it was extremely annoying while watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Choreography as if they were Plan to create a movie about gymnastics in the morning But eventually thought it would be good to make it into a musical ... they just forgot to change the choreography It is a dance that will hardly see you jumping up and throwing your legs into the air and that's it. <br /> <br /> At least, happy ending ... but if you can convince Your boyfriend said that candlelight dinner is more romantic than that!
