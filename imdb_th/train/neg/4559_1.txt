I am surprised that everyone involved in this production will really accept responsibility. This script is not funny at all. It must be written by someone who does not pass the entrance examination for the Canadian Comedy Writers Association. (And are saying something!) Leaving your binoculars if you want But nothing that looks funny in the eyes Ronnie Corbett must be banned for insulting himself with this garbage. The rest of the actors lack any ability to perform or be funny. I was surprised that it came through at first. All I can say to those who enjoy it is that they must be entertained very easily. And obviously the production cost must be at 100 yen per episode and in the event that everyone thinks that I am commenting as a foreigner who is not familiar with English humor, I must add that I am definitely in English
