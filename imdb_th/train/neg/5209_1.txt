OK, so I was bored and I watched it all the time. <br /> <br /> This film is not violent, untrustworthy and lackluster. The story is very sweet, it makes your teeth rotten. The tail of two children 'traumatized', learning about the 'gods' in which the fairy tale, which frankly made me somewhat traumatized Aimed at children who are straightforward to close after the first attempt at 'OIRISH' accent. Overall, why are they pumping out?
