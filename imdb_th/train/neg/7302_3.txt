The first five minutes of this film have the potential. After that, it's straight from something that might be illegal jokes. The best part is that I can't stop thinking about it. Supertroopers thank Joey Kern. I suggest watching this movie to learn how to make movies. There are many scenes in this movie that stop and wonder if both actors and staff stop paying attention at some point. The thing that surprised me most about this movie was earning $ 22 million at the box office and spending about $ 1.5 million Congratulations to Lion's Gate, who can pull it out.
