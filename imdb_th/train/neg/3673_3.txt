Diving scientist William Hurt, a US representative who conducted an investigation abroad. The contaminated person kicked the butt after falling 20 feet on his back and ran away? The gunman disappeared and did not kill Hurt (just wound him) but the second shot "killed" is dead? Wasting time. To compare this with falling like other critics do is ridiculous. Oh and at the end of the movie, they decide to start wearing gloves in their hands except for the "evil" agents and Hurt decides to kill him for him. What? BTW ... When will IMDb need 10 lines of text? I'm just babbling here. This doesn't just make the content of the review incomplete if you need to have a line number x or not.
