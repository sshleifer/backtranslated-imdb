Bo Derek's debut movie is still not visible for eight years ?? And that's how it should be! John Derek is a talented actor. But as a director, he is Ed Wood of erotic movies, right? Whether it is clear, especially considering that Bo (Unusual dark hair) is only 16 when this movie was created! John also wrote and photographed; The latter result in a great picture of the Greek island setting with storytelling that is set up? But the plot of nonsense and brutal conversations! <br /> <br /> The characters played by the male lead actor Peter Hooten were raised with Bo's family: they grew up as brothers and sisters. But now in their teens, both find that they are attracted to each other (but as I said, don't expect fireworks!) But the worst thing about this is the fact that Each drama has an obsession with movies not only But only stupid in yourself But still unobtrusive to them? Houten wants to change the far away fishing community into a modern seaside resort and expects that the cruise cruise will appear in view. (Of course, it's the final scene of the drama) Derek still looks better, right? She wants to occupy a large antique bathtub !! For that record, the couple were married at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Involved in an irrelevant event: female mayor and photographer Lothario who wanted to create a model from Bo (and who? Certainly that caused Hooten's jealous anger). Sometimes there is no good reason. At one time, we received examples from the screening of old Hollywood classic movies in cinemas. Open air, which is the whole city At the end of the day, while Bo's innocence is undeniably charming, it is not enough to compensate for the boringness and expertise of the movie.
