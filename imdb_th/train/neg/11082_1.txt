I know it's a mechanism of Power-Rangers And supporting children aged 7 years, but actually why are they serious about this movie? If they are going to write a plot with colored pencils, at least it is appropriate to make it stupid. It's a joke if you watch this thing. We have a typical family that is full of cliched characters (father is a veteran who lost his wife and blames himself LOLOL). But failed with a horrible performance Go to the movie But in order to fill the camera area, jokes But then they know that no one knows what to do Because there is no room for choreographers) so they set up the American Gladiator genre to run around
