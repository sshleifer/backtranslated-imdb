This movie is an insult to everyone. It was foolish It seems to have been written by a monkey. The show is ridiculous. If this is the view that most people have for the Navy, I cry for protection. This movie is terrible. I put it under "Travel to the bottom of the sea" as far as underwater movies. Gene Hackman had to use the rent to make shit. Denzel Washington must be a little tall in the plot, making any sense and ending for the rebel commander to receive his crime prize? Only Hollywood thinks this garbage. If you still don't understand, I don't like it. And if not because of the opinions of every professional, I don't want to post at all
