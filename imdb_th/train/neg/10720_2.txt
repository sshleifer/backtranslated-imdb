I saw this movie last weekend and it's ridiculous and irrational. The ancient curse turns men into mummies in his pajamas? The victims were afraid of unconsciousness and were unable to escape from the slow-moving old man. They dropped the torch and trembled instead of trying to expel him or burn him. The pseudonym of Quentin, Honeymoon of Honeymoon, is married to the pseudonym of Diane Brewer Worcester, Miss Canfield of letting beaver's duty, who is not satisfied with marriage Wow, love the plot, the rest of the actors follow each other in the grave and wait for a scream to respond and run to save them. The Egyptian girl doesn't look bad. But didn't lend to this movie Where is the mummy? Just a curse of liberation This does not hold the torch for Universal Mummy movies. At least watch this movie if you want to sleep because you will get the amount.
