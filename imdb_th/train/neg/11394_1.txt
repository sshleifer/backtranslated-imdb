Oh, for crying out loud, this must be a LAMEST movie that I've seen all year and I'm sorry that John Cusack, as usual, is related to this stupidity in the case. Sleepless in Seattle delivers the same message, even though it is at a deeper and more mature level. Serendipity grants it with a sledgehammer, then puts money in your mind. Next time boring and a half hours. (And that is one and a half hours of my life, I will not come back again. Thank you very much !!) It's not good enough that the main character of this movie will have an emotional maturity level of fourteen year olds. (Actually, I know the age of fourteen is better ...) except perhaps Jeremy Piven, which is sufficiently fun. Only the first 15 minutes of the movie in which the character of Kate Beckinsale represents the annoyance of the game about throwing the wind's feelings (Literally) have my best friend and I'm more frustrated than belief I told my husband that Rockstar is more intelligent, and at least the characters in Rockstar are not half that stupid people are in the mess. "Serendipitous" is annoying to watch the protagonists who seem to have no clue about their life choices and feel that they have nothing more than a puppet to destiny and fate. It's the most boring. I am sure that this film will be more happy by those who do not want to interfere with the chaos of choosing a more complex life, then responsible for the consequences Finally, this is the movie that our hero and heroine live happily after the chaos and misery in the lives of two people. (Is their fianc√©) not talking about relatives and other friends to go there. <br /> <br />
