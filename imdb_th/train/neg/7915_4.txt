All X-Men movies are great. And I mean all of them, including the long-hated X-Men. They have strong characters (Magneto and Xavier are the best people in my mind) and a good story. <br /> <br /> I am all excited when I hear this film about production and my expectations are getting bigger and bigger until I watch the movie. I'm very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman isn't a bad actor. (His best movie is The Fountain, although you don't hear about this movie when they talk about the actors) and his performance isn't What makes this movie worse? <br /> <br /> The film is filled with many meaningless characters that do not add anything to the plot (such as Blob or Gambit) that was thrown away. There to make fans believe that reading the original comics. <br /> <br /> I'm a XMen fan. I've read many of them and this film doesn't respect them. No. It's not about the Weapon X project or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth or Emma Frost. The motivation of wolverine is stupid and looks ordinary in millions of movies: Revenge for your loved ones. <br /> <br /> Oh, what I expect all the cursed movies to be the time of the Berseker for Wolverine, which is similar to what he had in X2 in the school. When Stryker came in and he alone destroyed the enemy forces But hey, this is a family fox, flicked and You will not see clear violence from the most violent and brutal Marvel heroes. <br /> <br /> In addition, I have a constant feeling about this movie because the origin of Wolverine is already described in X2 We already know how he is. Got his adamantium skeleton, so it's not reasonable to create a movie of what we already know. <br /> <br /> Personally, I believe Wolverine is one of the few characters. The body that does not need a stable background Because the mystery is the nature of the character We want to know how Joker gets his scar?
