OK, I know this will be an F-film alley (lower than the B-film standard), so I think "Men, I can use good laughter, so we can see the creatures under the sky kill each other." What I received can be found at the store. "Love Toys" in your area Random lesbian scenes, very little fighting and no plot. <br /> <br /> For example, one particular scene I can remember. (For only true stupidity, the characters (I can't remember their names ... the movies are great, right?) Driving as they do, most of them and drivers are tired of driving and stop: <br /> <br /> Driver: "Come, pull me tired, you want to occupy?" "Passengers:" Of course, I can drive for a while "(when pulled up, the driver began to grab the passenger's chest). Passengers:" What are you doing? I don't like that! "Driver:" It's all okay. " Passengers: "OK" (Continue to take off the shirt, fondle, kiss and play, lick) <br /> <br /> Now, the last time I checked horror movies, not in the porn category of Hollywood videos. You go elsewhere) and shouldn't be in the mainstream video at Blockbuster. Don't get me wrong. I'm not the one who hates pornography. But I will look at it properly and don't want to watch it for sure if I'm looking for a movie in the main stores like I rent here. (And maybe the same if I go to see) <br /> <br /> The worst movie that ever existed, no one should rent it, and it should only be bought to burn in public. If I can give 0, I can only get 10 times.
