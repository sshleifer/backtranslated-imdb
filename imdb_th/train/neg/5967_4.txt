Just think that it costs $ 250,000 to make "clerks". How do they spend 45 million dollars to create this music video? Two or three unknown actors in the scene do not have special effects that I can see ... I know that it must be used with a movie script full of expertise. Shooting a bar set will have to pay a bundle. However, I think Jerry Bruckheimer will not be put to death to make anything less. I'm just surprised that he didn't blow anything. <br /> <br /> Next, it's not a movie that I think is scary. The female lead seems to have good chemistry and the soundtrack is ok. IMO It seems a shame that this project is quite moderately able to be built for $ 5 million without any loss in production and 6 more. $ 5 million USD can make a movie well
