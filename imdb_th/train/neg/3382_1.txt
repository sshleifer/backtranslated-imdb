This is one of the worst film adaptations of musicals that have been made. The stage version of the A Chorus Line is excellent. This movie marks almost every way. Even the cast was baffled by Audrey Landers as Val "Dance 10 Looks 3" as Val's song. Val's story is that she is a great dancer but is 3 in the Luke department. But in the end she was a great dancer What do great filmmakers do? They hire actors who can't dance and have a good reputation. How to miss the boat <br /> <br /> Then there was a choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett is overturning in his grave. Why don't they use his choreography? It cannot be improved.
