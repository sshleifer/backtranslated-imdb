Back when, X-Files is a clever and thought-provoking presentation. The majority of the appeal is that the writer looks at the villagers and science for their ideas tied to the horrific side of real life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > I feel unbelievable in season 8 when broadcasting. The show has given two episodes completely to bend. ("One son" and "Requiem") and season 7 saw the rapid increase of episodes that took the bucket for ideas far beyond convincing or Seriously stupid But I think he can benefit from the doubt. Maybe they will bring it back because they have many wonderful ideas. <br /> <br /> "Runners" are annoying as "patience. "Which at least offered an interesting angle about the villagers that showed that vampires did well to avoid strange events (Aliens?) Parasitic episodes seen with the power of mind control worshiped by Christian worship Oh and they think it is the second coming of Christ. But you will find that in the last few minutes Seriously. There has never been any attempt to understand this in order to explain what the bullet is, why, what happened or whatever. Even in the early years of the reality show, especially then you can expect to have a slightly increased depth, a little background or, if not, then the opposite - a little mystery. What happened. <br /> <br /> Scully who really killed it. You can endure the stupidity of the place. But there are characters that have been developed for more than 7 years as a reasonably skeptic who turns to be a loner who is purely gullible for the sake of strange plans Do you feel that you are watching teen horror movies? But being a woman into the age of thirty, she enters into a creepy isolated community where she uses the best moments of the decade to reveal her evil, hicks, stereotypical or utterly indifferent for Her own safety Oh, and by the way, the new Doggett, the Mudler is not around. Scully just walked out into the desert to see the brutal murder of herself without him. He appeared at the end to save the day - I can't remember why - but other than that, he wasn't really there again: seriously. <br /> <br /> In summary, it feels Like a general script written for another show or someone's pet film project Long-term performances at the most risky time It may be used with less acting, which the characters are more structured and the audience is expecting less, but the X-Files is well done and Scully is one of the strongest characters in the 90s. Change her personality for the story they have to do in Star Trek. The time period is about fifty or more.
