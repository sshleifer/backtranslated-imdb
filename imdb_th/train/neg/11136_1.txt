This is just the second time that I feel compelled enough to comment at imdb about the movie. The first time may be the best movie I've ever seen and that is for Memento. <br /> <br /> Seeing Darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to Memento, as in the worst movie. I have seen Unfortunate to see In addition to the two scenes with naked women, there is nothing in this movie that will lift it up from the junk that it is. <br /> <br /> Let's see that the shocking effect, the script that doesn't. Well and the show is not good long. My wife and I laugh through the majority in not believing in bad things. Surprisingly, I watched it until the end. I never knew! Avoid !!!
