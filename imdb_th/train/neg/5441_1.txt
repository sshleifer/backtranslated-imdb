In every movie I watched this movie, The Rage must be one of the worst movies in one direction, LOGIC, continuity, change of script and dialogue, causing me to cry out in pain. "Who will come up with something crappy?" Gary Busey is known for his "B" movie, but this is definitely a movie "W" (W = junk). <br /> <br /> For example: about two dozen FBI and Local law enforcement officers surround the trailer house with a Jeep Wagoner. Inside the jeep is MA and "confused" why all the police are Within a few seconds, a large gun battle occurred. The MA was killed immediately. Police blast a jeep with Gary and blow away at them. The police fell like a domino and a jeep with Gary driving around in a circle and not being hit by a bullet / single tablet. MA was killed and Gary seemed to not notice that the man was a tough man. True miracles, not since the six guns that hold 300 bullets, have such miracles.
