According to other comments showing this movie, you may be shocked when you are a child. (And that may be a good thing for it) <br /> <br /> However, if you're older than this movie, do only one thing: big suction - so I don't mean acting. Cut the soundtrack or s.th like that. I'm just talking about "plot" (if you can call it) <br /> <br /> Spoiler in front. ------------------------ <br /> <br /> I don't want anyone. Spoiler is more than necessary. (If after reading, you still really want to watch this movie), but if you graduate from any school, this is just an insult to your intelligence. When I looked at this, I was almost always stunned because of what was just a silly thing. <br /> <br /> Including: <br /> <br /> - UNITE formation (UN at Evil - Link) <br /> <br /> -> We should believe it is evil. Is it too evil? If so: why is it evil? <br /> <br /> - Mark of evil in a tattoo. <br /> <br /> -> There is no need to define this for So people Why don't they do that? <br /> <br /> - Invite Christ to your heart, just serve lips. <br /> <br /> -> Because there is nothing at all in this movie is considered. "True Christians" never do. Saying silly prayers. So ... just say that prayer in front of the rapture and you are saved - no matter what happens! <br /> <br /> So rate 1/10
