Personally, I would like to recommend people to know this movie clearly. It looks boring and the fight is poorly designed. Slow and unbelievable If you buy a Hong Kong Legends DVD in this movie, the only thing worth listening to is the opinion of Bey Logan. <br /> <br /> But in any case, watching, I can't think That there will be someone and do not want to speak in good faith. <br /> <br /> Overall when talking about movies
