I hate this movie so much. I remember vividly. It's not funny at all. All movies that require humor, jokes that do not have sex, and the humor of racism are not worthy to use In the first half hour, Rob Schneider drank rancid milk. All I can think of is "He deserves it because doing bad movies" Don't waste time or money on this.
