I went to watch this movie, hoping for the best. I like general musicals. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball work well with their roles. However, the author gives them boring interactions. Love, interest between the two is not true growth. Suddenly it was there. I didn't miss much music. The best number is an example of the information we hear about Spike Jones with the "Der Fuhrer's Face", the number one spike-Jones. Something that is quite tame, even with monkeys. The funny game of Bert Lahr is endless. <br /> <br /> Have some fun: Lucille Ball is quite a look.
