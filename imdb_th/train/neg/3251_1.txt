I watched this movie in FX last night and when I was sitting there watching it happened to me that it might be the worst movie. Bad performances, Bad movies, Bad voices, Unbelievable fighting sequences, Stupid characters all make this the worst movie I've ever seen It was terrible. I was addicted because it lacked something I had to watch ... and they did the next part!
