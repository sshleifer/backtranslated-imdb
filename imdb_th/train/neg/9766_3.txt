Roger Corman is one of the most diverse and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He was the only person responsible for my favorite horror movies (such as Edgar Allen Poe, adapted the "Masque of the Red Death" and "Pit and the Pendulum"), including quickies, cheap and tasteless junk (eg "Creature" From the Haunted Sea "and" She is the god of coral reefs "). Corman also created a few films that could not be easily identified and? Just put? Almost impossible to judge correctly For example, "The Trip", as well as the name "Gas-s-s-s" in the imagination, is rather identified as a delusional exploitation. In other words, they are strange cultural hippies that influence movies. Half of the time when you don't have a little idea of ​​what happened, these characters are those who walk around the screen and where this thing is happening. The plot is simple and highly effective: gas, strange and deadly nerves are accidentally released and destroyed as soon as the entire world population is over 25 years old. * This may be evidence. The basic atmosphere of the sci-fi observation point after his death, but the author George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to switch to a romantic comedy "trippy". No character, even trying to prevent The deaths will occur unavoidably. They go out to a party on the street and find that there are a few young and juvenile crime organizations. "Gas-s-s-s" is disappointing and frustrating and tries hard to be bizarre. It seems that all scripts will be updated immediately and not funny. Of course, it's not my cup of tea. But this movie has a loyal fan base and many admirers, so I'll tell anyone that it's not worth your time or money?
