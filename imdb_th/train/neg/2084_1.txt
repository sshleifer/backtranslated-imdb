If they give the negative number option, I will use it. This movie is truly terrifying. I entered the theater, expecting it to be scary, and it was beyond my expectations. <br /> <br /> The weak script, the acting is painful. I want to go out But my friend drove and wanted to get her precious money. I think both of us were disappointed. <br /> <br /> Breast growth when women get special powers and changing hair color. Wrong. Eddie Izzard seems to be wrong for the super villain. He has come out weak and ridiculous. Jenny Johnson (Ummur it) comes out as a psychotic and strange, like Matt (Luke Wilson) friend Vaughan (Renn Wilson)
