If there is one thing you can trust that Disney is doing, it is their unique ability to tell stories. Even watching ads for Lady and the Tramp II is a terrible experience. Disney is forever destroying one of their best classics. It has a spaghetti ball. It's been done before! And that's what I said to this story, sorry directly with the video (All concepts should be banned) Everything is just a new beginning of the original movie, and even Bluth's bad films, many stories of penguins and walruses (I forgot the name) are just a low carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa Morgana is another Ursula She also repeats all of her original tracks. Really pathetic music I have never heard any bad songs from them until now. And the conversation was bad It's pathetic and simple. On the positive side, at least they spent time creating animations quite well. Not all characters are as annoying as they used to be. (Or it may be negative for Little Mermaid fans) coming back to the negative side of Melody. So cute, ugly. You may be vomiting. I almost do myself and your Little Mermaid fan is a favorite. Don't waste money on this. Actually, it's not scary like the Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but it's a little consolation.
