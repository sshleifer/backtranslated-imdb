Anyone who has written the screenplay clearly has never consulted a book about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I have never seen many mistakes in the biography since her early years in Celoron and Jamestown until the following year with Desi. I can write a list of all the real mistakes. But it will continue for various pages I believe Lucille Ball is one of the inimitable people who cannot be demonstrated by anyone other than myself. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr. I would be angry that the number of errors occurred. In this movie The filmmakers tried hard. But this movie looks very sloppy
