Although the film was created before Dogme appeared as a way to create a distinctive film and before the victory over digital. You get points This 1991 masterpiece is expected to develop clearly. Corin Nemec stands out just because he is not a good writer and lecturer. The rhythm is slow But it is very beautiful because the movie is very beautiful Save the next time at T.V. Because I guarantee that you will never see a newly created movie for T.V. Movie. Forwarding video never feels good!
