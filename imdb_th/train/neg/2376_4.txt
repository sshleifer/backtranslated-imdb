George Brent is a journalist sent to interview women. She is the heir of the face cream. He interviewed her on her yacht. They fall in love in a swimsuit. <br /> <br /> It appears (very fast) that she is not the heir. She is part of a cool cream advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> Movies follow their love up and down. <br /> <br /> Supporting actors don't help. Davis and Brent carry pictures Although it can be fairly predictable But still providing entertainment fairly It's far from her. But especially considering the ambiguity in her work, it is not her worst thing as well
