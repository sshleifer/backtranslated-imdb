Is there anything that happens in this movie that cannot be predicted? I think not. Essentially, this movie has an ancient idea after ancient thinking and there is nothing surprising. It makes the movie very predictable and because the film still lacks serious tension Therefore, for thriller, it is not stressful and unpredictable enough. But for the drama it is a failure This is because this movie is very difficult. I mean there is no way this thing can happen in real life, just like the events that happened in this movie. So this movie has a problem of credibility and reliability. <br /> <br /> But it's an ancient idea that kills movies. Sometimes the cringe of all things is formulated in this movie. The hunter was described as a heartless person, almost as a psychopath like a frustrated boy who was sexually assaulted and victimized as an innocent girl who acted like she didn't see this thing. Everything that happens in this movie is very clear and seems to be happening for reasons such as the order in which the 'hunter' corrects the broken car. 'Victims' must be one of the oldest ancient ideas from the book. I know what the movie is trying to accomplish after that. I try to look as if the teacher and the students are growing together to gaze the eyes of the people around them. It was incredibly clear and the price was so nearly that I wanted to stop watching the movie after that. The movie is full of moments like this. <br /> <br /> The name may suggest that this is a cheap porn movie. But in fact, it is hard to do for TV movies. Which means that everything is happening slowly and the movie takes half the time to develop characters and subplots that are not necessary to make the drama movies too. <br /> <br /> I'll admit that Elizabeth Berkley is a very good actor. In this movie She makes some ancient ideas and events look very realistic sometimes. Her Hollywood career is good after appearing in the Paul Verhoeven movie "Showgirls". So, unfortunately, she may still appear in movies - and television series like this only. It lost her ability and she deserved better than all the other characters. Corey Xavier plays the rich and unbelievable young man, and the way the main character's husband shows is worse than before. He looks like a predator who is more sexually irritated than the real predator of the movie. In general, he tried to have sex with his wife in every order. He wakes up. He wants to have sex. Before going to bed, he wants to have sex He returned home. He wanted sex. It may be true. But I don't know. It just doesn't feel right for this movie and in general. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of clich√© and I can't think of it. For whatever reason, everyone should watch this movie. It is predictable and still lacks suspicion and credibility. Not a movie that is 'scary' and of course a movie that can be watched at all times But all the weak and obsolete elements in the movie still make this story far from the recommended movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
