After a few years, some years 1968 were a good time for Elvis: not only did he make a special comeback "TV", but he also became a father and performed in a good movie. Two stories too? Speedway and live a little love so little. Personally, I can forgive him for mistakes. STAY AWAY, THE BEST JOE appears to be an interesting misunderstanding and not at all. Considering the bad, of course, Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell are really embarrassing ?? As a sequence, dopey father India and Elvis's character and the evil bartender with her eyes as well as Presley - but we're glad to see Elvis. Surrounded by two jones, Henry and LQ - and the humorous Thomas Gomez, especially as the head of the sarcastic Thundercloud, Meredith's stubborn father still wears his old head clothes in present! <br /> <br /> While there is a lack of surprising songs (If their dissatisfaction is not satisfactory) seems to be no shortage of free for all parties as the Indian men hit the bottle continuously while performing Presley his flirting skills behind their backs! As expected, the scenery of Arizona is generally an important asset here and snoring snoring is not just a disturbance. But is good But is an important point On the other hand, the episode 'The destruction of the house' by air is something that we have seen often since and do not work here ...
