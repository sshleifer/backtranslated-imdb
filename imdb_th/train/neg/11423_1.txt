What happened in the creation of this film so that it ended up with a total mess? Just one year after "The Breakfast Club", a great movie with many actors alike in "St. Elmo's Fire" (which, by the way, watching and performing in the latter more like they are still the wrong high school From the past But there is no hand or discipline to show their role. <br /> <br /> It's a director or writer because it's the same person. (Joel Schumacher) It must have both. But then Schumacher gave us "The Phantom of the Opera", "Telephone booth", "A Time to Kill", and two Batman movies, "Batman and Robin" and "Batman Forever", which range from Good governance, very good. There is something wrong with "StEF" because it doesn't have any genius. There are no jokes, no value at all, and far from truly precious things in life. <br /> <br /> Example: Wendy character (The young woman with a good heart) and helping the underprivileged, played by Mare Winningham) revealed to Billy. (The stubborn dirty person who tricked his wife and girlfriend) uch and without feeling the order of his life played by Rob Lowe appropriately) that she is still pure. Billy saw the real challenge and victory, but Wendy "wasn't ready". Wendy actually wasn't ready. It's hard to believe that she is in a group of friends. Later in this story, when Billy, whose wife had left him, took him to marry another, pulling something in his life together. Billy is leaving for New York to abandon and abandon the responsibility of his parents, daughters and daughters. He convinces Wendy that her purity will be the perfect "escape gift" from her and him. And Wendy, who works as a social worker who helps a broken family, seems to have not received any damage from this dictator. Let me take a break. The only thing you can give once you give to the loser who is going from family and friends? Schumacher presents this scene as a wonderful and impressive moment. <br /> <br /> There are many examples that have completely disconnected from what actually happened with the value that was thrown overboard and That action looks like a virtue. Br /> <br /> I think some people might say "That's the 80s" but I remember that it was in the "80s" that men began to take responsibility for the children they were father in. Married or away /> <br /> I The movie is terrible because it syncs with what is really valuable and accurate. <br /> <br /> For the technique (not the story) it's terrible. It's separate and feels like it is. 3 hours of movies that were modified for 1 hour and 40 minutes. Changing and jumping at times was not reasonable. Picking things on the floor, fixing the room, putting it back and the movie may flow much better ... but it's still a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe Schumacher could become a director. Which is better and stronger than 1986 (he must have) or maybe he was above his head when it came to writing a screenplay for St Elmo's Fire or this group of actors seized the scene and followed their way Myself - that's what I Think that actually happened
