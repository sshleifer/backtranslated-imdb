No plot, terrible scenes / fantastic scenes (world-famous marksmanship / marksmanship that can't attack their targets within a few feet, plus what happened at the end --- --- Law group forcing property destruction Carnival shooting gallery? WTH?) Technical error (How many bullets you can fit in Glock's magazine. 100+ people. These people shoot guns without having to reload.) This movie is terrible that even senior Hollywood actors like Michael Biehn (Aliens, terminator) can't. Save this garbage. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. (I know I wasted 100 minutes of this precious life). Hopefully the director will stop making a movie or learn more about his next movie.
