Jay Chou only and the film lacks the depth of character development, movie style and plot unfolding. <br /> <br /> Everyone noticed that the captain of the basket team. (Forget his name) and the player with Li Xiao's image looks very similar to what you think they are the same person. The hair is long, sunny and tall. The two of them seem to be coming out of a large production plant designed to spin products that make teen girls scream in orgasm. Not that the two actors are worth anything that will benefit the overall film for the film industry. <br /> <br /> The jokes are lame and not funny. <br /> <br /> The scenes involved.
