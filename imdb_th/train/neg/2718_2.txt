This is the most horrible movie I've ever seen. The way that drops will eat anyone is the biggest mystery of this film. The drops move very slowly until o.a.p in the zimmerframe can escape. Blob had a big fortune to find a horror woman who instead ran away standing still for half an hour so she could eat If you haven't watched this movie, I suggest you do it too funny to be serious.
