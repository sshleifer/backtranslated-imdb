Born again as a standard sub-episode from one version It's about the reincarnation and not flying. I have never felt a big reincarnation and that may be part of the indifference now. It refers to the case of Tooms, which is a good continuation from the previous episode. But the end is there Which is unfortunate because that happened at the beginning of the episode I think it's ridiculous that the dead man will choose to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl. And he waited until the eight-year-old girl to begin revenge Even the serious lack of dialogue Mulder & Scully in order to now fall. If you are reincarnated, perhaps now may be your own. If you don't, at least you can learn what bradycardia is.
