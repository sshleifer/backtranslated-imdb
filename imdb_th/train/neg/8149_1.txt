What the pants pile of course After religiously reading the book of Chris Brookmyre since I found "Quite Ugly ..." I'm glad to know that the drama has been commissioned. <br /> <br /> Obviously I have too much faith. <Br /> <br /> Bitt should be the best thing in this list - and even though he is not fit The way everyone can read books and adapt to this piece of waste is above me. <br /> <br /> All the characters were changed to be dropped. Quick chin and sliding open the bay window ... It tears my eyes. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid to think what will happen to "Country Of The Blind" if this is the standard ... <br /> <br /> Please avoid ...
