This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. While featuring good actors, movies don't depend on expectations. The most amazing thing about this movie is the song which summed up the movie's performance quite well: compensating for the terrible and confusing story by having a well-known actor. Do not change the fact that this is a very boring movie. Earn yourself points. 1
