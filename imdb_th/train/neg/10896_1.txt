I know that you have read this story in countless other movies. No doubt you are reading the comments here. But Voodoo Academy still stands as the worst movie I can follow. There is no doubt that the bad people really can't buy or watch TV. But even then I felt that it was fair to qualify that I was not just a stupid tenant that was not well chosen. <br /> <br /> I 've seen two of the top three movies in the top 100 here. imdb and I'm suing the rest of every opportunity Mostly standing head and shoulders above these things ... Indulge in absolute monotony. <br /> <br /> I like to rate movies that are not really good. (Just like having no sense of humor, even in bad things) If you can see by yourself, it's not that bad. If you can watch with a single friend ... it's not good, but maybe even worse. <br /> <br /> We are 5 people doing everything through Voodoo Academy. And not even a fun time to watch bad movies (For example, seeing a boom boom, 3 times in this movie, if I'm not mistaken) may cause the taste of my mouth to dry. Yes, I watched it, but I still forced my 4 friends to watch as well to achieve that goal. <br /> <br /> I hope and pray. We see the director being cut ... think that there may be a version with a large eyebrows for the next 20 minutes with a baby oil gland. from me Many movie centers around this thing. <br /> <br /> I applaud david decoteau for handling this movie in two days with a short budget, just as I applaud him to convince people to pay him. There is no doubt that his fetish is a celluloid version. But it's not a good movie Traditional stores of horror were shot in the same period for the amount of comparison. (Considering inflation) and is the most precious gem It's not an excuse for how bad this kid is. <br /> <br /> The front spoiler ... <br /> <br /> It's not worth it to separate the holes that plotted out. . The pacing of this film ... crazy ... nothing ... interesting for the moment decoteau devoted to the pectoralis massage manually. No matter what your position or gender is ... rubbing cannot keep that screen time. <br /> <br /> The performance is cheese ... but not too many actors. .. Better movies ... In any way, it is delivering the worst semi-line you will ever hear in this movie, which is really satirical. <br /> <br /> Rent this thing. If, like me, you have charm And the worst of the worst and if you're going to see it with a group of people who are ready to work to get through it This is not hahaha. This shaky series. It's a test of the patience you might want to skip. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it's worse ... but I'm not surprised if it has the name of decoteau.
