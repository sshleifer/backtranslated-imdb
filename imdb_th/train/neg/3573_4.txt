This film is a special Pia Sado! When I watched it, I thought of a classic cartoon that showed Hollywood stars. Need another role urgently But was afraid to become a typecast for the movie 'B' or a soft porn movie, who said that in casting her "Of course, I don't normally show the role that I want to be nude. But if necessary for movies ............... "This memory causes a very mischievous image of similar cartoons which show Pia in such a session that "Of course, I normally do not do any duties that require real acting. symbol..................". This may not be fair without reducing. The rather unclean story is the fault of the book Harold Robbins; Considering the nature of the story of Pia, it will certainly not receive attention and perhaps (Which had been awarded a performance in a butterfly) intentionally satirizes her part instead of trying to perform a role that is almost impossible Critics often point to the actor before being a problem whenever the movie proves to be disappointing. The screenwriter and the director are often more wrong. The real problem of "The Lonely Lady" is the same screenplay as the original book. Look for more feelings than content and nothing can help. <br /> <br /> The screenplay for this film is abysmal. But regardless of whether this film will be more successful filming with better screenplay, strict supervision and really talented performances as it is released, my audience will rise. Based on whether I evaluate my personal opinion or evaluate how successful the movie is in providing what it is intended to do My personal rating, it will be two-tenth; But to a certain extent, this film may give what the supporters intended and judged on this basis that four out of ten quality ratings are reasonable. Stay in a charitable mood and want to make it clear that I don't blame Pia for my disappointment. I will give you a fourth IMDb rating.
