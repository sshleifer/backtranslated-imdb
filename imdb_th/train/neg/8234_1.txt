Writers and producers of this little outing have fallen deep of new iniquities. The writer's blog is in a bad condition or has a bad idea until they are forced to put a disgusting scene where the girl defecates in the van's back seat and throws the stool in the car. At least you sum up what this movie has worth). We were treated to a woman who had more than one urinal in her friend at the spot, including many vomiting episodes. One time will suffice ... We get the message! This is bringing the humor of the bathroom to the next level! If the script and performance improved, then I could easily forget that I was watching a movie that was filmed in an inexpensive video. This is a traditional story that is quite intelligent. (Only) that we have to use the view from the inside of the van; Thus making it feel more realistic We have never seen in other places, such as shops or branches that many women have disappeared, and this may add to the much needed tension. <br /> <br /> Scary scripts like: 'I don't feel. Too good ... I want to go home. 'After a girl was chased by psychosis; Being screwed, raped and shot, which seems not enough. <br /> <br /> The show is cruel (In addition to madness) All 5 main actors in learning the show using the postal contact course during a long mail strike! The sound is so bad that I have to watch the whole story with subtitles. <br /> <br /> The director seems to be easy on this. It seems that the only direction he must give is: 'Scream girls' <br /> <br /> And for the show ...... If you look at this, please make sure there is paracetamol in there!
