I might rate this movie before Peter Jackson's trilogy comes out. But seeing the two of them side by side has no comparison. The speed of this movie is hastening. Several important scenes from the book are released and there is little character development. Animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live scenes drawn over which I find distracting. And the most frustrating thing about this movie is that it stopped in the middle and didn't end There are some good points. The fight scene is exciting and the dialogue follows this book. Look at this if you're in a hurry and can't take 10 hours to watch the new trilogy. But if you haven't read the book, you may be confused because there are many versions of this missing version. 4 out of 10
