Admittedly, I found that Al Pacino was a miserable pleasure. He was a good actor until the Scent of Woman, apparently he was unable to fix overdose. I hope this movie, which I heard that almost nothing grew up. A political political thriller that is overlooked in advance. It's not <br /> <br /> The City Hall is a movie that creates a plot of it with characters, names and "real" problems throughout the city, which, as you think That it is a wide plot and is involved When you find the truth, it will impress you. However, in fact, these sub-schemes and sub-divisions have resulted in a very tame and familiar city, such as Corruption of Power, two-sided politicians, Mafia and police relations. Afraid that there are no characters that are safe and what will happen! But it wasn't really. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the only thing that happened was quite predictable, and we still had many words of confession "confession". By combining strange tales, lessons in the moral ambiguity of "The real world" of politics and society, but after 110 minutes of lost names and reports, and the spider web of lies and concealment, the audience often receives satisfactory revelations. I don't think we will leave it in the town hall and while it's a full movie, I don't think it's perfect.
