I like the initial location for this movie, which is what makes me hunt. But the problem that I found quickly was that someone knew what would happen within the first 20-30 minutes (the pair came from behind the mirror and Every occupation) <br /> <br /> There is no real twist (which is good), but the final revelation doesn't make much sense as well. (She will be placed with uncertainty and fear for If you are an evil idol from outside the mirror?) <br /> <br /> Accepting that the scene "beyond the mirror" is scary when they first appear and the murder of a blonde girl. Creepy as well It seems to be a movie that searches for more interesting stories or scripts. The atmosphere that is overlaid with the atmosphere and the most scary sound design in the 80-90 minutes doesn't really cut. In fact, it's quite boring.
