It ended with slashers about 88, so it was time for the tearing of those old movies. The brain did very well. The script reminded me of the videotape. But in a more magical way than ever before. The performance can go well. But it is an effect that makes you laugh, a brain called a real turkey and blood never appears The opening sequence is what makes this movie look remarkable. The hallucination is very good and reminds me of Nightmare. It can be seen for those who are crazy about it because there is no blood in it and as it says that the blood is not there. But there are nudity for the perverts I've watched movies that were worse than this movie. But hope that they will make it look scary ...
