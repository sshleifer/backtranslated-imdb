Avoid this movie unless you want to watch expensive movies, but don't do well. For example? Sounds good, but the conversation is not clear - important sins in French movies. <br /> <br /> What movie does this attempt to blend between the West, the use of drugs and dressing in olden times? Consider this matter well The cowboy song was hilarious during the sword fight. Or a woman in her underwear holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed. <br /> <br /> People should do 'What Up Tiger Lily' with this bomb. Write a new script and make a copy or subtitle. It's almost now. (BTW, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, both known to American audiences)
