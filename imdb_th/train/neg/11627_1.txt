I wonder who is responsible for this. The jokes will not work for Gilligan Island. If this thing goes on in the series, will there be a joke about Auschwitz, or will Eva have to change her oven just to give Adolf the kind of advice at the 50 seat? Another post comparing this show with I love Lucy. The problem with this is that Lucille Ball is a genius in a comedic situation and this strange situation and chaos are not good and insulting my intelligence. <br /> <br /> After the damage the Nazis do With England and the number of deaths, I think the concept of jokes about Hitler seems to be disgusting and most people will kill this concept before any episode is produced.
