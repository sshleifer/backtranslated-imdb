I just rented this room today .... heard many good reviews before wow !! It's a very exciting story !! Does anyone know the director's address so I can get five dollars back? In the end, there were people "Stop-loss" from the 'Warst Iraq War Movie Ever', the number one for fairness. I don't think there is a good Iraq war movie But it's really terrible. <br /> <br /> I won't go into any technical inaccuracies. There are hundreds of reviews from other GWOT vets that give all the details. If the director cares about advising even the most E-lowest about technical accuracy But they can make the movie look more realistic .... I guess the writer should get "credit" for this movie Obviously he or she is planning a plot for this film from a vivid imagination that does not affect the bond of reality. Nobody except me wondering what the issue of this movie is? Is there a message? Seriously though ..... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I'm quite surprised at all the really positive reviews. This film is difficult to watch as a vet because of all the obvious inaccuracies. But even if someone can see that the plot sucks, the character is shallow (Say at least) and the performance is not the best It's ridiculous that I think this movie should be about getting rid of the explosive law because it's the biggest explosion I've seen this year.
