I easily enjoy. I enjoy "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and their many sequels, even when most people find that they can't bear it. I can still enjoy the movie Pauly Shore. Most have only one movie that I have ever seen that I can honestly say it's not good ... and this is like that A long time ago I saw it. But I remember sitting in the theater thinking "This is a dumb movie, why am I seeing this?" It's the only movie I don't recommend.
