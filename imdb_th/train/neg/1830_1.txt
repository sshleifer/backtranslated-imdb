This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not kidding. The next time it comes, I'll continue to put my head into the wall. I will enjoy sitting in the emergency room trying to explain to the doctor more why my brain is swollen, trying to make it through this movie again. <br /> <br /> I hope the blacks. This project is bad again. Both were good comedians, so I was shocked by it. Surprisingly, <br /> <br /> If they had to do it again, I was pretty sure they would not decide. The person in front of the money will have to lose tons of unreal - because the special effects (all 2) are terrible.
