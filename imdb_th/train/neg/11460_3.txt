A fairly amusing piece that tries to show how intelligent Orcas is. But at the same time (And somewhat oblivious to them) makes the audience feel stupid by creating the most ridiculous movie Richard Harris plays the role of a .. I am sorry. That's wrong. He plays the role of Captain Nolan, a fisherman who caught sharks for a living. But was tempted by a big catch When the arrest of a female killer whale is unusual (without asking), it is a pair (without asking) being rampant (without asking) and starts to stop. Something in common (don't ask). Making amazing movies makes people here. I have to tell you that getting started (With whale sounds and nothing more) is haunting and ending credits (With the most lovely songs) is quite fun
