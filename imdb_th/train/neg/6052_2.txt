Despite the flaws But I'm happy with "Burning cigarettes", one episode of John Carpenter in the Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story seems to skip the price between the mouths of MADNESS and 8 mm, but still quite good for budget and time However, with "Pro-Life", budget and time constraints can show more than anything else. Has a strong governance, as always, from Carpenter It has all the quality of writing and production that gives the feeling of being in a hurry. The script is not clear at all times. The fuzzy text and the story are full of holes, plotting when you look back. Maybe Carpenter will write a new chapter again, it should be a worthwhile episode. Instead of being distorted with only hard-core fans, it will be a little enjoyable. 2/10
