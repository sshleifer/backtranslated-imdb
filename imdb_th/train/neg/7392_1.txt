I looked around in the video store, still stunned that Steven Seagal and his Bad Action film still had 3 movies to hit the shelves in less than a year. The first in the Sci Fi Genre for our broader Seagal. Pictures, entertainment, movies that are not good, show your eyes in front of me as anxiously. This is not the case, one bit that doesn't have entertainment and movies. As bad as they came a little bit with Shadow Man, but the last fun we saw him, however, the attack power must be his worst movie. Of course, don't argue that Kill, Ticker or even Black Dawn. This is the bottom of the septic tank here. <br /> <br /> Everyone who says that this is the return of Steven Seagal should be forced to write a 100-page essay in the word Taste. <br /> < br /> Seagal is another one Endure / I am the worst person once again, named Lawson, wanting to take revenge for killing his team that leads him to an evil plan to dispense a truly bad drug for an unsuspecting person. The public doesn't have to mention the dealer, not from here. <br /> <br /> The whole production from directing is not good. This movie was filmed in the dark? It must be the lightest movie from Howling. 2. The action is terrible and terrible. <br /> <br /> The producer also decided to do what the fans hate the most: Toss Dantwong after Stunt Double and Steven Seagal were terrifying. Show a little enthusiasm here, can you blame him? <br /> <br /> While there is a saying that Attack Force is not a movie that Stevie has signed on (originally as Harvester) and of course must Better than the Attack Force. Of course - altering production doesn't make it more consistent and makes Seagal look worse. I feel bad about Directer Michael Keusch and author Joe Hal Pin as they will be judged forever for the production that Not <br /> <br /> So now this thing makes Seagal in a position that is impossible to come up with things that will compensate for this mess. The bad attack force becomes what we want. Let him create another movie?
