I must say that I can't stop watching this movie from the moment it starts. Just how bad it is !!! It's like watching dry colors only that makes them more confusing. I mean, you sit there and wait for what will happen in reality, especially what makes the whole movie feel! At the end of this movie, I sat there wondering if there was any chance that I might miss the first hour that explained everything, or that I might have accidentally passed between the movie and missed the glued plot part (if In fact, there are together)! The main thing that made me confused about this movie is almost at the end of the main girl. (If there is a real main woman) is in reality some options. I mean what happened at this point! Suddenly, she woke up and was in a mental institution, chained to a bed that had been poisoned by a doctor or something, then faster than to take me to my wrist. Random eating It's not reasonable! I would like to email the creator and ask for time back. I mean, I wasted 2 hours looking at this garbage! I am interested in knowing that the filmmakers really know what it is about! It seems that someone has solved all the bits that could be understood. But I think this movie takes up to 4 hours to make it happen! I sided with other people who wrote other reviews completely. I stuck with this movie with the title. I was so grateful that I didn't really buy this movie, no matter how many times I saw it in a local pound store. You would think that would give me a clue that this movie is a complete steaming garbage. But actually I think 1 pound is a way to spend too much money on this movie !!!! It's so sad that it's a waste of time and a good razor. I mean, I hope I will be OD'ed. It's less painful than watching this movie !!!!
