I should think that any movie that has a Poltergeist woman in it is not really good. It doesn't matter. But at the beginning of the murder scene, you find that the movie you're watching is a movie inside the movie. There were people sitting in the cinema watching that movie. One of the women in the audience was so annoying that I had to turn my back and strangled her. Strange but far from good.
