... from this scary movie! There are many things that are wrong with this film, acting, writing, direction, editing and others, which are amazing things that are happening at the top and prove yourself the worst. Music! I noticed that the film has two authors on the list. This is the reason why every frame has a song that is the worst "D" style movie. They have never heard of "less is more". It's so painful to listen to me. That is good You have to feel sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley. I'm sure they haven't seen this role in the twilight of their career. See your own risk.
