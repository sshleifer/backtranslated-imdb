In this movie, there are not many stories. It is based on the release of the first episode of the Lion King movie. It should be the way Timon and Pumbaa meet through their loneliness. But it doesn't have anything more than that. <br /> <br /> It's a combination of some scenes from the original, and it pretends that this movie can change them. But still is it? I hope more But all I have to show is an empty plot with a little explanation. <br /> <br /> I guess if you want to see other cats in the Lion King universe This is it But other than that, it is less fair for animators Disney should really stop producing these videos. It's quite boring and can use Jason Statham "D-"
