This is the worst item I've seen for many years. I believe it should be removed from the T.V due to delays. It's very stupid that I can faint when I watch it. (Although I never watched it because it was so bad. SOOOOO) <br /> <br /> Google: When Mac said that he could not eat sugar at the other time, he ate sugar Almost everything in the world has sugar in it !!! In the episode "Eddie Monster" when Eddy screams at Terrance, he falls into the crate twice, plus the time he stays, he doesn't fall. He falls on his side. What folly I can't say Fosters Home. I also make music with my band about how to delay this show. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
