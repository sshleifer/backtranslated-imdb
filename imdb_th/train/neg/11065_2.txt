This movie has a lot of potential. Everyone who follows Jeffrey's story knows that there are many details that are overlooked in this film. Spending too much time and effort on Dahmer's homosexual trend and his alcohol consumption. Where is the character development? The origin of any villain is interesting and Dahmer is no exception. Where is it in this movie that addresses his teenager when he starts killing and destroying small animals? But we give back the recurring events that try to explain the origins of the killer. But could not talk about the important issues in Dahmer's developments His flesh eating and his desire for flesh, etc. I can go on. But to summarize the issues of backwardness in the movie that focuses on his sexuality and not enough blood Of this film is "Dahmer"
