I'm shy to write this review. I said that because you read it, you will know that I am sitting with all things and that is embarrassing to accept even to strangers. But I have to warn those who read the audience's comments about IMDb before they watch the movie. It's the least I can do. This is a bad movie! Believe me. Plot nonsense. The show was not professional. And directing the work of the camera, costume, etc. is the second rate, all let it go.
