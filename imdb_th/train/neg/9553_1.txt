Not surprisingly, this was released directly to DVD in Australia. There was no exchange for features like it used to be. The conversation started, the horrifying performance and the script was sucked !! Anyone who thinks it is a good idea to create a sequel or follow the ultimate film work of John Badham Wargames from the 80s. They have to live in something. Amanda Walsh did well in this story. Because of the visual / love interest, while Matt Lanter performed well as the other main leaders, I would not recommend Wargames: The Dead Code to anyone. Check out the original Wargames hacker or film - both are better than shit this piece !!
