Skip the mission: Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episode instead of the network. Use the 1st and 2nd parts of the Living Legend and stick it in one plot along with the horrifying episode of fire in space. Although Galactica suffers from Network-controlled writing and no time to prepare for the right production. Living Legend is the best TV program of 1978. The light in space belongs to one of the worst episodes. As a historical record, see the Galactica, the original Star Trek and then will revive the Trek Series and you will see the quality differences between the sci-fi produced by the network and the combined sci-fi.
