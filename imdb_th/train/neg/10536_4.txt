William Cooke and Paul Talbot share the director / writer credit for a fun, cheap movie about three boys camping in the woods with a horror magazine. Stand up with fire and mock the students, walk back and forth ... and the homeless people in the city named Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... from Leatherface's reputation) roam around and tell the story of blood in exchange for the warmth of fire <br /> <br /> One story is the compression of the old tread of "The Hook", which is two teenagers in the channel of a lover who was attacked by a murderer with a problem with his hands. Another story has a pair of tokers who want to score some weeds. They stumbled upon a man who knew a man with the best s # @ t. As they smoked two bags of bags, their skin began to turn gray and green before it was bubble and fell. One of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home on Christmas, which could not wait for his mother to die and enjoy telling his grandson and granddaughter about Santa Claus. The story of the fourth fire was a greedy sailor who was sunk on the offensive side about an empty treasure chest and ended up being chased from the sea by zombies. <br /> <br /> Without a big budget. For special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES skips and may be much worse. Looks weird, but fun to watch except for sailors. The show is understandable, not worth it. Members include Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
