I understand what this film tries to convey. Older people are often overlooked and treated as annoyed people, which means that they don't feel worthy and like their lives empty. <br /> <br /> I don't have a problem with this message. But i just feel it May be skipped in a painless manner to see I enjoy good art movies. But when the movie became an art that was conscious (As in this case) The results are usually disappointing. Including pictures of people who are carrying luggage slowly, which takes about 5 minutes, trying to make a point But ultimately making the audience annoying. <br /> <br /> The female characters are very weak and you want to tell them to finish. Pull it together This is a movie that you feel you should enjoy or give a high score, and of course it has advantages. But I was too frustrated to watch this movie to suggest that others might have a deeper message than other Roger Michel movies (for example: 'Notting Hill') but at least that is the movie that You can enjoy watching.
