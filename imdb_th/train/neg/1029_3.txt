My father is a true fan of Columbo and I don't always like acting. I always expressed disdain for acting and told him how bad it was. But he went to see it no less That is his right as an American. I guess. But my feelings were adjusted to the series when I found that Spielberg had directed an important episode. At that time I was grateful that my father bought this item that I couldn't really. I passed his DVD collection and made this happen when I went home to visit the college. My opinion about the overall series is not swinging. But I received respect from Spielberg because he knew that he started with the lowest level director And that is to raise a small baby until the big fish come in The most, although it has only a small amount of Peter Falk But I said that this is the beginning of the series and no one knows how to go with it. Crime offender instead of the investigation of Colombo
