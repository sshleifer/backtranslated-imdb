This series is the CBS network that responds to the success of Big Valley for 90 minutes in the West, as well as the ABC program. While it is the answer, it doesn't have anything to make it past Season 2. <br /> <br /> The real problem has come true in this list. For example, in one episode, Johnny hit his eyes from the bar. Surprisingly, at the end of the show, Johnny was healed. In addition, the story is not close to The Big Valley. <br /> <br /> This is a program that I don't want DVDs and hope they won't be released. Thinking that since CBS is out of stock, they come back to use many familiar settings. This is one of the latest Western series produced while Westerners were not popular in the 1970s.
