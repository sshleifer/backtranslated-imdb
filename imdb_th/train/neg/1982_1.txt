who? What? Where? When? why? The performance was terrible. A lot of robots are being rehearsed. I saw all the actors in this movie in a better role. The screenplay is very easy. At the end of the film, the story is bound and Jeane Claude LaMarre should be bound as well. So he never tried to write / direct other films.
