I expect little from "K-911". I mean, it looks like a cute movie that I can enter. I have always loved dog jokes. But it seems that it should be Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The plot is quite lame and two interesting love stories don't have a starting point. Not to mention that James seems to have an overall female gender perspective in the film, although the fact that the writer did not go in that direction. James just ticked me for more than half the movie. The dog is a true star and sadly they shine. Actors <br /> <br /> So I'm glad that it's not just me on IMDb who agrees that this is a stupid movie But hoped that James would know that it was Jim, his brother, who was capable of being without fault But not everyone who can be their brothers You don't want Ashlee Simpson to use this same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
