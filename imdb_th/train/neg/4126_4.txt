Nothing happened in this thrilling and thrilling thriller directed by Mateo Gil, who is a regular participant of Amenabar. Films related to the effects of boredom and excitement are not helped. Anything and seems to be a boring exercise. The only suspicious moment is the pinnacle of the movie, which takes about 30 seconds of all the pain plus 100 minutes and is too easy to fix. The plot lacks sophistication or reliability, and while traditional thinking, the way in which the story unfolds arbitrarily and every plot device or twisting as a result of external interference. (Deus-ex-machina) The hero is always. Everything happens to him without forcing him to show initiative or wealth. If you're a fan of this type, see "Tesis" instead.
