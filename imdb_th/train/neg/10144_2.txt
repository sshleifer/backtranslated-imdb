When Steven Seagull's movie goes, this movie is at the bottom of the tank. His best is just a fodder for boring teenagers. This one tells the trick, the scales and then falls. The characters are all cardboard. The story is twice as lame. I can't destroy it by telling you the end. You know how all Steven Seagal's films are ended. If you see this, he is a government agent with a superior authority who knows too much to give up, so they decide instead to kill him. To use the brain until he can't remember Of course, he escaped, was arrested and housed by his former generals, who wanted a man of more than a million people to lead a smuggling plane that was handed over to a terrorist gang in Alghero Surprised Segal was trained. Every hero except the character of Segal and his dark girlfriend dies bravely and Steve-Baby saves the whole world in one moment or falls down whatever is done by the Air Force and the Navy and Boom - Lots of boom to get popeye cartoons instead.
