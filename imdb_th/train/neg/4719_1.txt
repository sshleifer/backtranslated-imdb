I just want to say that this production is one-sided, destroying the neutrality needed if you want to be serious. <br /> <br /> There is no credit of the person they interviewed so you can't have the idea that they deserve To hear <br /> <br /> tell a story from a single perspective Doing this is a very dangerous thing because the next generation learns the bad thoughts and that is why the war happened. I know that this is not the only reason of the war. But it doesn't help as well. <br /> <br /> You can watch this documentary. But read on the internet very much before. Balcans are complex according to human history.
