I will tell you what happened. Some people with money think it is good to destroy one of the best programs on TV. Do we need to create a large screen? Are they asking fans? I wonder how all the fans will feel if they do "Rocky Horror Picture Show" together with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland bring out all the songs. Do you think they will like it! This film doesn't have the same feelings that it had ever had. Of course, the original is constantly repetitive. But Bo and Luke are always good. They have problems because they often have problems and their main purpose is to help people walking through the city. There is nothing that is important to the people who created this movie. They may not have seen the original program before. My big question is, what will they destroy next?
