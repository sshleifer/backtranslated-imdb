If you enjoy movies like American Pie, Road Trip & Van Wilder; Avoid denying this film at all costs. It is a waste of untrustworthy resources that are ridiculous and fun that should not be discussed. Save and sell less than unsuspecting consumers. The worst movie I've ever seen in the past 18 months easily. Not good offensive throughout the period of 86 minutes. If longer than this, I will not be able to write this review without profanity Consider yourself a reminder!
