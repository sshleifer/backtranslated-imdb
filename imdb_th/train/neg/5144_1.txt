The orange tone of everything is delightful. Oh, yes. The main character lives in an orange slum with an orange. At the same time, in order to escape from poverty in the body, she played full video games. (Which sucks in the absence of clear rules and no logic in playing games), apparently she has income from playing games But she is revealed that it is not an employee of a game company? Many people who do not speak, stop talking later. The story is slow. She used an unusual orange computer interface with a very annoying operation interface and I wondered if there would be a future release of Microsoft. <br /> <br /> At the moment In the same way, the audience generally asked why she lost precious time in some moronic games when she almost had the necessity of life? Oh yes, playing the game is fun. But what is the point that you almost starve? While she pudded her life away, playing VIP games filled with boring orange orange, her dog ran away. (May look for owners who pay attention and provide food regularly) or own Stolen from women (While she ignores the truth with her lollipop orange) <br /> <br /> While she is obsessed with the game, the team plays her game, disappearing from a movie that is not entirely interesting, gasped So she wants to be the best, the best, go get them. Ash Catchem (to be bored of us all) Golly, this main character, sucks well like a human and doesn't have the feature to redeem, apart from her physical beauty. (Which she can exchange something to escape from the crushing poverty) <br /> <br /> So she reached the "real" level and at least did not suck horribly and she was sent Going to kill the unconscious teammates who are in the "real" level. Eventually, the boring orange lollipop movie is no longer boring. But there is a possibility to say something along the line "The main character is stuck in the poverty created by the imaginary computer, and now she is in the real world." Maybe she will make a murder and live in the real world right now? She killed that man and he disappeared in a special digital manner. Wow! Thanks to the stupid director You suck, then you suck a lot. Director <br /> <br /> Here, the director has a small chance to redeem himself a little by burying this film with the morals of a distorted evil devil. <br /> < br> The director may say "The real world is there, and if you are in it and participate in making it better, it will not be an orange-orange land." The smart way to make this movie a slow rumor lesson. About the basic pride of citizens (for 1% of audiences who have not found something really fun to watch now or be a movie maker) <br /> <br /> Not a director The director must solve all of this by throwing horrible digital effects and destroying the terrifying movie redemption opportunity that loses money, wastes time and loses confidence of the audience. <br /> <br /> After that, it ended very well. I hope the director will choke. I placed this hack on the list. "Avoid all costs" for other movies that his name is also attached to.
