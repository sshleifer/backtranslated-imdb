No plot in this movie ... no character development ... no climax ... nothing, but there are a few good fighting scenes that are quite good. So you go there ... Overall, it's a bad movie. But if you like a silly flick that has nothing but good action scenes then watch this movie. Don't expect anything more than that. Acting at that time and the direction is not bad .. Two pendants from Kimbo and Carano ... I'm looking for Carano a little more in this movie .. She's a good fighter And a really hot girl .... white is an excellent martial arts artist and a good actor I hope he will get a better movie in the future so that we can really enjoy his art .. Imagine the movie White and Jaa together ... That would be great.
