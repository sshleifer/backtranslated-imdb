This movie is quite bad. The performance is profound and completely enforced. Moreover, filming movies as a docudrama does not need to make it more convincing. You will not be able to get out of that easily. This movie, because it causes clarity about psychology or psychology that is not behind the perpetrators of such crimes. However, the important point of this film is absolutely rubbish! There is no other way to bring it! It's pure and simple, can't catch any sense of atmosphere! What happened did not translate any feelings of hopelessness, fear, fear or fear to experience in such a terrible situation. Not at all. It causes you to have a lower jaw. Spilled out of your tongue and you are not haunted by the actions of these boys. You just feel embarrassed for another movie that starts with potential. But ended up falling on the face in the most important point. Zero Day of course .... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
