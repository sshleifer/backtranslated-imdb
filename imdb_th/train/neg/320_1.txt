With Adam Sandler <br /> <br /> There's no doubt that it's one of the most stupid movies ever created. It's about a barque waitress. Shecky (Sandler) wants to be a comedian on a cruise ship. First of all, there is no funny or clever line in all movies honestly. It was a disgusting thing. It was distressing. There is not much rude or sexual humor, but the f-word has a lot. The budget is very low and that makes this movie break down. It happened on a cruise ship. But they seem to have money to rent a small boat and only 10 boats, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. I hate this movie and others who see it will hate it as well. <br /> <br /> 86 minutes. Rate R for language
