... even though the movie seems to be trying to market itself as a horror movie But still lacking clear blood. <br /> <br /> There is also a lack of skills in directing, editing and Writing a screenplay <br /> <br /> Jeremy London is one of the most exciting performances I've ever seen - "Descent from the Holocaust" of madness makes him aware and clumsy Oh, look at him! Oh, look at him to drink the spirits! Oh look, he lifted his eyebrows and pointed his head in a cheerful corner! Oh, look at the dark hair that is not his shower! Oh, listen to his husky voice! He must be an artist / writer / genius who has been tortured! Oh yes, the poet's shirt came out - it was another boy who thought he was Byron (or Poe.) Oh, because of love ... someone gave this guide about "How to do good" or not. They pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere, a plastic toy, a small reward that is dead in cancellation. Brand of trash bargain cereals Okay, that's a silly story - but that's because the London performance makes my brain melt with horror. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is cute and greatly increased. But still not growing in her performance shoes This film - she sent her a chapter as if she were being held in reality. All of her performances were made of wood, she posed as though she was a character - who knows, maybe she had a reaction. Respond But if that is the case, she will do it too far. <br /> <br /> The outstanding character is Arie Verveen as Poe - while his character's role is confused, he shows the best work. He is quite simple. But it is even more - he has some depth. I believe he has a life that is superior to the depressing two-dimensional quality of the remaining characters. Probably because I like Poe and I get lost and invent while he is on the screen, regardless of whether he has any other interest factors. <br /> <br /> The remaining characters are blurred, faceless - with caricatures. Normal All: Blushing blonde, best friend who is a bit of a dirty woman; Local police who were hit hard An old man who protects that might be too interested in our heroine. Witches, old plans, etc., etc. yaw yawn <br /> <br /> as well as problems 'The lack of blood clearly for horror movies' does not have any topics they mention. (And the characters in London say horribly - in the attack of Pau's writing) on. As other critics say - there is potential here: murder, incest, - truly shocking things But they fled from those problems and cut off from violence (Candle sticks that lift up and swing in the air) --- cut into black! This is the original horror story of Noirish. Actually it is expected to be loved and loved when it happens - it is a love map, especially when accompanied by a lightning bolt forging offspring. As clumsy or as editors easily at the last minute and cutting it off) This may be a very stressful psychological thriller - horror of palingenesis / delusion / madness - The simple (and fun) movie slasher: it tries to be both, or not. (What's new and exciting!) But it's completely failed. The only horror element of this movie is the most dull. <br /> <br /> I think the editor (if any) must be drunk when he / she chooses this thing. - There is a slow prediction. Scene; The scene seems to be a mess. (But that may be a bad script) LIew for the director and the director of the picture - there are some strange pictures and frames that I think are a tribute to Hitchcock or Browning, but just ended up being stupid. (Re-adjusted in noir But this is another attempt. <br /> <br /> The whole thing can be funny. (In the way that previous investigators talked about - "OMG, how did this happen?!?") If I had the trash trash - but unfortunately for me, I sat down on the sofa with low light with intention. Fervently to make yourself stupid - this is a terrible movie and I'm afraid that I won't recommend it to anyone else even. For laughs <br /> <br /> Please, please don't waste time or money on this matter - whether it's borrowing horror movies or real thriller or searching for a copy of Poe's strange story Any way 'will have a more enjoyable and frightening night than you ever expected to succeed in this garbage.
