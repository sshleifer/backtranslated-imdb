The Class is a comedy that shows the former 27-year-old classmate. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​acting. That is why I regret that The Class is not funny, although it has clear potential. It's not enough. (Haha.) This is because of the slow rhythm and lack of real hilarious punch lines. Some actors have problems with timing show On the other hand, the characters that I find not the most interesting are the main characters of Ethan and the Duncan couple and Nicole who used to be in the past. Series Was chosen as his accent (Although the character is not respectable But anyway)
