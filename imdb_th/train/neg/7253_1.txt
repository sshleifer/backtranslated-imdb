We rented a DVD to look forward to getting good Westerners. This movie is pretty cute and the scene is reasonable. But the idea is terrible This is my problem with movies. <br /> <br /> At first, why the bad guy killed the mine owner. Not really linked to movies, except to prove that he is a bad person and has a refuge At least let us guess. No character development at all for bank owners or bank employees. <br /> <br /> A long delay in what happened. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous evidence Martin still wants to see Judge after The gang confessed to killing the villain. More ridiculous that he confessed and decided not to listen to the sheriff. More nonsensical than Martin hung him and the rope broke. Then the sheriff took him to the end, eventually heading back to his town and helping his wife from a bad banker. Will he not just come back after sending a gang quickly to help his wife and arrest a bank criminal? Just send a message to the judge that the gang confessed before being killed on the path ???? !!! Overall, the show was very sad and didn't point to the movie.
