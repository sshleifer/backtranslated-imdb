This is the worst movie I've ever watched in my life. It may be the worst movie. Some movies are so bad that they are good. This movie is so bad that it has gone through a fun camp and it's so bad. It is anti-enantiodromia We bought it with the intention of being happy and everyone in my family gathered around to have fun. But we sat in a terrifying silence, pitying the poor sellers. This is worse than Lord of the Rings. It's worse than Matrix. The sequel is worse than Krull. It's worse than every Batman movie. <br /> <br /> Don't let this movie go Approaching within ten feet Your TV
