At one point when it seems to be interesting, it never got there. <br /> <br /> People will change from one point to another without any point (if it is very boring). No action, no suspense or horror, and the character does not have a good heart, therefore ignoring what happened to them. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring. <br /> <br /> All I gave it a 3/10. <br /> <br /> I like that it doesn't shake. - work and if there is a song it doesn't disturb me like a movie that is not really good and the performance is not terrible.
