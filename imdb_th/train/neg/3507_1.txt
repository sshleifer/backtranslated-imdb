The lowest point in human interaction by Maysles Brothers with this film Remember that you use words like "Masterpiece" in this film review that these Maysles creeps didn't happen, just drive to Hampton. No, when they find these two poor people, they have to use the funds in their projects. (And imagine that they told people to sell the project) then they were friends with two very weak women There is no meeting of the mind here or the true involvement. These compassionate Maysles smile, kiss, kiss, do what they need to get Beales to cooperate and take advantage of them fiercely as they did Who would like to think that these businessmen have the wrong thoughts and repent from time to time? But the process of creating movies from pre-planning, real filming and editing takes a very long time, and their goal is not a requirement for Beales's involvement as a human film about exploitation by people's vices. Over time, the reputation of making their films has been seriously stained by what they do here. Their reputation as human beings can be done. That is what people will remember them. Businesswoman
