I went to see this with great expectations. It's quite a pity that the conversation is the most stupid, and overall the film is far from fear or interest. Even children can see the missing logic of character behavior. Today's children need creative stories that will inspire them, which will make them 'daydreaming' about the event. That's what happened to movies like E.T and Star Wars a decade ago. (How many children have imagined being a Jedi Knight and igniting their own lights?) Seriously.
