It happened to Assault on Prescient 13 in 2005. It happened to The Lost Boys in 2008 and now it happens to another classic from the 80s. Wargames ... :( Why, why? Why not Hollywood? Why not? learning? only one ... ! They can't remade ... They suck .... We all hate them ....!. <br /> <br /> You guys didn't see the original 1983 version with Matthew Broderick & Ally. Sheedy, go to rent / buy now .... !! Hardware may look old, special techniques are not the new millennium. But still beating this junk hand .... <br /> <br /> For those of us who lived in the 80s when the hacking was sexy, the internet was a mystery and your disk came in a form. 8 inch floppy. Now we have the intelligence to avoid this movie, such as a war of war! br /> <br /> Never before "Good chess game" looks better ....
