This movie is offered to everyone. Not successful at any level. Performing is a scary story and raising long boring children. They are clearly seen from the length of the ending sex scenes that are trying to be shocking. But ended up mocking what the film was aiming for Complete garbage. I can't believe that this movie is laughing The problem is that there is no adult to stick to this movie because this movie plays an interesting episode of OC or something that is aimed at a poor teen
