This review doesn't contain spoilers because everything has been shown in the movie trailer. I try to be balanced in my review because I support many local movies. But i can't help But support the backlash with this movie It was slow, boring and pointless. Even "almost good and reliable moments" were immediately cut off with old ideas and bad performances. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, which I always loved only through Only in this movie It feels like the director is trying to make a TV that looks so fascinating and then taken away and decided to put it on the big screen. The Leap Years should come with a RA rating (bad rating). But it didn't change my beliefs in local movies Good movies will arrive as long as this movie is not created.
