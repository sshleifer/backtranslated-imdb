I will give a quick summer of movies: rude rotten boy named Max stumbles on a radio with Kazaam: rapper, he has 3 wishes While he is dealing with bullies and dads mixed in a systematic crime During this time, Kazaam occasionally raps. (Demonstrating Shaq's ramping skills) <br /> <br /> This film proves what we all know. I agree that it never seems like a worthy movie for the Oscars. But everything about this movie scrap is terrible. The character is unique or stupid. The plot is not worth talking about the conversation as a joke and Shaq is only one of the four problems. Hell, though, Denzel Washington will play Kazaam. This movie is still a joke. I know that this movie has attracted everyone because Shaq is so big. I can't think of what to say about it. Shaq should take the time to create this movie to practice the free throw
