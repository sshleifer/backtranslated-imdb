This is the type of movie that made me the most disappointed. Great actors, excellent directors, great potential. Then they destroyed it all with a screenplay nowhere ... and didn't say anything while going there! There is no depth here, no depth of character, depth of plot, surprise, doubt or common sense. We know what happened, we were told how they planned to solve the problem, they solved the problem, threw surprise to us near the end, which could not create a doubt. > On the positive side, Glenn Ford is a British actor. All wonderful (and one French) people work impressive with one-dimensional writing they receive. Herbert Walton, one of the true favorites, is "Old Charlie", who gives humor and warmth to dark and serious movies. I still think that this movie has a great look ... all the shadows and fog ... Film Noir's feelings <br /> <br /> Even though the actors do the best job possible It's not enough for me to recommend spending time watching movies. There are better movies of Glenn Ford: The Big Heat, Gilda, Affair in Trinidad, etc.
