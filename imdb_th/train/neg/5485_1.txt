Without emphasizing the things mentioned above about this movie, I would like to add that I am looking forward to watching this movie ... actors / venues and works of great director Michael Winterbottom etc. ... it has a vague shadow 'Don't look now' about the story from the beginning. Being in a different environment (Italy again) to reduce the heartache of losing ... or maybe that's the way I see So I sat there to wait for the story to unravel and revolve around what we expected to happen to this family in a European country abroad .... and I sat there and sat there .... And guess what? Nothing actually happens! And I mean nothing !! You are not given the opportunity to become a character because it has a lot of dimension and nonsense .. You get the belief from the rhythm of the movie that there is something that will happen to turn the whole movie into the head ... The eldest daughter, who flirts with the local Vespa boy, has a good scope for bringing this movie in a different direction. The youngest daughter of her deceased mother ends in a futile exercise. His father was pointless trying to lure one of his female students. Feeling ridiculous when his age It feels as though the script has the last recall when they decide at the last minute to get rid of the courage in the story and walk in sequence to the minimum without any impact when the credit starts to spin. (Unexpectedly) You can't help but feel that you have been robbed when you use it to sit and watch this garbage dump.
