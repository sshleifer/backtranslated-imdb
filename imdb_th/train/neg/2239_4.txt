The plot has already been explained by other investigators, so I will add that my reason for seeing this movie is to see Gabrielle Drake in her undeniable glory. <br /> <br / > Miss Drake must be the sexiest and cutest example of "posh totty" that has been determined to be celluloid. In the age and her family, only Jane Asher was equally beautiful. What is it about actors and brothers, musicians? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who like me admire Gabrielle, her scenes in this movie will not disappoint. She has a beautiful shape and no part of the imagination. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is terrible and is a matter of time. The music that covers the open credit seems to continue forever and scary.
