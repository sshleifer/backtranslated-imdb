Not too enthusiastic about this. The story is quite gruesome and unreliable. I was happy during the first 10 minutes charging a good nun. After that it was scary. Tim is not suitable for this role, he came in as an exaggerated self in himself. It is an ideal movie and as a musician feels a bit offended after watching it. There was no scene of training or playing with his band mates in 1900. He was completely self-indulgent. I find it difficult to relate to characters like this. Maybe I will see the wrong movie. If you do not have a passion for life or a sense of things about music, you should indulge in unbelief and watch this waffle happily.
