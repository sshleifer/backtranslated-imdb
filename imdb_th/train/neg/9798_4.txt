15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the programs that swept the country, especially youth groups. When I was a 3 year old boy living in the Philippines, I would watch this program every Friday on ABS-CBN channel (Channel 2 right there). When the movie was released in 1995, it was shocking and shocked me. Watching movies with 2 father and uncle. My grandparents sent a box of "Balikbayan" filled with Power Rangers (including the easy-to-create Megazord and Rangers stuffed toys). I also played video games and loved one. In ( "MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which is really sad. However, it was a show that made me feel interested about the robot series. (Especially the Mech anime series such as "Gundam"). Now I'm 18 years old. I want to think that this performance is quite wonderful for me. To prove this, I traveled down the memory channel by buying 2 sets of DVDs with "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" and watching both of them. "Ugh, terrible, just a trash can under the roof for me" for everyone in my generation. This is not a performance that you want to watch over and over again. I'm not saying that I will leave it for the rest of your life. But sometimes it's not bad right now, right? Instead of "Power Rangers", I recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam" (highly recommended), "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (aka Ninja Robot) or even the original Sentai that is the basis of "Power Rangers "
