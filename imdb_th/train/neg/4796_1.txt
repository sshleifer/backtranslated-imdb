I love John Saxon in everything he had once he took a camera position, even though he directed a movie that should have a more appropriate name. "Please do not watch this movie called: Zombie Death House." The $ 1,000 shock insurance certificate is loved by Fred Olen Ray. The tricky way to make you spend 14 dollars on filming the movie that was filmed. By the 70s cheese legend, Ray is a retromedia man. Ray, along the way, makes the Charles Band look hotter than the stucco ceiling on the Ford Falcon. Just worse now, they are both boring and beyond. It's great that Ray is digging this old thing, and in some cases it's a public domain, like the rest of the dollar hucksters video, but in the case of Zombie Death House- (the word "Zombie" is overwhelming to increase ownership. And the interest in this part of the goods) The only way to provide services to this trip is to publish it on the dollar market for the bizarre collection and fans of the crusaders !!! If you want to see real crusaders, choose to buy Black Christmas, Nightmare on Elm Street or The Glove.
