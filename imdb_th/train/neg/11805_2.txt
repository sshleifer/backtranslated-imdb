See the original with the same name from 1944! This thing is made for TV movies. It's so great! Even if it is used (As far as I can tell) is almost the same conversation But it doesn't work! Is it a bad show or governance? OK, so it was made for the TV. But why look at a bad copy when you can get a wonderful original? Especially when you are robbed of the story and don't enjoy the original as much as you watched it for the first time! <br /> <br /> There is something different from the original. (Shortened one time) but all is worse! Actors play different parts here, just don't fit the bill! You just don't believe them and who will lead the Edward G. Robinsons performance from the original? If you want to just watch it after you have seen the original and then you will be very brave if you watch it! It's almost sacred!
