Oh my God .. the worst SH * T I've seen. This is the main idea that came into my mind immediately after watching the movie. And I do not understand anyone who has the opposite legend Although the idea may be good But miserable results I mean, what is the role of H. Graham in the past? In my opinion, it has destroyed all the positive intent of the manufacturer. The characters play in a way that is affected and annoying. Every time you appear, be warned that you are watching a movie and are destroying the spirit of that moment. Then the whole movie, because most of the time you see that there is a stupid face with her silly effort To create a mood TERRIBLE, do not waste time
