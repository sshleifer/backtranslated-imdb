OK, I know that many people may not be satisfied with this criticism because Watership Down is "classic" and is a part of most people's childhood. But watching this movie for the first time at the age of 18, I have to admit: I really hate it. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie because my sister read the book and enjoyed it a lot and many people Who mourned the word "Watership Down" - their memories of seeing this movie as Children and have their emotions torn at the seams - suggesting it speak straightly. I hope I will not pay attention. I give benefits to the question. In general, I don't like to stop watching movies half way. This is an exception. It was sad and distressing and tragic. This movie may be the slowest thing I've ever seen. (Imagine a snail that contains dopants in space) and actually "don't do it". For me, art is fine. The backgrounds are well designed if not gentle and tweets. But the rabbit is not very loved and the animation is quite scary and not good. <br /> <br /> I will not talk about many details about the story; In general, it is a story of a group of rabbits leaving the rabbit because of human infiltration in the area. In general, it is about morals about the threat of human interaction to the environment. It uses human rabbits to send messages. For me, I hope they get gas, not because I am a sadistic person. But because the characters are not boring, annoying, boring and boring (In general, I am a very poor Englishman) I found that I was watching the clock all the time while watching movies and it took about 20 minutes before anything actually happened and even though it was a cancer that was worth it. Very scared. <br /> <br /> If I receive praise In any way, I must admit that the idea of ​​showing children the dangers of building in the countryside and hope that the revelation of human arrogance and others is a fairly good meaning. Maybe it is general and it's a declaration. But the message that tries to bring out is good in nature The music score is not bad too. <br /> <br /> So to conclude that this movie is quite bad. I can't watch all the way, or I might be forced to eat my own legs. True, it's not a "torque" that isn't good, but it doesn't give a high score in my eyes, so I give 2/10 points. <br /> <br /> Hope it helps.
