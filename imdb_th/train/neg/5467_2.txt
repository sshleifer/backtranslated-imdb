What to say about this movie It's about good students who have drugs and become unpaid students who sell drugs to more people. Two people had side effects when becoming a detoxifier and his girlfriend threw creatures that grew up in the school's basement. That was all about it and they stretched it out for 84 minutes. This movie is quite bad and should be locked forever. Although not fair But some people like to watch Troma's movies and they can watch if they want. The movie for me Troma is the worst movie there. I just watched this thing out of unusual curiosity.
