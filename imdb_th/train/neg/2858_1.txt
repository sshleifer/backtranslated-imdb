This is one of the worst movies of all time. The graphics are awesome. Performing as a b-effect movie and effects is just a feature of Nintendo 64. You will think that they will use a little more effort. Of course, it's a Scifi movie, so you have to expect it to have a low rate. But this one requires a cake Hey i still laugh So as you shake in this unbelievable movie, well done. <br /> <br /> Although there are some well-known actors and actresses. But it's hard for me to believe that they don't realize that the quality of this movie is worth the time and effort. <br /> <br /> The graphics may be good in '60's or even the early' 70's but will open. In 2009! I will not leave the spoiler. If you play "Jurassic Park" on the Nintendo 64, you will be familiar with what you see in this movie. <br /> <br /> Not worth the 2 hours.
