When the theater staff found an old film roll, they decided to screen at the midnight of the Night of the Living Dead screenings. Unfortunately, it is actually a Nazi mind control experiment that turns viewers into unconscious zombies. <br /> <br /> I don't understand the hatred of this movie. It is a low independent production budget that has a lot of camps. But it is not appropriate. "1.1" Here in IMD, it's very fun. Clearly, the filmmakers have the knowledge and love in a sensible horror movie and they create a tribute to entertain them by Reference and show respect for them in a variety of ways It has a sense of things like Night of the Living Dead (in many ways, very similar), Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness and many more. <br /> <br /> I like the description of zombies though. Actually, hypnotizing, thinking that they are zombies, actually having the physical attributes of an unbelievable creature, perhaps possible. But I thank the writer's efforts to explain The blood effect is appropriate for the budget, the correct show and the story is fun. <br /> <br /> I like it.
