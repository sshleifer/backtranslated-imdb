Ooof! This one has a foul odor. It doesn't fall somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller. Of course, in reality, it's all somewhere between the cracks of Wham! The video and Captain EO only have a very small budget and the more ugly teenagers cry All from the last 3 albums of Roxy Music. A short clip from Barbarella adds nothing. Avoid all costs. (Anyway, I like when they play 'Hungry Like The Wolf', but why is there a tiger lurking in the audience that turns into a tiger-drawn woman? I mean, they didn't sing 'Eye of the Tiger' or 'Hungry like a tiger'. It's Wolf! Whatever the video, the 80-year-old DVD of Duran Duran might be worth looking at because of the nostalgia.
