Last week I just watched "28 weeks later" which was very good. After that, I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> I told you that it is one of the most boring horror movies you have ever seen The scene is unrealistic. There are no scripts and no planning. The alien life is not true. And the fighting scene is not as intense as the battle in the school field And to make it worse, the man named Cody has a dirty, uncontrollable tongue that distracts the main movie. <br /> <br /> I forgot about it for 28 weeks. <br /> <br Cheers, Mesake C.
