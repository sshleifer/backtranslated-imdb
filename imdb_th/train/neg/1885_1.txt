If you are looking for this movie, it shows the existence of a ridiculous and boring middle class on a website that has no communication and false ideals. This is the movie for you. If you are a person who participates in movies and preserves your interests, you should look elsewhere. There are many movies that do much better. For example, try a dark movie by Bergman. The filmmaker felt that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class, he should let the audience face annoying and ridiculous events after the next event until the movie ended with confusion. If you focus on your time, there is a better way to spend two hours, such as cleaning your house.
