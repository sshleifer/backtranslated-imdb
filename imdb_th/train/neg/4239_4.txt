This is a movie that is better than the average I think because it uses a cable. I expect to have something in tune with the beautiful melodies and bad special effects seen in classics such as Christmas Rush or First Daughter / Target / Shot etc. <br /> <br /> Actors Well selected Ron Livingston as a SWAT commander who is under heavy pressure It is good to see him revisit the original content that he had many fortune in the Band of Brothers, the producer and designer, doing homework because of scenes and images like that in 1997. The opportunity to watch this movie and I'm sure you will because FX repeats everything 50 times ... spend 2 hours and enjoy it.
