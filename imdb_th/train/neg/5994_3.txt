OK .. this movie is good! Every model has touched Thunderbird and Love and this film has some features to look for in a good Thunderbird movie. The ship itself and Tracey Island were seamlessly transferred to the big screen while still maintaining the style that we fell in love. Sophia Miles was a great person like Lady P. and Bill Paxton, while I was not the one who thought That Jeff Thrace was hard enough ... but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 200 tons of flying machines. <br /> <br /> It's not really true. That this film has a center The kids make me feel Jonathon Frakes slap me with a wet fish and laugh with my hard-earned money for. In this film, it is true that Alan Tracy is a very disgusting person in this film and it seems that he can fly his machinery and his brothers ... at least 19/20. It is a simple machine that is cute, cute. If this is the case, <br /> <br /> The film seems to be unaware that it is serious or serious. It tries to show respect while taunting and in general, his face is flattened. 3/10 (2 for machines, 1 for Lady P)
