This film proves that you can't judge a movie with great art on the DVD cover. It also shows that you should learn more about movies before you buy. (Or buy for someone during Christmas) The beginning of this movie looks quite promising Until you meet the character of the Pumpkin Jack (old man from the street), bring a textbook filled with witchcraft that he left at their annual haunted house. (Which is the filming location) after that there was drinking, fighting and soft porn Then the action of the movie took place after an hour The best with a group of friends who have nothing to do better because it is a good movie to make fun And for the first time audience, it was very fun to predict the order of the dead
