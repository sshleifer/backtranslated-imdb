Why do I waste 1.5 hours to watch this? Why does this movie happen? Why am I commenting on this movie? <br /> <br /> One reviewer said that this film has patience to watch and it's not for everyone. I can't know who this movie is for. Perhaps after releasing acid, some people can see this and make some sense out of it. It is not intermittent, not experimental. It is plain and simple. This film doesn't have any plot. When you think you have something, <br /> <br /> I think the ending leads to the final conclusion of the film. (Without pun), viewers will see what happens I do not think to put spoilers here, not that it is important. This movie is another story that should not be missed in the movie world.
