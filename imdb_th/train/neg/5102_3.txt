Nicole Eggert has been identified as the star of this story, despite Micheal Dorn & Stacey Keach being a bigger star than her. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a bit of the movie "Alien land on Earth". Eggert plays the role. Is a girl who regrets the aliens being chased by soldiers and using the fleeing creatures in her sexy disguise A little nudity and some nudity is a pointless sex scene. Everything consists of <br /> <br /> The film stumbles upon the obvious scenes and runs about showing photos. I quite like Star Trek's joke when Michelle Nord is taken and he has a really cool death scene. <br /> <br /> It's very clear that Stacey Keach will be taken over and this film is quite. The weak ending is good to show that aliens have special abilities with Eggert.
