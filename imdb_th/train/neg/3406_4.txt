Space Camp, which has the unfortunate luck to plan during the Challenger accident, deserves such luck. "Stars" is a mockery of the performance of Lea Thomson. Actually, it was turned to the side when asked more. Her innocent smile is wider than usual. Sometimes movies are hilarious when they start asking you too much. The little boy holds a multi-million dollar robot in his wardrobe which is broken when receiving too many orders from the hordes of fellow dormitories. The punched and unattractive machine "Jinx" is a big player in the ridiculous location of the movie, which seems to be part of the short circuit in 2001 by the plane team. I'm not bored with this, enough to say that you can only laugh when faced with it. Having said that, all this is fun to watch in SeaQuest, recorded by Bell method. Romance and technology, careful, unbelievable as well. In addition, if you are crazy about the age of eighty years, it should not be missed for the fun performances of Kate Capshaw (Willie from the Temple of Doom) and Lea Thompson. In addition, Joaquin Phoenix also avoids being a true fan. Of Goonie, who is a friend with Jinx. Don't approach this movie if you're not a trash fan.
