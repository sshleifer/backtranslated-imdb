Good movies are original. Some stories may leave messages or touch you in some way. But sometimes you are not in the mood like that. <br /> <br /> I need something simple. Don't think easily when I watch this thing. It starts from good and is quite fun, so why is a bad review? Eventually the movie loses credibility. The story is not magical at all. That action is not too special. But overall good, the performance is ok, more than enough to meet my needs But everyone was ruined because of what happened at the top and it gave me a bad feeling. They should take a little extra effort to make everything reliable and get ranked 7th in the category "Don't just think of simple actions." So in conclusion, if you know that you are frustrated because of various things. Happened that seemed completely irrational: don't look! Otherwise, I would say that go ahead ...
