In making movies, straddling the prequels and the "real" trilogy of Star Wars, taxpayers, even the best filmmakers .... Mr. Lucas is not a filmmaker. <br /> <br / > To show the collapse of The good people in the dark want good actors ... Mr Christensen is not that actor. <br /> <br /> During the first 60-80 minutes, boring is boring, with only a few pockets. Lack of knowledge, because you know that any of the main characters who survived the original Star Wars are very valuable now and the best idea is Jar Jar Binks! <br /> <br /> There is no movie that can be picked up by the opening of the Jedi Prime Minister and has a wonderful (long) sequence at Lava Falls.
