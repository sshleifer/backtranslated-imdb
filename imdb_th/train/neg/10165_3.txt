San Francisco is a big city with great performances. Here, the filmmakers do not try to use the city. They do not handle the most realistic basic details. So I wouldn't recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a San Francisco movie. You won't think "Oh, I've been there." You have to think of "firetrap / starm, a double-deck armpit, how to become a quiet hotel lobby." Deviate, but the performance is always talented. <br /> <br /> The story seems to have been taken in three different ways, at least at first. The story of Chinatown is most effective and interesting. The story is weak and lacking scenes for scenes from the action-packed Hong Kong movie. The manuscript has more tension and emotional resonance. They have better frame and walk. But the performance was fun and we saw James Hong and other experts. <br /> <br /> Inmate, a pointless white boy I think the filmmakers don't know what to do about it, so they let it have a loose structure and cut it down. Father is a strange attempt at Berkeley's liberalism - in fact everyone knows. That it is not "groovy" to live in a slum - but his group is the most funny They throw a good chance away. Educated and bitter on the west coast, yuppie jerks here are jerky, yuppie, a different kind than they do in New York. They are unbearable. But will always distinguish That's very interesting This is not <br /> <br /> The Hunter's Point is the most disappointing. It is the most derivative of the three and the most stylistic rhetoric from San Francisco. You've seen it done before and you've seen it do better. Even video games are still better! <br /> <br /> Although not a general script and pointless But these characters have potential, talented actors and interesting things, start to force them to walk in the clumsy direction ... about ten minutes before the end. Good ideas are in the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> PS There are missing minorities here. See if you can guess.
