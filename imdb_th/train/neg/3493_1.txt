I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com, but I was reminded to remind viewers that this movie is terrible. Very bad. I like Shaw Bros. movies (I'm not a hate person) and I have high expectations for this because I found that it appeared on the website. "10 Best Kung Fu Movies / Martial Arts" (Now I believe that 10 of the best programs are cutting and pasting). First, there is no action in the movie, mostly consisting of talking about The story, which is a great song because it's the thinnest. And his own actions may be impressive in 1978, but it is a routine according to today's standards. Special warning for Netflix users: The DVDs they shipped are terrible.
