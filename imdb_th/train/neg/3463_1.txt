I watched this movie the night before and I have to say honestly that it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The performance is fair. But the whole story is ridiculous The killer was born because "The energy used to make a movie" and if the film is burnt, the killer will die, right? Is an unbelievable way The character was developed to say the least ... For example, suddenly the man said "You didn't try to finish the movie because your mother couldn't do it?" So should we go along with this? We didn't know that it was her daughter until halfway through the movie. This movie doesn't appeal to anyone. We don't know anything about the main survivors, except the character of Ringwal is a great actress. Being a director like her mother. Not really diving to know who they are. It seems that things will be rushed to the carnage. The whole story is too weak for my taste and I am extremely disappointed. Anyone who likes this shit must learn one or two things about making movies. I can't believe that anyone will agree to star or even work on this image. It's not a joke. It's not scary and very funny for the whole movie. I find myself predicting what will happen before each scene, believing that you are not difficult to do. It's a shame and I am deeply sorry. I wasted one and a half hours watching the clutter. 1/10
