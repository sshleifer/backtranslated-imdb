This film is built with many large stars that are beyond me. This film is a movie with the most ancient ideas that are the worst and the worst performances that these actors do It really surprised me that these stars in program A will agree with this movie. What's even worse is the fact that nearly 100 million facts have occurred here in the United States. It shows that the big star can pull the coin even though this movie is very bad. I feel sorry for everyone involved in this snoring. Billy Crystal tried his best with what he received and it seemed that other stars would walk through the movement. No matter what you do, don't fall in with a great actor because no one can help this.
