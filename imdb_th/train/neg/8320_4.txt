After watching the wake, I brought to a conclusion: the director and screenwriter Joby Harold woke up with the intention of laughing at the audience because of the simple truth. This movie is full of laughable elements. Absurd and ridiculous elements (For example, the hospital's set of main characters use ... the ghost of the doctor left on the floor?) The idea behind this film is slightly creative. But all holes and The ridiculous thing makes this story a stupid and mocking movie, except for Lena Olin. The great, all actors bring bad performances away. Hayden Christensen has a non-zero expression. The role woke up, laughing with the audience. It's ridiculous and full of ridiculous things that it is impossible to do seriously. My advice is: skip this crappy movie.
