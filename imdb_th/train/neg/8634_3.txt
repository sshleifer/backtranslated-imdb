Seeing a photo of a man who had been attacked by zombies makes me hope that Lucio "Zombi" Fulci may be his old tricks. The story of the murder of a wealthy man and a daughter's quest to find out who killed him. No characters are attracted and when you know how they do it (At least it's cool) You stop paying attention. The only good thing I can say is it's more reasonable than the Nightmare concert!
