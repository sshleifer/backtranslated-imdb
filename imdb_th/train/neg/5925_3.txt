Is this a "bad" episode of Star Trek TOS? At least it may have been my vote as below. 5. I mean now, making the feeling absolutely not bad. See something that makes you crazy Let me take a break. Now there are also different feelings to the music, with the initiative almost forced to increase the feeling of suffering until the point that it sucks. Send Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, creatures that are higher like Triskelion or anything. In addition to Medusin, these are very boring aliens, genuine, saying his famous phrase, "He's dead, Jim" Spock wears protective glasses when sending an envoy. But Kirk did not do them through the unconscious "obstruction" that is now the third time I remember boring. At least the third season of the next episode is "Specter Of The Gun" and "Day of The Dove" and others that will follow. Trek is an item to watch in the organization that will choose people like me as a big fan. A private survey, Trek, likes to use purple as a purple-pink color, just like in the corridor outside the normal gray walkway, now purple. We never had a purple bridge. But it looks interesting. I noticed it in many episodes. It's done by a light filter and it works very well. But now in the way of navigation is quite lame
