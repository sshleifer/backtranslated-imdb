When I read most other comments, I felt that it was too glowing for this movie. I found that it had completely disappeared. The spark found in the previous Zatoichi movie and just proved that after a long hiatus from the screen, it was always best to let things go. I agree with Star's comparison. Trek from other reviewers comparing the FIRST Star Trek movie to the original series --- millions of excited fans are waiting and waiting and waiting for the return of the show and being forced to look gentle. The original estimation <br /> <br /> The plot is sometimes incomprehensible. It is a terrifying blood (although the newest Zatoichi of Beat Takeshi has a lot of blood) and lacks the original heart. I didn't mind blood. But some may be closed by (Especially the scene where the nose was torn and the head that was cut). In addition, when Ichi did not work well - he looked like a broken man and sad in this movie (Even more than usual) - and that's what fans of the series might not want to see. <br /> <br /> This is a very sad return for Zatoichi unless you are like. I want to see all the movies in Sato-ichi. View previous or all new versions 2003
