I have many expectations from this film and many more since being a Yashraj movie. <br /> <br /> Jimmy runs the information center and one day he is invited by Pooja Singh to teach the boss Lakhan Singh, England. Both fell in love and decided to flee, but Pooja said she couldn't do this when Jimmy owed Lakhan Singh, who is known as Bhaiyyaji, but they decided and stole money. From And then, Jimmy knew that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh was a donor. Meanwhile, Bhaiyyaji hired Bachchan Pandey to follow Jimmy and Pooja. <br /> <br /> Starring Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, director of Viay, is the first film director, Krishna Acharya and produced by Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The scenery is good and Kareena. Kapoor (and her revealing weight loss) looks good, but the story is slim. And sometimes there is no meaning from one scene to another - why do I say at first that I expect more from this movie because it is Yashraj Production? Unfortunately, there is no single song that I can remember at the time <br /> <br /> There was a time when people laughed and thanked Akshaye Kumar and Saif for doing better, while Kareena Kapoor showed her a good role. But this cannot be said for Anil Kapoor - it doesn't suit him as a villain. Finally, it doesn't matter. Aditya Chopra, which in the past had produced and directed good movies such as "Mohabbatein" What does Yash Chopra do by creating a junk movie like this? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The movie is not good, not worth it to waste time and that is my first and last impression.
