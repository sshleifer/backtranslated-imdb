Suddenly I woke up and realized that I was rolling down on the plastic sofa cover and knew that it was a warm Saturday afternoon. Why i sleep Am I hitting my head? Or intend to swallow the muscles of Grandma relax? It may be an adult that has symptoms of narcolepsy? <br /> <br /> No, I stopped for a moment on Cheap Seats while surfing the channel and lacking the sense of humor and ability to make my life run out of speed. I'm black. <br /> <br /> It is the head, shaking, gaping, shoulder, shrugging, bad shoulders. But I have to give credit to the twins that are boring and morally to sell this idea through Maybe they have the same effect as the ESPN programming executives that they have for me, and when he / she wakes up a few scary episodes are in the can and he / she hopes now. How scary it is and he / she can collect an annual salary of $ 425,000. <br /> <br /> You receive a warning.
