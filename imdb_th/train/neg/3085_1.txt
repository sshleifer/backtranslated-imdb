Description: Trite, stupid and worthless. It is cheap and weak. It will make you wonder why these unusual idiots wasted 2 months or more in using the budget (I guess ...) maybe not more than 700 dollars to create this movie. It's just a passion for watching with or without a Mystery Science Theater. I'll give you the best advice in this world. <br /> <br /> Give yourself time to spend your life and money. You without - I repeat. Don't ponder whether you should watch this movie or not. This film has a lot of repetition. It will make your face turn purple from boredom. If you have one main IQ as my guest and watch this nasty movie You may appreciate it (As I said earlier, if you have one main IQ) <br /> <br /> There are about 12 actors on your own. There are little puppets that you bought in the garage and camera and music. You will create a home video that is a little more entertaining than this ridiculous thing.
