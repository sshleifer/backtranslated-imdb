This movie is not very good. It's boring and not too much blood for horror movies. The plot is just trods with no more. And I think the female vampires are very stupid She has many opportunities to kill vampire hunters because it shows that she has light as a reaction. But whenever she has one of them being pinned, she takes her time and something always happens that she doesn't bite them. No wonder here, go straight to the cable. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: Not near the first vampire movie. You're a SUCKER.
