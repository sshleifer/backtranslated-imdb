Do you believe in God? Do you believe in Jesus? Do you believe that he is the Son of God? The choice is up to you. <br /> <br /> Director Denise Arcand has done everything possible to bring Jesus back to the historical person, social worker, son of two humans instead. Is the Son of the Holy God The Spirit and Mary who opened heaven again for us Promoting the Big Bang the world comes from evolution rather than seeing the beauty of creation. This film shows the theologians leading "Modern discoveries" come to actors who play Jesus in the drama "Passion Play," which combines those happiness in his plays. <br /> <br /> The priests who take care of the temples of Passion Play perform. In Montreal, there is a sexual relationship with one of the female players of Passion Play instead of showing love for God through being single. Often not seeing the hatred of the director at the church clearly. <br /> <br /> The director tried to do something parallel between the life of Jesus and the life of a passionate actor. This is an admirable effort. But showing the resurrection with the organ transplants of other bodily passions showing how the director thought about Jesus. <br /> <br /> My opinion is not important. Of God is Do not want to stand in the shoes of the director and actor when standing before the throne of Jesus
