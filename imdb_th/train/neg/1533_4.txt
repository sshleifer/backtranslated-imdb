I will not take time and energy in this opinion. I just want to add, because all the comments are positive. I feel like I have to let people know that not everyone is so exciting, the only one who is intellectually motivated by the effort to create a philosophical, adorable movie. Some scenes look promising, playing with visual dimensions. But can't stand still I felt like being stoned for the first time again with a semi-philosophical conversation with a teenage friend. <br /> <br /> It's a futile effort to raise the Dutch cinema even further. I would like to see that Jesus is a Palestinian without any claims and humor, and also questions about the life and reality that we created for ourselves. <br /> <br /> Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and will never appear
