I read the book Celestine Prophecy and look forward to watching the movie. Please note that this film is based on the book. The most interesting point of many books is not coming out in the movie. It is the best "B" movie. Many events, characters, characters that interact and respond in the book are changed only or not. The flow of events that occurred in this book was very smooth, fast changing and being raised into view as if you were a child. Bad character development The character of the character is different from the book. That direction is similar to the horror flick "B". I understand that it will take six hours in the movie to present what is in the book. But they filtered many of the base players. The casting is very good.
