Of course not scary but not good. <br /> <br /> Cry, The Beloved Country (1995) directed by Darrell Roodt and written by Ronald Harwood (adapted from the 1946 novel by Alan Paton) starring James Earl Jones and Richard Harris <br /> <br /> This film is about apartheid in South Africa and the story of a black man and a white man who blends together. Religious preacher But innocent Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) received a letter from Johannesburg saying that he had to come immediately. After that, he found that his son killed a man. James Jarvis, a farmer / wealthy landowner (Richard Harris) found that his son was a black rights fighter who was killed by Kumalo's son in this connection. <br /> <br /> I can't compare to movies. The same name in 1951 because I didn't see it or 1974, the musical "Lost in the Stars" because I haven't seen it yet Both look better than this one. But on the other hand, I saw Cry Freedom. It had a lot more urgent air. Actually, it was trying to say something in the movie Cry. The Beloved Country didn't seem to know where it was going. "Wishy -washy "I refuse to compare this movie to a novel. (Except that I enjoy the novel more than I like this movie) because the novels and movies are two different media and there is no point trying to transfer directly to others or compare In the same way, <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie sounded. I think it's not bad - go out ten - but it's not good as well. Both talented actors drew the most skilled actors I had ever seen with the most awkward dialogue in film history. (But may have been blamed on his screenplay for Ronald Harwood, a strange game). The film also wrote the composer and pianist Julia. Above all, the point and style of the novel disappeared almost entirely during the transition of the movie for the third time; There is little if there is tension with any moment of movie, race or suspense. Music doesn't help. The orchestra, the band that was misplaced and painfully boring, really helped with this boring movie. One of them is a movie that has a rather good or excellent shot. But unfortunately, it doesn't help too much. <br /> <br /> The amazing final word of Alan Patton's novel will appear in the final moments of the movie. It's terrible that they seem to be cut. Connected from the recently displayed movie I don't know what Nelson Mandela might see in this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
