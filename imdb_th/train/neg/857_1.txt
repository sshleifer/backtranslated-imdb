Many king fans hate this because it's separated from the book. But movies are different media and books should change when they jump. Although this film will fail completely But all failed according to movie conditions I want to slap people who tell me that it's the most horrible movie ever created. I always follow the question "Really ... What scene makes you scared?" All the fans I asked silently. Sometimes people lose because of great fear (none ...) named shtick "Grape-juice-shot-out-of-elevators". If you are afraid of that, I don't know what to say unless you're afraid. easily I just rolled my eyes to see these z-level horror ideas played in movies that are harmonious and incoherent. <br /> <br /> The only place that deviates from the book and interesting is the work. Boring that the movie was made for Mr Halloran to go to Overlook just to kill him. With the most stupid members of the audience who know that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that takes Halloran forever to walk down Actually, one of the most stupid scenes ever in the movie <br /> <br /> Oh, and it's a good choice for Mr. Halloran Stanley! Afro-nymphomaniacs light Black adds to the mood and character development of horror movies. There has been more "off-site shooting" than in any place in any movie ever made. <br /> <br /> I think it's It is a miracle that I can finally avoid this chaos and accept that Kubricks 2001 is a truly important movie because 'Great Testament' created by both stupid, stupid and fawning movies But not suitable for Kubrick fans who cannot explain the idea of ​​working with movie resources in The National Library in front of them <br /> <br /> Throwing the thrill of Jack Nicholson, the opening of one stupid torpedo during a tense time and Shelly Duvall's nomination for Razzie
