Dave is about to divorce and his mind returns to his first love. "Wanders" may not be a word. I should say that he is fixed on his ex-girlfriend. He remembered the day that the relationship ended. The sequence of dreams lacks only transitions. He likes to restore their favorite songs and the places they go. I'm not a consultant But perhaps this is related to a failed marriage Dave goes to the support group and meets a half-aged woman (still divorced), who instead of "closes" with his disgust. I'm talking about how dreadful Dave is? Sometimes he refers to himself in a third person. He didn't move his arms when he walked as well. It was very strange, making the short story too short. Dave planned to hunt Mary. (Old girl friend) and kill her ... uh ... I mean face to face with you He did that Which is really creepy He believed that she would marry. But he still flew halfway across the country to meet her He left her home to make sure that she was alone before he "dropped" with her. He talked to her awkwardly, which ended by sharing the gospel of Christ about 10 words or less and flying back Find a new girlfriend We enjoy movies mostly for unintended funny values. I still entertain my wife with Dave's impression .... "I heard Dave and Mary's songs again!"
