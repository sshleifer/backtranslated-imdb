It's disgusting! This movie may have something good. But especially writing is crap and the main character is quite shallow and not interesting. Mike Meyers is a good person and the historical recreation of decadence in the late 1970s was well built. But overall, this movie wasted a lot of time. But movies that are related to similar themes and the same basic time frame are excellent BOOGIE NIGHTS
