When you create a thriller about witchcraft, I believe you should do everything you can to help the audience suppress unbelief in order for the movie to work. For example, some pictures ("Rosemary's Baby", etc.) are not successful. Other things (such as "Necromancy") are not, and the horrible material that may occur is repetition and silly. This film has a time of atmosphere. But about half of the dialogue is difficult to do (Sometimes it is badly recorded at other times that cannot be understood) and Orson Welles, who gets the highest bill, plays a role. Suppose he was desperate for work Or maybe he's just having fun ..... (* 1/2)
