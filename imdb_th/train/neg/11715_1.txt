haha! You have to smile and smile if you do it all the way through this movie. It's like saying something about myself. I guess. The movie was created. I think it is some psychological test or like some kind of medicine to take you to a place you've never been to before. When Wittgenstein wrote his first piece of the famous urinary tract (sp?), He said it was meaningless and useless. But if you read it after you finish Leave work and see things with clarity and true understanding. This movie is the same as I thought. <br /> <br /> As this movie, it is without a doubt that the worst movie I have seen for a long time in a unique way. First of all, this is snipes. I like watching this guy kick ass in various movies and I have suffered from some weak people. However, even if you know that this movie may suck, you will never wonder if it may not be as good as before. Which is the fun of it I mean, this is snipes. You know it might be good. But it will be okay, smile. <br /> <br /> So this thing at all levels is pure boredom. The reference to the professional is both dead and obvious. But not as good as funny There are no characters in this movie that are interesting at least. And in order to make everything more realistic, they have a soundtrack that arranges the sounds like parts for different types of Bond films. Bond is simply not correct. In fact, although it seems close to the action movie music But it happens. It's done in a way that will make you astonishingly impressive. <br /> <br /> Then the whole scene in black Because the character is very flat, you don't care what really happens, but no matter what happens and people are killed, you just say to yourself, should I see or not? What else, how about a scene that can not be seen, frighteningly blinking at the strobe light for an extended period of time to be tolerated? Of course we will throw the following When you are stressed and your eyes no longer manage, do these things in the darkness that you don't see what happens. And above that, face the things you don't care about Have you ever been bored from the beginning? <br /> <br /> So I went out and went a few times. And it will become something that you can watch without anything that appeals to you at all levels, so it becomes something you can divide effectively and start thinking about your life. Where will the people <br /> <br /> and that ... that is the true miracle of this movie
