I went to see a lot of movies. I often brought my 5 year old son. I'm glad I didn't bring him here. There are many references about sex and the skinny dipping scene. That's not the main reason I won't take him. The trailer leads you to believe that it's a light comedy. However, almost every funny moment is in the example. I wait for it to be interesting, funny or anything other than serious matter. However, I almost fell asleep when the story had no plot. I understand that dogs can be good friends, both focused on dogs that behave badly, that the owners do not understand enough to practice. If a man causes a lot of damage and harms the body, that person will be banned. The worst movie I have ever seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson, which is a lost talent. The best way to summarize this film is that couples get dog stubborn, couples fall in love with dogs, dead dogs, sad couples, ending
