I have quite high expectations when I first started to watch this movie. But it turned out to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> First, incredibly slow pace. So it seems like much longer (and not short). I'm sure that when Jane Austen wrote this book, she made it many pages full of explanations and not intended for people to read. One day, or it might pull and lose, it would be attractive, which "Emma" did most definitely. Now, "feelings and feelings" have shortcomings of this slow pace. But at least there is a lively line to do for it, as well as some good performances. <br /> <br /> That makes me flawed. While I am not interested in anybody in general related to this film, I'm sure they have good work ability. But I don't see much in this movie It is like someone who is trying too hard to be witty, too difficult to be a "nobleman", too difficult to be an Englishman (some), so they all come out as actors and not people. <br /> <br /> # 3 As I say, the actors are like actors only and not like the people they play. May be a good thing because the people they play are not really good people Why do everyone like Emma? Of course, she is a good, rich and handsome person in front of them. But she was a gossip after them If her friend is "ugly", she doesn't have to worry about turning her back. So why is this girl so good? Why do people tell stories? "Just make you laugh." Of course, the hypocrite can't do that. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow and "Emma" does not change my opinion. <br /> <br /> Well, I see that I don't care about this. I'm sure it's a lovely book and all. But some books are not for the big screen and "Emma" is one of them
