I will admit that I didn't expect much from the movie Roger Corman. In general, I expect that many scripts are walking and not good. But in this case, I am surprised. <br /> <br /> Gunslinger is a story of a woman (played by brave Beverly Garland) who was a sheriff after her husband was brutally murdered. Ms. Garland is The person who shot was very beautiful, killing a murderer the next day at the husband's funeral. Her first job was to close the local bar that violated the curfew of the city. The bar owner is trying to buy the land, expecting to buy the railroad (hopefully). However, Miss Garland is a thorn in her plan and the bar maid hired a man to kill Miss Garland. <br /> <br /> Because Garland shows her role faithfully and realistically goes to Suzanne Sommer, "She is the sheriff." The joke with the exception of double etiquette (The apartment door that opens from the inside, jeep tracks, and two cavalry around the screen to their queue to ride around the corner), the movie becomes reasonable. However, Corman was unable to withstand the expansion of his film with a horse riding scene as he walked in other movies. <br /> <br /> Sterno said The Gunslinger is a horse theater that is worth your time.
