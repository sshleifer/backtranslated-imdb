Imagine that you were asked by your date what movie you want to watch and you remember having an interesting example about "The Grudge". So honestly, you recommend watching that movie. It's Halloween season, after all. And it made a box office income over the weekend so it was quite good ... so you will go <br /> <br /> and you are in a frightening situation when the movie Ends And you hear your own voice say that "That should not be the end of the movie ..." But that is <br /> <br /> And imagine coming out of the cinema that was embarrassed and ashamed for introducing dogs like movies. Do you think that your date of thinking that you are a cheat in introducing cruelty and your advice will end a promising relationship? Actually, it's really terrible that both of us laughed about how bad it was. I do not see the future of Miss Gellar in the movie and advise her to watch television in the future. In fact, it wasn't long before she was sent to the flea market convention that sold Buffy souvenirs and it couldn't happen fast enough if you asked me. Scary, scary, scary The story is not reasonable. Terrible continuity Clearly, all the endings were planned for "Grudge II - The Return of 'Cat-Boy'".
