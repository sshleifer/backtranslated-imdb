First of all, yes, I'm a white person, so I try to step on the delicate issues of the race ... Continue ... White people hate black people = bad people, but blacks, white people, white people = OK !!) Where do I start? I hope I have something good to say about this movie, in addition to the unintended comedy scene: the infamous scene is Ice Cube and co. Fight with some really big, strong, really angry and scary characters Neo-Nazis and win !!! neo-Nazi is twice as large :) and chase! The chase is invaluable ... This is not a movie about competition, patience and understanding. It doesn't deliver ... This is a racist movie that reaffirms all the ancient patterns again. From him Black roommates transformed into automatic skinheads ... On a terrible day, I regret that I have never seen before. <br /> <br /> Save your time and the horrifying experience of paintings. Bad You are on the topic and renting American History X is now a movie.
