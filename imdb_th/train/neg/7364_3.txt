In the year 1692 Salem, a feloned child, lied about his involvement in the magic of slaves, sending the entire community to chaos. The costume drama starring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray is not boring. But did not show hysteria in communicable diseases Worked by three writers (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead and Bradley King). The story is interesting. (Especially coming out of Hollywood in 1937) even with anyone reading "The Crucible" by Arthur Miller. The melodrama on display here will not be able to endure for a long time. The biggest problem of the image may be in the selection: Colbert and MacMurray are couples who do not match the witch hunt. MacMurray witches are too contemporary for these environments. * 1/2 from ****
