Yes, I know that I am one of the few people who wish to trample on this movie in forgetfulness, so let me tell you why I felt this way. In fact, it was advertised as a Zombie movie or something like that. I might like it. But now I can't speak. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler ... even though I'm not sure. What to lose * Start with a big flaw. If I don't know if this movie is called "Darkness - The VAMPIRE Version" and if I don't see the order in which some people seem to suck blood, I won't see the relationship with the vampire. I mean FANGLESS ???? > <br /> Second point: What are metals? Looks like every young person But most of the so-called "vampires" are various types of metal, judging from their shirts primarily! Do not understand me wrong. I entered the most violent musical style for almost 15 years, but no one would make me scared by showing me the ridiculous teenager in Iron Maiden (every band !!!). T-shirt running around. Pretend to be a vampire! "Pathetic" is the only word that I can use here. <br /> <br /> The third weakness: The actors wait a moment. What is the actor ?! You mean the director's wood friend! The words may be lost here. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is full of blood. It will be a strength and a pleasant thing if the director "brutally" does not choose to create the topic of artificial vampires in this movie. I want to see vampires But was treated with a silly kid that I wanted to use my baseball bat Filmmakers should advertise this movie as "Horror movie, Grade B, cheap, no plot But there is a lot of blood "!!! <br /> <br /> This film is disrespectful towards all Vampirism concepts and it makes me sick.
