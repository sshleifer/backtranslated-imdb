I noticed from the comments that most people talk about this movie is talking about MST3K broadcast. That's fair enough. (That is, after all, it has received the widest revelation) but there is unfortunate to see "Final Justice" in its original form. I want to share ideas and opinions about uncut versions. <br /> <br /> First Others have to admit that the original version is slightly more interlinked than MST3K, since most are scenes of explanations between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini. the possible Instead of an actor But I like to type the word "Venantino Venantini"). Explain why the character of Venantini's refugees cannot leave Malta immediately. (It's not a very reliable issue. But at least the filmmakers tried to conceal it.) This scene was cut at the time or because it didn't provide much food for the riffs. I don't know. <br /> Another missing issue in the original: the betrayal of Venantino Venantini to Joe Don. Baker seems not to be stimulated in the MST3K version. Explained by the previous unwanted scenes that Venantini raped her in the shower. While this makes her motivated to fight with him, the whole situation is just ... icky (no other words for it) <br /> <br /> Some worthwhile moments of MST (voice Shouted at the time of "Son of a -" and sheriff's shooting "deja vu" of the sheriff) all the results of the edited prints for the TV they worked with and were absent from the original movie <br /> <br /> The only scene I want to make is MST3K: Before entering the bar to ask someone. Don, Don, ask the Malta police who came with him to go out because "They saw that set, they would not cooperate." However, Joe Don himself wore a cowboy dress, his sheriff, a ridiculous cowboy with a shadow badge! I can't imagine why they have the opportunity to make him fun ... <br /> <br /> The last observation about the original "Final Justice" that has not yet uncovered: Why, oh, they why Feeling the need to put Venantino Venantini's bare butt on the screen?
