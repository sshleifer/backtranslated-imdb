Serum is about a crazy doctor who finds a serum that should cure all the diseases through the power of the mind. But it created some monsters that wanted to eat human flesh and brain Mad Doctor creates zombies out of the corpse and has some problems. Has led to a very long operation, with many scenes that make you familiar with the characters The crazy nephew of the doctor had a car accident and the doctor tried to use a new serum with the boy. The results were not good. This is a class C movie that has been shown OK but has some problems in directing and continuous errors. There is no action of zombies in this game and the effect, while sufficient, is nothing special. You can move forward through the slow part and go out and enjoy the action scenes. Beware of nudity and bad language.
