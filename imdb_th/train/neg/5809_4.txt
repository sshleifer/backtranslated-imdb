I couldn't see why the filmmakers had to remove the film. <br /> <br /> The 1972 movie with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic movie. Steve McQueen is an outstanding actor and Baldwin is just Not showing enough He has no passion for his play. In addition, the original "Getaway" action is excellent. But the remake has no action! It's almost tedious, although the fact that movie production in 1972 is more difficult than in 1994. <br /> <br /> I don't understand how Baldwin was imprisoned from Mexico. I think this is a mistake in the story. <br /> <br /> So I think there is no need to create a new one or if they decide to create a classics, they have to choose a great actor for the first role. Like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
