If you want to know the true story of Wendigo, I suggest you get an original copy of Algernon Blackwell. This movie is not only bad. <br /> <br /> I love books when I read the episode (in "Campfire Chillers" by EM Freeman) and was very excited to see it. Movies made from this movie I was very disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there are too many PC undertones (Politically Correct) throughout the movie that is not in the movie. When that book is written on a PC, there isn't even one person. <br /> <br /> My advice is to not waste time or money !! If you see it on the shelves of the video store, let it go there.
