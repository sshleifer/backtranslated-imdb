Yes, unfortunately I found the DVD of this story and found it very bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters suck. I mean, if there is a hat in the orange hat that calls itself 'Orange Sherbert' is the best creativity that these people will receive from the characters and they shouldn't be in the movie creation scene. "Clothing" is not good. The interview is not good and generally there is no "wrestler" on this disc that has any special abilities. <br /> <br /> "Wrestling" in Splatter Rampage. More than this, the idiot is soft and leaping towards each other with fun on the trampoline. They made sure to giggle together while making the experience seem more like a toddler's play than "Deathmatch Wrestling". <br /> <br /> In general, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a cute clone Only instead of blood, weapons, assault and wrestling, we have received trampoline, giggling, TERRIBLE and some men called Orange Sherbert. Wrestling fans or not avoiding this DVD is terrible.
