The Underground Comedy movie may be one of the worst comedies I have ever seen. I should know that it will not be good when the box contains phrases. "Guaranteed to be offended" written ... means that the filmmakers will focus on making you more money than you make you laugh. <br /> <br >> This movie is an innocent confusion of Children's characters, bad characters, and even worse jokes ... from the portrayal of a pathetic bat man to Arnold Schwelen, a terrifying painter. A few jokes that are a little funny are not much - see Michelle Clark. Duncan plays as a virgin - for example, though they go too long and are destroyed by Vince Offer's stupidity that is funny. < br /> <br /> Keep the underground comedy movie ... Bury it!
