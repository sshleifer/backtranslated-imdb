Chilly, adaptation of Rebecca West's book about the Army Captain, comes back from duty in World War II, with his memory deficient. (Now with the original idea!) He seems to have remembered the Glenn Jackson flames. But not Julie Christie, the current wife, who should be sufficient to spark the emotions This well-selected sanitary napkin brings Alan Bates, the leading man, to come together with director Alan Bridges and Jackson Christie, Ann Margaret and Ian. There are a number of good scenes (especially when Jackson is on the screen), but walking around the bridge is incredibly inert, and the dull colors of the movie come out loud. A long time ago, on the shelf "Soldier" This is the best thing that was forgotten. * 1/2 from ****
