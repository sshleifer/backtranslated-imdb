I found that ordinary characters and stories are not interesting. I have never read this book (good luck) or it will be a painful experience. I got a ticket to see a free sample. But still not worth the time or my friend I think this is not worth telling. It's like the old man has a past before they are old. (No kidding) The life of the main character is painful to watch. One version is no better than the next generation to avoid stupid mistakes. However, I think the actors do the best they can with lame stories. I am always a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I am writing this review to oppose the positive reviews I have received. Unfortunately, I try to watch this movie
