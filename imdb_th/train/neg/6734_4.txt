I found that this movie is a good idea that is not delivered. It seems that they found a way to create doubts. But can not give a good return In one case, the police were on the watch to find the kidnappers' hiding place. They try hard from the dentist to go to the dentist to match the dental record. At the same time, the man who was kidnapped (Mason) escaped through the elevator shaft. After all the construction, the police arrived at the same time, he received a free, anti-climatic condition to say the least. There is also a large lecture scene that takes us. "In the thoughts" of the husband and wife who are intimidated by distracting from doubts instead of We are well aware of their tensions and the voice acting is insulting and robbing the audience of the opportunity to experience personal fears when Hitchcock has proven time and again The greatest disappointment is to sit and watch movies, both fast and gentle. I mean just ... "finish" with snoring
