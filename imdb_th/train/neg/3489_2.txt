This is my first time and probably the last film of Angelopoulos. I am eager to join because it is the highlight of Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors and the movie by Theo, who I have heard a lot. The launch was good, with a long distance shot to the military jeep across the Albanian-Greek border. OK! But that's all Nothing left This movie has a big hole and I don't know what to say first. The main story of the story is revealed to reporters by an old woman. During long walks It's like talking alone, 15 minutes, killing the action and the patience of the audience. Nothing happens on the screen for 15 or 20 minutes, apart from this old woman who tells the story. What was assumed to be shown through action was told to the camera by an old woman. For a moment, equippe of the TV is heading to the bar. They open the corner and as soon as the winter begins! May shoot on different days, continuously leaking Many problems with story telling change from nonsense to irrationality, not adhering to the style, causing the audience to ask questions that have never been answered. Mastroianni gets a role that lacks integrity or charm. While the Greeks or Albanians or the Balans would agree with many movies, showing a historical, racial or political mistake, just to show the movie about "humanity" in red in the review again. More to say But there is no time to lose in a poor movie which is not a movie at all But the person who impressed the movie and paid for the state
