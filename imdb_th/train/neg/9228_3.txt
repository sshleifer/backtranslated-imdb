CQ is incredibly slow and I'm a David Mamet fan. The movie follows a young filmmaker who is creating a movie. Barbarella-esque After that the movie began to lose me. Deep and profound? Not really. The movie "Dragonfly" created in CQ has no end. This is very similar to CQ, which has no end. (In my opinion) <br /> <br /> I'm lucky enough to watch this movie at the SxSW film festival. I have quite high expectations when I watch Y Tu Mama Tambien and other great movies. Many more I'm still waiting for Jason Schwartzman's performance, but it's not easy to go. If you are not in a sci-fi movie or a slow movie that is nowhere, skip it. <br /> <br /> CQ feels like a student movie. If you want to rent the latest sci-fi indie movie, Donnie Darko, it won't make you sleep.
