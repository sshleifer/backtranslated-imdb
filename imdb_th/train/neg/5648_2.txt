Boston's law has turned the tail and headed to the barn door and slapped the pig that has been created! When this program aired for the first time in nearly four seasons, it was a joke that the legal system in which all actors were proud of drawing. It's a variety of jokes and real boundaries. The characters that are shown are acceptable and have boundaries in their images. The opinions and sexual activities are limited and the humor is Julie Bowen beautiful and beautiful as in all the other series she joined. But now being dragged to the bottom depth of the sex media and violence Julie is a great actress and wants a platform that is more stable than this "production". Rene Adjurdubois is a great actor from "Benson" to his own creation in the entertainment industry Humor and acting that always honored Captain Kirk "Be" funny and funny, Candace Bergan and must be admired by her acting in this drama and being a good actor. James Spader There is no doubt that his acting ability will be. However, he should return to his XXX origin, such as "Crash" because he seems to have a lot of talent and passion in that direction. We asked if this set would be left in the trash as it is already and it started to smell !!!
