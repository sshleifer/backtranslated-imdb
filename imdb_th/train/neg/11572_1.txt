Slow, boring, repetitive It is not surprising that the Weinstein Company did not buy this. Spurlock should eat more McDonalds while filming and discontinuing production. There is no way you can watch and enjoy it. The preacher is a joke. Not all ideas are funny. You can create a 2 minute movie with this concept, not a feature. I'm sorry I rented this movie. I won't see anything with the name Spurlock. It's completely rubbish. Filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never get a distribution agreement. The film states that American consumers and their shopping are wrong for the current depression when buying and buying products, making money circulating in the system as a base of the economy.
