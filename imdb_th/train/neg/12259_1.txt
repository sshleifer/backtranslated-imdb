A movie about some filmmakers who want to make a new documentary about the shark-filled waters. As a big fan of movies, including fierce animals or monsters, I think this may be my type of movie ... it can't be !!! This should be a way rather than not doing! It has a lot of unintended humor, and the beast is an incredible joke in the final scene. It happened after the main character * rolled *. It looks ridiculous! Good for laughing though. If it is because of the lack of talent between actors, stupid conversations and hilarious crocodiles that are hilarious, at least laughing. How weak it is, so they even think about old "sex sales" ... totally And somewhere to the beginning there "Make-up" that has no meaning This is the last ingredient that makes this film the perfect trash for me. It's incredible that people actually spend time creating such garbage! If you are looking for real time loss: watch this movie !!!
