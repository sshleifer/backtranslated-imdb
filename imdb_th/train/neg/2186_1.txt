... but it will surprise you if we have it at first! This movie is as bad as horror movies today. A man walks around a small semi-woman who tries to decide who will kill him so that he can give the new body to his girlfriend. One scene involves a man who stumbles around and rushes across the scene for three minutes full of everything that is better than "gallons" of ten gallons of blood. The film also tries to create a feeling that what men are doing for his girlfriend is wrong and unnatural. But this movie is not good, it is impossible for the audience to dig up the shock or rape. This film cannot make your own name straight and aimless and gloomy without aim - the credit begins. "The brain that won't die" but the credit ultimately indicates "The chief that wouldn't die"
