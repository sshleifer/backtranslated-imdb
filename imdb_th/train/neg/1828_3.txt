I watched 'jealousy' two nights before on a DVD at a friend's house. The location of this film is quite bright. Jack Black and Ben Stiller in many potential comedies. But it failed to deliver completely I watched it with about five friends and no one laughed at all. The jokes (which are small and far away) aren't funny in any way ... The story is ridiculous and they never answer questions ... SH * Where is T GO? Of course, the answer is no one is interested. The film lacks any comedy, and while other users talk about the only thing that makes it most worthwhile is Christopher Walken as J-man. No character has developed the plot. Thin, almost transparent - and that song throughout the story that should be funny?
