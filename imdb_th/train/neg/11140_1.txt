I thought I was going to watch a horrible movie .. and ended up laughing throughout the story. In the scene where humans transform into werewolves, I think they are joking. The current computer game has ten times better animation. Low budget is appropriate. I want to introduce Wolf (1994) and Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf movie. It has good special techniques as it should be. (Humans turn into werewolves) If you don't want to laugh well, I wouldn't suggest you watch this movie. This movie is a joke.
