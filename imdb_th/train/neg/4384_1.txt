The fact that people spend money on really bad scripts is beyond me. This must be one of the worst movies in addition to the "Haunted Highway" I've seen. A bad actor and a really bad story There is no normal reaction to any events in this film, and even though it's Halloween. But ordinary people have a bigger reaction when they see that their father was killed, not to mention regret. (In a room with at least 50 people that I might add) and some people dress up while Satan dragged the dead out of his house. Even a 8 year old boy will see the difference between a doll and a man. Not to mention the fact that no one would be innocent and stupid to believe the reality of Satan's presence and Jesus on the same day as this child. When I was 8 years old, I was sure that there was more brain. <br /> <br /> But the really stupid thing is that everyone seems to have fallen because of this dumb Satan. The question throughout the movie is Satan, or is it a madman who kills people whenever he feels like that? He has hands, arms, man made and whatever, so I think he should be in the movie as well. Otherwise, they have hidden jobs that are not hidden. Then when this person is a human being and all he can kill his old woman, male and female police 5 (!! ???) (all have guns and training that I understand) and a few more .... And obviously everyone stood there to wait for him or her. <br /> <br /> The concept and method of telling the whole story is the worst thing I have ever seen and I will not recommend it. Everyone must waste 1 hour and 30 minutes to see all this shit.
