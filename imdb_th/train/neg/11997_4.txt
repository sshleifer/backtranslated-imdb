This movie has many disadvantages and that's all I saw. It was long and painful. I saw the whole audience getting impatient and waiting for it to end. Working time for more than 3 hours, which can be modified for less than 2 hours Most people confess that they are sitting by expecting something better. <br /> <br /> It's funny in the purse. Ambitious projects and lower operations Govinda works normally. Anil kapoor makes me disappointed. If you expect to have something close to Babel or love, then it's really not close.
