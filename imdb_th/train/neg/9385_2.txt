The "Trivia" page in IMDb claims that the filmmakers protested because the film was cut by the studio for "Reduce the complexity of the plot" If so, that effort has failed all because this is one of the most inconsistent narratives I have ever seen in a movie - I hate to see it before. The lot is "easy". <br /> <br >> It's sad to see Warren with little characters that will continue, even if he can't do anything with inappropriate content. It is interesting to see Caron in the '70s mode instead of garb and persona in her Hollywood era. But it's sad to see her walking aimlessly through the ruins of her husband, the creator. In fact, she will fight with and marry the director instead - whom you know will never direct anything. But do as 1 or 2 AD. Work on TV from here. From outside oughta tell you enough. <br /> <br /> I call this "interesting" because I have a passion for American movies in this era. And this role will add to the perspective of Oates' 1971 (Second - Lane Blacktop, The Hired Hand), but the 1940s detective was a fish out of the water in the 1970s. Selling in a way that is too heavy Similar themes will be handled more effectively in the next two years in Altman's The Long Goodbye and as far as Oates plays as a bitten person on a three-year errand Will show his performance in Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia. If you don't see these things, don't waste your time on this!
