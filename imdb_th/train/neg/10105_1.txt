Zombie Nation 2004 R <br /> <br /> Hey, I'm bored. Then I watched my tiny Comcastic box to find movies to watch Zombie Nation? Hey i love zombies movies Said that the filmmakers had some kind of cult that followed in the funny description that it didn't remind me not to watch this movie. I use that advice. <br /> <br /> Zombie Nation is the same as Troll 2 because it's all wrong. It's a little (if anything depends on your perspective) about zombies and happens within one city. This film revolves around a corrupt police who behaves as badly as possible. (He had to try to suck this thing a lot) as he arrested women for a little bullshit and killed them. Yes, he is a serial killer. This film is not only But there is a flaw in thinking that it is a flick of zombies only Serial killers enjoy killing them alive for it, and they go down and be private with it. This guy knocked the woman out and injected poison too. He does not have sex with the body or makes the organ. Talk about boring things! Finally, one in five women he killed made Voodoo protection for her and without a clear reason, all five came to life again and headed to kill this man. All of them were buried or thrown into the sea. But you do not know that it is buying clean clothes that they wear The women acted badly and avenged. Oh yeah. <br /> <br /> This movie is a scandal in every genre. Nonsense performances, nonsense writing, crappier sets and crappier makeup effects. Women do not look like zombies unless you count dark makeup around the eyes to give a true definition of what makes zombies true. They can talk, conduct, think and act perfectly human. The blood is weak compared to many PG-13 movies, and the nudity is too short for you to see a glimpse of the chest in the opening sequence ... then the exact same breasts later! To guess that there is only one actor willing to go naked for this repetition The police station was built so badly that you could see that they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they were filming clearly. You can see the pipes and the bad light. You can see the director failing. Clearer than it wastes time. <br /> <br /> 1/10
