I guess it's possible that I can watch movies that are worse than this. But this one is a real foul! The plot is not unusual. But not the worst The director is not close to what you expect from Andy Ching. He has good working ability. <br /> <br /> Annie Harmon plays as a female lead as a journalist who scolds who is behind the assassination of the president. There is no chemistry with goodness. Her behavior is flat and the wood and the 5-inch pointed heels she wear throughout the story are ridiculous. This time out, so Harmon puts her firmly at the bottom of the list. "B" <br /> <br /> <br /> And what is the good idea of ​​Cuba? But this is lower than we expected from him. <br /> <br /> Bad James wood and Rennell flowers. Poor, Poor, Bad, Bad
