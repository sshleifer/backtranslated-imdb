I don't think it can be done. But there is something to replace the open house - horror stories about low budget about people who kill high-priced real estate - the worst movie I've seen in a short time. <br /> <br /> It has been called the best movie in Montreal's latest film festival, which makes me believe that every other item must consist of a blank wall, along with a dark poem reader. <B r /> <br /> Watching this movie is like part of hell. Came from Austria and tried to stumble upon the footsteps of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet about the various characters that live in the suburbs with dark weaknesses There is a chubby dog ​​owner and his chubby young wife who stripped him of the divorced, thin, whose wife still lives with him in the house, including a room that is untouched by his dead child. boring The program continues forever like two hours, plus that I use in that theater. <br /> <br /> Yes, the characters interact.

Of course, they don't need to learn a lot because each chapter repeats at least three times in the scene. <br /> <br /> This is not Gummo or the movie mentioned above.

"Never walked away during watching movies" (which had a couple of older couples Not unless you are one of the few people who do not find the idea that your parents have sex and have a few middle-aged couples who are starting to rebel. <br /> <br /> Movie this story Is disgusting for me Not pornography, not music. The cringe is not a scene that doesn't involve guns. I am offended that some people use money to create this when there are writers and filmmakers who are able to look for capital. I was offended that some people from outside the city might see Dog Days and come out to wonder if that was the best thing we could find in Montrealers. Mostly, I felt dissatisfied that the people involved in the festival tricked everyone into believing that The emperor has a new set that is beautiful and attractive when it is clear that he is naked like a fat young wife who undresses. <br /> <br />
