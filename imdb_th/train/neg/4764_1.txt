86 minutes of my life wasted I fell asleep for the first time I tried to watch it and I had to say that I wasn't the one who slept in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I never saw a plot that had no purpose. The compulsive nature and predictability of the actors are difficult while the protagonist, the author who is accused of being in the movie himself <br /> <br /> Everything in this terrifying adaptation will be overacted. And if it is not a show made of wood, as if you saw the teleprompter and set himself, which was bright and disturbing in an entirely unnecessary and overdressed manner at an unexpected level. <br /> <br /> As Detective Fearing under disguise, any person who does not see that - just like all the rest of this ridiculous plot - the light telegraphy year in advance should check their eyes immediately. <br /> <br / > Bad performances and from two great actors plus the redirection of the Branagh trademark that is too encrypted is enough to make you want to use real ammunition instead of yourself. <Br /> <br /> Above all, it has the lightest of homoerotica that has increased completely at this point. All I hope is that this is a failure that people should not try to imitate the cinema at this level again.
