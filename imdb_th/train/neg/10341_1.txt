I rented this movie from the library. (It's rare for a good reason) Desperately curious. I'm a big Plath fan and this movie is very disappointing. The Bell Jar (1979) is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is scary, not because it's strange from the original novel. But because it is not focused or intended The scene was created badly and did not bring the audience anywhere. What is the voice of the poem Plath? What did Lady Lazarus do with the situation of Greenwood? Plath's poetry has been completely misused. Marilyn Hassett is completely unbelievable as Esther Greenwood (or 20 years old for that) partly due to casting (she was 32 years old during the filming of Hassett's No emotion, no skill, no skills Direction is moderate The director covers the things that are not there. The only reason I gave this movie is 1 because 0 is not an option. Sorry, Sylvia, you have to wait for others to adjust your work to the more appropriate.
