I refused to watch this when it aired, creating memories in the late 1960s. A regrettable series with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I couldn't resist the challenge. I should know better. Not a new creation and a parody rather than showing respect. This show rarely knows how to play and is full of childhood comedy and cartoons and characters. The three main characters are a little smaller than the actor's caricature and only Emilia Fox can do. (Bob Mortimer feels pain in the role). The supporting actor is just a comedian of Vic and Bob who wants to be part of the joke and realizes the situation that will convince and CGI. Gott couldn't help improve the things that were available 30 years ago, but only made the audience dazzled by light and camera work and doing little to cover poor script quality and dialogue. Every style and without substance (And while the 1960 show was ridiculed for a lot of time This 'update' is now very old with 'Fashion style matrix' fashion 'girl power' forced and less than the subtle tension between the two lives lead.)
