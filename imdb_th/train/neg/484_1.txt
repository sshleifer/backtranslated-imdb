I feel disgusted with this movie. No, it's not because of the graphic sex scene. It is because it destroys the image of Artemisia Janetileji. This film doesn't have much truth about her and her art. It shows Judith Beheading Holofernese, but shows that witnessing the rape trial when she did not draw her first Judith for one year after consideration. The case <br /> I don't know if you understand this from the movie or not. It may be that Tassi is not an honorable character. He raped Artemisia. It's not love. It's raped. He did not claim to accept the wrong rape charges to stop suffering while she was tortured. From the evidence of rape, he still claimed that he had never known Artemisia. (Also known as having sex) while she repeated that "It's true" <br /> <br /> I encourage everyone to go out. And search for true Artemisia and see what she really is about Do not hold all your knowledge in this character movie. I encourage you to do some research. Artemisia has an interesting story behind her and an amazing art. <br /> <br /> Don't watch movies, but find the true story of Artemisia
