This film has always been my favorite since I first saw it as a 12-year-old child in 1962, when it was shown on the “late show” of a television channel in Los Angeles. From the very beginning, the characters are very attractive, and it is a pity that the film was never released for videotapes and was not shown on television (obviously, due to the ban on the estate of Moss Hart, the playwright). / producer / director who wrote the story and presented it for the first time on the New York stage during the Second World War (the reason for not showing it is difficult to understand more than 50 years after its creation). I no longer saw this film for more than 30 years, when someone who was the main actor of this film was able to get for me a bootleg copy of VHS (bad video quality, but good audio). My memory of this was correct: it was a fascinating and fascinating film to watch. An amazing aspect of this film is how many of its stars, just beginning their careers in 1944), have become either major movie stars, or at least famous and full-time actors (for example, Judy Holliday). Edmond O'Brien, Gene Crane, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Carl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman"), Reeves, Red Button, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill). The scenes with the Liberators of the B-24 are stunning, especially close-ups, where you can see the details of the giant (for that time) four-engined bomber (18,000+ produced then, and now almost extinct). A good understanding of the various levels of training that pilot cadets went through on their way to assigning bomber crews (of course, VERY gender biased, like the trend of the day: only men became pilots, women just supported them in their roles - hardly acceptable in the modern world ). I hope that someday it will be released on video for the new generation to enjoy.
