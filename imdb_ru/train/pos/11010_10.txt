When The Matrix appeared in 1999 and challenged existence and identity, it was expected that many films would use it as inspiration. Surprisingly, in fact this did not happen, and it took until 2002 for a film of a similar subject to appear. But to say that Cypher is a clone would be unfair to him. <br /> <br /> The story of Morgan Sullivan, who claims to work in a high-tech techno company called Digicorp. His job is to be a spy and get information about a competing company, being under a fictitious and false identification. His home life is perfectly normal, but he must lie to his wife about what he is actually doing. However, things begin to take a conspiracy, and before he finds out what is happening, he begins to doubt who he really is. It does not help the strange woman who appears ... <br /> <br /> Bends and turns in all directions make you absolutely fascinated, and in no case nothing seems far-fetched or incredible. <br /> This is an exciting journey in the not too distant future, and thanks to a good game, everything will keep you on the edge of your place. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
