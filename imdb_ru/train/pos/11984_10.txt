I have never seen a show as good as Full House. Full House puts all the new shows to shame, great time! Anyone who has never seen it, but I do not understand how it is possible, should see it. This is a great show for any age. Full House will make you laugh, make you cry, surprise you. True, some people feel that the show has some “raw” aspects, but the positive aspects weigh all the “raw” aspects. Full House held its first episode on September 22, 1987, entitled “Our First Show”, and on May 23, 1995, the last episode entitled “Michelle Rides Part II”. <br /> <br /> The plot of the show is very believable Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) lost his wife, Pam, in an accident involving a drunk driver. Danny has his son-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos), who is Pam's younger brother, and Danny also leads his best friend Joey Gladstone (Dave Cooler) to help him raise his three daughters. Danny's daughters are DJ (Candice Cameron-Bure), Stephanie (Jody Sweeten) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Joey and Jesse plan to move in with Danny and his three girls for a few months just to help and end up living with them for eight years; this is the number of years during which the show was shown. <br /> <br /> The following is a brief description of some of the characters and actor / actress who played him / her: John Stamos (Jesse): John Stamos is an excellent actor He plays Jesse. Jesse is a rock star waiting for her big break. In Full House, John Stamos perfectly shows his heroine. He looked and played music like his idol, Elvis Presley. <br /> <br /> Bob Saghet (Danny): Bob Saghet is also a great actor. He loses his wife in a car accident involving a drunk driver. He must grow three girls without a mother. Bob Saghet copes with the image of one of the parents who works full-time and who still have time to raise their three girls. <br /> <br /> Dave Kulier (Joey): One word can describe Dave Kulier, funny. He is great. Joey's character game was perfect for him. He perfectly plays the role of a standing comedian in anticipation of his big break. <br /> <br /> Candace Cameron-Bure (DJ): She's an amazing actress. She plays an older sister, a DJ, which is short for Donna Jo. She is one of the best actresses I've ever seen. Her acting skills at Full House were very believable. <br /> <br /> Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie): Two simple words can describe Jodie Sweetin, incredibly amazing! I wish I could say everything I would like to say about Jody, but I would use a maximum of 1000 words just for her. She got her start in a children's show called “The Stories of the Goose,” and when she came to Full House, she blew the minds of viewers and creators. Her gorgeous looks and absolutely amazing acting ability helped make the show a success. According to Dave Kulje, Jody was supposed to be the star of the show. It was supposed to be where she was going to take a big break. Jody, when she was five years old, when the show first went on the air, could play each line perfectly. She showed great enthusiasm. Most small children cannot do this. As you probably guessed, Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie) is my favorite character in Full House. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle): a great actress. Full House is what they started with. They got the role of Michel, because they were the only children who didn't cry in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> There are still many actors to be recognized. These are the original characters of the time when the series first aired in 1987. <br /> <br /> The only negative I can say is how Full House became Michelle Shaw near the end. I think it was focused on her towards the end. Especially when I think Jody and Candace were much better at acting. <br /> <br /> Full House is a great show for everyone. It can teach you a lot. One of the most important things he can teach you is that everyone can live a great life, even if a tragedy happens, such as losing a family member. Full House continues to attract new fans. With all this in mind, it only remains to say a couple of things; Full House will never die, and, thank you, the cast of Full House, for giving all the shows that they can enjoy.
