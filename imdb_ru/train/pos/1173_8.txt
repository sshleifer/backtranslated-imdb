The Night of the Living Homeless was a pretty strong conclusion to the first half of the 11th season. Obviously, this is a parody of various zombie films, especially Dawn of the Dead, this episode compares the homeless with the living dead, like creatures that feed and flourish from unnecessary change, and not from the brain. <br /> <br /> Kyle is accused of a sudden outbreak of homeless people, when out of the goodness of his heart he gives $ 20 to the homeless in front of his apartment building. More and more homeless people are beginning to penetrate South Park until the city is completely captured by them. This is a very strong episode of Randy Marsh, as he assumes the role of a shotgun leader, adults, who are hiding on the roof of the Park County Community Center. But before Randy gets to the community center, hundreds of homeless people come to him, and he shouts cheerfully: “I don’t have any changes!” Unfortunately, the refugees end up losing Gerald Broflofsky to the homeless when he tries to escape, catching the bus for city, and unwittingly throws all their changes on the bus to distract the homeless. Then he becomes one of them, asking everyone for a change. <br /> <br /> The boys are trying to figure out why there are so many homeless people in South Park, and find someone who is the director of homeless people. They find out that in the nearby city of Evergreen there was a similar problem with the homeless, so they flee to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve this problem. Unfortunately, the homeless rush into this man’s house, and he tries to get out of the easy way by shooting himself. However, he fails several times, shooting himself in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder, shouting terribly until he finally dies. Perhaps this scene was more ridiculous if such a scene had not happened in the “Fantastic Easter Promotion” two weeks ago. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, one of the refugees discovered that due to a problem with homelessness, the value of the property has plummeted. thus the bank expelled his house, making him homeless. Randy immediately turns to him, putting a gun to the man’s head. When the man finally begs the rest to spend a few dollars to help him, Randy pulls the trigger. <br /> <br /> In Evergreen, boys learn that city residents have sent homeless people to South Park, and that the homeless transition from city to city takes place across the country. The boys rework a bus that takes homeless people from South Park and delivers them to Santa Monica, California. <br /> <br /> Parallels with zombie movies and Randy Marsh’s gorgeous lines make this movie truly replayable. , 8/10
