Sometimes it’s hard to say exactly why a movie is so effective. From the moment I first stumbled upon The Stone Boy, something told me that it would be a great movie. Despite this, it seemed unlikely that I would ever have the opportunity to see it on my own experience. Then, one day, while browsing the online catalog of my local library, I saw that they had recently purchased a DVD release of this film. For which I am very happy, because the cinematography has an amazing depth and quality that the old VHS copy can never reproduce. <br /> <br /> Speaking of cinematography, I have to highlight it both far and higher. The most amazing aspect of this movie. As a photographer who sticks to the almost exact visual style depicted in The Stone Boy, I firmly believe in the fact that a great cinematographer can practically carry a film alone. Here an extremely talented actor and director, who perfectly understands what is needed for this story, helps him a lot. But the presence of Juan Ruiz Anchii behind the camera makes almost every scene something beautiful. And you almost never can say so. Most movies would never have expected this from you. A scene behind the scene captures some of the details, a bit of visual magic that is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Director Christopher Kane made a long and interesting career. As far as I can tell, this film is not very revealing. But sometimes, in order to catch the director at the beginning of his career, in front of all the big budgets and loss of focus, you can find real fine magic. Cain retreats in this film, allowing things to live their own lives, and then on. As in the early films of John Sales, characters are given space to breathe, time to talk. Side stories happen because they exist, and that is life. In this film, Cain demonstrates a wonderful, rough, even frankly painful understanding of human nature. <br /> <br /> The acting game links most of this story. When people say, when they exist in this film, they do it like real people, not restrained by the fact that they play characters. Gina Berrio's screenplay allows incredibly talented and respected actors, such as Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Frederick Forrest, to spend time simply existing. Regardless of what they say, they are insignificant or have deep meaning, it all comes down to the weight of pure reality. <br /> <br /> When you look at the actors involved in the project, or at the excellent soundtrack of James Horner, it seems strange that such a film will be almost forgotten. Perhaps a lot of what makes the "Stone Boy" in the meantime in which it was made. This 1970s hangover feeling that reminds me a lot of my childhood. People talk about the 80s in terms of modern style and music, but these are not the 80s in which I lived or remember. The appearance of the images, the understated and dark knowledge of the quality of the game and the overall result should fall under the skin of any person who grew up in or near this era of time in North America. I see myself in it. I see how I saw the world. And such a film as “The Stone Boy” sees the world as it really is. <br /> <br /> To learn more about this, see <br /> <br /> “Black Stallion” (1979), Never Cry, Wolf (1983), “Gentle Mercy” (1983), “ Testament "(1983)," Places in the Heart "(1984), Matevan (1987)," Tide "(1987)," Driving Miss Daisy "(1989)," The Secret Garden "(1993)" The Secret of Roan Inish "(1994 ), Wendy and Lucy (2008)
