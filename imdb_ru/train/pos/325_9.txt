This is a great film - especially when compared with the sometimes tedious seriousness of modern politically minded directors. Nowadays, a film that easily combines sex, gender, politics and art is rare. Although the optimism of the 1960s cannot be restored, I think that at least we can learn a lesson from the fresh energy and charm of the film. I don’t know that those who called the film “boring” watched — there are so many things in it that it never remains the same film more than 15 minutes at a time.
