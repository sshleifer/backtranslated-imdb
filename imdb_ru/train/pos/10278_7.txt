“House of Games” is definitely not without its drawbacks - holes in the plot, tough game, final scenes - but they do little to distract from the pleasure of watching a thriller that so methodically spoils your head. “House Of Games” does almost everything a good thriller has to do. Of course, this is not a huge feat, given the fact that we are dealing with the world of people of trust and the minuses that they make. Therefore, it is clear that we never know what is actually happening, although we think we know. But this is what makes the film useful for those who play; a movie for which repeated viewing is condescension instead of necessity. <br /> <br /> This has Hitchcock's certain inclination to it. The film is based on some similar themes, and his work Marnie, released in 1964, was considered a misfire upon release, but is now considered one of the most provocative works of the Master. It would be easy to assume that the character of Lindsay Crows is the same as the Tippi Hedrin character ... perhaps ten years later. Both are strong-willed singles, both with compulsive behavior that forces them to go too close to the shark pool. As Croesus' depressed, cruel character says: "What kind of life without adventures?" Put your reality check on a low level and enjoy swimming with sharks!
