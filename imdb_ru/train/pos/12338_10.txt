Joan Fontaine plays the role of a villain in this Victorian film. She convincingly plays a married woman who has a lover, and also targets the rich man Miles Rushworth, played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is pretty good, like Miles. Miss Fontaine brought her role to perfection - at the same time she was sly, prudent, innocent in appearance, scared and charming. It takes an actress with an extraordinary talent to make it happen. Joan Fontaine looked absolutely gorgeous in elegant suits by Travis Banton. Also in the film is Joan's mother, Lilian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I highly recommend this movie.
