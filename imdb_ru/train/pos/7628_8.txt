This film is one of those "WOW!" films. Not because it is the greatest film of all time, but because it surprised me. It was not only the T.V. film, but also Elvis. I can safely say that there were as many imitators as there was only one Elvis, but I can also say with confidence that Kurt Russell was very close to being real. It was one of the greatest imitations I've ever seen. He made me believe that this is really him. I learned a lot about Elvis life after watching this movie. And do not keep the TV part that allows you to go astray - this is really a fantastic movie! And Kurt Russell could be Elvis's twin :)
