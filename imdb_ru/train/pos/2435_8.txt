I never thought that the old cartoon will cause tears in my eyes! When I first bought Casper & Friends: Spooking About Africa, I really wanted to see Casperâ€™s very first cartoon called Friendly Ghost (1945), but when I saw the next cartoon, Good Boos To Night (1948) made me break! I could not believe how sad and tragic it was after the fox Casper was killed! I have never seen anything like it in other Casper cartoons! This is the saddest of all! It was so frustrating that I just could not watch it again. It's like seeing Lassie die at the end of a movie. I know that this is a classic, but for us, old cartoon fans, it's too much to cope like me! If I wanted to see something old and classic, I would prefer to see something fun and funny! But when I think about this Kasper cartoon, I think about my cats!
