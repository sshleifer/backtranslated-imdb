Soylent Green I found a great movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Logan's Run, you will like it. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is old, and there are no special effects in it and some of the acting is best described as “stupid,” but the story is great. <br /> <br /> The story of how the world can be, and its impact on society, is very sharp. <br /> <br /> In the end, the mystery was not a mystery, but the story unfolded easily and at the right pace. <br /> <br /> The closest modern equivalent would be the “Dark Angel” in how the US shows. be a third world country.
