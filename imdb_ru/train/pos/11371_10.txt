This is really a wonderful part of the cinematic achievement. From the very beginning, I was completely fascinated by the (true) story, when Lieutenant Viktor Burakov (Stefan Ree) cries, performing an autopsy of the remains of children's bodies. This is a wonderful story of Andrei Chikatilo, played well by Jeffrey De Mann (Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to feel sorry for him until we remember who he is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexander Bukhanovsky, who was wonderfully played by Max Von Sydow, was absolutely believable in all details, and what he says when he speaks of paranoia in the Soviet Union becomes too obvious from the behavior of the local communist commissioner Bondarchuk, played by Joss Ackland. For me, however, the outstanding performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a truly outstanding actor he is. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI so closely watched and admired his work. This film puts the "Silence of the Lambs" in the shadow of the atmospheric and gloomy Soviet landscape to the superb performances of all participants. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 10/10
