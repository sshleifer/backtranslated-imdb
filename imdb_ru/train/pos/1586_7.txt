Rozenshtrasse is an intimate film rather than one of the epic scales that could hold many viewers looking for a similar plot for a pianist. Fortunately, von Trotta, a good screenwriter, chooses a feminist look in an era illustrated too much on his colorful appearance, but too little analyzed from the point of view of proximity and from the point of view of an ordinary Aryan German, and not from a Jewish point of view. Rozentrasse finds his strength in this irreplaceable burden of people who fall into the historical circumstances of which they fall victim. The pace of the film is introspective, painfully slow, meditative. In addition, the characters are very bright, while the transitions between generations and time were cleverly passed. Rozenshtrasse is not a masterpiece, and some of the shortcomings of the narrative are clearly distinguishable. Another mistake is the trivial cinematography, unable to grasp the intensity of the inner drama that the characters are experiencing. However, this movie is worth seeing. Finally, Rozenshtrasse is part of the latest trend in German films, which tells about the ghosts of a dreadful past, a trend that includes such wonderful films as “Nowhere in Africa” and, more recently, the controversial “Fall”. I would recommend this film to those who can read off-screen.
