This is the best film I've ever seen in a long time. This is not only the best movie of its kind (school shooting). The way Ben Kochchio (director) decided to make a movie was great. He filmed this using teenage actors who still attended high school. He shot it in his own rooms and used real parents of actors as his parents in the film. In addition, the actors also filmed using video cameras, which looked like a video diary. It is almost cunning. (If this is really a word) There are a few blunders, for example, when Cal calls Brads (?) Land Rover Range Rover (or vice versa, it has been some time since I saw it)
