For those of us baby boomers who arrived too late to appreciate James Dean and others. al., Martin Sheen showed us the “Path” in this remarkable feature. <br /> <br /> The idea is quite simple: a cool hood meets the sheriff of a small town, and All-Hell follows it, but the essence of this film is fascinating. We all have a car nut. <br /> <br /> No, this is not Casablanca and not great literature, but this is a serious film about cars, uprisings and geniuses of Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is, and for what Martin will become. I liked it when this movie grew up as a teenager in the 70s, and so did you.
