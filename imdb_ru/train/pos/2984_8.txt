David Zucker shot one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this stupid farce. Yes, this is a matter of acquired taste and depends on the wealth of Sophia jokes, but it is always funny, unlike some recent comedy works. The film is filled with all sorts of jokes, starting from the obvious and ending with a more subtle look: you have to pay attention to everything in the frame, otherwise you will probably miss them. Like his previous attempts, including “Airplane!”, “Top Secret!” And “Naked Gun”, humor crashes almost every second. There are so many things that work, it's easy to lose sight of a few unsuccessful ones. What distinguishes this film from other pale imitations in the genre of "fake" is the fact that it has a real storyline. While others depended on making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random films (take “Mafia!”, Please), this film tells a new story with cute characters. It touches sports films in general, and also makes fun of the real sports industry instead of using any specific films. Even for people who are not indifferent to South Park, its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make up a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry. The film also uses the roles of athletes, sports announcers, and other celebrities extremely effectively, especially the funny role with Robert Stack in Unsolved Mysteries. By the way, do not forget about the final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. In general, Zucker achieved, in words, perhaps using a mixture of film sports, home dunk.
