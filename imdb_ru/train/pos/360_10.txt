11 Oscar nominations and zero wins !!! I still do not understand why - this is not how the actors in the film after that did better, that you can do it by giving them awards for trivial roles, as was done with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery , Danny Glover, etc. - all this was amazing - I am curious to get scenarios of discussions at the Oscars that year ...... this should fall into the category of “Ysada-byda-kada” for judges .... <br /> <br /> This is an amazing book - but despite the writing style of Alice Walker, she has the feeling that she is exaggerating her characters - the poet I am so glad that their screen version brought out a few things. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was awesome - African scenes live as we would like - the African part of the book should be in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - BUT, no! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so stupid that they can't think of Africa outside of safari - so yes, there should have been a free scene of “Zebra” and wildlife when we all know that there is no West Africa ---- and most of all why do people speak Swahili --- who in West Africa speak Swahili ?? I just needed to get this out of the way ....... <br /> <br /> But as the story is awesome, the filmmaking is from this world - CLASSIC yes !! <br /> <I have it, and I watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation.
