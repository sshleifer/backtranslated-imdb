Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It is interesting to observe how the United States so little respects the world leader (such as Chavez), who supports poor people in his country. His worst "sin", in my opinion, is the care of those who are at the bottom of the trunk. What could be so bad about this? I have always been fascinated by the reaction of the US government + media to Fidel Castro. At first, Castro was a good guy (circa 1959), when he ousted Batista. However, Castro soon began to turn corporations in Cuba to the needs of poor, not fat cats. We are a worthy country, but why does our media and government have such a problem in order to share with the poor? If these guys are “dictators”, then we could use more “dictatorships”, especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.
