This is the beginning of a new and interesting Star Trek series. He has a "down-to-earth" feeling, similar to a darker and less "boring" set design. <br /> <br /> Characters need more time to develop, but they have potential. One thing that is rather disappointing (with all the Star Trek series really) is that they depict such a grim picture of equality between men and women in the future, when they paint a very positive picture about everything else. (Earth stopped war, famine, etc.) <br /> <br /> Female characters - two, the commander of the volcano T'Pol and the communications officer Hoshi, a man. Hoshi is rather weak, and T'Pol is created to be a "Vulcan kid." <br /> <br /> Some of the crew’s views seem too American (as opposed to the TNG crew’s more international experience), but it creates an interesting dynamic. <br /> <br /> A very good pilot, albeit for a very good series.
