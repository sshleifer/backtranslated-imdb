Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed Baron, a fantastic series about three superhuman spies who supplanted Six Million Dollar Man. It was my favorite movie when I was little, and I still like to watch it. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had an unmistakable screen chemistry like Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while juicy Alexandra Bastedo showed her role in the role of Sharron Macready. The late Anthony Nichols made the tremendously coarse Tremaine. Of course, the best episodes were scripts written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner's own “Interrogation” differed favorably from “The Prisoner”. I regret that there has never been a second series; there is so much life left in the concept. Will Craig and Richard be rivals for Sharron's love? What if Tremayne found out about the power of the Champions? Did the Champions have any other abilities besides those we saw? We have not learned, alas.
