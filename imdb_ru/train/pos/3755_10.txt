I remember this movie many years ago. Of course, the best film on this topic in my experience. The fact that I remember so many films very well after such a long time testifies to its influence. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to comment on the level of speeches due to the language barrier. But they, nevertheless, were very influential. <br /> <br /> This item continues to fascinate us over the years. And it was most effectively handled here, with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticism. <br /> <br /> I would like it to be shown on TV at least once. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Or is it? Is there a copy of it in an archive of feature films?
