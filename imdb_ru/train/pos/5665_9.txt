I had them from the first show. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity County. Sleepy little Mayberry-like place with one little difference. The sheriff is really Satan. There is a spoiler. Not that you still don't understand in 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Yes, but that's not all. It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people try to keep it in good condition, but it's a tough battle. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows who Caleb is and loves to spend time with him teaching him the ways of darkness. Thin. Sneaky. He doesn't always look evil. Most of the time he is a hero. Everyone owes him a great service, because he often arranges disasters and saves them from it. Therefore, every time you think that someone will finally kill him, one of his friends appears from nowhere to sabotage him. <br /> <br /> In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb were in the woods in the cockpit and some guys with guns decided to rob them. Lucas used this as a pretext to teach Caleb a lesson about evil. <br /> <br /> The robber (Ted) did not dare shoot them. Lucas told Caleb that Ted is semi-conscious. If he had no conscience, he would have already shot them. If he had a real conscience, he would never have become a criminal. So he started calling him Half-Ted. That was pretty funny. He was teasing criminals. And, of course, he was always 10 steps ahead of Paul Ted. And, of course, he was always under complete control. In fact, they supported you by Satan. <br /> <br /> Very, very good show. it was one of my favorite horror shows of all time. Night pursuer of the Twilight Zone Circle of Fear American Gothic Supernatural <br /> <br /> It's a good company.
