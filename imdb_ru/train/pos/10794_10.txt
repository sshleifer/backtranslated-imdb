I always liked to see Chuck Norris in the movies. Although the action may not be superb, the fighting scenes are fantastic. I also liked to see Judson Mills perform next to him. In my opinion, the Norris brothers have established themselves as great artists, and this was another great performance! I hope you take the time to watch this movie!
