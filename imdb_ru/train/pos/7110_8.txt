John Garfield plays a Marine, blinded by a grenade during the battle of Guadalcanal, who must learn to live with his disability. He has all the stereotypes of blindness, and he is confident that he will be a burden for everyone. Hospital staff and wounded marines cannot reach him. His girlfriend can not go home in the performance of Eleonora Parker. He is stubborn and blinded by his own fears, self-pity and prejudice. This is a difficult role that Garfield plays unforgettably in a great performance that makes a person watch, despite the syrup-like melodrama that is always present. The best scenes on Guadalcanal, where he is in a machine gun nest, trying to repel the advancing Japanese soldiers in a hellish battle at night, and then sleeping in a hospital where he sees himself walking on a train platform with a white cane, dark glasses and holding out a tin cup, while his girlfriend is moving back from the camera.
