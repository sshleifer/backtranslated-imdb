After watching the movie "Liberation" films such as "Pulp Fiction", do not seem quite so extreme. Maybe by today's standards of blood and bullets, it doesn't seem so sharp, but if you think that it was 1972 and that the film has a really sinister core, then it makes you think differently. <br /> <br /> When I started Watching this movie, nothing much seemed out of the ordinary, until I got on the stage of "Duel Banjo". In this scene, the brutality and the brink of this film are really visible. When I watched Drew (Ronnie Cox, Robocop) come face to face with a backward young guy, it really shows how sharp these films can be. When you think that a child has a small banjo, which he probably could have made by hand, compared to Drew's good, expensive guitar, you really understand how there are four men in their territory. <br /> <br /> As the plot goes, it is very believable and never goes beyond. But what really distinguishes this film about four businessmen who earn more than they hoped for in a canoe trip is that director John Boorman (Excalibur) relieves all the characters from simple cartoons or stereotypes. So, when the film falls into complete horror and anxiety, I really cared about all four men and what happened to them. <br /> <br /> The acting is generally excellent. With John Voight (Midnight Cowboy, state enemy) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights, Striptease) in the lead role. John Voight makes probably the most difficult part of this film, and this makes his transformation from a family man into a warrior very plausible. Unlike Reynolds, whose character is a warrior from the start, the Voig character is transformed throughout the entire film. Ned Beatty (Life) is also good at an extremely heavy role, he is raped recklessly, while Ronnie Cox plays a believable view. <br /> <br /> One thing that really made these films strong for me was that the villains were as terrifying as everyone I've ever seen. Bill McKinney and Herbert "Cowboy" The Coward were excellent and extremely intimidating, like those of the redneck. <br /> <br /> Overall, the delivery was excellent and I recommend it to everyone except people with a weak stomach and children. 10/10 Watch this movie.
