Blimey! this is a good movie! The acting was not good at all, but if you look at some moments of the film, rewind and look again, it is brilliant! The man at the beginning of the film comes with a suitcase against three. WOW! I never expected this. Then he puts the coke in a suitcase and runs away. I bet that the smoking guy against these three was one of his comrades who later sold the drugs. And the brilliant quotes: “Good shades, I need a pair,” “they are yours ... if you think you can take them ...”, just great! And the fight is the best I've seen lately. Look at the second guy he kills after hitting the head of the first guy on the table. WHAT HIT! And in the middle of the movie, one guy in the car shot once, then 3 guys fall, he really takes good aim. Hiring guys like him costs a lot of money. The end was brilliant, it was so exciting that James Cahill walked 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shot Jason Peters after his distracting steps. Jason Peters falls and turns over again while he is dead! I can’t say more about how good this movie is!
