For Muslim women in West Africa, married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard. The community cannot directly approve such behavior, but equally it may not yet be ready to consider it as criminal, which, of course, allows it to continue. Fortunately, the letter of the Cameroonian law promises equality for all, and this documentary tells about the real exploits of various women practitioners in the legal system of Cameroon when they are trying to ensure justice for some women and children. What is remarkable (except for the inspiring central story) is how, despite their informality, the courts are indeed pragmatically progressive if the case is really bought. The program also gives a fascinating insight into the whole lifestyle in Cameroon, which (besides the horrendous crimes committed in the cases shown) seems surprisingly emotional and joyous compared to those enjoyed by people in Europe or North America. And although I admit that this comment may be naive on my part, this attitude seems to be reflected in the delightful pidgin-English they speak. Overall, this is a terrific little movie, and it's much more fun to watch than you can imagine.
