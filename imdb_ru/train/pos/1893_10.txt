Although it is certainly politically incorrect to be entertained drunk, there is such a charm in Dudley Mooreâ€™s image of the attractive and magnificent Arthur Bach that one cannot help but feel this unique and wonderful character. As you are not entertained by this infectious laugh, giggle and complete nonsense. Although I am not really a fan of Liza Minnelli, she was really great in the role of Linda Marolla, and I could not imagine anyone else in this role. Sir John Gilgud was the heart of the film and deserved his Oscar. The rest of the cast is also great, and this great tune "Arthur's Theme", wow. Truly, it was one of the best comedies of the 1980s. Great movies get better with each viewing, as in the case of "Arthur".
