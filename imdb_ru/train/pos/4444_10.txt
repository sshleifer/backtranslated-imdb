Most Italian horror lovers seem to hate this film because it has nothing to do with the first two Demons films. And with “Demons III” in the title, one would assume that it would be. The problem is that this film was never meant to be part of the Demons series. Distributors only "Demons III" above its original name "Ogre" to earn on the popularity of other films. New American DVD-release of this picture is called "Demons III: Ogre" on the cover, but the film itself says only "Ogre". I don’t know if in past releases the title “Demons III” was on the film itself, but this new release seems like a white lie. If you can get past the “Demons III” in the title, you might like the “Ogre”. It starts with a creep intro and remains pretty creepy. There are no blood and movies, films are slow, but I still dug. Just do not expect it to be like other Demons films. I give Ogre 7 out of 10. Italian fans should try this.
