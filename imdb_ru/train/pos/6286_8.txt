passed in 60 seconds Where I started, it keeps you in the film with some good performances and some cool cars. people say that this is not a very good film, I do not agree with the fact that there are some stupid roles in it, and what is not the action movie. I gave him 8 of 10 reasons for action and comic relief, if you like Rock or Face Off than this film, your sentinel cell is an excellent job with one of the most underrated actors in my head Del Roy Lindo. I think that sometimes people look at the movies, sometimes they need to sit back and enjoy the movie, and after words ask themselves if they have achieved what they are showing. that is, if they are going to act, it was an action pact. if they tried to make a film to change the way they made films and tried to win every reward, okay? I think that they did an action movie that they intended to do, give him a chance and you will not regret it.
