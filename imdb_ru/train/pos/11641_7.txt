I just caught an episode about Brad, a crack cocaine addict who turned to drug addiction in the streets after his cyclist career went down in ruins as quickly as it began. I have to say that the story of his cycling career was more heartbreaking than his addiction. This young guy who wins left and right cycling races, and he is invited to train with the Olympic training team for two weeks, and immediately upon arrival he insults Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes who has ever lived, and, as a rule , callous and unfriendly. all in general. It is clear that soon he was asked to leave. Most of the show talks about his struggle with addiction and how he regained his life, but I wanted to know what was wrong with him, first, that his act was such an ass? <br /> <br /> In any case, I was puzzled by how the show was organized, as it shows Brad in the midst of his addiction. We see his footage when he sleeps in ditches and ditches and even smokes crack cocaine. I didn't even know what it was legal to show, but why would the film crew just follow him and shoot it? Do they do it in the hope that this guy will turn his life around and give them material for a good television episode? <br /> <br /> In any case, this is an instructive show, because it shows the influence of various dependencies and the total control that they can take over the lives of people. Sometimes it’s hard to look at it, because you really see how families and friends are suffering in the face of the addict’s indifference, although I have to admit that in the end everything seems too clear. During the episodes, there are cases when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but nevertheless, and maybe I should warn about the spoilers here, at the end everything looks too joyful, and I have a feeling that this is a very unusual phenomenon. in real life. But, nevertheless, this is a show about people trying to help others, and you can never complain too much about something like that ??
