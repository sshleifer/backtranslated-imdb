This is a good show, and I find it funny. Finally, the bad Latin stereo types are over! Gracias, Señor Lopez! I love this show, and I just started watching it about three months ago. The whole concept of the family’s television show of the Latin family struck me. I am surprised that Latin Americans finally have a good chance of being on television. This show is perhaps the best I've ever seen, it is funny, emotional, touchy and pleasant.
