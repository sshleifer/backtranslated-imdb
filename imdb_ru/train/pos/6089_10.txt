Well, I overestimated this a bit to compensate for at least one of these shrewd reviews. But I liked it. I did not laugh out loud, but it interested me and fascinated me, not leaving me at any moment. The story is built. Yes, you knew that this would have a happy ending - this genre is always there. Meanwhile, it was strange with sights that you might have missed, so be careful when you look. Stiller and Black did it again. Good team. They need to work more together. I do not know that it will be a cult classic, but, of course, it was a fun trip. Not as good as what about BOB or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, but what is it? Still worth a little get off the road to watch and watch this movie.
