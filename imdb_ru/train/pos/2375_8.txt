I sincerely think that it was the best version of the war of the worlds I have ever seen. it was funny, but it was also informative, I learned a lot about the film, and if I could, I knew from this film. my favorite part was when the soldiers killed the robot, and the other came right behind it. in the last world war for cinema, I think it should have been more like the first and would have been better. but in any case, I give this movie 2 fingers up. <br /> <br /> and if they make another such film, I will definitely watch it. <br /> <br /> thanks
