A surprisingly unusual film with enough turns for a pretzel bag. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother who may or may not be what she seems. The story is very boring, and the dialogue is skillfully understated. A hint of humor and intrigue, none of which exceed the characteristics of Posey so well. The supporting cast star. Back side? This film needs your full attention, almost to the point of stopping and writing notes. Posey has a greater sexual attractiveness when raising eyebrows than most actresses in the whole body. It is worth your time, even if you do not understand the denouement.
