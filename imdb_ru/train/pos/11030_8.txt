Watching Cliffhanger makes me nostalgic about the early 90s, when almost every new action movie could be described as “Die Hard in a / on a”. Cliffhanger is “Die Hard on the Mountain,” and it's pretty good for what it is. <br /> <br /> But unlike Passenger 57 and Under Siege, which are worthy Die Hard clones on their own terms, Cliffhanger dispenses with the feeling of many militants and breathtaking landscapes that, in their vastness, threaten to crush and Trivialize the conflicts of people fighting and dying among the peaks. <br /> <br /> Years before other films, such as Simple Plan and Simple Plan. Fargo dramatized crime and murder in snowy places, director Cliffhanger Renny Harlin acknowledged the visual impact of comparing the brutal violence and the dark struggle for survival with the cold and indifferent natural environment. <br /> <br /> The first sequence has already received significant praise, all that it deserves: its intensity allows us to forget about the art of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we see is really happening. Even Harlin’s shot from a falling scarecrow, which is very effective, but still threatens to become too big a joke (and which he repeated in the Deep Blue Sea), or Ralph Wate’s ridiculous expression on his face, can not weaken the power of consistency. <br /> <br /> The next impressive story is a shootout and robbery on board the aircraft. As Stallone and Michael France and director Harlin wrote, the audience plunges into action, initially not knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not: the bloody double crosses are completely unexpected. As Roger Ebert noted, the stuntman who made the air flight between the planes deserves special recognition. <br /> <br /> Later, during an avalanche, one of the terrorists / thieves seems to really fall as a wall of snow carries it away from the mountain. As far as I know, no one was killed in the process of making this film (a small miracle, given the extreme nature of some tricks), so it is obvious that a mannequin was used for the shot. But the picture itself remains impressive, because we are wondering how Harlin (or rather, one of the directors of the second block) knew exactly where to place the camera. <br /> <br /> I will take Sly Stallone as my action hero any day of the week, because he is one of the few movie stars I have ever seen, who is completely convincing as a person who can endure a lot of physical and emotional pain and at the same time really feels this pain. Gabe Walker's role really complements Stallone's strengths: he plays the older, more vulnerable militant hero, demonstrating an impressively restrained game as a mountain rescuer who must save himself. <br /> <br /> Unlike many of today's post-matrix action-heroes, inspired by comics, Stallone Walker is an ordinary person who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer skills. In Cliffhanger, the hero almost freezes, and his clothes begin to show big tears when he barely avoids one dangerous situation after another. He flinches when he is beaten, and bleeds when he is cut, especially in a sequence of caves, when he hits Rocky from one of the villains of a rabid dog. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the evil villains really contribute to the effectiveness of the film: when I first saw this film as a teenager, I was rooting for the good guys at every turn and foresaw when the other bad guy would bite the dust (or rather, ice); At some point, I actually welcomed it, since one of the coolest characters in the film deservedly suffered a violent demise. <br /> <br /> Litgow’s British accent is just as unconvincing as a random sample of a plane or helicopter model, but he is in fact a good actor and one of the few who can perfectly talk silly dialogues: in one scene, looking at his hostages Stallone and Rucker, trying to decide which tasks to give them, he actually says: “You stay! You bring it! "Even a better actor such as Anthony Hopkins might have problems with this line. <br /> <br /> Even if Cliffhanger occasionally throws off trust, he does it only for a more entertaining show. <Br /> <br /> For example, at the beginning of the film, Lithgow openly says to one of his people: “Retire when he comes down.” No real criminal mastermind would make this mistake even unconsciously: his carelessness allows Rucker to shout out a warning to Slyu on the rock, and this speeds up the exciting rope pulling between Stallone and the bad guys trying to knock him off. The rope is tied to his leg. <br /> <br /> Lytgow could have given his order in a more subtle way, but the sequence might not be so funny if Rooker was not given the opportunity to openly challenge his captor's arrogance. <br /> <br /> Made very much in the style of a Saturday matinee or (sometimes) western, Cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that he experiences some weak elements that could have undermined the smaller film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned earlier, weaknesses include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor kits with REALLY artificial snow, as well as two other bat scenes and wolves that seem unnecessary in already filled with action narration. Finally, Harlin’s decision to shoot some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless, as the technique gives nothing for the scenes. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Stallone is too old for the militants, because his character in this film seems so believable that it inevitably makes me wonder what he will be years later. But perhaps it’s best that Cliffhanger stand alone all the time without a sequel: there are already enough tired and outdated franchises. There was an unofficial sequel that called itself Vertical Limit: compared to this clinker, Cliffhanger is on the Top 250 IMDb list. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8 (Very good, especially considering most other Stallone films.)
