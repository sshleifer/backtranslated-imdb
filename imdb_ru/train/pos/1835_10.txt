What an outstanding film I can't describe with words. I do not know how it turns out that the rating of the film is 7.3, it should be 9.3, but in any case, no one can make this film, and the game Akshay is just outstanding, the second half of the film makes you cry, and the film is really good unexpected finale that makes a movie perfect. You should watch this movie once, I think, well, that's your business. In any case, I love this film, and it’s not just sad and funny, but it also gives you really good values ​​and what you should do, so I think this is one of the best films in the history of Bollywood. but I know that people have respect, so the only thing I don’t like about this movie is that the music is good, the background music is good, but the songs are not good enough, I think the music would be better if AR Rahman was a music director, but in any case we can not do anything about it, so I.
