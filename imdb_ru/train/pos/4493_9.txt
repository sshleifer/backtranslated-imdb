This is a great film about a traditional working-class family in Northern England. Filmed on the spot in Bolton, he plays James Mason as his father, who is the dominant force in his house. Or so it seems. Cleverly, the film based on the play portrays the complexities of family life. The cast is also amazing, many familiar faces provide support.
