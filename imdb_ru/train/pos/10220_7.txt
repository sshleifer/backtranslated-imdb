This fun line is typical of what these naughty sisters say. (This is funny in itself and rather funny, also unintentionally.) Only two sisters are really bad. Boy, they are bad too! One is given in a pinup pose and lustful comments wherever she goes. Another stood up to look like Marilyn Monroe. She has these sensual, slightly parted lips. And in order not to give anything away, it is even worse than others. <br /> <br /> All three sisters play asterisks. The man who stumbles upon their lives is played by John Bromfield. Today he is something of a career. <br /> <br /> It looks like maybe the first mainstream porn core ever on the market. Well, of course, not the first, but the most fashionable at the time. <br /> <br /> Girls wear as little as possible, and let's not forget about the female: Bromfield is shown a razor with an electric razor, whose fetish was it? - with a bare chest. He is also shown wet in a bathing suit. <br /> <br /> There is a real conspiracy here too: the family of girls, you see, cursed. They are prone to suicide - or dramatic death, which may seem suicidal. <br /> <br /> The film is not bad. I really do not know where it was shown. Maybe it was made for entries. Anyway, and I could be wrong, I felt that the typical male audience was not the main goal here. Women are poorly dressed. They often resemble dark covers of magazines such as Police Detective or jackets from kopeck novels. <br /> <br /> But this guy seems to be the center of attention. Not everyone in the film likes it, but all the girls love it. And I think that the audience is also intended. <br /> <br /> This is very fun - and on its own terms.
