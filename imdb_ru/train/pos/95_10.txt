Yes, I have a copy of it on VHS, in excellent condition, which I transferred to DVD, and if someone wants to bring back memories of the Christmas classics, send me an email at dmd2222@verizon.net.i, where I searched everywhere and I didnâ€™t find anything for it, and I thought that I could not be the only one on this planet who has this classic on a tape, there must be other people, and if they do, I will approach them because very few have this classic, so I consider myself lucky and I have all the dolls for Christmas, except the one that John De ver made with dolls again, I think it's called Smokey Mountain holiday, I'm not sure, but it's close.
