It was felt that this was very balanced, showing what Jehovah's Witnesses did to protect American freedoms. It also showed the firm faith of two families who witnessed the first generation. I also commended the way he showed how the formation of Jehovah's Witness affects family members who are not witnesses, and how difficult it is for them to accept the fact that they don’t celebrate holidays, the sad part is that families don’t those who are witnesses do not think about having their own family of witnesses for family dinners / visits or giving them presents at any time other than holidays or birthdays. When it comes to medical care, witnesses want and expect a high level of medical care, people forget that blood transfusions allow for careless medical care and surgery, while bloodless treatment makes the medical team highly qualified and trained, would you prefer to treat your loved ones? I highly recommend this video!
