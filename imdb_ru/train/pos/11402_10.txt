I saw “American in Paris” in its first graduation, when I was still in school and immediately fell in love with him. I came back to see it again the next day and lost count of how many times I have seen it since, both in movies and on television. He uses some of the finest musical works and songs of the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century (George Gershwin), and represents the greatest men (Gene Kelly) and women (Leslie Caron) in Hollywood history. The supporting cast of Oscar Levant (oddly enough, as always), Georges Guberial (why he didn’t make more films?) And Nina Foch (brilliant in her unsympathetic role) are at the top of her form. The final ballet, superbly staged under the title music, makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of Paris, as well as the images of impressionists and post-impressionists. All songs by Gershwin are beautifully staged, but the most memorable are “It's very clear” (Karon and Kelly on the banks of the Seine) and “I got a rhythm” (children of Paris join Jean Kelly in “Une Chanson Americaine”) This movie. If you have never been to Paris, look at this. But look!
