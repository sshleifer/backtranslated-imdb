Why “Panic” never received a good theatrical release is easy to understand: she’s too clever, and the audience would probably have had difficulty comparing it with “American Beauty” in her study of the midlife crisis, as well as “The Soprano and analyze it ”in your study. illegal actions among family life. Although it may seem that panic stems from non-original material, the realistic characters of Brommel, combined with clever dialogue and observational direction, make the film a realistic look at the death of a middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy plays the role of Alex a hired killer working for the business of killing his father (Sutherland). He leads a double life with his wife (Ulman) and son, unaware of his real trade. In middle age, he is increasingly disgusted with what he has been doing all his life. Under his calm, collected facade, repressed indignation moves because of his father’s control over his life. When he meets a young woman (Campbell), he feels inspired and decides that it is time to quit the family business. <br /> <br /> The fact that the writer / director Henry Brommel decided to make a profession that his main character tried to destroy away from the murder contract is a one-time trade. He could easily replace him with any unwanted profession; his characters are so well developed and believable, the scenes are processed so smoothly and realistically, and the dialogues are written so astutely and naturally that the focus is on Macy’s conflicting nature, not on his work as a hired killer. The script of Brommel feels like a Shakespearean tragedy, with a specific theme of all destiny. <br /> <br /> In Alex, Macy creates a tragic, easily sympathetic character and turns into another thoughtful, excellent game, as always be expected. Donald Sutherland is also effectively abrasive and abusive as his overbearing father, and Ullman’s dramatic turn as Macy’s wife is a welcome change for a comedian. Consider a scene in a bike shop where its mood darkens slightly and reaches a peak in the scene that causes emotional confusion. <br /> <br /> Henry Brommel’s first feature, Panic, is a well-thought-out movie. We hope that thanks to the study of the characters, the first-class composition of the characters, a plausible scenario, a concise dialogue and good leadership, this is just a taste of Brommel’s inclination to create characters that seem real. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
