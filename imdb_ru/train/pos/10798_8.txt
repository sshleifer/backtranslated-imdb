I first saw this gem from Joe Sarno, and I must say that after seeing it, I will never forget Jennifer Wells. At first I thought the movie was moving a little slower than I had expected from the Sarno movie, but when Jennifer entered it, when I first saw her somewhere, I sat down and noticed. It is difficult to avoid her presence in this film, and she seasons every scene in which she participates. I saw most of the other Sarno films, as well as other films that starred Jennifer Wells, or with Jennifer Wells, and I must say that it was both Sarno and Jennifer in their team best. The directing of Sarno in this film about inner adult drama is excellent, and Jennifer showed (figuratively and literally) acting skills that make it a must-see. Colleagues in the film Rebecca Brooke (also known as Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan, both often met with Miss Wells, as well as the frequent stars of Sarno, turn into believable ideas as a pair of adventurous but normal housewives. This film is a classic Sarno.
