I immediately noticed that this film is really not based on the novel by Dodie Smith. In any case, it was a good idea that Pongo and Perdita’s son had their own puppies. The cutest of the Dalmatians was, of course, the little Snowball, which was completely flawless until the very end of the film. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I didn’t know what to think when Cruella de Ville seemed to have completely changed. In fact, I often thought that she could be friendly, but now that she had turned into “herself” so quickly and announced that she was Cruella again, I almost began to really worry about Chloe's Dalmatians. <Br /> <br /> In fact, the scene in which the puppies watched the Lady and the Stroller while Chloe and Kevin were having dinner had turned out to be much better than I expected. I also loved the parrot that played to be a dog, and it was incredible that dogs learned so many tricks for this film. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was pleased that in the end the Dalmatians were again saved, but I would like to know what was going to happen to Cruella after she lost all her property. And what can a dog house with such a huge amount of money actually do? <br /> <br /> Finally, it was very touching that Snowball also had spots at the very end of the film.
