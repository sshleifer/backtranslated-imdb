Solid film "B". <br /> <br /> I like Jake Weber. His understated supply is refreshing during superb performances. I liked the relationship between father and son. I liked the family dynamics. Wendigo looks silly, but this is an image of a baby toy and a dead deer. This union, you understand? This is a psychological story, not an instant gratification. Watch it and think about your inner child and what the film can tell you, and you will be fine. <br /> <br /> Great job.
