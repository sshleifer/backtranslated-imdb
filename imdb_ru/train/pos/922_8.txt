At least half an hour a week. I have not been interested in anything in the big three networks (ABC / CBS / NBC) for many years. All lions are interesting, although Larry can sometimes be annoying. I really like the figures of Middle-earth that they bring with Hunter. Most of the other characters are interesting too. Siegfried and Roy's party is also sometimes interesting. The animation is top notch, and definitely the best computer graphics that was made on the weekly TV show. Usually, when they hire big names to star in a show, they try to hide a bad script or characters. Although this is not quite true in this show. There are a couple of characters who were weak and improved as a result of the voice acting, but in general the characters stand on their own. <br /> <br /> This is definitely for 16 and up. There is nothing that most children have not heard before, and most of the jokes would probably just fly right over their heads. It is definitely not as rough and harsh as South Park, but it feels the same as Bash of All. One example is that in one episode, Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand laugh at the same time. <br /> <br /> Father Pride and other productions of Dreamworks, such as Shrek, also feel like spiritual heirs of Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain and Freakazoid. This is the same type of humor that has grown. He may not be as witty as Spielberg’s classic television series, but he’s still good. <br /> <br /> I hope that he will complete this season well and will be updated for future seasons. Otherwise, I may never find a reason to watch the big three again.
