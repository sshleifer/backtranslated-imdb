The story of the untouchables, who behaved like a great soldier, saving the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, was told in the 1939 film Gunga Ding. Based on Rudyard Kipling's poem, the film is brilliantly shot by George Stevens and Cary Grant stars, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Victor McLaughan. The main role is played by Sam Jaffe, known in my era as Ben Casey's boss, Dr. Zorba, a name that has become synonymous with large, uncontrolled hair. Say "Dr. Zorb's Hair" to any of my generations, and they know what you are talking about. <br /> <br /> In India, during the British occupation, there are three soldiers sitting - two romantic, dashing figures. in Grant and Fairbanks, and in McLaughan, as a large mound, - cutting - in fact, three overgrown boys. Gunga Dean is a water carrier, to which Makkesni (Maklaglen) is, to some extent, offensive, in any case - verbally, but Cutter (Grant) loves him. When he catches Dean (pronounced Dean), who practices his soldier’s walk and salutes him when he is a monkey during their maneuvers, Cutter gives him some tips. <br /> <br /> A cheerful group of musketeers disintegrate when Ballantyne (Fairbanks) announces that she is going to marry a beautiful young woman (Joan Fontaine) and leave the service. However, when Gunga Dean and Cutter stumble upon the Towes, a murderous cult led by gurus (Eduardo Cianelli), Gung Dean runs off to warn the detachment, and Ballantyne insists on being recruited to help save Cutter. In the end, this is a buddy movie. <br /> <br /> “Gunga Dean” begins with a light heart, with a farce and a wonderful broad comedy, especially Cary Grant, which is quite funny. Both he and Fairbanks are so beautiful that it is difficult to decide which one to watch first. Most of the film consists of huge action movies that are very exciting. In the latter part of the story becomes very dramatic and ends with a tense, exciting battle. <br /> <br /> Grant plays the brightest role, Fairbanks is a romantic lover, and McLaglen is McChesney, mainly because of his treatment with Gung Dean, the most incredible character, although his love for his elephant Annie is revealed in his soft heart. . His softness is manifested closer to the end of the film, especially in a very touching final scene with tears in his eyes. <br /> <br /> Sam Jaffe, always a gentle and likeable actor, gives a wonderful introduction, like Gunga Dean, a simple Brave man with a wide smile, powerful imagination and high dreams. Without much discussion, Jaffe superbly conveys the soul of Gung Dean. <br /> <br /> This is a truly stunning adventure film, massive in size, with good acting, spectacular scenes, great music and some beautiful cinematic images. Another one of this wonderful year 1939. Highly recommended.
