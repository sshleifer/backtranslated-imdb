"Fraidy Cat", the fourth of these cartoons, is good. At least I like it, so I am surprised that it causes mixed reviews. <br /> <br /> This is a rather creepy story than an amusing one, although it has its own comedic moments. The atmosphere is dark and creepy. Suspension is another strong element here. As for humor, it’s mostly dark humor. <br /> <br /> In this short story, Tom listens to an eerie radio show at night and is absolutely scared because it is about ghosts, which he believes. While Tom is scared to death, Jerry watches everything and can't help but laugh all the time. In fact, Jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more. With the help of a white shirt and vacuum cleaner, he creates a large "ghost." <br /> <br /> Tom is experiencing the most terrible experience of his life. Although Jerry scares Tom for no good reason, the way he turns around is ridiculous. Plus, again, there is no violence here, because this is one of the oldest cartoons of Tom and Jerry. However, I do not understand that the joke about Tom’s nine lives almost sucked into the vacuum cleaner. <br /> <br /> When Tom finally discovers that it was all Jerry’s plan, and that Jerry had fooled him, Jerry was “caught by hand in a jar of cookies” (he deserves to be discovered). However, Tom shows incredible patience before responding. He glares at Jerry for about a minute. The funny thing is that Jerry invites Tom to laugh with him, and it takes him about half an hour to realize that Tom is looking at him with a very serious face. Jerry tries to be funny, but Tom is not laughing. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a special and unusual experience of Tom and Jerry.
