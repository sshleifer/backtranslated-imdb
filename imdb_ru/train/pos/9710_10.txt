This is what makes me proud to be British. This is the funniest thing on television. The league is made up of Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatis and Rees' cute scissors. Totally underrated, this horror comedy is perfection. The characters are iconic and whimsical catchphrases, "Hello Dave." This is a comedy that everyone just needs to watch. <br /> <br /> The best thing in a gentlemen's league is that it is always fresh and always goes beyond. He does not need to rely on catchphrases (as opposed to small Britain) to make it fun. the fact that the league wants to kill, perhaps, their most famous and iconic characters, shows us that they have steel balls.
