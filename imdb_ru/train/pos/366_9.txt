This film is so wonderful, it’s hard to find words to describe it. This is the only time I can’t decide which was better, a book or a movie. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is awesome, and Oprah Winfrey, such a good actress, she can be fun, happy and unhappy All at once. All together, the film was well-staged by Steven Spailberg, and should not be missed. 9/10
