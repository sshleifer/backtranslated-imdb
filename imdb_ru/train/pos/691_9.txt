I will come clean. The only reason I learned about this DVD was because Dominic Monaghan is my favorite actor. When I heard the title of the film, I thought it would be ... different, perhaps not in such a good way. <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. After reading a few reviews about this short review, I was really excited to see it. I sent a copy as soon as possible and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film tells about Jack, insomnia, who often suffers from conditions that make him doubt what is in reality and what is in his head. I will not talk about what is happening, but I will tell you that the film can sometimes seem intimidating in its realism. <br /> <br /> The direction is fantastic, focusing on what's important to the story, not letting it lose any fun or thought-provoking moments. <br /> <br /> In general, I give this magnificent film 9 out of 10 because it goes far beyond what I thought any short film could achieve.
