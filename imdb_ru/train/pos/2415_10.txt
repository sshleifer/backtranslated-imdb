I am totally addicted to this show. I can't wait for the week to go by to see the next show. This is a great storyline, which involves the best actors and actresses. I will tune in every week to watch it, even if I'm not at home, I always have a VCR installed in the bay with the monarch. Simon Rex is the best actor on the show. it's tense and exciting. I think that this show should remain on the air, and I believe that everyone should tune in to watch it. I saw the very first episode, and in fact I was not going to watch it, but once I watched all my life, and I decided to watch it, because it was on, and I really like it, and now this is my favorite show. I really mean it.
