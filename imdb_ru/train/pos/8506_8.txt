but it was on the UHF channel and the reception was very blurry. I would really like to have a movie, because I watched it first of all because I was a bus driver, and when I watched this movie, I rode this model bus. Only (at the time of his murder in 15 years) I vaguely remember that OJ was one of the stars in this matter. I only remember that he was the driver and the fact that the bus was shot and madly driving. I was looking for this film to no avail, since I watched it in the mid-80s. I liked the film, I usually do not watch thrillers, but after reading the summary in the TV guide and watching it start (albeit fuzzy), I stayed at it all.
