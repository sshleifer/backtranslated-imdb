Maybe I really liked this movie, partly because I felt depressed at the dump, and this is such a cute little fairy tale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was a great step. Gorgeous, intelligent story, great effects, great acting (especially De Niro, which is awesome). This movie made me happier than ever. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny and smart movie. A joking joke about the princeâ€™s history and its consequences, how the magic affects the witch and dozens of clever little touches, everyone delighted me. This is a lot of what makes it so good; This is a complex film filled with special effects, with more stories than in most fabulous films, but incredible attention is paid to trifles. <br /> <br /> I feel like I want to go ahead and watch it again and again.
