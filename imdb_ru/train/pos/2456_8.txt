When I went to watch this movie, my expectations were very low, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought that I would watch a boring film about teenagers, BUT actually the plot is interesting and well executed, the acting was somewhat convincing - especially from Melville, who really shows his talent in this film and the scene The struggles were - for a film with a low budget - very well made. <br /> <br /> I think this film deserves a wider audience than it received. This is a film that the whole family can watch - maybe not the smallest of children, as there are some rather rough scenes in it. A film about love and the problems that may arise when you go against your family traditions. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is very similar to “Bend it like Beckham”, but I actually think this film is better.
