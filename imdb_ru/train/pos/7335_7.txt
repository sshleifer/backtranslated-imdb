With Ralph Bakshi, most of his films look like double-edged swords. You will get something terrific from this, but only if you put up with the stupid and overly stupid. The Lord of the Rings is a great adaptation of the story, which may not have always shone in the animation department. <br /> <br /> “Fire and Ice” is a great achievement for Bakshi in terms of animation. Rotoscoping is much more detailed, and the animation has a bright appearance. You still get some boring cameras and slightly blurry background images, but overall the look has definitely gotten better since the last fantasy epic Bakshi. The animation has an almost realistic-naturalistic style, and unlike LOTR, where this style often disagreed with real content, here it enhances the unique atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film fails to create a meaningful story due to its simple setup and in fact the motivation of most of the characters is rather blurred. Lorne and Tigra are simple cases, but even the main villain Necron was difficult to track down, not to mention the “Furry Mask Man” (also known as “That Guy”). Despite the fact that most of the voice actors were suitable, there are some strange quirks in the audio department, and Tiger especially sounds terrible when she screams. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that the cinematic value of the film outweighs its unnecessarily stupid execution of the storyline. Scanty characters are something that you will never encounter, but it will help you remind yourself that perhaps this film is not even meant to be taken too seriously. This is still cool and fun.
