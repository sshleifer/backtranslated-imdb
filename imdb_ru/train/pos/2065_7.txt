Fearful Symmetry is a pleasant episode with a few flaws. The first thing about the episode is that it takes place near the Mountain Air Force Base in southwest Idaho. The first deep throat season takes place near Ellens Air Force Base, also in southwestern Idaho. Iâ€™m wondering if the Air Force bases are one and the same, but they decided to use the real name in Fearful Symmetry. Mulder and Scully have a good dialogue, always a plus. Ed Meecham, the keeper of the zoo, reminds me of the naughty old school teachers. They must have once loved children, you just have no idea how. Just as he must have cared more for animals at one point. I liked the concept of the episode, but I felt that there were some inconsistencies in it. If aliens are so adept at kidnapping and returning safely, why can't they return the animal to the right place? And the aliens just now having problems with the return of animals? I do not buy Mulder's theory of problems with a space-time continuum. As if he is an expert in this. I also thought that the performance of Jane Atkinson as Villa Ambrose was not well done. Besides these tentacles, I still enjoyed this episode due to the intriguing concept of aliens collecting both human and human DNA.
