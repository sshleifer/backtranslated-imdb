There is something convincing and strangely plausible in this episode. From the very beginning, an atmosphere of tension is created by the realization that a certain planet will explode within a few hours. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy went to evacuate residents who seemed to have already left for unknown places, with the exception of an elderly librarian. <br /> <br /> The polite, but mysterious advice of the librarian about where all the citizens were. He was interrupted by the crisis, during which all three crew members of the Enterprise suddenly found themselves in different eras of the past of the planet. Kirk finds himself in a time period reminiscent of 17th-century England, while Spock and McCoy are stuck in deserted, frozen waste. <br /> <br /> The intersection between the two stories and the various dangerous situations that men end up in is superbly resolved, with the return of the currently unknown chance, while the minutes are counted down to the explosion of the planet. <br /> <br /> This episode characterizes the imaginative writing and graceful play: the touching performance of Marietta Hartley as a woman exiled during the Ice Age, and Jan Wolfe as a city librarian. Somewhat reminiscent of the classic episode "The City on the Edge of Eternity", this story of time travel is the rich and compelling finale of the series, which ended with one episode later. This should be one of the best of the entire series, especially great, given the generally lower quality of the third season as a whole.
