Long before Tim Lahey and Jerry B. Jenkins shook the world of the Christian subculture (and earned millions in the process) with the books “Left from the Back,” MARK IV Pictures, the Christian film distribution company of the Billy Graham Evangelical Association gave us this masterpiece. What I like most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail sitting in the living room. Instead of leading us to the dramatic scenes of this “post-ecstatic” disaster, we sit in the living room, listening to this in the news, because the filmmakers cannot afford to show it. The premise of the film is based on the pre-Millennium escalation, the Tribulation, believing that Christ comes once for the secret taking of the true church, and then comes again at the end of the seven years of hell on earth. What used to scare me in high school now makes me laugh. Patty’s intriguing adventures and journey through the tribulation (and two of the three sequels of the film) tell of her remarkable story of disbelief and, ultimately, a curse. I hate to admit it, but I still really like to watch it. It even has the SAME ACCURATE account of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I think that I am the only person in history who made such an observation.
