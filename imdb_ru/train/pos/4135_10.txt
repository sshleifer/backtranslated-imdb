This is an absolutely charming film, one of my favorite romantic comedies. It's very funny and the cast is wonderful. Although Laurence Olivier is mainly associated with his Shakespeare work, he shows in this film that he is by no means limited to playing only classical theater. He manages the transition from a cynical divorce lawyer who tries to avoid women and their traitorous ways to a love-suffering puppy who falls in love with Lady X, played by Merle Oberon without much effort. The dialogue is surprisingly witty and refreshing, and the atmosphere is charming. Ralph Richardson was also happy to watch. I highly recommend it.
