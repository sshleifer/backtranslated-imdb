Spanish films have entered, if not Golden, definitely into the Silver Age. “Piedras” is another example of a film that seriously considers people and their conflicts. Although feelings are strong or almost at the level of life or death, they are still not very melodramatic. This can happen. <br /> <br /> There are different stories that become connected. One of them is about a backward girl who does not dare to walk the street until the next quarter. One is about a middle-aged woman who finds the lover of her life in a foot fist. Another tells about a girl who has problems with drugs, and her lover leaves her. Another story about Madame Brothel who (almost) finds true love. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing. It is in Spain that filmmakers take women seriously.
