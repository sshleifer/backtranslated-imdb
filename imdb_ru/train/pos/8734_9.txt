The film was absolutely awesome and cool. The graphics were great and it was awesome. Especially, Flick was great and great in the film, and he was funny, and he was, and sometimes he was smart. Circus beetles are colorful and gorgeous in the film. The grasshoppers were also great and cool in the film. Hopper was a pure and perfect villain. Even Dot was cute. When the bird comes to eat the bugs, this scene was gorgeous and good. Even the last scene was awesome and cool. Even Flick's inventions were good. Making an artificial bird was a good idea to scare away grasshoppers. When the ants build an artificial bird, this scene was good and good, I should really appreciate the creators of "A Bug's Life".
