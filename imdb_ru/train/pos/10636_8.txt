This story is a complex and remarkable story about the last harem of the Ottoman Empire, well narrated and provoking, we see the inner workings of the disappeared world and learn about the people who lived there. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the story, the characters, the acting, and the scenes. Several scenes suffered from quick editing, and the subtitles sometimes disappeared too quickly, otherwise it was a great piece. <br /> <br /> Safiyaâ€™s main character was perfectly played by Marie Guillain, who, I am glad to say, did a fantastic job without this. The scenes with her and Alex Deskas (Nadir) are charming and beautiful. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see something less Hollywood and more authentic for the world they are emulating.
