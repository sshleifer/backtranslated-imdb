When I found the movie in the schedule for Christmas, its name did not seem familiar to me, since I did not read the novel and heard nothing about the movie. However, after reading the content, I decided to spend the Christmas evening watching a movie. The effect completely surprised me: I don’t remember when I last saw the film in which every moment attracted me. VOW TO CHERISH is, without a doubt, one of the films that now represents a real surprise that I received from the cinema. Here are some reasons why I consider this film to be an underrated example of a good movie. <br /> <br /> First, all the content is especially educational. This has something to offer the modern audience - pure correct faith and some answers to universal questions. Is there a need for Christ in our time? Does love still matter? What is faith for? What is the logic of burden and suffering in life? Someone next to me, whom I can always trust? The film provides answers through the content, since everything that happens to the characters can also happen to any of us. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film is extremely humane. The main characters are experiencing an internal struggle and cope with extremely difficult decisions. Is it better for Kyle David Denman and Teri (Megan Paul) to start their lives and forget about the family or preserve the values ​​they were taught at home? What is the best for John (Ken Howard) to leave Ellen (Barbara Babcock), his sick wife, and start a new happy life with Julia (Donna Bullock), the woman with whom he falls in love? In fact, Ellen no longer recognizes him ... However, he decides to swear HIS WIFE of eternal loyalty. If the rebellious brother John, Phil (D. David Maureen), it would be better to continue his easy life, although this does not bring him satisfaction, or once he begins to seriously think about his life. Phil's prayer to God in the park is a psychological masterpiece of the universal aspect of humanity. These words can also be spoken by everyone, no matter where, when, or how they live. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film is an excellent family image, not very popular these days: there are problems, but there is always something stronger that unites these people. This “something” is love and trust. I know this may seem a bit idealistic. Not all families can rely on loyalty, and this may not be so easy. However, this is a very cognitive and realistic aspect. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the whole film is about mutual aid of people. If we want to live a happy life in our society, we must understand one thing: we must help each other. Alexander (Ossi Davis) is an example of such an attitude. At the beginning of the film, we see him talking to John about prayer. He later helps his brother. Alexander is a kind of “angel” who is sent to John and his family. Is it possible that we will become angels for each other? <br /> <br /> Fifth, artistic features also deserve attention. SPEECHES: Barbara Babcock plays the true role of Ellen, and although she has a difficult role, she does an excellent job. Take, for example, the moment when she appears at school and is keen to teach again. Ken Howard is also remembered as a faithful husband. PICTURE: The most memorable for me was the scene with John and Ellen in the park, walking along the fallen leaves (autumn), while the sunshine (love) spreads everywhere. I interpreted it as a kind of symbol: even if there is sadness, it can always be illuminated with light and joy ... <br /> <br /> VOW TO CHERISH is a wonderful film that realistically showed me what it means to love, what loyalty, and this once again proved to me how wonderful it is to live and believe. In the end, I would like to quote deep words from the film, which I found very touching, and I hope that you will also make <br /> <br /> Kyle to my uncle Phil: Yes, he (John Brighton) lives according to the Bible. But no one forces you to do this. But by what rules do you live?
