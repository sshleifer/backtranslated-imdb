Wow. Um ... well ... wow! I think I'll start with the plot. A betrothed woman (Lucy) arrives at the family home of her husband (Mathurin) in France, where they await the arrival of a bishop or cardinal or someone in the Catholic Church to marry them (to satisfy their desire). While Waiting Young Lucy learns about the legend of the Beast, who roamed the territory a century ago. That night in bed, she begins to fantasize about the monster and his date, the victim of rape, with the former mistress of the house. This is where it gets interesting! The plot is actually quite thin (and it seems that it is delayed in the middle of the film), but the director rewards (?) Those who show him with a shocking and cheerful ending. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone. If you are looking for a great movie, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a far-reaching film on bestiality (which almost takes a sympathetic look at the subject), this film is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, do not be afraid of it. Except for some actions on the horse at the beginning, the “works” are rather caricatured, IMO)
