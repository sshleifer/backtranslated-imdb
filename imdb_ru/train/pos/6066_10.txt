When I first saw this movie, it was a long time ago on VHS-Video. I really liked this movie because it was fun and exciting. A few years ago, I saw another movie called: "The Incredible Adventure of Andy Colby." In this film, parts of The Wizards of the Lost Kingdom were used. They called this film "KOR the Conqueror". I started looking for the movie "KOR" many years ago because I wanted to watch the entire movie, and not just the parts that were used in the Andy Colby movie. No store could rent this film, and no store knew this film. For many years I watched my old VHS tapes that I had at home, and what a miracle ... I had this film, since for many years it was at home, but the film had a different name, because in Germany it 3 or 4 titles. So I was happy to find this tape at home, and this time I had much more time to watch KOR the Conquerer again. The music is great while filming a movie, but the best part of filming with music is the moment when KOR is drunk walking through the green forest. The music in the background had some kind of magic. I like Bo Svenson and also the boy who played Simon in the film. They both did their job very well. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 10/26/2004. Thank you all for reading my comment.
