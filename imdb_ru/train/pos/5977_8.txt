Teen Eddie spends his life being intimidated and humiliated due to his obsession with heavy metal music. One day he learns that his character Sammy Kerr died, allegedly burned by the establishment, who wanted to put an end to his music. But Eddie has his latest record, which was never released, and when he loses it, he begins to receive messages telling him how to deal with his tormentors. Soon, Sammy said that he intended to return to life at a local Halloween party in order to take revenge on the city that once mocked him. <br /> <br /> Full of humor and jokes, this film is very interesting. Sammy himself - a real villain from horror films, playing on the "obsession with rock music" obsessive ideas of the 80s. Worth seeing.
