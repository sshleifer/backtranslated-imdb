Acting is fiction. The story is awesome. The script is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Several ways to describe this movie. Yes, it is slow and mostly speaks, but the whole story of their life and the way it is told through pop-up memories makes you listen to every little thing in order to learn more about this obsessive and tragic story. I myself read the book on which the film is based, and it showed me even more light in this story and answers some questions that were left unanswered in the film. I also need to read the Artist Song, which is the “other” part of Gilmore's story. This film made me think so much about the phrase "pierce the other side of the mirror." You hear a song in a film called Gary Gilmore's Eyes, written by a punk band that wrote a song about how it would be when Gary Gilmore had eyes (this is one of the things Gary gave as a graft after death) and when you listen to him, that is, after Mikal saw Gary for the last time, you look at the situation as a whole a little differently, if only the song itself was here. This film opened my eyes in the same way and in many others. I highly recommend this film (and book).
