Another comment about this movie made him sound crappy. Considering that the talking pictures were so new - I think the script and acting was good. Davis was so young and fresh. She has not yet found her own style that we expected. And yet it's great to see her like this â€” still learning the craft. <br /> <br /> There are so many cliches from this film, and it seems that this film has laid some traces over the next 70 years. My voice is to see and remember how young this type of film was. Keep and open the mind, and you may be shocked by how worried the characters in this picture are for their presence in 1934 and for how we perceive the beginning of the last century as tense. other negative and single comment notes.
