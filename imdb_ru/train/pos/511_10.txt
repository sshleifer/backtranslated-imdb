I first saw this film almost 21 years ago, when it was ITV (before cable and satellite TV days) Matinée. I was out of school with a parotitis, and I was completely fascinated by the film. I had it on the purchased video for about 10 years, and I want to get a copy of the DVD of it. David Niven is my favorite actor of all time, and I think this is a parody of the fact that he was watched so many times when Oscars came. I also think that the queen should have knighted him, as he easily did for the film industry, if not more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. the way the film switches from black and white to color and back is well done, and there are such star actors as Roger Livesey, Marius Goring and Richard Attenboro’s early appearance in the film.
