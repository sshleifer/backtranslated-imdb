After watching this intense martial arts film for the first time in almost 18 years, I must say that he has not lost his mysticism or any amazing martial arts, as I remembered from my youth. The story of a dying martial arts instructor who sent his "unfinished" student to find the last 5 members of his poisonous clan so that they do not look for a condition that the master’s friend hides. Fearing that his last student will not have enough training, he instructs him to make friends with one of the five "poisons" to defeat the other four. <br /> <br /> I can’t say enough about choreography or camera work. A wonderful film in itself and quite possibly one of the best martial arts films ever made. CLASSIC !!
