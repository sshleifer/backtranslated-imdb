Charming, romantic, innovative and fun. The vision of this unusual film has almost no analogues, surpassing the more famous "death novels", such as "Ghost". Although we intuitively know that Peter and June will find ultimate happiness at the end of this long, long staircase, joy along the way. The moral of the tale is, of course, timeless: love conquers all. But the struggle to achieve this victory is conducted in the heavenly arena of wide vision and spectacular greatness. With more than 500 respectively dressed characters depicting different eras and cultures, the director's vision of paradise remains unforgettable six decades later, in the CGI era. <br /> <br /> And yet, despite all the cosmic dimensions, Powell and Pressburger knew the most important truth: the best story is told at the smallest level. The surprising, resolutely romantic aspect of The Ladder is captured with utmost simplicity: the tears of June, preserved on the petals of a rose. <br /> <br /> This film, like the story, and the plot itself - one for centuries.
