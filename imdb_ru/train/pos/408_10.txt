I can't tell you all how much I love this movie. I read reviews that say that this step is “too confusing” or “like swimming in drying concrete”. I say these reviewers have no imagination! For those who love fiction, this film is for you. If you have ever enjoyed playing Dungeons & Dragons ... this movie is for you (especially if you are in Eastern Adventures), I wish I could see this movie on the big screen. (Just more incentives to get my own big screen tv. :-)
