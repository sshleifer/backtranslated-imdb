There are many problems with Mystery Men. Firstly, there are too many different characters, so that all of them can get complex or even interesting personalities. Special effects are distracting from the story and in fact not so special. Paul Reuvims is lost in the pitiful youthful role of a character who simply farts and speaks with an inaudible accent. <br /> <br /> Now for the decent parts. William H. Macy, three heavenly words, and his performance as a rudimentary ideal. The Sphinx is an exceptionally funny character who is only mysterious and simply pours out traditional mystical proverbs. Ben Stiller is also very funny, showing a weak character trying to become a big league of superheroes. All characters do, and this is an area that I find particularly ironic. That's because all the actors are indie actors trying to get into the big leagues of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the reason I thought it failed at the box office is because America doesnâ€™t cause irony. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked the film, but I feel that it would work better if more effort was spent on setting up the script, and not on unnecessary CGI landscapes and effects.
