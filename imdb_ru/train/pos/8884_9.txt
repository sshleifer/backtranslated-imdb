I really liked the 60s. Not being that generation (I'm waiting for the "80s"), it was interesting to see a unique four-hour capsule for that era. <br /> <br /> However, one of the main problems in the film was how unbalanced the film was in the image of families. According to the commercials I saw for the film on NBC, the story was mainly about two families who were struggling with problems in America in the 1960s. Perhaps I missed something, but I think we learned more about the white family than the African American family. <br /> <br /> I really believe that in the 60s music was used to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that you get from the mouth of the actors (they are all very talented). This is very clearly seen at the end of the first part (about two hours) of the mini-series. <br /> <br /> Very good movie!
