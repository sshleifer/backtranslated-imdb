This film seems to be well remembered as the time when Tom and Jerry signed a peace treaty. For a while, everything is idyllic, but, as expected, everything goes bad. Probably the most memorable moment was the endless battle, including a pipe, a frying pan and a baseball bat, in which two people participate in a dog, Butch, at the beginning and at the end of a short one. I liked one bunch, and you should try to catch it on the Cartoon Network.
