In this story, nothing special happens - just two men use completely different ways to handle the memories of Vietnam. But what he lacks in prerequisites is more than he does in action and realism. This is a quiet film about friendship and exchange of experience. We even get romance (not for nothing - just another very real piece of this story). It is worth seeing.
