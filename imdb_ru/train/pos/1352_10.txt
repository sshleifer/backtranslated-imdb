I have never watched this film and consider it a classic classic with great veteran actors. In the period when this film was made, people in America were different, there was no TV or all the modern things that we have today, except for the radio and the launch of great films that are being shot in Hollywood. Sweet innocent stories about a young romance between a girl or a boy were considered differently than today. Ann Shirley, "Murder My Sweet", 44, played a young orphan girl called Carrot Top because of her red hair and ended up at the house of two elderly people who were like two wise owls and looked after Ann Shirley It was a small town, and everyone knew everyone, and if something happened, the whole town found out about it in a matter of minutes. This is a mundane film with good decent people who are trying to help each other in a very simple way of life. Today it seems very funny and stupid, but believe me, it was like that in America in the 1920s. ‚Äù 30s and they were a great generation that loved good family films
