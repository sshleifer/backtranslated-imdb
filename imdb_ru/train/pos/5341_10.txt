CAROL'S JOURNEY is a pleasure to watch for many reasons. Clara Lago's acting is simply amazing for someone so young, and she is one of those special actors who can say a lot with the look on her face. Directed by Imanol Urbibe is a dense and controlled film without interruptions in continuity, thereby promoting the plot at a steady pace with sufficient tension to not ask what the scene from the nest will bring. The script by Angel Garcia Roldan is a story in the best possible way, which seems to be the main goal for films in the end. The plot is unpredictable, but the unfolding events are completely logical. Perhaps the best feature of this film, if you tell the story of the Spanish Civil War, which affected people. It was an important event of the 20th century, but the Americans are hardly aware of this. In fact, in 40 years of teaching at the university, I mean an average of one student in a semester who even heard about it, and even more so who could say something comprehensive about it â€” and the overwhelming number of students were honored scientists all of which speak to a huge amount of censorship in American education. Thus, on the one hand, this film is a good way to start exploring this event, bearing in mind that when one thread pulls, most of the story falls apart. Therefore, the assessment of this film is directly related to the amount of his knowledge. To view this film as another adult film is to completely miss this film. The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of cinema: acting, staging, character development, plot, dialogue, film continuity and artistry - on a scale of 10 for very good, 5 for medium and 1 for needing help. CAROL'S JOURNEY is above average for all indicators, with the exception of dialogue, which is rated as average. The average LEI value for this film is 9.3, rising to 10 when it equals the IMDb scale. I highly recommend this film for all ages.
