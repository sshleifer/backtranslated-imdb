I made this film when it came out on videotape, and I really liked it. I had the opportunity to buy it on DVD a few weeks ago, and since then I have watched it several times. I would have to agree with others when they said that Indian Summer was a nostalgic film. When I watch it, I want to be 10-14 again. I think this is why we all like the film to some extent. We all wish from time to time that we can experience our lives as children with the wisdom / knowledge of adults. Wouldn't it be nice for all your friends / parents to be young again? Not to worry about your work, be a parent, etc ... ??? I know that I would jump into De Lorean and go back in time. Although I liked the film very much, my favorite film about the camp is “Meatballs with Bill Murray”. I would like them to make a version of Indian summer.
