Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the script, “Pickup on South Street” is a tough, brutal, well-made film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark), who accidentally collects a top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for spy agents. Also involved is Gene Peters as a cool woman that the wicked ex-lover Richard Keely uses as a courier. This is a film noir at its best, and although the performances are very good, its great actress Thelma Ritter, who steals the film. As Mo is a weary street vendor selling ties (and who also sells information), she’s terrific in the role that brought her another Oscar nomination. Surprisingly, Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Oscar, and she never won. It was supposed to be the role that made it for her!
