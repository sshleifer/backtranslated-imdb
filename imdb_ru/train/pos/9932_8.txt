If you go to this film, expecting something that is not there, you will be disappointed, as in any other film. This film contains what Hammingway called the "iceberg effect." At first glance, it’s just a cache of random fragments of a movie that are broken up together to create a movie. If it were written in the book, it would be a short story, because the action in the film unfolds very quickly, and, if you are not really trying to catch it, the reasoning underlying the plot (along with some subtle omens) can good to pass by you. Definitely a movie that you have to watch twice to fully appreciate. Experimental cinematography barely describes this film. Cinematography and post-production make a great contribution to the overall picture of the film, making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others (something desired in American films lately). Although in some places the film may seem a bit rough, horrible and too heavy for some viewers, the film never becomes completely unreal. The only aspect of the film that I would call “needs improvement” is the choice of the soundtrack. No movie can be good without a suitable soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite suitable, the debut is too long, and the other rap songs in the film could really be replaced by something more suitable (heavy, ugly rock or psychedelic). Electronica would have made this film a real trip). The flow of images and dynamic ... color palettes adds another “artistic” aspect to this, combined with the events taking place throughout the film, is not the film that you can skip in any part and you still understand. However, it also makes the film more desirable for viewing, and not one that you quickly get bored. 8.5 / 10
