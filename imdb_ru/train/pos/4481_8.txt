The only reason I give this film 8/10 stars, not 10, is because 1) Sinatra is terrible and 2) Kelly’s love interest leaves much to be desired (IMHO). Love that Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, little boy. The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most interesting and amazing dance series I have ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still my favorite and my favorite daughter. I am 28, and she is 4, so although the character is less significant than Mickey, he is still loved by many children and adults today. Kelly, as always, fascinates, his eyes are full of fun and excitement. In every movie I've ever seen him, he always steals the show. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. No wonder that Paula Abdul “tried” Kelly's moves. I would also call Gene Kelly one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century. If you only watched one piece, don't miss Kelly with Jerry Mouse. You will not be disappointed.
