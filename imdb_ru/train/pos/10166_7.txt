I watched it on an 8-hour flight and (presumably due to pressure and altitude) I actually found it a bit interesting (emphasis on “soft”). <br /> <br /> The actual idea of ​​the film was brilliant: the woman dies, her fiancé falls in love with someone else, she decides to make sure they don’t get together, but in the end she lets them do it. Unfortunately, the film itself was not so good. OK, there was a bit of laughter, and the actors all worked well. But from the very beginning the plot was about as predictable as the flight site I was on. I think that the whole part of the story with gays, but not with gays, could be worked out much better. The talking parrot was a good idea, but frankly, it was not very funny. <br /> <br /> In general, the film was more interesting than looking at the seat in front of me, but it was close. call.
