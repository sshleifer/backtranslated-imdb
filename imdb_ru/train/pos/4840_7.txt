I saw a recent DVD of this film in Region 2, shown in the “horrors” section of a store on Oxford Street, and also advertised as a “classic thriller”. In fact, it is almost the only means for Arthur Asuka, one of the most popular names in British comedy and light entertainment for more than four decades. <br /> <br /> Perhaps his incessantly cheerful, lush and in fact good-natured humor as a culture shock for many who are used to the sour and cynical flavor of the British comedy of the last twenty-five years. However, there are still those who appreciate his lively and cheerful person and the complete avoidance of pathos. Asuchi was the idol of the great Tommy Cooper, who often borrowed the gag of "self-suppression", with which Arthur is trying to entertain passengers who are in a difficult position. <br /> <br /> The low-rated Lipa has a striking, rare appearance of Travers, which has an impact on the mysterious Julie.
