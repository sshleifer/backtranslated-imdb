I could not refrain from commenting after reading a very short “Not bad” comment. This film is much better than just not bad. The game is stellar, even from actors who do not play cute or something else, but act like friends of my son. The film is smart and expects its audience too. Scene lines with double flashback are figurative and contribute to the plot, and do not act as a filler of time. I watched this film with my children, and then a few days later I watched it again. If you have children, and you are sick to death of films that inspire a diabetic someone with his purulent sweetness, then look at “Holes”. My 6 year old child enjoyed it just as much as my 11 year old, and my husband and I enjoyed it just as much as both of them. How many films can you say about this?
