This is an absurd dark comedy from Belgium. Benoit Poelvoord (The Man Biting the Dog) is perfectly shot in black and white, he looks great like Roger, the angry, obsessed father of the family in a small gloomy Belgian mining town. Roger is a photographer who, together with his little daughter Louise, visits traffic accidents to take photographs. He is also obsessed with winning a car by participating in competitions where a participant must break a record - and he decides that his son Michelle should try to break the record of perpetual walking through the door - he even hires an overweight coach to train him. Michelle dresses up as Elvis and starred in the radio show Cinema Lies, where he describes the mistakes in the films. Louise is friends with her neighbor, Felix, a lover of pigeons. Roger is a callous figure when he pushes Michel to the limit while trying to write, which almost leads to his death. Magritte surreal images are scattered in the film. It is undoubtedly charming and well worth your time.
