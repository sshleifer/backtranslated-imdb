Contains * spoilers * - also my quotes may not be accurate. <br /> <br /> Everyone always notes satires in social commentary and economic parallels - how true this is. But for me, I see this film much more than that. I like the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit. In the world around him, so much confusion and dirt, but it will not stick. Alec Guinness was the perfect guy to play this game - his boyish grins and eternal curiosity are so pertinent: <br /> <br /> "It's brilliant - can you tell me what is the ratio of ink to gasoline?" <Br /> < br /> The only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention did not work after all - he stands almost naked. However, more than shame is this simple disappointment that “it did not work.” He was never intimidated by people. Remember, <br /> <br /> "But, Sydney, we also want to stop this." <br /> <br /> Within seconds, he was leaving, trying to leave again. Does he show any signs of pain that such treachery should have caused? <br /> <br /> Dapney’s role is also noticeable. She is tired of money and power. She thinks she finally found love outside her father’s company. At first, she doesn't care about Sydney more than anyone else. But the moment he falls off her car, and she comes back to see, maybe she killed him - and yet he still thinks only about the beauty of his invention. She finally found something worth living for. The funny thing is that this is not even romance. This is a friendship, but of such an ephemeral nature that the name almost does not fit. This is more admiration and perhaps even inspiration. <br /> <br /> When she discovered that Michael had no real love for her and that her father was completely incompetent to care for her, she became cynical and tried to encourage Sydney. Fortunately, she discovered that in this world there are indeed people who live not only with power, money and lust. What a refreshment: <br /> <br /> “Thank you, Sydney. If you said yes, I think I would strangle you. ” <br /> <br /> I love the very end, when all this crazy business seems to have come to nothing. But then the playful, freaky beat begins, and Sydney leaves, his step corresponds to the melody: fearless. Where is Daphne? We really do not know - but they were not really in love, and she was not really a scientist. He was helped to escape, and she got a "shot in the hand of hope." (Pollyanna) Relations would be good, but as Billy Joel says, “this is more than I hoped for ...” <br /> <br />
