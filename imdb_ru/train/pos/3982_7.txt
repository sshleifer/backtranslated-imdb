This particular short film by Joe McDoox was obviously inspired by the impressive movie “Thank you, your lucky stars” by Warner Brothers, one of those star wartime action movies of the time. In this film, Eddie Cantor played himself and one of the comedians who would like to act in films, with the exception of his resemblance to Cantor. <br /> <br /> George O'Hanlon, who starred in McDoakes shorts, is both himself and McDoux, who are just trying to take a break from the film. Like, for example, Thank Your Lucky Stars, several contract players of Warner Brothers were walking along this film with a free moment. <br /> <br /> O'Hanlon was sent away by the central caste for a small role in one role in the film about the First World War, but the counterpart MacDoax receives a message. The poor guy is so nervous about his important moment that he is starting to think about how to deliver his only line. It may sound like a real movie star will help. <br /> <br /> 86 later infuriate director Ralph Sanford and the patient Clyde Cook, who plays the British cockney soldier they find in the movie business niche for poor McDoakes. Worth watching this very funny short story, which was nominated for an Oscar, to find out what is happening with O'Hanlon / MacDawks. <br /> <br /> Both of them.
