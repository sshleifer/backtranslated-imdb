This film, in my opinion, despite its flaws (which, as I say, “few”), is a true masterpiece and a great and glorious work of art. <br /> <br /> Here Mr. Bakshi made a very beautiful film and showed his great talent and versatility as a director of animated films. He does not receive the 1/100 credit he deserves for literally preserving the art of animation for an adult audience. If it were not for Mr. Bakshi, I do not believe that the animation would have survived the Disney onslaught. Moreover, with “The Lord of the Rings” he not only created a beautiful animated film, but also created a completely new kind of art - unfortunately, the one that never came to light. <br /> <br /> Most people will complain about the use of rotoscopy in a film (using live images that are used as background images and are often animated using various techniques, from a slight hue to full animation). But I feel that people who complain about this simply cannot take on an artistic form that is out of the norm. No, this is not a Disney animation. No, this is not a live action. No, this is not “deception” - it is a new, fascinating and absolutely wonderful form of art. Something so fresh and so new that it feels at home in such a fantastic tale as The Lord of the Rings. The innovative use of Bakshi of this technique makes it possible to embody the subtleties of Middle-earth in a very dark and mysterious way, in particular, Tolkien’s dark creations, especially the Nazgul, are not designed for traditional animation or live action. <br /> <br /> Peter S. Beagle’s script (in my opinion, very little based on an early draft of Chris Conkling) is a very loyal adaptation of Tolkin’s works. Where possible, he uses the dialogue directly from the novel, and he feels at home in the world that created Bakshi. There are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3/4 in a single 2-hour 15-minute film, but there are very few changes in the storyline. There are a few holes that would be nice to fill: Narsil's reforging, Galadriel's gifts, Warnov at the Hornburg battle, but again, with the time constraints that he had (already the longest animation function in history), this is, of course, understandable (although the question arises how they could be explained in the sequel). <br /> <br /> There is also a delightful (one of my favorite) score by Leonard Rosenman (who also scored Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV (the score for which is clearly based on his LotR work)). It is pompous and bold, and, I dare say, perfect. He is in itself an orchestral triumph, but in combination with the images of the film he enters a completely new world of symphonic perfection. So far from the typical Hollywood fare that it distracts many people. <br /> <br /> Voice actors are wonderful. Of particular note is John Hurt in the role of Aragorn, who simply exudes the essence of Strider. <br /> <br /> Character design is also surprisingly unique, although not often for all tastes. But remember that it is the responsibility of the director to adapt to show you what he / she imagines, not what you could imagine, and therefore Aragorn is realized with a characteristic Indian feeling, and Boromir appears in a viking-inspired attire. Perhaps this is not what you imagined, but I can only welcome Mr. Bakshi for showing us what he "saw." It may also be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with Priscilla Tolkien in developing character outfits for the film. <br /> <br /> Another word - “Flight to Ford”, in my opinion, is one of the thinnest beautiful sequences ever caught on celluloid. Bakshi is not afraid to slow down for a moment, and his mastery clearly demonstrates the incredible tension that he is able to increase. Bakshi’s artistic abilities and Tolkien’s incredible work merge in this sequence with a glorious summit that cannot be compared. <br /> <br /> The recently released Warner Brothers DVD (2001) is extremely lacking. Although we can express our eternal gratitude for the film being finally available in widescreen format, the package is terribly devoid of add-ons. How great it would be to get a director's comment, to see 20 minutes of extra shots taken for theatrical release. Another delightful addition could be live action frames that were later animated. Also in the DVD release, there is a horrible voice at the end of the film, which is different from the simple voice acting that occurred in the very last frames of the film. This version is plastered and poorly painted right in the musical climax of the score. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest tragedy of all is that the sequel was not done. We can never see the interpretation of Bakshi of Gondor, Shelob, Faramir, the Cracks of Destiny, the battle of Eowyn with the Witch-king or the confrontation of Gandalf with him. We will never be decorated with the image of Bakshee Denethor, the Palatinate or the Paths of the Dead. It is a shame beyond all shame that we will eventually have to take Peter Jackson's brilliant and brilliant Hollywood, the action movie version of these later events in Tolkien’s masterpiece, but I suppose even that’s better than no cinematic version of everything. <br /> <br /> david
