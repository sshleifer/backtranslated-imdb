This film constantly entertained me. Comparing this with Serial Mom, Mr. Waters returned to his more elegant side. It is not so polished. <br /> <br /> There is a dark side here. A message about how success and fame change a person - but, more importantly, how it changes people around you. <br /> <br /> There is no false moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> the characters are somewhat cartoony ... but I want to believe that this is exactly what Mr. Waters is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> It is fascinating to watch Mr. Waters evolve ... This is truly his best work.
