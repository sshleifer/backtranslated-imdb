I gave him 10, because everyone else liked it, and it would be unfair if not. The reason I'm bothering you is to add personal observation of the work of Castle. <br /> <br /> I have seen Murder and Tingler (a version with a clever color sequence, where everything except blood) in black and white) several times and "House on a hill with ghosts" many times. <br /> <br /> Even I’m not old enough to see them when Castle was preparing for his showman tricks, so I can appreciate them for their services. And although the majority betrays him as second-rate, crazy, hammy, etc. I believe that they are doing him a disservice. <br /> <br /> The ultimate “kill” sequence is usually shocking and works today — and the Tingler premise, although stupid, was very original. <br /> <br /> But "House on a haunted hill" was a triumph. Using this house of Frank Lloyd Wright as his exterior, a magnificent Vincent Price and a solid cast, as well as good performance and production performance - when I first saw him on a late afternoon packed evening, he provoked a reaction from the audience. seen since. <br /> <br /> This was the part where the heroine is alone in the basement (if you haven’t seen the movie, stop reading NOW) and we are waiting to hear the hero from the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> There is NO wiring of what is happening, the camera slowly moves away, causing the AUDIENCE to switch its view to ... I say no more (my "spoiler" declaration above concerns only THIS movie). <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I think this trick was REMOTE, not accidental, and when it happened, the WHOLE AUDIENCE grabbed (including most of the man!) It took the audience about ten minutes to calm down. <br /> <br /> Now this is an excellent movie. He could have been a bright showman, but “House” and two other films I mentioned were “GOOD FILMS”. Castle may not have been Hitchcock, but he was not Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> It is easy to focus on someone's fads and forget to study them TALENT. Therefore, I hope this documentary has confirmed this. I look forward to seeing this.
