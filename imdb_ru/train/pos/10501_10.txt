Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the best game ever created. It's so exciting that you can play it for hours without stopping for a break. I beat the game 4 times, but I never got all 120 stars ... (I got 111) ... but I hope to achieve them in the end. Despite the fact that I had not officially played this game until I was seven years old, I loved to watch my sisters play it. Now I am 13 years old, and I still play it, erase games and start again. <br /> <br /> The graphics are incredible for the early N64 game. The gameplay is addictive. The management is excellent. Levels hard, but not impossible. Fighting with Bowser is a challenge. <br /> <br /> I would like to tell you more, but why don't you just get it for yourself? Remove the X-BOX 360, PS3 and Wii and find your Nintendo 64 and play this amazing, wonderful game.
