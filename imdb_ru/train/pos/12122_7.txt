The film can be great. I just looked at it last night, but I feel that I cannot give an honest opinion about it, because I first read the book. The book is so much better than the movie that I was disappointed with the movie. If you plan to watch “On Human Slavery,” do not read the book in advance. On the other hand, the book is so good, and it contains much more than Philip's love affair with Mildred, and you can still enjoy it by watching a movie. I do not claim this with ease. On average, I read a book every 4 days and read such disparate authors as Daniel Steele, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. “On Human Slavery” gets my voice as one of the ten best novels ever written.
