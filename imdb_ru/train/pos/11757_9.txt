Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play over 30-year-old guys who put their marages at risk by deciding (Russell is somewhat reluctant) to replay their heartbreaking tie with rival Bakersfield years after. Williams is fine, but Russell is just as gorgeous as legendary defender Taft Remo Hightower. Holly Palance makes a nice and attractive turn as Williams' wife, who could live without this revenge. The film is worth watching to see the famous Remo in action. Highly recommended.
