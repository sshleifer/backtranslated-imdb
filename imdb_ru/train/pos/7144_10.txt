I saw the film “Holes” and say that it should be the best film throughout the year. It brings out the child in all. I mean, who would think of troubled boys digging holes as a punishment? Louis Sachar is who. Although the film was different from the book, it was still very good. For example, Caveman / Stanley was supposed to be the biggest there. Weight is wise and growth is wise, but ZigZag / Ricky was higher, and Armpit / Theodore was higher. Also X-Ray / Rex should have been one of the smallest boys, but it is not. The only thing I didn’t like about the film was that the memories were pretty convincing and long. I would prefer to see more of the present than the past, but this is just my opinion. I especially like the work of boys. Like Squid / Alan, played by Jake M. Smith was supposed to be a naughty and strong child. Jake M. Smith did exactly that and did a great job, like almost all of the actors in Hole. So I would say that if you have not seen “Holes”, then you definitely need to see it when it reappears, or you miss a lot of fun.
