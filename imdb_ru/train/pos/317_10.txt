Telemundo, of course, should consider creating a collection of the DVD story Xica! I know a lot of people, including me, who would like to have the opportunity to purchase the Xica novel! This is a very interesting story that takes place in Brazil. The costumes that the actors wear are beautiful, and the city where the story takes place is beautiful. Xica contains a lot of history from that time period. I would like Telemundo to show it on TV again, even if it were 2 am. I highly recommend watching Xica if it ever appears again on Telemundo. I have already emailed Telemundo a million times to show the novel again, but my requests were not heard. The only warning statement about Xica is that it sometimes contains some sharp scenes, so I would recommend that children under 14 not watch Xica. Overall, Xica deserves 10 out of 10!
