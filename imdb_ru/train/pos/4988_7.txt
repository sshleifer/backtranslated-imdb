Man's Castle is located in one of those built-up settlements built in Jerry style, on vacant lots and parks, which at that time were called “Hoovervilles”, named after our unfortunate 31st President, who was stuck in the Great Depression, taking place in his administration . The assumption of this film is that the man’s house is still his castle, even if he is just a shack in Gouverville. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy has such a hut, and, to tell the truth, this guy, even in good times, will not work all that much. But in the role that is very typical for Tracy, before he became a priest in San Francisco, at the beginning of a series of classic roles, he plays a tough, good-natured mug that accepts Loretta Young. <br /> <br /> Alone As for the Male Castle, this is what it shows the effect of Depression on women and men. Women were imposed several additional loads, if the men had problems finding a job, the women were twice as heavy. And they were sexually harassed, and some resorted to prostitution just to eat. Spence takes Loretta Young, who faces such problems, and does not make any demands on her in her castle. Pretty soon, although they are in love, although Tracy is not one of those who calm down. <br /> <br /> In the love scenes there was something special, because Tracy and Young had a hot romance during the filming of The Man. Castle. And both were Catholics and married, and in those days it was an insurmountable obstacle to marriage. Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith very seriously. <br /> <br /> Starring Walter Connolly, as a kind of father figure for the whole camp, Marjorie Rambo, who went through all the traps Young could face and trying to keep her away and Arthur Holl, a really disgusting bastard, who is also watching Young. With his plan, Chol brings the plot of the Male Castle to its apogee. <br /> <br /> Man's Castle is a gloomy look at the Great Depression, and not the usual movie fare for those who try to escape such a reality in their entertainment.
