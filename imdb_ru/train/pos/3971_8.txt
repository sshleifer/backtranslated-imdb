<br /> <br /> Have you ever felt that you were being watched as someone watched your every move? Well, just remember, before you decide to break the law, the FBI will always be there. At the very least, this feeling you experience after watching an exciting, but slightly ripe criminal drama, the story of the FBI. She traces the roots of the organization from a small bureau to one of the most modern institutions in the world (in 1959), telling the story through the eyes of one of its agents, Chip Hardesty (James Stewart). <br /> <br /> Chip has been at the FBI since day one, and he happily puts his job above all else in the world, even sometimes in his family. The FBI's story tracks his life, showing what he does as an agent, and how a person influences his personal life. The film shows amazingly what things the FBI does and how they deal with them. Viewers see Chip stopping riots in the Ku Klux Klan, going under cover to solve the scandal of murders and property in India, deliver the fugitives to custody, save the hostages and help fight the Second World War. He even helped bring the communist spies to justice. <br /> <br /> Stewart in a vaguely difficult job, as always, is stellar, like a slightly neurotic agent who loves his work, maybe too much. One of the best parts of this film is that we see the inner life of Chip and his work. We see how he suffers from the death of his best friend, and then his son. We also observe that his wife has a miscarriage, and in marriage - difficult times. Almost all his personal problems are caused by the love of his work. Vera Miles gives an excellent performance, but, nevertheless, it is very convincing. She was never a brilliant actress, but there was always something very attractive and seductive in her. Well, maybe it's just me? Unfortunately, none of the other presentations are worth mentioning, but the exciting story has managed to keep me extremely interesting. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of this film was impressive, especially the scenes in the South American jungle. All colors had a texture that really set the atmosphere for the film. Perhaps the biggest part of this film was the incredible guidance of Mervyn Leroy. Each scene was so smooth that they just skated together to tell a brilliant story. He is full of brilliant camera shots, some of which look very hitchcocky. <br /> <br /> In general, the FBI Story is an exciting, but underrated film. Hours of two and a half hours may frighten some viewers, but if you have such an opportunity, I recommend going to this. I enjoyed Jimmy Stewartâ€™s exciting performance and fascinating story.
