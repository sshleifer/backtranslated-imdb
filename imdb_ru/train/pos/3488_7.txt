WWE needed a savior as Wrestlemania 14 rolled around. The departure of Bret Hart and the subsequent evaporation of the Hart Foundation made Vile D-Generation X stable and unchallenged in WWE. Their despicable leader Shawn Michaels stole the title from Hart thanks to the intervention of Vince McMahon and with the help of his cohort Triple X and Chin systematically killed anyone who challenged his superiority. But in Royal Rumble a new rival appeared. Stone Cold Steve Austin. Hated by McMahonejing, Austin was worried about JH. So excited, in fact, that they enlisted the support of "The Worst Man on the Planet," Mike Tyson, as a special security official. Austin would have a serious chance against him in his title match with Sean Michaels. <br /> <br /> But first it was necessary to get the undercard with which the Legion of Destiny won an unforgettable battle of 15 teams, Royal, to become the No. 1 contenders for tag names. I really forgot that this match existed until I revised the PPV. Not very well and really emphasized the lack of depth in the separation of tags in that period of time. <br /> <br /> In the next match, the light heavyweight title was defended by champion Taka Michonoku against Agila. WWE has established a light heavyweight title to compete with a strong heavyweight division in WCW. This was not a success, and this was the only time the title was defended in Wrestlemania. A short match lasting about five minutes and really too short to accomplish much. What they did was exciting, and it was a good little match in which Taka retained his title. <br /> <br /> Well, in our next match, DX Triple H member defended the WWE European title, which he won in farcical fashion from Shaun Michaels in RAW in December, and he did not defend on PPV against Owen Hart, the Only Survivor . Triple H got a big entrance with the DX band to perform his song. China held the Triple-X to the ring, but then handcuffed WWE Commissioner Sergeant Slaughter. Triple H and Owen had a pleasant little meeting before Chin intervened, giving a weak blow to Hart, which led to the fact that Triple H retained the title. A good match could be great if it lasted a little longer. <br /> <br /> But, of course, we would not want to be distracted from our next match, in which real husband and wife Mark Mero and Sable defeated Goldust and Luna Vachon in the first mixed match in Wrestlemania for 8 years. And, frankly, it was not worth the wait. Although not scary, the match was in no way memorable. It was the approaching end of Mero’s only run at WWE, and the main goal was to continue the breakdown of his relationship with Sable. <br /> <br /> Then we saw that Ken Shamrock broke and cost himself an intercontinental championship. when he destroyed IC Champion The Rock, but then refused to let go of his ankle blocking hold, with the result that the judge reversed his decision. It was a short match, but worthy of what it was. <br /> <br /> Then there was the first good match of the night, when the champions of the WWE Tag Team New Age Outlaws lost their titles for Cactus Jack and Charlie's Chainsaw in the Merry Match. The decision was reversed the next night, as Cactus and chainsaw threw the criminals behind the scenes, not the one that was used in the match, but it was still a fun contest. <br /> <br /> NO, it was time for the long-awaited first ever meeting between Kane and his brother Undertaker. Kane cost WWE Undertaker to the Royal Rumble, and then “killed” him when he helped Sean Michaels to lock the Undertaker in the coffin and set him on fire as revenge for the Undertaker, burning his parents house and leaving him badly disfigured years ago. It was a worthy match and told a good story, since the Underataker absorbed everything Kane could throw at him, and then knocked him out with three tombstones to finish the match. <br /> <br /> This left only the main event that WWE saw. Face champion Steve Austin with Mike Tyson as a guest performer. Michaels suffered a grueling back injury in a match against Undertaker at Royal Rumble and was outstanding in this match, despite his physical limitations. Triple H and Chyna were driven backwards at the beginning of the journey after outside intervention. The fight ended with Austin trying to play Sweet Chin Music and hit the referee with Stone Cold Stunner. Then Tyson entered the ring to count the three, celebrating his victory with Austin, and then knocking Michaels after the match. It turned out that Tyson and Austin were together, and the cat was playing with the mouse all the time. <br /> <br /> This was the last PPV match for Shaun Michaels for four and a half years. This helped make Austin the biggest star in the wrestling business, and the popularity brought about by Tyson’s appearance was a crucial turning point in the WWE-WCW battle. Austin will be the biggest star in WWE history, and together with Rock Mick Foley, Undertaker and Triple H will lead WWE at a time when they will receive the highest level of cultural significance. And it all started here in Wrestling 14.
