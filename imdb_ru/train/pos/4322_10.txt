Perhaps you are not indifferent to the social commentary or the point of view of the directors (I myself am puzzled by the fact that Kazdan seemed to advocate "insignificance" when it is clear that the actions taken in the film contribute to a certain meaning. I was embarrassed by the end). However, it is absolutely impossible to deny how the story is presented; magnificent symbolism everywhere; threaded symbol arc; visual; dialogue ?? This is an absolute job. I watched the movie dozens of times and still amazed at his perfection. There is not a single moment, action, line or line that has nothing to do with the topic. Realistic human notions from all actors. Scene backstage, it is woven fantastic. <br /> <br /> I have a good level meter. The buzzer never worked during this movie. If you are a thinker (and not a casual viewer) ?? This movie delivers. Exponentially. Absolutely mesmerizing. (Do I have to agree with the message to evaluate the screen? Who cares if it embarrassed you or was unclear, was it interesting?) <br /> <br /> Did the movie affect me personally ?? much. In my top 5. <br /> <br /> Note: The reviewer on the first page clearly speaks of the wrong perception of African Americans. What could he possibly not have recognized, was it a hand ?? shake. Not distribution. “A spiritually dead white man,” just saw a man to respect and admire. And he did something with it. The fact that he was black had nothing to do with it (the color is simply used to draw a parallel. And the abyss. It is not by chance that the sequence of discoveries also changes from black to white). If you view the blacks in this film as a token, you can reconsider your alarm. You can only see black and white yourself. Just a thought.
