Now I had the pleasure to watch the Infected Man for the first time when its premiere took place on television in December 2000. <br /> <br /> An infectious diseases expert (William Hurt) loses his family when an unknown disease penetrates his house and kills them. Now, a few years later, he is now in Russia or somewhere else. I'm not sure exactly where, all I know is somewhere in the area. In any case, due to budget cuts in the laboratory of infectious diseases, they are forced to lay off most of their employees. One of them, a disgruntled guard named Joseph Muller (played by Peter Weller, best known for his role as indestructible Robocop), goes in there and demands that his work be returned to him. He needs this job because he is divorced and he needs her to pay child support. So he goes there, a fight begins, and some things overturn, dangerous things. It soon became clear that Muller was infected with a deadly pathogen. In fact, it is so deadly, one drop of his blood will kill a person in seconds. Soon there was a rumor, and a disease expert (Hurt) was called in to investigate, and he later teamed up with an American reporter. Now Muller is determined to return home to see his wife and son, and will stop at nothing, even if he will have to infect the entire population of Russia. <br /> <br /> Now, as I said, this film is very similar to Fall Down. We have a concerned person (Weller, Michael Douglas in “Falling Down”) who will stop at nothing to achieve their goal, even if they have to kill several people in the process. Then we have a hero that looks like a hero (it hurts, Robert Duval in “Falling Down”), who sympathizes and intends to stop the antagonist. <br /> <br /> “Infected Man” is actually a very good movie with a good line story and some very good performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
