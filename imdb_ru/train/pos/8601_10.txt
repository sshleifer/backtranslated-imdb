My observations: the vamp clothes at the end are delightful and wonderful, exotic and fantastic. Janette wore it well, and even with the naive Nelson. The boat crashing into his balcony served him straight. The costumes of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well, especially by today's standards. 1942 costume designer did a great job. The main theme of the song is just superb. <br /> <br /> Caution, negative posters: 1942 was the time of the Second World War; Pearl Harbor happened a year earlier. The US has just come out of the Great Depression; It was necessary to go out and spend this hard-earned money for a passion for singing, dancing and yes, a fantastic fantasy. Despotic dictators tried to rule there in the RL, suppressing freedoms. Thank God, the public had these fantastic subject films. Going to the movies in those sad times was a privilege. When you, negative posters, become actors or even movie stars, then you have a place for talking and criticism. The films of Janette and Nelson stand the test of time. <br /> <br /> Angel wings are a wonderful, real angel. RL at a costume party is not so hot, but great for Janette, given the SL. <br /> <br /> The beautiful singing of Jeanette and Nelson, as always. Dancing Janette was pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> 15/10
