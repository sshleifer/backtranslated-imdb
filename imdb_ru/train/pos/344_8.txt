Another entry in the horror festival category, which fills the shelves of your local video store. The plot of the “spoiler” “offended know-it-all, avenging“ cool ”children who have offended him”, of course, will be familiar to those who have watched it before. And those who have seen it before will probably watch it again; those who are waiting for Ingmar Bergman and will subsequently be outraged by their lost time should just skip it. Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack, and David Boreanaz, Denise Richards and Katherine Heigl as an eye-candy - go with the flow and enjoy it. Oh, and I loved the creepy mask.
