This film is a sharp political commentary representing the history of the majority. It is annoying that it works effectively on both levels. It should not, but it is. This story about four boys and a girl, who grew up in 1953 in communist Belgrade, brings joy to the heart. This is what gentlemen call a classic movie. Obviously, Belgrade in 1953 is not as severe as the dictatorial and fascist milieu, as the communist society often depicts. You can listen to rock and roll music, one of the songs being played is the song "Hey, Babu Riba" called the movie. But you can not buy any jeans or certain drugs that it is illegal to possess. In contrast to the harsh criticism of a communist society, this film demonstrates how it affects the lives of the five main characters, who call themselves four. A girl who has a father in exile in Italy and is waiting for a passport for her mother and her family to join him, the piano taken from the sacrament from one of the boys, the sudden surrender of your house and premises to your new comrades because they need it . The boys spend a lot of time listening to music, and it becomes clear that they despise fascism, which created communism, when they enter into a quarrel with a fascist charlatan who has Stalin's tattoo on his hands. All of this leads to actions that they take later, and to the memory that time is running out, since this film was released in 1986 in the twilight of the Soviet Empire. Great movie worth seeing again and again. "Repentance is not your enemy, but, nevertheless, no one and no friend."
