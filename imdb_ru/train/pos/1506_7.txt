Before films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Suspiria and Halloween changed the horror concept forever, the genre was a more gothic and far less violent era. Films such as the TV series “The Hammer's Horror” and “Rosemary's Baby” were what scared the audience in the 60s and early 70s. I can't tell you how many times I shot this film as a child, but I did it because there was something in it. I didn’t want to limit myself to films about slashers and zombies of the 70s and 80s, as well as about films like this production, from the famous, but unfortunately, long-gone film company Amicus. Great, eerie music. Strong performances star composition. Brilliant cinematography. Many good old thrills and chills, especially in the first and last vignettes. Some memorable moments and images. Moves slowly but steadily. The house is one creepy, oppressive dwelling. Excellent production design and scenery decorations that give the film a real gothic horror. It depends on the thrill more on the mood and bloodless chill than on dried blood and causeless nudity. <br /> <br /> Cons: in the first half, there were some problems with the rhythm. Besides the “Cloak”, the rest of the stories feel that they were made earlier. Cliche is abundant. The second story, Waxworks, has an excellent game and its moments, but it is the weakest of the four in terms of fear and expectation. Low budget does show from time to time. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: seeing this film for the first time in many years, I understand why I shot it so often. This is by no means a masterpiece, but a good example of the time when horror films were made with style and class. Watch it with the lights off. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
