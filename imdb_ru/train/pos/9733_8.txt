“How to lose friends and alienate people” is an entertaining, though free, adaptation of Toby Young’s memoirs of the same name. This is also a great headline to help fill in line requirements in IMDb reviews! The main essence is the same as in the book, in which some incidents are dramatized, but a romantic plot is added, and the final, of course, is Hollywood. Simon Pegg, despite the fact that he plays a really annoying person, is usually his pretty and funny person and he wears the film pretty much. It is strange to think that just a few years ago he was just a comedy TV presenter, and now he is talking to Hollywood names. There is a good cast, and this is a fun, lightweight watch - something like a male “Ugly Betty”, but funnier.
