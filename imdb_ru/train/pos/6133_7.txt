Easily the greatest low-budget horror movie of all time. I first saw this film when I was about nine years old, and I must say that it scared me. Now, when I grew up, I see this film as it really is ... a brilliant piece. Everyone, or at least everyone who has a taste, dreamed of seeing a snowman kill people, even if they did not recognize it. I always found something really scary in the snowmen, so naturally, for such a terrible drug addict like me, this movie was a dream. Some people say that this film is stupid or completely devoid of any information ... this is a film about a snowman serial killer, what the hell did you expect? Anyone who has given a low rating to this film is obviously too excited to sit back and laugh at the silly lines and cheap blood. I love this film for what it is, comedy, and until the film industry comes to mind and makes a serious horror film about a snowman killer (which, unfortunately, seems impossible), I will always keep this big piece of indie horror close to heart ,
