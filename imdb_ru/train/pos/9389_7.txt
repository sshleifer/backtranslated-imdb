Red Rock West (1993) <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage finds himself embroiled in a deadly crime without even knowing it, and dominoes lead to an increase in danger, adventure and accidents in the wild abandoned American West of the 1990s. Red Rock West is often cruel and sometimes hilarious, and Cage copes with his usual sardonic wit and careful ease. <br /> <br /> Is the plot excessive? Yes. Is Dennis Hopper perfect as a crazy, almost likeable killer? Yes. Does Cage have a chance? Well, you should look and see. He never gives up, and I was surprised when I first saw it. On the second preview yesterday, I was surprised at how well it was held, how well it was constructed, and how dark and funny it was at the same time. <br /> <br /> Directed by Ron Dahl (who also helped write) is better known for his work on television, but with Rounders and this film he shows a deft hand with sensational plots. By the way, it is saved by humor and caricatures. The bar is sloppy, the police are dubious. And don't miss the truly inspired cameo of Dwight Joacam as a truck driver.
