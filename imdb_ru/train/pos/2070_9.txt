Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and the late Vic Morrow are the human stars of this film about a young man who is looking for answers about the death of his brother. Mr. Shin, Mr. Margolin and Mr. Morrow are all in the front ranks of their roles; Ms. Phillips has a slightly less than enviable task — to try to make a film created specifically for television (twenty-five years ago) by “sexual interest” in a film that was otherwise asexual. The real star, however, is the California Kid; Ford’s 1934 coupe, borrowed from Jake Jacobs, placed in front of the camera and taken to a training session that would make the viewer gasp, gasp and hold the edge of the seat with breathless anticipation. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are exciting, (although some dialogs are a bit flimsy), contributing to the good entertainment of the evening. This is how all "car films" should be made. <br /> <br /> Try to make this movie on the late channel of the movie; it's well worth the missed sleep.
