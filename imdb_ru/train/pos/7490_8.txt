Until today, I have never seen this film. He was filmed on the set of the Old Dark House and Frankenstein and concerns a small Bavarian village where supposedly giant bats suck the blood of the villagers. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is a damn good movie with an atmosphere that can be spared. and the cast who won't quit smoking, Lionel Atville, Dwight Fry, Fay Ray and Melvin Douglas play the role of a character named Brettschnider, which is interesting to me because it was my great-grandmother's maiden name. <br /> <br /> This is a carefully modulated film, in which there is an uncertain and witty liner that slowly builds up in a short time, going astray only when, about ten minutes before the end, they realized that they had a limited time to wrap everything up. From now to the end, this is a direct transition to the finish line with a very small amount of funny that preceded it. <br /> <br /> Leonard Maltin and IMDb list a run time of 71 minutes and warn of shorter prints. The problem is that IMDb and Maltin can be wrong, and in this case, I think that this is so, because the source, which I trust more, says that the total work time is 67 minutes (Encyclopedia Overlook Film). To argue about this, I know, is insane, but since most of the print media are available, usually around 60-63 minutes, the amount of missing material is much less if its duration is only 67 minutes. Personally, I think it will not matter much, as it is a maximum of five minutes, and I very much doubt that it will make or break the film. <br /> <br /> What time it will be if you like squeaky old movies, do it, by all means, watch this movie, it's a great dark and stormy night movie.
