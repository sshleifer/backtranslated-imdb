I really need this on a tape, not on a DVD, and soon! <br /> <br /> I have one nephew who is in the infantry, but not yet deployed, although he is going to go to Iraq soon after December 2008. I lost my beloved stepson in Ramadi Iraq 09-15-05 from an unmanned rocket in the green zone. I have another nephew who joins the army as soon as he finishes high school this spring, because he, like his older brother, has an idealized and romantic idea of ​​what military service is. My stepson died in just 10 days in the country, and he never went on any missions, so my nephews have no way to refer to any experience shown in this candid documentary film, based on some personal experience, which my late son could pass, <br /> <br /> I cannot do anything with those who are or have already left, but I have one left who did not raise his hand and was sworn in. I desperately want him to do this, no one else did. <br /> <br /> Please help me with this. <br /> <br /> The documentary "The Basis of Truth" is the best visual reference book that I have. ever seen. I need to somehow get my younger nephew to see what he gets into before it’s too late. BUT: (don't laugh) I need my mom to see it first. She should actually see and hear these men and women, not just an idea about them, but the truth about what they will be immersed in, perhaps forever. Then she will have an emotional determination to get my brother to watch this movie, and when he does, he can then force his son, my younger nephew, to watch it too. Then my nephew might start taking it seriously. <br /> <br /> (((is there another case when it will be shown on TV? If so, please tell me when?))) <br /> <br /> However, my problem is that my mom doesn't have a dvd player, she still uses video (is this correct? with tapes?) So I need to find a way for her to watch this movie. Can I buy it from someone in this form? If not, is there any other way to get it from someone in the form of a tape? Is there any legitimate link I can pay to download it to my computer and then transfer it to tape? If so, with whom to contact. I will gladly pay for a privilege if it is a legitimate reference. <br /> <br /> Or, if you have alternative ideas, I’ll consider everything you can offer. <br /> <br /> Please help me, I lost one very valuable adored and loved one, I already know that my elder nephew will never be the same when he returns, and I can also lose him. I cannot lose three, and the emotional losses for all those who return are too high to pay for every male child in my family of this generation. Please help me. I’m happy to call you, write me a phone number if this is the best way to get the necessary information. Thanks so much for any help you can offer. <br /> <br /> Regards, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
