I laughed after reading all the idiotic comments on this film, <br /> <br /> because it is obvious that those people who criticized the film never saw it or were so stupid that they paid to watch it. <br /> <br /> The best reason to watch was on the Elvira show several years ago. Elvira shot the movie with as much laughter as she can. <br /> <br /> This is a good monster, compared to hundreds of horrible American films. It is better!!!!
