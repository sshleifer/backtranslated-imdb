If people didn't know who Barbra Streisand was before, ... (is it POSSIBLE?) ... they knew exactly who she was! <br /> <br /> This show won 5 Emmys, & stands out as one of the best things Streisand has ever done. <br /> <br /> It consists of 3 acts .... <br /> <br /> ACT I ... Barbraâ€™s singing standards from room to room a room filled with musicians, including the part where she is again a little girl, and it all ends with a great version of her trademark song (at the time) ... People. <br /> <br /> ACT II .... A musical tour of Bergdoff-Goodman, while Barbra sings songs of poverty .. this is better than it seems ... <br /> <br /> ACT III. .... The best part, Just Barbra, musicians, and some wonderful songs, such as ..... "Happy days are here again", and "Funny girl" potpourri .... <br /> <br /> In All in all, much of the history of television is made by one of the greatest performers in the world!
