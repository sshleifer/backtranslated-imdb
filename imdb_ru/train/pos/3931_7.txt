A somewhat contrived biographical portrait of Abraham Lincoln’s early years from director John Ford, focused mainly on the process in which the young lawyer defends two brothers accused of murder. <br /> <br /> The film presents an interesting image of this important American. the figure and film are well made, but it seems somewhat incomplete without any remarkable moments of his presidency or even his debates with Stephen Douglas. The obvious intention was to portray Lincoln as a young man, developing qualities that would make him the great man he will become. But the result for me was that, although I admired the image, it simply wasn’t as satisfactory as I thought it could have been on a large scale. <br /> <br /> In the role of Abraham Lincoln, we have the Henry Fonda, which effectively displays calm strength. Work Funds includes some gangster manners and other affects that are quite effective in presenting a portrait of Lincoln, especially in combination with some effective makeup and costume, which is sometimes a little frank. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is solid and surprisingly doesn’t include many of Ford’s regular support staff (sometimes referred to as its stock company), but we have Ward Bond, one of the most prolific characters in Hollywood. Bond appeared in more than 100 of the best AFI films than any other actor in both the original and the revised list. He also appeared in 11 nominations "Best Picture". <br /> <br /> There is one scene in the film that seemed to inspire a rather similar scene in “To Kill a Mockingbird,” where it would have been done even better than she. here, although this scene is one of the most effective in this film.
