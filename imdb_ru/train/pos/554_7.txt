(contains small spoilers) <br /> <br /> I wonder how Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here. Stewart, of course, is remembered by many as George Bailey from Frank Capra’s film “It's a Beautiful Life,” so it’s easy to find parallels between two films. In The Beautiful Life, Bailey sees the world as it would have been if he had never been born. In “Far Country” by Jeff Webster Stewart, without interfering to help anyone (except yourself), you can see, in essence, the same thing: a world in which he (on all practical issues) does not exist. /> <br /> Without interfering (and trying not to take care of anyone), Webster is forced to see those for whom he cannot help but take care, get hurt, push and even kill, while he stands and does nothing. This reminds the viewer of George Bailey, watching the world, which turned upside down, because he also decided not to intervene, even without being born. <br /> <br /> Both films end with the same image - close-up call. Stewart, turning his philosophy of innocence, seems to have earned his “wings”.
