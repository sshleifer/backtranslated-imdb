A wonderful, disturbing film about the true, senseless, brutal murder of the family of a small town, as well as the consequences and testing of the lives of the killers Dick Hicca and Perry Smith. <br /> <br /> No No matter how much time passes, or what this film looks like, it still resonates with the complete incomprehensibility of such criminal acts. <br /> <br /> This really traces a multitude of tragedies: the tragedy, the cruelty and senselessness of the killing of the Clutter family, a decent farming family in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas; and the wasted, cruel and sad life of Hickok and Smith. <br /> <br /> An interesting moment is noted in the film: none of these two immature, frightened, petty criminals would have ever thought about going through something like this is one thing. But together they created a dangerous, murderous collective personality; one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them. They push each other along the road, “proving” something to each other. That they were enough for a man to do this to accomplish this; neither wants to be considered too cowardly to complete his big “bill”; the wretched and dangerous remnant of the desert life they led. These were two adult children who live in the world of the criminal, not laughing back; who constantly need to prove courage and endurance. in this case, these needs were brought to the very killing of the Clutters. <br /> <br /> The film contains a somewhat sentimental view of the Clutter family, but the point is. They were respected, law-abiding people from a small town who did not deserve this terrible fate. The film also gives us a sense of the young life of Hickok and Smith. Perry Smith, whose youth was full of safety and love, but watched in horror as the alcohol leads his family along the tragic path. Hickok, poor and left largely on his own devices, is not able to understand how he fits, using his intellect and charm to deceive everyone he has contacted. <br /> <br /> Interesting, and perhaps the first Look at the death penalty, and what we hope to achieve. Is it nothing more than killing out revenge for killing that shook the nation at a time when we have not yet encountered the fact that there may be such predators among us, or does putting these guys at the end of the rope really provide a detective story? to the childish and cruel posturing of such people? Is it possible to keep people who live by deception, acting under the radar, believing that they are deceiving everyone with whom they come in contact? To be discreet, you must believe that you may be caught. Is it possible to keep these people who believe that they are too smart to be caught? Who committed hundreds of petty crimes and got away with it? It was supposed to be a “backup”, “no witnesses”. <br /> <br /> When he is caught, Hicock discovers that he cannot fascinate and deceive the agents, as he worked in the department stores. Smith, who believes that in any case he deserves such a fate, which seemed to be the only one who really realized the seriousness of what they did, readily tells the story when he learns that Hiccock is cowardly bent. Hickok blinked first. Stupid chicken game between two immature, emotionally damaged, dangerous people. <br /> <br /> A fascinating psychological thriller that tells the story of a terrible crime in the history of this country. Awesome images of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. These roles made their career.
