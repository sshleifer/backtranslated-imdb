Depardieu's most famous film is (1974) the innovator from the film Bertrand Blier. There are a lot of sex scenes bordering X-rated, including Jeanne Moreau playing the hot version of her Jules of the 1970s, and Jim runs a troika with two hairy French hippies (Depardieu and Dewar). There is no such thing as sacred territory in this film; all honest. <br /> <br /> It is very strange that Americans do not like this film, although many French people whom I met consider it a classic. Something in this is contrary to what the Americans have programmed for "love." <br /> <br /> Gerard and the late Patrick Dewar are two hippie bastards with a lot of sexual problems that go around harassing women and committing petty crimes. Bleer pokes fun at these two guys, at the same time making bourgeois society itself look much more ridiculous in the end. Best of all, however, is how the wonderful appreciation of Stefan Grappelli conveys the restless soul of the drifters, the deeper subconscious or “higher ideal” that motivates all the recklessness in which they are engaged.
