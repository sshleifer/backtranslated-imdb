This is a very well-made film, carefully filmed and with an excellent character, which sometimes touches deeply - for example, a scene with a faithful but inexperienced police assistant and his wife. The plot is convincingly worked out and fascinating. Character-gangster is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero. It became clear that the cops are as rough and ready as the characters of the underworld. <br /> <br /> A few short remarks: I found the final slightly one-sided, as it marks the heroâ€™s successful integration into the police structure and the justice system, which breaks the ambiguity of the police characters that has been maintained until this point. I also found that the main character is a bit weak: a little more than a catalyst for saving a hero, all she seems to do is cry and faint while the tough guys fight.
