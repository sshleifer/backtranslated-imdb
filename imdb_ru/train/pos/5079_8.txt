Well, first of all, I would like to clarify that the Kaaha Kaaha is part of the Tamil prayer and roughly translates to "protect." Haha, on the other hand, refers to the color of the police uniform (this is Haha!). <br /> <br /> Also, the Tamil film industry is full of purely commercial enterprises, and any Rajnikant or Vijay movie could be a covenant. on this statement. <br /> <br /> Now Kaaha Kaaha is a GREAT movie with a great soundtrack. Of course, very stunning in the final scene, especially the finale (which is definitely unexpected!). Sometimes there is too much blood, but, of course, this is a great movie!
