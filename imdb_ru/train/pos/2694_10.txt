Garde à Vue must be looked at several times in order to understand the subplots it contains. If you are not used to verbose French films based on conversations and a battle of minds and not actions, don’t even try to watch them. You only get boredom to death, and are assured that French films are not for you. <br /> <br /> Garde à Vue is a verbose film, mostly based on dialogues (by the way, written by Audiard), and it mercilessly cuts the veil of appearance. <br /> <br /> Why does Master Martino (Cerro) prefer to be accused of being the murderer of children instead of telling the truth? Because at the time of the murder, he was with an 18-year-old girl, with whom he had an 8-year sexual relationship. His wife knows this, she is jealous of this, and he prefers to execute (the death penalty was still used in France in 1980) rather than reveal the only “pure and innocent” aspect of his pitiful life.
