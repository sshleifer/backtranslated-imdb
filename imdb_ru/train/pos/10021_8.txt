This story, based on the two plays of Edgar Allen Poe (“The Fall of the House of Usher”, “The Dance of Death” (poem)), is actually quite creepy from beginning to end. It looks like some old black and white films about people who are found in an old dilapidated house (for example, “The Cat and the Canary”, “The Old Dark House”, “The Night of Horror”, etc.) ). Boris Karloff plays a life-size mad inventor of dolls who terrorize guests. He dies early in the film (or is he?), And the inhabitants of the house are subjected to a whole series of terrible experiences. I will not go into details here, but it is certainly necessary for fans of the old secrets of the dark house. <br /> <br /> Watch it with lots of popcorn and soda in a dark room. /> <br /> Dan Basing 8/10
