A child with ideals who is trying to change things around him. A boy who is forced to become a man because of the system. A system that hides the truth and violates the right to exist. The boy, inspired by Martin Luther King, gets up and speaks the truth. A family that is falling apart and struggling with it. The film, from which you can not hide. You see things, and you hear things, and you feel things that you are about until the day you die, you will hope that nothing has really happened. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can do nothing, and a boy with, excuse me, balls, a boy who will not accept things that will not allow something to happen to him, a child with power and a child who behaves like a professional, as if he never did anything else, he caricature this film to the end, and anyone who wants to see how violence found its place in the 60s.
