When I think about this film, all the adjectives that come to mind are somehow connected with the physical perception of the world. Texture, smell, color, thatâ€™s how I think this film should be judged from the point of view. Look at the rich gold tones surrounding the young concubine, sleeping by the fireplace, or the stuffy Turkish bath, and let her fill your senses with impressions of spices, coarse fabric, smooth skin, aromatic oils, shimmering flames, rustling rustle. Don't just look and listen, be absorbed, let the humming voice of the narrator hypnotize you.
