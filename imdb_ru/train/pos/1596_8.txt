Although Cher and Cage are the protagonists of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good partners for them - that's where Loretta and Ronnie will be in 50 years from - still in love. The whole cast does an excellent job from Aiello to John Mahoney - it shows a real piece of life. Although I saw it a long time ago, I am glad that at last he catapulted Cage to where he was recognized in Hollywood for his talent. From music to scenes in opera and to the kitchen table, this is a very entertaining film.
