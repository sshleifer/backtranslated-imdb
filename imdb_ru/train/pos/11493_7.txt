“Unborn” is a pretty good low-budget horror film that uses fears related to pregnancy. This is always very well played by a good Brooke Adams and a bi-film follower James Karen, although the support roll is rather average for a b-grader. Gary Numan's music from all people is also good. Henry Dominic's script is intelligent enough for this kind of thing, although there is a hint of misogyny in this. Rodman Fender's direction is just adequate, and there are some unnecessary cheap fears. If you're an Adams fan, whose film career isn't as good as it should be, check it out; she is gorgeous as always.
