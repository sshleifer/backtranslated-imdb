The election marks the second thematic film about the Lawsuit Society, made by Johnny K. <br /> <br /> To amazingly name Simon Jan and Tony Leung Kar Faye as Lok and Big D, two participants in the process who were selected as candidates for the post of chairman of the Ho Singh Society, a 100-year-old test society. <br /> <br /> Although Locke is a man who is always cool, Big D is not only impatient, but also thinks he is on top of everything. Lock was elected the next chairman for 2 years. To gain full control of the gang, the newly elected chairman must be transferred with the help of the Dragon Rod, which represents power and authority. Big Dee was extremely dissatisfied with the results that he was not selected as the next chairman after paying a substantial amount of bribes to council members. He ordered his man to take the baton before he fell into the hands of Locke. <br /> <br /> As long as Big D gets Baton, Locke has other plans for him. <br /> <br /> This is one of the thematic films about the test community, where a lot of bloodshed is not needed. Johnny That puts people's greed in a film where bloodshed is commonly used in other thematic films about test societies to show how people's greed can lead to the death or fall of one of them. However, not a single bullet is used, hardly any group battles participate in elections. It is a battle of minds that distinguishes “Elections” from the rest. <br /> <br /> In addition to Maggie Shiu, the only actress in “Choices” who has less than 5 lines in the film, masculinity controls the entire movie. , Louis Koo and Nick Chung, who was seen in To’s previous film, are being shot as an undercover policeman and a gangster who sold his life to a gang, respectively. Together with some of the veteran actors appearing in the film and a great script, he makes the only HK film representing the Cannes Film Festival 2005. <br /> <br /> The elections hardly failed critics who want a different test of the public theme of the film.
