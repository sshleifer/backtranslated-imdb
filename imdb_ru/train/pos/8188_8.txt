I fully enjoyed the first part of these two participants, Impossible Planet, and was a little worried that the second part would not stand as well as it did in the past of two participants of the previous series 2 Who. But, fortunately, my fears were groundless, since I enjoyed this episode just like the previous one. In any case, we start with the surviving crew members on the run from Ood, who became the devil's pawn. There is also a bit of philosophizing on the part of the Doctor in the episode, which I really liked. Needless to say, this was a good and convincing story of Doctor Who. Although it may be too intense for young viewers. <br /> <br /> My rating: B +
