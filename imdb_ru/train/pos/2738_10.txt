I have not seen this for more than 20 years, but I still remember some things about it. <br /> <br /> This film could NOT be made in color. Strong grays are what makes it, and was life so simple in the 1950s? Most of all in my memory stands Perry Smith, going to the gallows. His breath is under the hood shortly before they set up a trap. I don't think I could watch it again ..... once is enough. It's like that nameless guy at the start of Papillon, who in horror pulled out to the guillotine. The guy who said to watch it on a double count with “The Walking Dead” should have added the last 10 minutes “I want to live”. <br /> <br /> Some of my ancestors, being “aristami”, went to the guillotine in 1794-95, so my feelings for the death penalty are quite intense.
