As a knowledgeable fan, I recommend this film as true to the facts and well played. When I was 11 years old, I lived in Istanbul, I heard some friends talking about a new musical sensation that made the girls scream. I thought, um, if girls like them, they must be crap. My only recordings before this time were the Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. Soon, while on vacation with my family in the military cafeteria in Izmir, I heard a song (which I later recognized “Love Me Do”) and was struck by the difference between her and every song I had ever heard before. When I heard my elder brother's "Meet The Beatles" album, I was hooked for life. After reading the final book about their endeavors (by Davis), I was surprised that this film was very well in line with the facts, with the exception of excluding most of sex and drug use (it concerned the use of methadrin / dexadrin). ). >
