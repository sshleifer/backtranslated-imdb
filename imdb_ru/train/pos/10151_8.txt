Beautiful greeting card from New York. Most of all I liked to look at it with my whole family, and not to distort in anticipation of a silly joke about the toilet. It never happened. My teenagers also liked it. My son is for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter is for Michael Vartan. My wife and I said that we could not remember the last time we sat with the children, and everyone enjoyed something. This film told a story that was comfortable, but not old and not finished. The ending came with a turn that we all liked too. If you are not just a cynical person and are ready to tell a story, then this is for you. As a guy, I need a lot to keep my interest when it comes to romantic films, and this one did. I recommend it, and we need more of these films to watch.
