In response to the man who made the comment about how the film stretches, and who thought that the role of Brother Jess is meaningless, here is my answer: <br /> <br /> Brother Jessâ€™s role is to provide a dramatic form irony in the story. Craig Schaeffer / Norman could have foreseen the problems associated with life, fully looking at how Brother Jess turned out to be. There are various instances when Brad Pitt and his life flow in parallel, for example, when Brother Jess takes Craig Schaeffer to a scattered bar and subsequently he finds Brad Pitt there a few days later. The dramatic irony was that the character Craig Schaeffer had more emotional turmoil in the death of his brothers, knowing that he could do more to prevent it, and subsequently create a more convincing mood in the film.
