This film is one of the best Tom Cruise films. He captures the imagination of the audience with his role as David Ames. His character can somehow relate to all of us. The storyline is very clever and keeps the audience on the edge throughout the film. I have never watched Cruise films so much before, but when he sees this, he shows me his real talent. My favorite part in the film is the end, when everything comes to a big conclusion, and he will know the truth. If you have not seen this yet, be sure to try. This is one of those films that as soon as you started watching it, you just have to see it to the end, otherwise it will make you think and you will regret it. My opinion, you should just buy it and risk what I did, and it became one of my favorite films of all time. This is A * 10/10 I promise, as soon as you watch it, it will stay with you and you will like it forever.
