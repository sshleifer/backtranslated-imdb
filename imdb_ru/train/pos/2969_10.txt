This film tells about two guys who were involved in sports on the spot, trying to get two to get a hot chick. BASEketball becomes a nationwide sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the favorite captain, but he is hated when he loses the NBA to another rival team. He meets the girl of his dreams, Yasmine Blyth, and in the end they kiss. When I first saw this movie, I wet my pants, it was so funny. a definite must see for all comedy fans. If you love South Park, you'll love it! Maybe not looking with children, this is a little inappropriate for little guys. some losers give him 6 1/2 out of ten, I give him 11 out of ten. i love the chicken coop it rocks i have to go goodbye thanks for reading this
