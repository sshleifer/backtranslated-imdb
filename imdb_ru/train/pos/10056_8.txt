We watched it in my class “Women's Health Problems,” to show how in many societies women are treated worse than men, and I really liked this film. I plan to try to get a copy of it myself to watch. The story is very touching, and I recommend it to everyone. I am a fan of different cultures, and this film was exactly what I needed. This film is for the whole family, despite its rating. This is a film that I will show my children. Our class teacher wanted the film to be too educational for women in the first place, but this film was more than that. This is one of those films that will forever remain in my memory and become loved.
