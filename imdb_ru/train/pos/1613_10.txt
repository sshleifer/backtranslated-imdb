This movie is still a favorite all the time. Only an elaborate, insane jerk will not enjoy this wonderful film. This film is reminiscent of a piece of warm apple pie with French vanilla ice cream! I think that this is Cher's best work and her most believable performance. Cher has always been gifted with charisma, beautiful appearance and enviably thin figure. Does she like to sing or not - who else sounds like Cher? Cher has definitely left her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered for a long time after others come and go. She is one of the most unique artists. Funny, because who would think of Cher as such a gifted actress? She is a cut above the so-called movie stars "today." Cher is a real actor on the same level as Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett and some others, in that she never seems "acting", she really becomes a hero convincingly. She more than earned the respect of her peers and the public. <br /> <br /> Everything about Moonstruck is wonderful - characters, scenery, dialogues, food. I never get tired of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Each time I watch a scene where they all sit at the dinner table at Rose’s house, I pause at the console to find out exactly how tasty Rose’s food is. a portion. I saw spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but I can't understand if they eat ravioli, ziti? What is this main course? It looks great and it drives me crazy! <br /> <br /> Everyone in this family was hardworking, and they respected and cared about each other. The grandfather was not pushed aside and tolerated, he was a vital part of the family, and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom. He, too, seemed a rather healthy, independent old man. <br /> <br /> Loretta’s mom was not “just a housewife,” she was the glue that held the family together and was an example of what a wife, mother, and home manager should strive to be. She was proud of what lifestyle she chose, but did not allow her to determine who she was. Powerful businessmen are not as comfortable in their skin as Rose Casterini. Pay attention to the daring way she said: “I did not have children until I was 37 years old. This is not the end until it ends. ” You had a feeling that she was one of those young women who did exactly what she liked and achieved her goal, until the other person realized what had happened. She was charming, smart and very intelligent. What a great mom! <br /> <br /> I really didn’t like Loretta right away because she seemed like a kind of knowledge - all of this, who really wasn’t so adventurous and so controlled herself as she wanted others to think She could tell others about herself and where they made a mistake, but she really didn’t use common sense in her own life. She was going to marry her mother’s middle-aged boy simply because she wanted a husband, a sense of identity and purpose in her life. She was more ordinary than her own mother. She dressed and wore her hair like a matron in a custodial home, and it seemed that she was bored without humor, but under you felt that she was vulnerable and alone, and she had a lot of love to give the right man. She is likely to eventually become a beautiful mom too. <br /> <br /> I could see in the future a house full of loud, screaming happy children of Loretta and Ronnie, and Rose and Cosmo enjoyed every minute of it.
