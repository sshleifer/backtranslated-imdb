Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston. I was very skeptical when I first watched this movie. I mean, what is a conceptual night. Jim Carrey is playing God? Nothing is sacred. <br /> <br /> Well, this film is hardly sacred, but it is also not sacrilegious, at least to a large extent. Yes, Jim Carrey possesses the powers of God for a while, but he is not God. Embarrassed? I will give you a low rate. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter out of luck, and he feels very unsuccessful in his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Anniston), and you can immediately say that they love each other, but the relationship between them is rather fragile. <br /> <br /> Then Bruce shot the lead. Just so that Evan Baxter steals it secretly. Obviously, this is not the case; Bruce shares his thoughts with the world on television in such a way that it is ridiculous and certainly deserves to be fired. <br /> <br /> Much later, complaining and shouting about God, Bruce gets a page. After a while he got tired of calling, so he answers and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is the boss, electrician and janitor of the building. I found it very funny. God is the Boss, the Holy Spirit is the Electric, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor. I'm thinking about it. Boss, obviously. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. Janitor, the guy who cleans up the mess left by the world. BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> In any case, Bruce is a bit skeptical about the fact that he really met God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a chance to play God, he starts to believe a little. I wonder why. Enter flagrant abuse of authority for personal gain and to insult enemies. <br /> <br /> Since this is Hollywood, Bruce, obviously, eventually comes up with, learns the lessons and begins to use his powers for the good of the world. In the end, he calls on God to take him, and prays that His will be done, not Bruce. <br /> <br /> Since this is Jim Carrey, the film is pretty funny, and there are definitely some very interesting moments about this. The film is not a perfect theology, but for Hollywood it is definitely a good attempt. Many of the statements in the film can be quite provocative and even provocative, and I applaud Tom Shadyak for his efforts in this film. <br /> <br /> So, although it’s not perfect, it’s definitely a funny movie about popcorn with a little thought behind it. <br /> <br /> Outcome: 3.5 out of 4 (worth seeing or two)
