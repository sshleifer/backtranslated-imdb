I got into Deathtrap in anticipation of a well-organized and intriguing thriller; and although this is something like this movie; I also can not help but think that this is just the poor person's Sleuth. The classic film of 1972 is undoubtedly the source of inspiration for this film; not particularly in terms of plot, but surely this is the case with the performance. The cast of Michael Kane in the lead role only confirms this. The film is based on a play by Ira Levin (who previously wrote Rosemary the Baby and Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sydney Bruhl; a playwright whose best days are over. After his latest gaming bombs, Sydney is low; and it did not help when a play called Deathtrap; written by an amateur whom he taught comes to his doorstep. Deathtrap - guaranteed commercial success, and Sydney soon begins to carry out his own plot; which includes inviting an amateur scribe, killing him, and then issuing the “death trap” for his own work. <br /> <br /> Despite all her tricky turns; Deathtrap falls on one main element, and these are characters. The film does not give the only pleasant character, and it is very difficult to take care of the story when you don’t support any of the players. It did not help the current one. Michael Caine demonstrates a good and interesting performance, as one would expect, but no one else is proud of himself. Christopher Reeve is clumsy in his role, while Dayan Cannon somehow manages to make the only possible pleasant character disgusting with a frankly annoying game. Fortunately, the story is good; and that's good enough to save the film. The plot has many turns; some of them work better than others, but always enough to keep the film interesting. Director Sidney Lumet also deserves praise, since the style of the film is another huge plus. The central location is interesting in itself, and the cinematography fits well with the film. In general, I have to admit that I liked this film; but it could have been much better.
