When Philo Vance (Edmund Lowe) stands unreliable on the edge of a balcony high above the city, clearly hypnotized and almost died, it immediately reminded me of an almost identical scene in another film nine years later. ‚Äù The Woman in Green, in which Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) is also about to rush into space, being hypnotized. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes survived these assassination attempts by unscrupulous criminals. Spectacular cinematic anticipation in both of these scenes. When will they know that you can't outshine the minds of great fictional detectives?
