I notice that the DVD version seems to contain missing scenes or lines between the FRF publication and the launch. <br /> <br /> They must prove that they can win the right to sit in the FRF, and not in the “green team”. <br /> <br /> Another scene, like during a simulation failure, Kevin gets Joaquin to calm down. <br /> <br /> I think that in the VHS release, except for ABC, there may be all the missing elements. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I like to know which DVD release contains the missing items. <br /> <br /> The DVD I watched seems edited for television.
