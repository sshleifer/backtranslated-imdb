The stars of this 1947 film were shot by director and screenwriter Orson Wells (with a strange Irish accent), as well as by gorgeous Rita Hayworth with less attractive short blond hair. So, I used to communicate with Orson in “Touch of Evil,” “Citizen Kane,” “The Third Man,” and so on. But this was my first contact with Rita Hayworth. Our first meeting went well, she copes well with the role of the frightened / dexterous Elsa, married to a disabled millionaire lawyer. Mike (Wells) and Elsa fall in love. He wants to escape with her, she does not know if she can live without things that can be bought for money. Elsa, her husband and his partner quarrel and bite, just like the sharks that Mike describes when attacking each other, and his prediction turns out to be too true. In this riddle, the killings take several turns as we approach the climax in a fun house. (Recall the final skirmish in The Man with the Golden Gun, which is borrowed from this scene). I wasn't sure who the killer was until the end. <br /> <br /> This film is similar to shrimp with garlic and lemon. The dish focuses on the sea, it is thin, sour and spicy, all with great effect. These may not be the best fresh shrimp, but quality frozen shrimp from Costco. The fragrant sauce adds naturalness to pink shrimps when you fill a healthy but filling alternative to a more ordinary, regular meal. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
