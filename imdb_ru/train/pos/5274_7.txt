Yes, I loved this movie when I was a kid. When I grew up, I saw this film so many times that my father had to buy another copy of VHS, because the old copy is worn out. <br /> <br /> My family received a copy of this VHS film when we bought a new VHS system. At first, my mother wasn't sure that this was the right film for a 10-year-old child, but since we just bought a new VHS system, she let me watch it. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film every little boy dreams ?? The film contains stunning scenery, big muscular barbarians, beautiful topless women, big bad monsters and jokes that you get only when you get older. So, a couple of days ago I inserted a video and watched the movie again after a long time. At first I was bored, then I began to think about how much I loved this film when I was a kid, and continued to watch. Yes, the experience was not as good as I remembered ?? The acting is pretty bad, the storyline is pretty bad, the jokes were no longer funny, but the women were still beautiful. Yes, I grew up. Despite the fact that the film experience has changed for me, I still think it is worth 7 stars. For the good old days you know ??
