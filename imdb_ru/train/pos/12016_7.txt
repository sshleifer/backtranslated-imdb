Good Western starred in the rocky wilds of Arizona. Lots of cool guys everywhere; Cobern's character seemed to be swinging back and forth between a raging psycho and a calm type. Several holes appeared in the picture, but they are not enough to compensate for their excitement and value for viewing. One really stupid scene shows that Heston empties .45 boxes of their powder and collects it in a bag for kindling fire. A. To collect so much gunpowder, he would need a mule to transport ammunition. B. The grass was obviously dry: why not just drop a match on it and let it burst?
