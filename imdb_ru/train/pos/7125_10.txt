Good night, Mr. Tom is so beautifully shot and beautifully implemented. It is not entirely true to the book, but should it be? No, absolutely not. John Thaw fascinates like Tom Oakley. His transformation from being rude to caring was so well implemented that it made him more believable than Scrooge in The Christmas Carol. After Inspector Morse, this is the best time to thaw. He was seriously picked up by young Nick Robinson, who gave a completely convincing image of an evacuated, injured abusive relationship with his mother. The script and the music were worth the purchase, and you also see how the thaw plays the organ. Amazing The most touching scene was that Willy found out about Zack's death, and then Tom told him about his late family, who died of scarlet fever. Buy it, you'll like it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
