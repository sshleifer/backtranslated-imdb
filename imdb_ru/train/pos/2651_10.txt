Like this. The film is better than the book. Don't get me wrong, I love the book. But the film is much better. In this film, Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duval are at their best. (I have never seen Skatman Kroters and, obviously, Danny Lloyd.) Some of the ideas used in this film are better than the ideas used in the book. But I have already spoken about this in my commentary on the mini-series. But I missed a few. The film was shot in a better place than a mini-series. And scenes REDRUM more terrible than in the book. So, if you're looking for a great movie, take Stanley Kubrick's The Shine. But count on nightmares every night for 3 weeks.
