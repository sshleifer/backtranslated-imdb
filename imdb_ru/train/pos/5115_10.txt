I have not seen this film in the theater. I admit, anti-Winnie Barbarino biased. Who the hell was John Travolta to film? I remember the Oscar broadcast that year when Travolta looked completely devastated when it did not win. How dare he, when in the run appeared "real" actors? Sorry, John, you should have won. Catching this movie on cable a few years ago, I fell in love with the whole movie. Bad, Sissy, Uncle Bob, Wes, everything is perfectly done. I also confess that I have never passed by this when I am surfing. I have to stop and look. Over the years I have learned how to conduct most of the dialogue, dance with my thumbs in my belt and learn to value Travolta more. The only thing that upset me was the omission in the soundtrack of the music from Urban Cowboy. “Looking for Love” defines the film, but Urban Cowboy was filled with classics that didn’t make it into the soundtrack. It was supposed to be a double CD ........
