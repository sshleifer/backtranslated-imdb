Have you ever wondered how far a movie can go? <br /> <br /> Schizophrenic tirelessly explores the world of extreme with Harry Rousseau. <br /> <br /> Harry is an aggravated writer, a scumbag killer and a drug addict who will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand between him and madness. Driven by the demonic voices of his fashion model, Harry begins his murderous fun. <br /> <br /> From the director Ron Atkins comes the first part of the most horrible story ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The only film like this one I saw is the second episode entitled Necromancy-Schizophrenic <br /> <br /> This is really a budget film that is not suitable for everyone, but if you are looking for that Anxious, unusual and terrible, it will be a good choice. <br /> <br /> DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING AS A MODERN HORROR OF THE DAY (for example, Scream) <br /> <br /> Recommended at the discretion of the viewer
