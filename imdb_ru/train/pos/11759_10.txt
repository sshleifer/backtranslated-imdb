The Best of Times is one of the best sleepers of all time. The installation does not burden your patience, development is steady, many interrelated relationships are established with love, gags and injections all work, and everything is ridiculous. There is a lot of sentimentality here. Kurt Russell, who plays Reno Hightower, puts on one of his best performances, and Robin Williams, who plays Jack Dundee, is more confident than ever. The cast also includes many great supporters. Jack's wife is played by the beautiful daughter of Jack Palance, as is Reno's wife, who is an excellent comedian. I can't tell you how many times I watched this film, how many times I liked it and how often I would like more people to see it.
