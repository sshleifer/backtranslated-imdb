I started watching the show from the first season, and at first I was quite skeptical about it. The original film was kinda childish, and I was just looking for some science fiction show waiting for the new BSG season. <br /> <br /> But after a few episodes I became a fan. I loved the heroes — not as stupid as you think he is Jack O'Neill, not only clever Samantha Carter, the glorious Teal'c, beloved women and children, and the brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Of course, stories are sometimes frivolous, sometimes even ridiculous, but basically it’s not about technology or space battles, but about helping your friend, even risking your life for it. It's about “we don't leave anyone behind.” Fight to the end, when all hope is lost. About free will and all the good qualities that make a person a man. <br /> <br /> And now he is breaking the record, going to the 10th season and still doing good.
