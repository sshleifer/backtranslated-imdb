To evaluate this film fairly, you need to think about the genre in which it should be: children. They had more recommendations to follow to make this film (that is, he could not do without humor and / or language from the 1st), taking everything that was in this film was fun and pleasant to watch. Sequels tend to make me nervous, but this one seemed pretty good to me. Knowing that he did not have Frazierâ€™s stellar power, like George, they benefited from humor, and I believe that Shawman did a good job with the role. The plot is easy to follow, and maybe at times it is suitable for a young audience, if you want to watch a movie and hope for Academy awards, this is not so, but if you want to watch a simple, fun, energetic movie with this.
