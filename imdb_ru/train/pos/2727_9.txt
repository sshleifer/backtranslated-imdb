One of the best films about the true crimes ever created and very faithful to the book of Truman Capote, who invented the genre of the novel about real crimes. Quincy Jones' ghostly musical score and the awesome play of Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry, the killers. Why Wilson did not become a big star after this film is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Black and white cinematography and editing in this film is top notch. Recreating the killings is frightening, and since it leaves the real killings to your imagination, it is even more scary than if they had shown how a shotgun fired. The film was shot in Clutterâ€™s own home, which was sold to another man after the murder. The film has a very documentary feeling - besides the scenes in the actual house of Clutter, other scenes were filmed at gas stations and in stores where the killers actually went. Nancy Clutter's favorite horse, baby, even in the movie. Will Gere has a great prosecutor in a short trial, which is not only filmed in the courtroom itself, but also has several real jurors for Klatter's murders, posing as jurors for the film. <br /> <br /> This is a good, scary movie every time you see it.
