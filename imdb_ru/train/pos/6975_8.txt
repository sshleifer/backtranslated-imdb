If I only saw the pilot of this show, I would rate him at 10 points. I was immediately fascinated by this magnificent new world. The subsequent episodes did not fully live up to the promise, but I will continue to observe and hope that it will get better and better. The production values ​​are incredible and the action is first class. I don’t mind that this is not entirely BSG compliant, because I’m so intrigued by the premise, and let's face it, these are two different shows. I am thrilled that both Esay Morales and one of my favorite musicians, Eric Stolz, have returned to my life (at least once a week) because I missed them both. This is a show that requires a little attention from the audience, and it is always good. You have to wrap your head around certain aspects of the show; things are not always what they seem, and, of course, there are shades of gray, both literally and figuratively, in storylines, characters and, of course, in various virtual worlds. We all know how this ends, but the journey looks like a trip.
