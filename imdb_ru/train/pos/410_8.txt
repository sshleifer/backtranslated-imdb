I made this film as a DVD without knowing anything about it, which was part of a winter marathon watching the movie every night. After several terrible American adventure action films (“Ballistic”, “Daredevil”, “The Cradle of Life”) “Zhu Warriors” seemed to me brilliantly original filmmaking. This story is complete nonsense, but I discovered that the sincerity of the film, its kindheartedness and the complete absence of irony are refreshing, and the film looks exciting. Of course, special effects are not as technically perfect as in Hollywood, but directors are wisely more interested in color, composition and movement than realism, and many of these shots are breathtaking. In one frame, two superhuman characters stand on the rocky spiers of rocks, in front of them rises a huge moon, the image is perfectly balanced by three elements. In the other - the princess-princess pierces the sky behind her glowing sword, like a rocket aspiring to heat. And colors explode from shot to shot, they are used to express emotions, not to represent reality. <br /> <br /> Characters have the same simplicity and directness as comic characters do not offer great depth on their own, but referring to archetypes. that resonate more deeply. Physically, some of the actors are amazingly beautiful. They play their roles directly, without irony and cunning, and therefore plausible. <br /> <br /> The strangest of all, despite the clumsiness of the plot and subtle characteristics, I found that at the end I was almost in tears, moving with the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original, kindhearted vision of the director. <br /> <br />
