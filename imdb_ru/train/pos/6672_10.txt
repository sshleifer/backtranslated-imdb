I saw Mystery Men holding a bit of pressure in the press and among the general public (for example, imdb vote), but overall I feel that Mystery Men are more fun than most movies, definitely wittier than most so-called comedy films and almost “smart” ones. <br /> <br /> The cast is great; Greg Kinnear is great, as is Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Kinner's limousine scene with Ricky Jay is the perfect “spoiled movie star,” and he endows his character with the right balance between the quality of comics and realism to make it work. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am a little upset, and the visual effects are certainly very explosive, perhaps at the expense of further characterization, but in the end, this is the creation of a high-level concept film - these are small moments "How are you, tiger lily?" - and in this film there are so many wonderful ones that it is worth watching it again.
