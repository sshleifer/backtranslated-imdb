I did not like the pretentious and overvalued Apocalypse now. Probably my favorite film about the Vietnam War - “The Deer Hunter”. The reindeer hunter focused on one part of the war, and then focused on life before the war. In fact, this is the film "Deer Hunter 2". The scenario is too free compared to the “Deer Hunter”. The plot never develops to such an extent that viewers can truly understand and feel the characters, as did the Dirhanter Hunter. Memories in Vietnam are not as exciting or involved as in Deer Hunter. That's why I can only give this film 7 out of 10. However, I think the acting was outstanding. De Niro and Harris are truly awesome actors. They fully immersed in their characters and expressed the strong pain of two former friends who lost their best friend Bobby in battle. Harris's character is a half-dead alcoholic who hides his guilt that Bobby loses his life trying to save him. <br /> <br /> I also like the cast. Everyone in the city is part of the movie. The city obviously does not do well with veterinarians in Vietnam. As in many small towns, it is about being quiet, modest and doing your own thing. The character of Harris, however, cannot be one of these things. I wonder how wars affect people. Some people quickly come to their senses, while others never get better.
