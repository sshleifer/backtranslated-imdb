After the cruel murder of their daughter Julie and Allen, they leave the city to find solace and mourn in a lonely hut on a distant mountain. Allen wants his wife out of depression by resuming photographing. Julie stumbles through an ancient prison and sees the ideal eerie, decaying conditions for her photograph. But when the photos are developed, they are full of dead people - and Allen quickly discovers the tragic history of suicide in their new grief. “Dark Remains” is a pretty decent indie horror movie. He offers some genuine fears and a lot of stress. The game is pretty good and the cinematography is great. 7 out of 10.
