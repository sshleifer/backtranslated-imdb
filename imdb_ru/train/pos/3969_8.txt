Someone noticed that James Earl Jones is a waiter who serves when Hagarti's wife shows that she is pregnant when they are in a restaurant near the lake. I watched this movie on a video that I recorded on TV. When I watched this scene, it seemed to me that I recognized Jones’s voice when the “waiter” laughed at the end. I rewound the tape, then slowly went through this part when the camera moved away and showed the waiter. Listen carefully as the waiter laughs when Hagarti looks up and tells him that they will have a child, then watch or slow down the scene carefully when the camera shows the waiter, albeit quickly.
