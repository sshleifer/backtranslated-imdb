A good film with — for its time — an intense, sprawling, rather dark story, somewhat reminiscent of John Ford's “Seekers”, though not so cruel. The story begins quickly and does not stop, with several scenes of a really good dialogue between (Stewart) Jeff Webster, Rhonda Castle and Sheriff Gannon. This film is in some ways reminiscent of the Bend of the River (1952), also the work of Mann-Stewart, but I found it much less sentimental and more interesting. There are a few caveats: a too quick completion (and rather sentimental) ending; 24-year-old Corrin Calvert is not very convincing as a naive French teenager, and, of course, the film takes place in the Mythical West, a fable country where the real laws of nations and physics do not work. But these are trivial problems. James Stewart is amazingly good as a dark, frustrated man who thinks that he cares about no one but himself, and mountain landscapes cannot be defeated. Beautiful western costume drama.
