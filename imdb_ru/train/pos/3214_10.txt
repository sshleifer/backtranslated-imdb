I fell in love with this silent drama. Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could play it so well. Raised from childhood to know nothing but war and war, Todd (Kurt Russell) is dumped onto the planet after genetically modified soldiers become obsolete. <br /> <br /> The scene is set, and another classic icon of militants was born - SOLDIER. Neither Rambo, nor Schwarzenegger, nor Bruce Willis, nor Mel Gibson, nor Jason Statham - Kurt Russell has this role, and he made it completely his own - original, bold and too human. I miss the fact that sequels have never been made. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> <br /> _________ <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com / ny5 / jbc33 /
