This movie is a great war movie. It may not be a great Hollywood movie, but it doesn’t matter. Hollywood has a reputation for sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment, but this is not the case with this film. Other reviewers have found this movie too slow for their taste, but ?? like a retired soldier ?? I appreciate the speed at which the film crew deliberately told its story as fully as possible, given the two hours and nine minutes. The story itself has been told and retold several times, but is this for a professional soldier ?? and what is an African American ?? report the story provided by the film crew and how it presents the US Navy to the world. The story of Brashear's work on becoming Navy Diver and his life as a Navy Diver after it is not the only story that is presented. There, I also talk about how the senior assistant senior officer on Sunday challenged the illegal order of his commander that the 2nd grade junior officer Brashear would not pass during the test dive, no matter how well he did it, and paid the price for losing one lane. and change of destination. He also told a true story of how Brachuhir discovered the third hydrogen bombs lost in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Spain in the 1950s, and how he saved another sailor’s life on the line of a running line that broke him twice Brashear did not push him out of the way and did not shoot himself. It was a difficult story to tell, and I admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story, and I can tell from the deleted DVD scenes that the team tried their best to tell the story as fully as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud that such a wonderful story was told in such a full form, and that the traditions and honor of the fleet should be preserved in such a natural and complete manner.
