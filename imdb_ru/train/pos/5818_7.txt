In fact, there are stupid moments in this film, both in the clay part and in the role of Joe Sands and children, and it is much worse than in other MJ films such as "The Wiz", "Captain Eo" and "Ghosts" . But as a fan of Michael Jackson since almost eleven years old (yes, guys, this is half my life!), I can't complain much about it. Just seeing this beautiful guy and hearing his wonderful music for me is a trip to paradise. But as a film, it’s not good at all, and I’m afraid that he would get a much lower grade for me if my favorite Mike wasn’t the main one in it. But since no one but Mike is a lunatic, he should get 7 out of 10 from me.
