I got on the “Douche” in the foreign films section of my local video store and missed it several times because it looked like a farce or comedy from the cover. Then I was lucky that I bought a copy at an economical price, and I am happy for my luck. A “shower” is a story about three (3) men, a father, and two (2) adult sons, each of whom comes to terms with life changes, as the world around them also continues to change in modern China. As in many “foreign” films, Chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting facets of this film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the exciting features of the local, Chinese flavor, giving the setting of this story, there is a difficult but touching relationship between men and the only woman involved in the story, all against the backdrop of the village bath. <br /> <br /> Family history is moving from alienation to understanding, and I'm glad I learned these people. Numerous small characters, bath clients, as well as their personal conflicts and friendships are added to the main story. “Shower” is a film that leaves a smile and is touched by its warmth and humanity.
