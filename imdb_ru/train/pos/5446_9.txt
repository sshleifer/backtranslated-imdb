National Lampoon's “Class Reunion” is a classic comedy film from the early 80s that combines unique characters, lots of laughter and great music by Chuck Berry. When Walter Baylor is completely humiliated by his classmates after high school, he takes the opportunity to avenge the reunion of the class. One by one, he pursues his classmates, including an innocent blind girl, a lustful fat man, a beauty from high school, a king of all preparations, and even an ugly old lunch lady who treated all the children in high school. There is a kind of scary element in this film, and there are several short scenes of sexuality in it, so I would not recommend it for young children, but this is a great movie for teenagers. If you're looking for a movie with a great score, complex characters, or suicidal special effects, you might not like Class Reunion. If you want to sit down for 90 minutes and laugh a little and have fun (and who aren’t), this film should be in your films to see its list. ++
