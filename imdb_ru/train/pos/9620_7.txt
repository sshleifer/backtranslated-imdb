There are so many “Hollywood” films that are not only torturing, but have nothing to do with anyone's life. Of course, films do not always have to have a deep meaning, but it's nice to know that there are still directors who take care to tell "human" stories. I will not give up the background of this brilliant film, however, the script is definitely one of the most complex and memorable that I have ever seen in my life, and I am also a 32-year-old movie lover! The Beetle is among the top ten on my list of favorites, which includes: On the Waterfront, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus, and these are just a few of them. This “touching” movie should also be one of your favorites - if you have a heart!
