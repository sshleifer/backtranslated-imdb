In the two other Jafar Panahi films that I saw, in “White Balloon” and “Crimson Gold,” the director obtains an amazing depth in objects that seem insignificant on the surface. Offside, Panahi’s tribute to Iranian women who are upholding their rights, I don’t think he is so successful. Of course, not what he says is not important (and it’s very bad that, like almost any other Panahi film, Iranians cannot see it). But after a while, the film feels a bit flat and it feels long, even for 90 minutes. Not to mention that I did not like it. The actors are all fantastic, and the celebration at the end of the film is infectious. But this is not an important job, in my opinion.
