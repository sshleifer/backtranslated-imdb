IN COLD BLOOD is a masterful director and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, he also strives to be realistic, sometimes he is more clinical than entertaining. Talking about the brutal murders of the family in the Midwest, the author Truman Capote focused on the little things, wrapping himself and the reader in the subject AND subjects! Brooks wildly moves away from such an approach in favor of something closer to dokudram. Although he shoots in real places, he keeps his distance. The killers are portrayed as depraved assholes, as they were. They are not regarded as misunderstood souls (as in the book of Capote), and the wildness of their actions is appallingly stupid. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are superb killers, as are supporting actors, including John Forsyth and Paul Stewart as a reporter (“Capote Character”?). Landmark photograph of the great Conrad Hall.
