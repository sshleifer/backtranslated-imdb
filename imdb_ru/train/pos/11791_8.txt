This is a very intriguing short film by David Lynch, and saying the name of David Lynch is probably enough for many people. This is your typical short lynch. Blonde and brunette in a dark room. The blonde is crying, the brunette is threateningly talking to the blonde, and that is all. <br /> <br /> With a lot of silent moments, but with the obsessive music of Angelo Badalamenti, there is a strange form of waiting. This short film sounds like “Dr. Mulholland”, a film that I loved, and so I also liked it. This is probably especially for Lynch fans, but there is a chance that you will like it.
