I have to admit - the only reason I bought this film was because I was a big fan of Gackt and * huge * Hyde fan. I was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that, let's say, were pleasing to the feminine look, but a bit silly. I mean that the synopsis sounded really there. And now, when I just finished watching it, I feel the need to tell the world about its magnificence! Hyde and Gack both gave heart-rending performances, and my eyes are still hot from crying, which lasted for the last half of the film. You are immersed in history, and you really feel for the heroes at the end. The element of vampirism - which I love, but which is very easy to overdo or spoil the film - is subtly mixed in the storyline to make it something just exotic, common for this situation, and not an accidental unnecessary addition to the story. First, I rated it at 9 out of 10, and then came back and tried to think why I did not give this last point. Nothing came up. So ten out of ten is true. In the end - I am not a big critic - the fact that I generally try to write a review means that I really hate the film or really love it. You can tell which side I'm on with Moon Child.
