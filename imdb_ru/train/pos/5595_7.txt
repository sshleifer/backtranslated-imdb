Polanski returns to the themes of loneliness and madness, which he explored with such a tremendous effect in “Repulsion” and “Rosemary Baby” in “The Tenant”. <br /> <br /> The Polanski trademark atmosphere is dark, thoughtful, unnerving - but there is something Awkward about this film, and I'm not sure if it is intentional. <br /> <br /> Sven Nyquist, who was responsible for some of the most beautiful films of Bergman, does not quite justify himself here. Since his name was one of those things that really attracted me to this film, I was a little disappointed at how few examples of truly impressive cinema were in the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really lets the film down is acting. Polanski, of course, is not a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten off more than Trelkovsky’s difficult role can survive. Some of the support staff are great, especially Melvin Douglas as the host and Shelly Winters as the concierge, but others are weak and wrong. It is also difficult to ignore the fact that all these supposed Parisians have American accents. <br /> <br /> Quite unexpectedly, beautiful moments of dark comedy appear in the film. Anyone who has seen Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is definitely a good comedian. However, there are times when he dangerously approaches a parody of himself. The sudden (and somewhat inexplicable) “transformation” of Trelkovsky is more likely to cause a giggle than his eyebrows, which distracts from what should have been a powerful moment in his psycho-dramatic journey. <br /> <br /> In general, the Tenant is a pleasant and intriguing experience, albeit too languid for its own benefit. There are some extremely frightening moments and a constantly uncomfortable and gloomy atmosphere, but this film, being very good, did not quite hit the target as successfully as it could. <br /> <br /> Alas, at the end of the day, the film “good” Polanski is still better than most other “good” films. Definitely worth a look, but don't expect to be torn down.
