This film is light, fun and beautifully shot. Lightning is absolutely gorgeous, and the colors convincingly resemble pictures of Vermeer. <br /> <br /> This is a sentimental comedy at its best, far surpassing American and French standards, and perhaps even better than English ones. <br /> <br /> Each character is touching, and the interpretation is close to perfection. Isabelle Blaise is gorgeous, Sylvie Moreau is better than in the Katherine series, Stefan Gagnon is charming, Emmanuel Bilodo is gorgeous in her strange role, and Genevieve Laroche is the perfect best friend! <br /> <br /> I could go on for a few hours before you find any negative commentary on this film, so give it a shot and add your own review.
