WHO GOT GOLD? (unfortunately) the last of the HANZO THE RAZOR films, in which the main role is played by Shintaro Katsu in the lead role - an experienced samurai officer, armed with a variety of weapons, with a “unique” technique of raping confessions from unwitting women informers as long as they do not spill the "beans" and ask for more ... <br /> <br /> This post starts with Hanzo "revealing" a woman who pretends to be a ghost to guard the lake, which is filled with bamboo trunks filled with gold, stolen from the treasury. This leads to the fact that Ha zo discovers a loan borrowing scheme and an orgy ring run by a blind monk. Then the necessary sword game and rape / interrogation begin — the final in a decent final for this strange movie trilogy. <br /> <br /> Not as strong and pleasant as THE SNARE (part 2 of the series ...), but still great for fans of samurai slime and Japanese pinky-style movies 8/10
