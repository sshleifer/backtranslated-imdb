Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time. I do not know how he does it. I read books all the time, but if there’s a movie with Will Smith, I’ll watch it. He has a rare gift to drag you into a movie and keep it there. This film is one of the best films I have ever seen. I watched it on Saturday, and still can't get it out of my head. Amazing and sad at the same time. Thanks again Will. You must watch this movie from start to finish to understand each part of the movie. You can not miss a thing. Make sure there is enough Kleenex and your man / woman near you so that you can hug. WELL worth the money you pay to watch it ... do not wait until it appears on television.
