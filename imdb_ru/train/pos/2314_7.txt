I heard good things about this movie and was, you guessed it, a little disappointed. Reese Witherspoon, as promised, is surprisingly good, surprisingly confident at a young age; in fact, all (small) actors are pretty solid in their simple American settings of the 50s. The reason I didn’t rate this movie above is mainly because by the end the elder sister’s grief didn’t look so real, and it pulled me out of the movie a bit. Perhaps we should fill the plot, or the film should be a little longer. I think the character Maureen is underdeveloped. It is clear that Dani (Reese W., the youngest) would have been traumatized and evil, but why was her sister more upset? Because she is several years older? Didn't the end undermine the rest of the movie? Because of the rhythm of the film, it seems that Maureen and Court just met when he received an interpretation (warning: this scene is surprisingly cruel, in retrospect it seems that she might have tried to shock a little. Well, it works!) depends on what you want - if you want a happy story of young love that you seem to get, a surprise awaits you. "Man on the Moon" at the same time and strange, and dreamy, and harsh film about coming of age ?? quite awkward combination? I liked the character of Cort, although I can see that the girls are watching who are watching this. And I liked that they had the courage to allow him to hurt his younger sister (most men would, most films not) and die. <br /> <br /> 7/10 on my rather sharp rating scale. For some reason I found Jason London on a tractor funny.
