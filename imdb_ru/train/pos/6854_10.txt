Intellectual, stylish and compelling thriller from the great Brian De Palma - this is a modern classic, which is firmly one of his best films! <br /> <br /> When a restless housewife is brutally murdered by a strange stranger, the victim's son joins a prostitute to uncover the murderer. <br /> <br /> Dressed in Kill left a strong impression on the audience of his time and for good reason. De Palma creates an amazingly dramatic story that begins with an intriguing environment and turns into a heartbreaking mystery full of strong expectations. The final and the conclusion are especially "nightmarish". This is really the edge of your place shocker. Even more impressive is the elegant direction of De Palma, which gives the film not only intense tension, but also a unique dark atmosphere. Dressed in Kill is also a very erotic film, but mostly in a strange way. Pinot Donaggio also gives an excellent musical score for the film. <br /> <br /> The cast is another strong feature of this film. Michael Cain makes a terrific turn as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is wonderful as an ill-fated housewife. Nancy Allen’s job as a street-street traveler is solid. Young Keith Gordon also turns out to be a worthy supporter as an investigative son. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize De Palma’s films for having Hitchcock elements, and this film is no exception. But any similarity between the work of Hitchcock and De Palmas can only be regarded as a good quality, since calling this film “robbery” would be humiliating to a good thriller. Dressed in Kill is a must for all movie fans. <br /> <br /> **** of ****
