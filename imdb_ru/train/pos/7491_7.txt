A few years ago, I found a copy of this movie "on the shelf" for a couple of dollars. In many ways, this is entirely appropriate, since when it was shot in 1933, it was a really cheap film from the studio of “poverty” Majestic. However, although the film is quite derivative, it is still worth seeing and giving a few surprises. <br /> <br /> The story is very, very familiar, because in some German city people are upset because of some recent deaths that seem like vampires! Add to this acquaintance Dwight Fry. He played Renfield in Dracula, and here he is very, very similar - although he plays a much more harmless pervert. In this case, he is obsessed with his favorite bats, and people start accusing him of death. The film copes well with providing some red herrings (that is, false leashes), and although Fry may not require a genius, he is not responsible, WHO and WHY intrigue and make VERY different from the average horror movie. In addition, although there was little money for filming to talk about her, she still had good actors of the day - Lionel Atville and Melvin Douglas - and she also used Universal Studios kits at night (when they finished shooting during the day) the film looks pretty good overall, although I also thought that, as usual, Fay Ray was terrible - I thought that this did not detract from the film. I saw her in more films than most people on IMDb, and I noticed that her characters do not have depth - she always looks like a “screaming lady” and gives little new in each film. <br /> <br /> In general, for fans of old horror films, this is excellent and worth seeing. For people who are NOT fans of the genre, this is probably pretty overlooked.
