An excellent series, masterfully played and directed, but unloved (as they say to me) by Mr. Dayton and recalled by him after one presentation. Currently, it can only be viewed in private collections, as well as through the British Film Institute on special request. Very regrettable, since the nuance of Ian Holm in the image of the tired but determined Bernard Samson is excellent; one of his best performances. The cast, including young Amanda Donoho and Hugh Fraser, is great. With Mel Martin, who plays a conflicting and treacherous wife, and Michael Degen as the mercurial Werner, history positively repeats the tragic and fatal personal consequences of the great game.
