Today, if someone mentions the name of Victor McLaglen, the answer is likely to be "Who?" or maybe "why?" Well, believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won an Oscar for best male role in this film, which tells about a poor, desperate man who is ready to sell his best friend for the "carriage" to the United States. This is an interesting film that shows how low even the best intentions go for a couple of bucks. The film takes place in Ireland, which is dominated by the British, and while all the other characters are directly or indirectly fighting for the political independence of Ireland, the main character of Mr. McLaglen is worried about getting money and getting drunk. This film makes one wonder whether the political activism of all these difficulties is worth it, because, although the activist is trying his best to prove his point of view, many others do not only care, they donâ€™t even know what it is about. The moral of this film is this: beware of a friend, he can sell you for a penny.
