In the early 1970s, many of us who sincerely adopted a hippie / acid / alternative culture realized that the mainstream society would not change as we thought. For me, this film determined the stress of "what now?" that many of the people I knew felt at that time. Are we going to the commune and creating our own vision of utopia, or do we radicalize and strive for change? <br /> <br /> From useless gestures to police, radical rhetoric, Pink Floyd music, to love and explosive images in the desert are so much there. It captures a good moment in time.
