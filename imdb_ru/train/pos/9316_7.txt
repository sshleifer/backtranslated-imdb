Walter Pijon is Braley Mason, a civil lawyer who opened a criminal case in the film “Unknown Man” of 1951, which also starred Anne Harding, Barry Sullivan, Kef Brazel and Richard Anderson. A great proponent of justice, Pijon takes a pro bono case, defending a young man, Rudy Walchek (Brazel), accused of murder, and justifies it. Soon after, he realizes that the man is guilty and extorted money to protect his victim, as well as other store owners in the district. He advised the district attorney (Sullivan) that Rudy is a small change, that in order to destroy organized crime, you need to find the main person. Mason finds the main person and faces a dilemma. <br /> <br /> “Unknown Man” is a small black and white film that attracts the viewer's attention with various plot twists, although the plot is somewhat contrived. This is really a story about a good man who seeks his god, justice and what he wants to do to achieve this. And this is the most contrived part of all. I guess there was a time before OJ, the Menendez brothers, etc. And so on. D., when people believed in the justice and honesty of the lawyers. In any case, for this viewer these days are long gone. <br /> <br /> Walter Pijon does an excellent job with his task - his beautiful, elegant manner of behavior and declamatory voice show us a successful, self-confident person, but deeply caring at the same time. Pijon had a great career spanning 60 years, but she never became a superstar. He was a solid actor who could play almost everything and did. This may be because by the time he got the lead, he was already over thirty, and he missed his morning idol; or maybe something was missing for him; or that it was printed early as the second leader to a big female star, like Greer Garson. Hard to say. Here he gives an honest and touching presentation. <br /> <br /> Very good movie with good features.
