I watched this movie by chance, I was curious about the trailer on TV. I like it when I open such films, small, tender stories about ordinary people. Even if the end is tragic, “Man on the Moon” has some funny moments, especially in the first characterization of Dani, with her innocent and pure love in court. This is a really beautiful, touching love story with three bright moments: the performance of Reese Witherspoon, who fulfilled her promises in the world of cinema, the wonderful cinematography of Freddie Francis's “Old Lion” and the fantastic account of James Newton Howard, which is really the soul of the film. His themes (which deserved an Oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyrical that they seem to have transformed the script into music.
