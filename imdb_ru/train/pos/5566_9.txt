This film is interesting to watch, there is little plot in it (well, there is no plot), but there are good jokes and situations you will laugh at. The main storyline says that Cheech is trying to have a nice date, while Chong is having fun with Cheech's cousin (they smoke drugs, go to the record store, massage room, comedy club, and even go to someone's house that do know!
