I saw a preview of Freebird on the Isle of Man TT, as I heard about it in a pair of motorcycle magazines. Although I no longer participated in the races, the temptation to see Phil Daniels in a motorcycle film (yes, I love the quad, like everyone else) was enough to distract me from beer and parties. Finally! we did it! we Brits actually made a great movie about a motorcycle (and no, it doesn't look like Torque), this is the best of British comedy. Remember my words, this is the best performance of Phil Daniels screen, and, as for Jeff Bell, there is a new British legend that makes his name clear. I really liked Gary Stretch in Shane Meadows' fantastic Dead Mans shoes, and here he gives a quiet, touching presentation that he can proudly add to his growing reputation as a film. This film is not only for us, bikers, but for everyone (even my girlfriend liked it very much). I hope that he will receive the same brilliant response on the mainland as on the Isle of Man. I will not go into the details of some of the classic scenes in this movie (be careful with the store), as this would spoil the fun, but I would say, go see, enjoy and get one of the best nights in the cinema you had some time. I really think this may well be a cult classic. As they said in TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
