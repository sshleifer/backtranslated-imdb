Critics are stupid. This movie is fun and smart. I really liked this movie. Why everyone hates this movie so much. I wish people loved this movie more than they did. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comedians, and they did a great job to make this film. I donâ€™t see you people making films like them. Therefore, people should just watch this and not comment. I like this film. Everything is fine through it all. There are parts where it gets stupid, but at least they did it. Jerry Stiller will like it, because in this film there is an action similar to the show King Of Queens. But it is better than that. I can not believe that it was rated so low.
