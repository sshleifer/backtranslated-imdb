A delightful film, shot by some of the best directors in the industry today. The film also involves the great actors of our time, not only from France, but everywhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes: <br /> <br /> 14th arrondissement: Carol (Margot Martindale) From Denver, she comes to Paris to learn French and to make sense of her life. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: there was probably no better way to start this film than with this episode in romantic Paris. <br /> Loin du 16ème: an image of Paris that we know best from the days of the unrest in Cite. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time caring for someone else's child (she is a nanny) than her own. <br /> <br /> Quartier Latin: It’s so fun to see Gerard Depardieu in the role of "tenancier de bar" with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara discussing their divorce. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: do not say that you do not like these memes! <br /> <br /> Tuileries: it is such a pleasure to see Steve Buscemi as a tourist who makes high contact (no, no) with a girl on the subway. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is great. Ludivine Sanya. <br /> <br /> I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004, and because of this film I want to come back! <br /> <br /> In Barcelona (another wonderful city), in Verdi, March 18, 2007. <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
