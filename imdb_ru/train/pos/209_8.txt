Walter Mattau and George Burns work so well together. The acidity of Willie with the perplexity of amnesic Ala is a mixture created in heaven. The scene when they meet again in Willyâ€™s apartment is a gem, and the final scene rounds the film down to perfection. Walter Mattau gives an excellent insight into the hot-tempered half-comic comedian as soon as he can, the intonation in his voice and exaggerated drama, combined with his general misunderstanding of what is happening, form a great characteristic. the film, his calm aplomb with deserted dry answers was remembered. Watch the scene near the end, when Al and his daughter ask something about the Spanish caretaker, and Al's reaction is priceless.
