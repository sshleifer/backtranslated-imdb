Contractions and brooms are a fun fantasy adventure for children, in which Angela Lansbury plays the role of a witch girl who, with the help of three evacuees and a "professor of witchcraft," breaks the Nazi invasion. <br /> <br /> Brilliantly inventive, with lots of laughter, this film will delight children of all ages for its great characters, exciting story and memorable melodies. Lansbury is beautiful, as Eglantine is not exactly the perfect witch who takes three children on an adventure of a lifetime, and her three young colleagues (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weigill) are equally impressive, as Cockney is a scoundrel who helps in fighting with a nasty gunn. <br /> <br /> The special effects are somewhat outdated, but let's face it, children don’t care much about these things while they are entertained. And they will be entertained. With some impressive scenes combining live action and animation brilliantly, and more authentic cinema magic than a hundred Harry Potters, it would have been difficult not to enjoy this wonderful piece of cinematic exclamation. In fact, only the rather protracted musical number, installed on Portobello Road, darkens the perfection of the film, but with so much pleasure that can be easily forgiven. <br /> <br /> And besides, any film showing the British television The Legend of Bruce Forsyte as a “flash” in Harry’s style is guaranteed from me.
