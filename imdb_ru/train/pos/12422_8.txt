With the mixed reviews I received, I did not expect too much, and was pleasantly surprised. This is a very interesting small crime movie with interesting characters, superb images, a composition that is fun and easy, and a good pace. It looks good, funky. Apparently people either love this film, or simply hate it, and I liked it.
