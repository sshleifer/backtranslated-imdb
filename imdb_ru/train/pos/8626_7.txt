"Der Todesking" - this is not exactly the movie that cheers you ?? The second iconic monument to Yerg Buttgereit in a row, which is actually much better than the notorious Necromantic, comes from seven short episodes. one for each day of the week ?? spinning on suicides of unrelated people. In between these already alarming episodes, the Buttgereyt inserts truly horrific images of a strongly decaying male corpse. The episodes are not all equally strong, but, as useful, “Der Todesking” occupies a rather high place in the list of the most depressive feature films of all time. In particular, the episodes on Wednesday, in which a man explains his sexual dysfunction to a complete stranger in the park, and the episode on Sunday, which tells about a young man sticking to death, are extremely intense and devastating for observation. The added value of this film, or any other similarly shocking, is controversial, and I'm not even sure if Buttgereit had any type of message to report here. There is a vague mention of a creepy chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide, but for the most part we remain unaware of the motivations of these people to end their lives so dramatically. Not at all like what I expected, “Der Todesking” is not exploitative or disgustingly graphic! On the contrary, in fact, I never could have hoped that the Buttgrate would be so subtle and thoughtful about the image of pure human suffering. Thursday's episode is a perfect example of this, as it stylishly shows the different points of view of the famous German bridge, while the names, ages and professions of the people who jumped off appear on the screen. Production values ​​are inevitably low, and editing often lacks professionalism, but this is not something that really matters in this type of movie. Is the topic strong and makes us think about less fun ?? but also irreplaceable ?? aspects of life. GREAT use of tragic music too!
