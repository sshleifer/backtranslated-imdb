When I reach the “back side” of 35 years of age, I find myself shaking my head more and more when I'm crazy about sex, teenagers who are affected by drugs today. as for teenagers today. This film is about the essence. If you're a fan of the late 70s, you'll love the movie. Movie from KISS-poster to the concert of Angel! <br /> <br /> Follow the young Laura Dern. Why didn't they have more Runaways songs that I would never know? <br /> <br /> I really had a problem with Randy Quaid's character desecrating a 16-year-old girl. While he is gone, she and her friends are having a party that destroys the dude's house. The cops come in and everything except the mention that the minors drink and how these children got their hands on these things. <br /> <br /> Foxes belong right here: Over the Edge, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused and Kids as one of the youngest teenagers of all time. <br /> <br /> I say: buy it, look with your children and tell about everything.
