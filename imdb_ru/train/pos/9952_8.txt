Before watching this movie, I thought this movie would be great as a Flashpoint, because prior to watching this movie, Flashpoint was the last movie of Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong that I had previously watched. As for sex scenes, I was disappointed, I thought Dreamquest sex scenes would be great, like Flashpoint sex scenes, but I was disappointed. With the exception of the sexy scene of Asia Carrera, any sex scene in this film does not make me feel great (you understand what I mean). The great Jenna Jameson does not do such sex scenes she is capable of. Felecia and Stephanie Swift, both of these cute girls disappoint me, as well as sexy scenes. <br /> <br /> Although this is an adult film, if you ignore this factor of sex scenes, this film is very good. As for typical adult film standards, this film has definitely raised the standard for adult films. The plot, acting, directing, scenery, makeup and other technical things in this film are really great. The actors of this film did a really good acting game, they all did an excellent job. Dreamquest has definitely raised the bar for quality films for adults.
