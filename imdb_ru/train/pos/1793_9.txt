I saw this movie on a Sunday afternoon. I really liked this movie. I loved everything about it, from the luscious moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where Mami Gammer (Leela) cries because of her bad decision to marry a man to her parents, and not because she really is in love. I liked these moments because they were so real. At first I was seriously scared, because I was hoping that it would not end like Bobby, who was a great actor, but a poorly written film without real meat. But in the middle of the film I felt completely different. You will laugh and cry, but in the end you will want to see the evening again. Believe me when I say "SEE IT!"
