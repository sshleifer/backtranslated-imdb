If you like fighting games, this is very good. Some of them are cheap, but it is worth fighting with robots. I enjoyed the battle-mech field for a while, and this is practically the only film I've ever seen that comes close to feeling what it is like to pilot one of these huge robots. If you like childbirth, then you like the Fur Warrior Three and Four games, and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 to save a steel battalion. The film is worth watching at least once. There really should be some more films on the same topic. Less remakes and more original artworks. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
