This young lady's name is Bonnie (Paulie). She is attractive, apparently living a fairly decent life, but suddenly suddenly escaped from her home and life as an Evil Dude and Various and Different Evil Servants. Now she has no idea what the hell is going on, only that a bunch of heavily armed people obviously want her dead ... and she will die without even knowing why. <br /> <br /> God, I hear whining all the time. Now that the content is so cheap to produce, and people can create their own movies / books / comics / internal organs, there will be no one to guarantee that there is a quality standard! We will sink in shit! The only people who actually think that these are people who have not watched a single movie or read any books lately - because we are already making a dead man's float in shit. These are people like Ferrari and Rodriguez, who lie to these ignorant people, throwing 8 thousand dollars on the table and making ... well, I would say that this is a better fighter than everything you saw in theaters this year. But you have not seen any action movies in the movie this year. I saw the cashier. You stay in droves. You'd better have caught this copy, spent twenty minutes on entertainment and continued your life. <br /> <br /> This is just fun. You enter, like Bonnie, with a lot of questions, and where it all ends, it's foggy. All vanity was made earlier in several ways, but not in such a short time and not without such a concentrated, tasty shootout. You are there for atmosphere, mystery and weapons. That's all - that's all the directors promise, and they deliver. <br /> <br /> Heats the black pits of my heart to think that it was done on such a budget. A lot of indie films are being missed here, but rarely do we see anything as sharp as this short film, and we have never seen a single action movie shot in the genre that would look so good. Hell, you could give these two guys MI: 3, and that might draw me to it. Bond franchise. Damn, whatever. No, actually, even better: I would like these guys to make a feature on their own and stay away from Hollywood. Whatever the case, the killing film industry is undoubtedly infectious. <br /> <br /> The best indie game we have ever seen, and the most effective indie business card we have ever seen. The DVD is 20 dollars and has bonus features from the ass. Take your movie ticket budget and attach it to it.
