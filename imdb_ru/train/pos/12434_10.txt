For the first film in the proposed series, he achieves the right balance. This is done with style and class, showing the early days of Modesty as a refugee and the beginning of her coming to power in the criminal world. I think this is a very honest / true image of her character exactly as the writer Peter O'Donnell intended. Alexandra Staden as Modesty is stunningly beautiful and is an excellent choice. She acts very convincingly, like a tough survivor with a cool / smart / innocent appearance. And Tarantinoâ€™s full rating for choosing an unknown actress for a role is much more likely to have a new face creating a role. I look forward to the next movie.
