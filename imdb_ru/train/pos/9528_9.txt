To be honest, this film has captured most of its detractors. <br /> <br /> The opposite of death (salvation) is salvation (salvation), and this film is one of the few that comes across. two concepts. The film also explores the love and frustrations that accompany the relationship between father and son. From the outset, it should be noted that none of these topics is currently fashionable. <br /> <br /> It is assumed that fathers are on the move, killer Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman), love your sons and do everything to protect them. But Rooney's son Connor is even more evil than the rest. He kills one of Rooney’s loyal soldiers to hide his theft from his father. When Connor learns that Sullivan’s son Michael witnessed this, he mistakenly kills another Sullivan’s son (and Sullivan’s wife), trying to silence the witnesses. <br /> <br /> Sullivan decides that he wants revenge at any cost, even at the terribly high cost of doom. Rooney, who in one scene curses Connor's birthday, refuses to give his son Connor Sullivan and hires an assassin named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So, Rooney joins his son Connor on the Path to destruction. <br /> <br /> In the rest of the film, accompanied by his surviving son, young Michael, Sullivan pursues Connor Rooney on the road to death, and Maguire pursues Sullivan. When Sullivan confronts Rooney in the basement of the church and demands that he leave Connor because Connor killed his family, Rooney says: "Michael, there are only killers in this room, and there is only one guarantee, none of us will see" Heaven. " When the film ends, somewhat predictably, one character is saved, and the other repents. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Tom Hanks, but he really fails to convincingly play the assassin Sullivan, gives a subtle and concise execution. Newman succeeds like the old Irish gangster Rooney, showing a sharp expression on his face and manners, his eyes follow the atrocities of Connor. Jude Law plays Maguire in a creepy way. Tyler Hoechlin plays young Michael naturally and without affects. <br /> <br /> Cinematography constantly shines light from darkness, repeating the themes of salvation and destruction. The camera is drawn from a palette of green and gray shades. The grays belonged to the fathers and city landscapes of the Illinois depression. Greenery belonged to the younger sons and rural plains of this state. Thomas Newman's lush, resounding and obsessive music had a faint Irish tone and was performed in arrangements similar to Copland. The sets were genuine mid-western urban - factories, churches. The houses shone with brilliant woodwork. <br /> <br /> The film’s superiority lies in the fact that it creates unique sensations from deep themes, distinctive play and exciting music and cinematography. The only drawback was a small anti-missile message that slipped in script y, the film just nodded political correctness. <br /> <br /> I give this film a10 out of 10; over time, this will be recognized as a great movie.
