This is so exciting! After I watched La Roue with this short, carefree little movie, I think it's a real pleasure! This is absolutely amazing and one of the most charming pictures I have seen this year. This is more surprising since it is an early talker who disgraces some of the great pictures of the 30s thanks to the innovative use of sound in movies. It is just filled with music and a delightful mood that is really optimistic and, in the end, it made me happy! Obviously, it would not be so difficult to get a lottery ticket that the presenter was looking for, but the pace is so exciting, and the film is so spectacularly interesting that I didnâ€™t even remember about it twice. The comedy is a lot of fun, and I think it even surpasses The Marx Brothers, possibly the greatest comedic force of the time. This is pretty perfect.
