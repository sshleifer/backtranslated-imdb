This is one of the greatest films of the 80s !!! It sticks out like a "poop in a punch" !! I can't believe Mad Magazine condemned it or something else. And yet, they proudly put their name on the show with "Stuart", "Chinese lady" I speak without any words "" and "The guy from UPS at speed." What's up with that? And I love Ron Leibman - he is cunning! I wonder why his name was removed from the credits? It was his funniest role I know. Of course, he is not as foxish as in Norma Rei. But, in my opinion, this film is right there, with the release of the National Lampun. If you liked movies like Porky, Fast Times, The Last American Virgin, or any other teen-oriented 80s movie, you will love this movie !! Rent it and you will understand what I mean!
