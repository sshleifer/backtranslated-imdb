I must say that I have long wanted to see this movie and was not disappointed. Dominic Monaghan's game is fantastic. As insomnia, I can tell you how the story develops. I have never experienced anything like it, but some waking moments overlap the dream, and it can be scary. It was a great movie that cost every penny. I hope that someday I will be able to work with Tess myself, it will be an honor outside of it. I can recommend this to everyone. Maybe not small children, as they may get scared. But if you are such a sleepless person like me, you will understand the world, secrets and fear. You will like it. <br /> <br /> F.
