This is one of those films that tells about the clash of people born in the east, in Western cultures. <br /> <br /> “Love for Tokyo time” is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to serious cultural differences. Ken, a rock'n'roll fanatic, marries Kyoto, a Japanese woman, so she can stay in the United States when her visa expires. It is expected that the marriage will only be temporary, that is, until Kyoto again receives legal status. But Ken, who seems to be lost in every way, loves Kyoto and tries hard to make it work. This, despite his friend’s conviction, that throwing Kyoto and getting rid of all obligations to girls is bad for rock and roll, except that it inspires writing songs about broken hearts and all that. <br /> <br /> But Kyoto comes from a strict traditional Japanese upbringing, and does not expect to be married to Ken all this time. Moreover, she misses home and wants to return to Japan. Sadly, it's finally someone Ken thinks that he can love and be with him and all that, except for one time, when he thinks he has found someone who has such feelings, a girl doesn’t expects to stay that long. Not that she didn't like Ken, she just got used to a completely different way of life. She says, "I can't tell him how I feel in English, and Ken can't tell me how he feels in Japanese." It's a pretty sad love story with a techno-nintendo soundtrack from the killer 80s <br /> <br /> I chose Loving on Tokyo Time because he reminded me of one of my favorite 80s films, Tokyo Pop. And for those of you who loved Loving on Tokyo Time, take a look at Tokyo Pop (the New York singer goes to Japan and joins a Japanese-American cover band), except for the fact that this is a film with a happy ending. <br /> <br />
