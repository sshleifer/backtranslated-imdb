Good. Yes, it was a very tough budget film with continuity errors (for example, individual scenes taken, obviously, in the sun, then in the shade and then mixed together), and as far as I love Nick Mancuso, he was often too good at the burn part, and some of the background support rolls were really bad (plus at least one actor was used for two different, but noticeable roles). But come on. Richard Greco was hysterical (his hair alone was worth it). Stephen Ford was very nice. Mancuso had excellent features, while Nancy Allen, ironically, was completely bland and uninteresting. Classical? Bad parts? Yes. Entertaining? Big yes. I would really like to be on the set that day when they decided what kind of hairstyle Griko would have. "Are you fast?" ... "Not so fast".
