First of all, I would like to make a correction to another review of this film, which said that the last musical that won the Best Picture Academy Award was Gigi in 1958. This is misinformation, since West Side Story won in 1962, My Fair Lady won in 1965, and Sound of Music a year later. However, this movie is absolutely fantastic! The story from the novel has been slightly modified, but this is more because of the limitations that they had on the scene, which they simply did not change back for the removed version. However, I do not mind. Actually, I rather think that all production flows better than a novel. I like the fact that Nancy leads Oliver to the bridge with her and kills there, and not later in the apartment. The subtle things in this movie make me laugh. I like it when Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble start leaving the governor’s office. Underline at the time brilliantly. My three favorite actors in this film were Jack Wilde, who plays the best Dodger in any version of the film, Ron Moody, playful and humorous Fagin (this character worked much better than he is in the book), and Shani Wallis, who is the strongest, the most upset version of Nancy. The only reason I give this film 9 instead of 10 is because there are two big production numbers: “Compete myself” and “Who will buy”. I always hate when choreography in musicals implies that people are like people involved in daily activities and work. It looks awful and obscene, especially when they dance in the London meat company. They should have just done the usual choreography for these scenes. However, this film is a rare treasure that will remain with us, I hope, forever.
