Great show. Instead of watching the same old shows like the comedy series, where it’s the same old thing, just different “stars”, this refreshing show provided an incredibly interesting kind of office situations. For two years we have not watched a single TV, and after returning from all the available shows, we look forward to the opportunity to watch this show on W. Shame Global for turning it off. I thought it would be a winner. Let's be realistic, SEVERAL Canadian SHOWs do it. Everyone I talk to enjoys this show, and I think it was stupid when Global left. I guess they want to promote it with the typical mind-numbing views from the States instead of pulling out behind the Canadian-made show, which had a lot of promise. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy many shows on TV, but, let's go people, let's keep a variety. This unique show gave a very comedic idea of ​​a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships with unique characters that you don’t see in any sitcom, either today or in the past. It is a pity that the global had to say no to this, a silly mistake.
