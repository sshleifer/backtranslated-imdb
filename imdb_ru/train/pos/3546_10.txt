One of the best musicals ever created is an example of how producers and directors were not afraid to choose actors for their talent, and not for what people can expect. The lighting and decorations are unique, which gives it a very interesting effect (it has a special name that I canâ€™t think of) Dialogue is also unique in that it does not use abbreviations. The film is dynamic, beautifully played and interesting from start to finish. Real joy is MUSIC. Such an array of first-class songs, from beginning to end, which are beautifully performed and organized. In addition, the music is very original and memorable, and I think it surpasses many musicals from the thirties to the sixties. He certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, which can only be two or three. Not bad for a director without experience in this type of film. Another quality is that it is fresh every time it is seen.
