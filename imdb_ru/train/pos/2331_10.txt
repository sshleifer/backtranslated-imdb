At first I was exhausted by the fact that the main character of the TV show could bring the dead back to life, but then I thought that I could do it. Guess what? I love "Pushing Daisies" and am looking forward to Wednesday night, just to watch it, then next week I watch it a few more times on my DVR. Colorful characters, witty banter, impetuous dialogue and new unique situations attract me and fascinate from beginning to end. The relationship between Ned and Chuck Charles is interesting to see how they work on the fact that they cannot have physical contact. Even the character of Detective Emerson Coda continued to grow in difficulty. And Olive Snook! Jimmy Crispy! She pissed me off! The voice of the narrator is interesting to listen to, and the cinematography makes me feel that I am watching a movie, and not a TV show. I recommended to my family and friends to turn on “Pushing Daisies”, and they also hooked !!! The show is worth waiting a week for a new episode, and if you haven’t yet seen “P.D.”, I highly recommend watching it!
