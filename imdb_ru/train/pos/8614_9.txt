I was interested in the film, mainly because Diane Keaton is my favorite actress. I disagree with some other posts on the grounds that the plot was not convoluted. I had no problems with this (maybe some people had too many eggnogs last night). The film was very sad and touching. What else do you want? Alexa Davalos is a wonderful new talent (also beautiful), and Tom Everett Scott is doing an excellent job with his role. The relationship between mother and daughter may have been a bit unreal, but the behavior of young people in the film was not. It was tragically sad, but instructive. This, of course, beat the other shows that were on TV on New Year's Eve
