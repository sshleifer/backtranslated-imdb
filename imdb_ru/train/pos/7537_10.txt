Despite the fact that those who hate Christianity, 700 Club provides real answers and inspiration. It also provides reliable news, logical comments and a presentation that is different from what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS consider to be the best. Unlike other programs that provide comments on social and religious issues, those who are behind Club 700, provide assistance to the needy, for example, feed the hungry with the help of Operation Blessing, provide medical care to those who live in impoverished communities, and give hope to those who need hope. This is not at all hateful. If 700 Club offends you, I advise you to get the remote and turn on the channel on your TV. I do the same when I find news from CNN Headline News or, for that matter, programs that I find biased or offensive. What I find offensive is that the ABC family inserts a disclaimer for the fact that the views of the Club 700 do not reflect the views of the ABC family.
