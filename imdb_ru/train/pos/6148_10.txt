In the love memory of David Tomlinson (1917-2000) <br /> <br /> When I first watched this film, I was 4 years old, and I was fascinated by this story about witches in World War II. The scene that impressed me most was the struggle between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was amazing to see this army without a walk through the body in order to fight the amazed singing of their march. This film is fantastic, from a trip to Portobello Road (which has become for me the most fantastic place in London) to a trip to Naboubou. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are truly a fantastic couple. She is always gorgeous, seems to be a good aunt in the family, and David, with his always surprised face, is her great main character. we will miss him.
