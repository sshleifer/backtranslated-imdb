Every film critic and metal head hated this film, but I enjoyed it. I saw it as a child on TV somewhere, and was amazed at the scene when Sammy went on stage and played "Joke or Treat" on Fistwey. <br /> <br /> The film itself was typical of the 80s, the guy is being pushed by bullies and enlists supernatural help to beat the bullies, but heâ€™s gone far and must be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Matt from Melrose Place selects Skippy from Family Ties, so Skippy gets Tony Fields record from Gene Simmons to console him and all the breaks of hell lose, the main point is where Tony sings (lip sync) and dancing to a metal song before shyt hits a fan. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of mistakes and material, but the music and everything was enough for my fists to pump 8 of 10
