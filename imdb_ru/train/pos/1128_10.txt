Although the recent retelling of a part of Homer's epic “Troy” with Brad Pitt was once interesting, “Iphigenia” with its glowing Irene Pappas is breathtaking. Deploying in a natural setting with Greek actors speaking their native language gives this authenticity. The accidental encounter with this film in one of the many movie channels of DirecTV interested me, despite my problems with concentration. In this film there is neither brilliance, nor "trinkets", just a fabulously rich story, impeccably told by the actors, so real that they feel that they are listening to the real family in disarray. I think that even Homer, if he really existed, would have been proud of this story. <br /> <br /> jlh
