One can only hope that in many cases such a powerful person as Morgan Freeman can take the time to help someone who needs help. <br /> <br /> It all comes down to loving people. As Will Rogers said: "I have never met a man who didnâ€™t like me." Of course, if you meet Paz Vega, what will you dislike? Her smile can melt diamonds. She is so fantastic that I can watch everything in her. The same goes for Freeman. he is just a wizard on screen. <br /> <br /> They gave us a funny movie from start to finish. From the Mexican supermarket to Lorraine and Bobby to Pakki. It was gentle, charming and just funny. <br /> <br /> You should check this out.
