In this movie, Wild Bill Hicock, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer are all together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill, and Gene Arthur plays Calamity Jane, and Charles Bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the Indians, and you hardly recognize him. This was the first time Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together, and the next film was basically the same, but set at a different time. This film begins with the assassination of Lincoln, as well as the war in India. Disaster Jane is in love with Wild Bill, and Buffalo Bill is married and now wants to stay at home. This film also deals with the last position of Custer and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good, as usual, and I usually don't like Gene Arthur, but I liked her here.
