If scientists behaved as H.G. Wells in the future, the story would not have turned out as in the upcoming events. Almost 80 years have passed since Wells wrote The Shape of the Future, on which this film is based, and no closer to the world he describes, than before, in some respects. <br /> <br /> Although Well-known players like Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson and Cedric Hardwick are so good actors, they are more caricatures than real characters. This is the main weakness of the film, it is devoted to the philosophy of science Wells, which will solve all the problems, and the rest of us - backward fools. <br /> <br /> The Massey characters, two generations of the same family, adhere to this extremely optimistic view. , Cedric Hardwick is a skeptic who feels that a person rushes too far forward. And Ralph Richardson is a warlord who emerged from the destruction of yet another Thirty Years War, in which they fought with the use of modern weapons. By the way, since the atomic bomb was not invented, poisonous gas was considered a weapon that almost destroys humanity. <br /> <br /> According to Wells, science and conquest can never mix. Scientists as a group are too much over the world of politics to deal with such things. During the lives of Wells, scientists undoubtedly fled from the right-wing fascist governments of Hitler and Mussolini. However, the very same people, in order to defeat them, submitted to the allies and created the atomic weapon that opened modernity. If they behaved the way Wells would have liked, a man like Albert Einstein would head a junta of scientists who would establish a new order after World War II. <br /> <br /> Wells was wrong both in time and in development. He obviously never imagined a computer and atomic energy. Programmers are much more likely to become our rulers in a brave new world than scientists at the moment. The “upcoming business,” under the leadership of William Cameron Menzies and the scenery created, provides an opportunity to look into the mind of H.G. Wells is undoubtedly a respected thinker of his time, although he did not quite understand the form of “Upcoming Things”.
