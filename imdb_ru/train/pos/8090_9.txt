When a little hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherited a magic ring from his uncle, the wizard Gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil dark lord. If the ring is in his hands, he will regain his strength and destroy Middle Earth. Frodo and his loyal friends go in search of destroying the ring with a group of warriors. This is an underrated adaptation of the classic novels, since it covers only the first half of the story. Despite this, it is an epic and surprisingly animated film. <br /> <br /> Animation is superbly done using a rotoscope, which tracks footage from live action movies. Ralph Bakshi worked well with the low budget he was given. The film also boasts magnificent music by Leonard Rosenman, which is suitable for any scene. In the script there are several holes in the plot, but this should be justified, given that the initial transaction was to turn the trilogy into a book in two films, many of which had to be squeezed into the first. What worries me most about character design is that Samway was too stupid, and the rest of the hobbits are completely normal. The other characters are actually well written for the screen, and the actors sound great work, I was glad that Legolas is actually a bit more useful for the plot. Rotoscope orcs are more comical than frightening, and ring ghosts are creepy and nightmarish. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that the evil wizard Saruman is called Aruman, thanks to the authors. In general, I think a little more money and better writers would make it more justice, but there is something fascinating about it. Ralph Bakshi valiantly tried to adapt the screen of these classic stories. The film suffers terribly from the fact that it is overshadowed by live action films, but it is still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages.
