What happened in 1939 that helped create so many great Hollywood movies? Well, whatever it is, magic can also be found in this picture of Colombia. This is a long-forgotten comic comedy that Turner Classic Movies began to show. (The book of Multin’s films does not contain it.) In almost every department, “The Amazing Mr. Williams” is a gem. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a first-class police detective who never found the time to marry intended. As the wedding bells are about to ring, he is called to the scene of the murder. The woman in question must learn how to not only enjoy the pursuit of criminals, but also to belong to the police. In this process a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> Melvin Douglas again proved that he had several peers in a light comedy. Joan Blondel was at the peak of her career and delighted. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are funny. <br /> <br /> The film has been going on for too long, but who cares? Worm comedies are always able to entertain, and this film is right here with the best.
