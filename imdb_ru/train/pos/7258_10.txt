I was lucky to recently get a copy of this movie on DVD, and now I watch it a second time. The first time was on a late night channel in Australia more than 20 years ago, but I could never forget this strange and dark movie. <br /> <br /> Few people love this film at all, because it’s so unconventional — the fact that there’s almost no conversational dialogue in this movement — we just hear the thoughts of the characters — is just one unconventional aspect of it. <br /> <br /> In search of a copy of this film, I learned that the producer was dead, the main actor was dead, he was not stored in any British television or film archive, he was never published on video or DVD, and television networks Worldwide defeated him after their copyright expired in the 80s. When it was first shown on television in Australia, there were no recordable devices for consumers. <br /> <br /> At the second viewing I recently understood why it was unforgettable. Sometimes it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic, very much like the play of Harold Pinter. <br /> <br /> Again, if someone wants to get a copy of this on DVD, please email me, and I'm sure we can come up with something.
