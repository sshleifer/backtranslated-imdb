I first saw this movie when it originally came out. I was about 9 years old. This film was very interesting and very frightening, unlike any other film that I had seen before that time. <br /> <br /> MAIN PLOT: The expedition leaves Earth on the fourth planet of Altair, a large star in the main sequence in the constellation Aquila, to find out what happened to the colony of settlers who landed twenty years ago and have not heard about . <br /> <br /> SUBJECT: Lower civilization (namely ours) comes into contact with the remnants of a very advanced alien civilization, Krell-200 000 years removed. The "seed" of destruction from one civilization is transmitted to another, first unknowingly. The theme of this film is very good against evil. <br /> <br /> I first saw this film with my brother when it came out. I was just a boy, and the scenes with tigers really scared me, like the scenes of battles with the invisible Power of Creatures. I was also amazed at how real things look in the film. <br /> <br /> What really draws my attention when I'm an adult is the truth of the movie “Forbidden Knowledge” and how appropriate it will be when we do it. (if ever) come into contact with a developed (alien) civilization, much more developed than we currently are. Advanced technology and responsibility seem to go hand in hand. We must do the work for ourselves in order to acquire knowledge along with the wisdom of how to use advanced technology. This, in my opinion, is the great moral of the film. <br /> <br /> I found out in graduate school that “knowledge is power” is, at best, really not right! Knowledge is a “potential” force, depending on how it is applied (... if it applies at all). [This is not what you know, but how you use what you know!] <br /> <br /> The overall impact of this film may well be realized sometime in humanity’s own future. That is, knowledge itself is not enough, we MUST, have wisdom, on which knowledge depends, to truly control our own destiny OR we will find ourselves in the film Krell in the film - just winked. <br /> Many thanks to those who responded to earlier versions of this article with comments and corrections, they are all greatly appreciated !! I hope that this story will enthrall you as much as I have in the last 40-odd years .... <br /> <br /> Rating: 10 out of 10 stars
