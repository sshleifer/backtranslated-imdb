Women have never looked as attractive and pathetic as in the Piedras Salazar film. Although the editor can help the film here and there, it is fascinating and enjoyable with an intensive evaluation of the latest films by Pedro Almodovar. 5 different women deal with their male partners and families. Starting with several different stories that are sure to meet along the plot, Salazar portrays his female characters in the same neurotic and borderline behavior as Almodovar. A lady from high society with kleptomania, with thick to small shoes, a seething housewife, taking care of her disabled daughter, a dancer-addict obsessed with her ex-boyfriend, and a taxi driver who looks after her late husbandâ€™s worried children, they all roam the streets of Madrid in good thoughtful scenes. Using some familiar actresses of Almodovar, the director succeeds in his first film to give depth to all the characters sharing the film, and to cause sincere sympathy for each of them. Women control the storyline, and men will definitely stay with each other, in the end ... Amazingly good for the first film and worth the time in any standard. It is noteworthy that Salazar hesitated in some necessary instructions for actresses, but the screen still shows an impressive act, especially Monica Server, who played in her former short film. <br /> <br /> Required for all Fans of Almodovar and pleasant to all.
