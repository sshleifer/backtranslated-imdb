A 14-year-old girl has her first serious love for a 17-year-old boy who lives nearby, while at the same time trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy compared to her older sister. This is a simple premise of this beautiful, poetic film about coming of age from director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is known for having previously led Summer 42 in 1971 and To Kill a Mockingbird in 1962, two giants of the adult genre. Here he directs newcomers starring: Reese Witherspoon, in her film debut, as a 14-year-old girl; Emily Warfield, like a big sister; Jason London, like a court, is a 17 year old boy. Reese Witherspoon is amazingly good in her film debut, showing all the emotions that a 14-year-old girl feels, experiencing young love and pain, never paying attention to the false note. Warfield and London are equally good. The film accurately reflects the thoughts and feelings of each teenager in relation to love with a sense of sincerity, never turning into an excess of Maudlin even once. Glory to the autobiographical scenario from Jenny Wingfield; This is one of the few films about young love, honest and consistent, but not emotionally dishonest or sensational. The music is surprisingly simple, emphasizing the tone and mood from stage to stage, but never becomes intrusive. Beautiful cinematography - the famous horror director Freddie Francis, who was over seventy when he was filmed. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston in 1957 play the parents of girls with ruthless precision, caring, strict and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is also good as a boyâ€™s mother. There are feelings that need to be sorted out, lessons to be learned, and truths to be encountered in this good-natured film, which is filled with an emotional wave. Today it is the last film of Robert Mulligan. This is one of the best films of 1991. **** 4 stars.
