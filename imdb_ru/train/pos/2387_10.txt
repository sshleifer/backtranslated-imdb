I have a six-month-old baby at home, and from time to time she sleeps very poorly. One morning, it was especially difficult for her to fall asleep when a song-theme with scribble-beans arrived on TV. She almost instantly stopped crying, and the rest of the show was pleased. I sat her down on the bouncy seat and watched her kick her legs, swing her arms and actually laugh at this show. All the while she was entertained and delighted. I also got their videos, so sometimes, when my baby is worried, I have something to calm her down. Of course, late at night, if she wakes up with colic to fuss, scribbles are not her cup of tea, but they will certainly come in handy when I need a little time to do the housework, etc. The biggest surprise for doodle beans is that my child doesnâ€™t even like to watch TV She would prefer to play sex with a toy or with our little toy poodle than watch TV, but the scrawl beans fully captured her attention. I don't know if she will like them in the future, but for now she is tied.
