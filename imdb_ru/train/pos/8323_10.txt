"The wisest people cherish a little bit of nonsense from time to time." <br /> <br /> If you are too smart to watch this movie, then you are too smart to live. <br /> <br /> Wonderful bustle, a beautiful background, an old piece made with keen attention to detail <br /> <br /> Walter Mattau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins and others - just great! <br /> <br /> Rent, sit, relax, accept, smile a little. Enjoy it <br /> <br /> Then, thank you.
