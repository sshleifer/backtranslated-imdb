For all my 60 years, I learned that when we watch a movie, we have an identification (whether we like it or not), implicit with a certain character. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, because the character performs a certain gesture, sometimes because the character speaks a certain word or sentence ?? what do we use or what would we like to use ?? in a certain situation. <br /> <br /> The film in question should be viewed from this point of view. Who will find a parking space now ?? in a mall, in the city center or on the street - by car, whose driver cannot remember that he is not the only driver in the world? <br /> <br /> Who has no desire to “wear out” a badly-raised quarrel? <br /> <br /> Haven said that I was asking: - Have you identified yourself with DELLA (played by Kim Bassinger)? answer: YES!, then try not to find absurd details compared to the reality of life in the film, because you will surely find the film ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Made abstractions, you will see that there are moments of surprise in the film , such as: 1- In the sequence in which Della grabs a box of tools in the chest (does he have a gun in this box, and does he have enough with If you have already seen the movie or plan to watch it, keep in mind that there are “realistic” films, “fantastic” films, “political” films and films in which you can “wash the soul” ?? To illustrate the latter, we can quote: "Tropa de Elite". <br /> <br /> According to the newspaper, the applause was unanimous when BOPE officials took certain positions. (Since I saw the movie on DVD, I could not figure out the reaction of the audience). <br /> <br /> Regarding direction (Susan Monford), interpretations (Kim Bassinger, Lucas Haas, Craig Scheffer, etc.) Publication (William M. Anderson, Society of Dead Poets, Green Card, exceptional edition, “RoboCop 2", etc. It is well located in the context. On a scale of 1 (Awful) to 10 (Master). I rate "When it came out" 7 (normal).
