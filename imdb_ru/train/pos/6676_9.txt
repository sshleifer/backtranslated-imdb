****** WARNING: CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS *************** <br /> <br /> So who are these “Mysterious People”? Simply put, Mystery Men is a group of subheroes who are desperately trying to live their young fantasy life, destroying both their real personalities and their super-identities. A shovel (Bill Macy) works at a construction site during the day, and at night leaves his wife and children at home while he walks down the street looking for crimes to cope with his unusual and unique style of fighting a shovel. Blue Raja (Hank Azariah) sells silver to the newlyweds during the day and throws the tableware to the kids at night, if his mother does not force him to engage in the latest espionage. Mr. Forrius works in a landfill to make money, and then throws out frustration about his friends at night, throwing ill-considered statements about friends and enemies and threatening to really get angry (leaving everyone surprised, so what?). Ben Stiller breathes such a life into this character, you can't help but love him. <br /> <br /> These three spend their nights trying to capture the “moment of glory” they dreamed of ... becoming real Superheroes. Obviously, this could happen. After all, in the City of Champions there is the Captain Awesome ... flying, fighting super-cop with enough brand logos on his suit to stop an extra one or two bullets. Greg Kinnear turns into a stellar performance as a middle-aged sale, trying to get his fans back in the twilight of his career. <br /> <br /> To return this “extra magic” that can again win approval, S.A. Frees Casanova Frankenstein, WAAAAAY for the tremendous threat played by Goffrey Rush in frightening perfection. This crazy genius created a “psirator” to turn the City of Champions into a reflection of his own madness ... and eventually captured S.A. within hours of his release from prison. This leaves only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein’s evil plan, but with such minions like Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio will need a little help. <br /> <br /> The recruitment begins, and after a painful recruitment, the team settles with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially had the only real talent in the team, with its mystical bowling ball, apparently its lively vengeful spirit dead father; The Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who demands that he become invisible when ABSOLUTELY NO ONE look at him; Spleen (Paul Ruvims), provided by mystically strong flatulence from an evil gypsy woman; and the highly underrated Sphinx (Wes Studi), which, as shown, is able to cut a weapon in half with his mind, then spends most of the rest of the film, spewing meaningless puzzles and acting unnecessarily wisely. <br /> <br /> This film is indeed a multi-faceted bustle. Anyone who wants to shove movies into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle. This is a parody / parody of the superhero genre - from pseudo-Berton sets infinitely processed (and sometimes decorated with lots of parody material) to ridiculous costumes, the comic genre gets pretty good popularity. But at the same time, this is a serious film about superheroes. Both at once. Although in itself it is not necessarily a unique idea (for example, this film in some way reflects the short-lived work of InCior Five from D.C. Comic), it is quite innovative for a large screen. He offers the world of comics, which in any case requires the suspension of unbelief, and then adds the inevitable willing - and we all know, if the superheroes were real, these guys would be real. If the Big Guy with S was flying around New York, you would see half a dozen news stories about how underwear idiots regularly beat themselves in the ass. Sure, Shoveller fights pretty well, and Blue Raja hurls the forks with great precision - all parts of the world of superheroes. But does that make them real superheroes? Only in their minds. <br /> <br /> This film is also a comedy, albeit a dark one. Inevitably, when you try to point out the intricate, ridiculous nature of super-heroics. One-liners fly when comic geniuses on the stage throw out a lot of bits for the game. Particularly amazing is the dialogue of Jane Garofalo with her bowling ball / father. However, this is not a comedy in the sense of laughter or forever memorable jokes. He combines a dose of drama, discovery and romance, but he never decides to immerse himself in any of this. <br /> <br /> What really makes Mystery Men a good movie is that it is very engaging. Weak / lame good guys end up making excuses and, for one moment, really become superheroes; justice prevailed; and the film ends with a scene that smells like realism (as much realism as possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses create the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to tag a movie, the movie can be a great game. <br /> <br /> Of course, no film is perfect. Claire Forlani is just as boring and pointless as Mr. Fast & Furious's love interest, even though she plays a key role in his conscience Tom Waits, seems somehow embarrassed by his own line of the crazy inventor Dr. Heller, although retirement ladies in a nursing home, worth seeing alone. And the villains - no more than lackeys with weapons (this is stated in the film). The cinematography is intermittent and scattered (as it happens in a regular comic, so it is excusable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery, and special effects are never quite well integrated into the rest. <br /> <br /> However, in general, this film is incredible. You should probably be fans of comics and the genre of superheroes to truly appreciate this movie, but it's a fun game and a good way to kill a couple of hours and give your brain a break. <br /> <br /> 8/10 in my opinion.
