"Nothin '. There is nothing" in room 237. But you have no business going there anyway. So stay away. You understand? Stay away. "<br /> <br /> There has never been such a feat of psychological horror that this film achieves. This is a horror film with the highest rating among all, and rightly so. Jack Nicholson is a great actor, and this is one of the greatest movie performances. <br /> <br /> This is a family that moves to a lonely and abandoned hotel for 5 months in winter. Then the father (Jack) becomes almost obsessed with the horrors in the hotel. <br /> <br /> Direction Kubricks - nothing more than short, then beautiful. Intense tracking shots, painful music, mystical Great messages and bewilderment make this film the best horror movie ever created. <br /> <br /> Danger, death and horror are constantly mentioned throughout the film. Red is used in EVERY scene. Red is intentionally inserted by Kubrick? Of course !. <br /> <br /> This is Kubrick's classic, and this is the third of his films that I gave 10/10.He is a perfectionist in his own direction, and you can see it in all his films. He likes to confuse his viewers in all his films. <br /> <br /> I will talk about this film for a few more months. He has infinite depth. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is the cornerstone of horror and tension. Masterpiece of Terror 10/10
