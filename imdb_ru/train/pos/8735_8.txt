Such a joyful world was created for us in Pixar's A Bug's Life; we are immersed in a universe that could only be documented on film, or rather, a universe that can only be captured through the world of animation. For those who have forgotten what the rich and turbulent animation of the world has to offer ?? when is it in the right hands that is ?? The life of a beetle is a warm reminder. We leave the film with an equally warm feeling and satisfaction, derived only from the high-caliber film industry. <br /> <br /> This is just the second Pixar animation feature. The Disney subgroup made its debut and, perhaps, quite by chance, got into the world of cinema three years earlier in 1995, releasing its outstanding film “Toy Story”. It was a film that defied agreement, reinvented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence. Now they are returning with their sophomore, which, to be honest, gives us all a creeping feeling of cynicism before watching a movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a film about ants. Well, all the walks in the world of insects and insects are described in the book “The Life of a Beetle”, but it is the ant that is the main thing in this film, as people play a major role in dramas, novels, and so on. How can such an insignificant animal species, like an ant, act as the protagonist of a film, not to mention ensuring the entire premise of a feature film? Of course they are joking. However, we forget that in Toy Story, a bunch of toy toys could become the most ambitious, most inspiring and attractive group of animated characters and villains ever invented. The guys from Pixar manage to do the same skill and turn a bunch of dirty and tiny beetles into the cutest and most pleasant gang of parasites that you may have ever encountered. <br /> <br /> Not only are they all friendly and pretty ?? there is no unpleasant character in sight; even villains are exciting characters ?? but they are colorful, they are eclectic, and they are unique. And the set of characters is also huge due to the lack of a better term, only adding rich layers of distinctiveness already glued to the Life of the Beetle from the very beginning. Let's start with our main character and our hero. His name is Flick (David Fowley), and his character is at least fairly general. Of the thousands of faithful and obedient ants living on the magnificent, beautiful Island of Ants, he is considered the clan's “black sheep”, as can be seen in the first moments of the film, when he inadvertently destroys the harvest of the season of his antics. <br /> <br /> The problem is that ants collect greedy grasshoppers headed by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), who want to continue to assert their anger and autocracy among small ants; when they come to the Island of Ants for their annual banquet and see that their offer is gone, they go crazy for lack of a better time. Hopper offers a proposal to save the ants from complete extinction in the hands of his flock; however, these are negotiations that are simply impossible to complete. The cogs and clockwork in Flick's mind are now in full swing, despite his guilt and shame, and he offers to leave Ant Island in search of powerful warrior beetles who can come to the aid of the colony and fight Hopper and the grasshoppers. <Br /> <br /> If you think about it, “The Beetle’s Life” is very similar to the storyline of the classic “Samurai Akira Kurosawa” or the American remake “The Magnificent Seven,” in which the village of an unhappy but kindhearted people is threatened. evil and evil enemies ?? One lonely villager goes in search of help to the big city, finds her and returns to the colony to drive away the evil. In A Bug's Life, help comes in the form of a murdered circus troupe, which Flick mistakenly perceives as warriors in a bar fight. <br /> <br /> A lot of fun comes from these scenes. and a lot of fun comes out of these circus troupe mistakes. Among them is the erudite stick insect (David Hyde Pierce), a German caterpillar with obesity named Heymlich split along the sides and a quasi-fatal ladybug, which is actually a tough and male ladybug (Dennis Hopper). Watching these bugs on the screen is extremely pleasant, as they observe how insects and insects interact on the screen, just like the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> As I said, a lot of fun and fun comes. of their characters and joyful interactions with each other, which are inferior to a variety of cheerful lines, surprisingly tense and exciting situations and a whole dazzling film. What makes A Bug's Life even better is that the film is not limited to just children, as many may perceive it, although children will really find more entertainment in this film ?? the cliché of child-friendly situations is a bit more than we would like. However, this mistake is easy to ignore, and enjoying this movie is incredibly easy. <br /> <br /> Although Life of the Beetle may not reach the dizzying and iconic standards set by its predecessor, this film is still great, and the beginning of something promising here. Pixar proved that this is not just a one-hit marvel, but a talented and talented filmmaker group in Hollywood. They endlessly raise the bar, and when someone always manages to exceed their standards, it is always only them. What else can you say about the life of a beetle, except: to see it; this is not exactly the best we have seen in people in emeryville, california, but does it exceed all its years ?? and damn if this is not the best animation of 1998. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
