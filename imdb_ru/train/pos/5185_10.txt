I watched this movie more than 100-200 times, and I love it every time I watch it. Yes, it can be very banal, but it is also very funny and pleasant. The camp shown in the film is a real camp, which I actually attended for 7 years, and is portrayed as a camp, a great place to spend the summer. Anyone who ever went to camp, wanted to go to camp or sent a child to camp should watch this movie, because it will bring back beautiful memories for you and your children.
