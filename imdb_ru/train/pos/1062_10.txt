I think this show is definitely the best show. Jessica Alba does this great work. Michael Weatherly does an excellent job, like the rest of the cast. The show is very intriguing, they have great storylines and their stunts are amazing. Itâ€™s like watching a 1-hour movie. It is definitely worth seeing.
