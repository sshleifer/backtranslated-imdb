*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> this film always seems to be greatly exaggerated, until I remember that in my campus it was the suicide of a former student who became a Nazi racist-murderer who then committed the murder And more : his name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. <br /> <br /> Find it on Wikipedia - I added some photos to their article about it. <br /> <br /> This is hard to believe, but it does happen. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburn, Kristie Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport were good.
