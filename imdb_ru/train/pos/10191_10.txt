What is contained on this disc is the first showing of the first page. This CD is NOT for the faint of heart ... the music is incredibly rich and VERY cool. What you will find out when you watch this movie is why Someone has been so huge for so long. It's true that their recordings were great, but their shows were at the top of the pile. In 1969, when this concert was filmed, screaming teenagers who threw jelly beans at the Beatles disappeared, and the groups (and the audience) got used to the long and often surprising manifestations of musical virtuosity - that few viewers have an intellectual curiosity to spend in the era of Britney and Cristina's canned music. What you especially study here is the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try the concert, it's really awesome.
