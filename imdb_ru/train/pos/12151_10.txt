This is just the embodiment of what a movie should be for television. It was a lazy Sunday, when my wife and I were in graduate school, and we stumbled upon it. Crappy game. Badly written script. Good old guys. Funny, but still somehow obvious cliche and banal premise. Pickup ride with your corpse-backed wife. It has everything. <br /> <br /> You will meet familiar characters: a gold digger, a stupid rich boy who wants to do it on his own, friends who know better, a dad who knows better, but his son drives away And his dead wife. Propped up In pickup. <br /> <br /> Wow: and title. Several things in our lives have been “Texas Tragedies” since they saw this beauty. Everyone who participates in its creation deserves a medal.
