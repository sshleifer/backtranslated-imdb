Well, basically this is a sci-fi film about popcorn, but from the very beginning it is obvious that it was directed with great intelligence. You can count about 10 clich√©s of which the film is built, but it gives only three of them, and several of them have a zest, which allows you to once again understand that the director did not assume that you are an idiot. The acting of Kurt Russell is really superb and brings depth from the character, which is amazing and rewarding. It is recommended if you just saw something really stupid and want to restore your faith!
