If there is a more masterful adaptation than this, you do not need to look for it; You will find more and more in this almost perfect presentation of Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Rarely did I see a film that would induce me to read the novel on which it was based, but I admit that there is. Although I did not read Jane Eyre, I am convinced that I missed very little in the dialogue and the plot or in the intensity and emotions. I just want to explore the novel because of the tremendous curiosity and emotions that this masterpiece has aroused in me. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t need to disclose anything regarding the plot here. Let me just say the following: if you may not be sure if you should watch or read the beautiful story of Jane Eyre, I beg you to have no more doubt! Every atom of power and magic that brought Jane Eyre up as a popular classic of English literature was successfully captured in this film. <br /> <br /> The fact that Bronte did not bring Clark and Dalton was able to bring the spotlight with tremendous intensity. The success of the film, no doubt, is due in no small measure to their acting skills. <br /> <br /> Love Jane Eyre or hate her, but appreciate the wealth, vitality, truthfulness of the story; love characters; love the actors; everything is just like you love what is beautiful in the movies.
