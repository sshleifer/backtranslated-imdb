As many reviewers point out, the film’s version is slightly different from the stage version of the story. I have never seen a stage version of the story, and therefore I have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers. Richard Attenborough may not have been the best choice for a film director, but the film is still an interesting story about several dancers trying to succeed in the show choreographer Michael Douglas. The film works correctly without choosing a famous actor or performer to participate in the final test group. Thus, our attention is focused on the movements of the dancers and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during the Marathon Test Day. Douglas is also probably not the best choice for this piece. Obviously, some songs were cut out in favor of the new one, and a backstage cliché was added to the story of the romantic connection between the dancer and the choreographer. Honestly, it was the weakest part of the film. The recurring invasions that Cassie made during her trial attempts seem to reflect almost desperate requests that you often have to do while engaging in art professions in the absence of talent and / or luck. However, this aspect of the film was made to death in the past, and it is curious to see how this tired old shoe lifts its heel once again. The revelations of the dancers themselves began quite promisingly with the number “I can do it,” but then it slowed down a bit at different times while the dancers told their stories. Honestly, their stories differed little from real people who never get such a chance. *** out of 4 stars.
