There is nothing in Moonstruck that you donâ€™t like. I'm from a New York Italian family, and I miss the house a little when I watch it. Actors and actresses, plot, plots, humor ... they were all fantastic. It starts a little slow, but a lot happens in these two days! I fell in love with LaBoheme because of this film. On my list of favorite movies, Moonstruck is number 3. This is a "feel good" movie, where you leave the theater, singing "this is amazing" or repeating some of your favorite lines: "old man, if you give these dogs another piece of my food, I will kick you until you die "; "Chrissy, bring me a big knife," "who is dead," "you love him, Loretta ..... well, because when you do this, they drive you crazy, because they know they can." I always wear Moonstruck when there is nothing good to watch, because it makes me happy.
