Seven Pound Stars - Will Smith in the role of Ben Thomas, an IRS tax agent who has a hidden motive to meet with those who have been delayed on their tax payments. Thomas caused the death of seven people while driving, talking on the phone, and the film tells about his attempt to try to redeem him, frankly, an unforgivable crime. <br /> <br /> The storyline is as thin as a brick through fingers. green house window. What you see is exactly what is happening - even the end of the Titanic was more amazing than the Seven Pounds. There is absolutely no turning point in this, there is never any confusion or doubt about what is happening. <br /> <br /> I usually only like Will Smith when he is in full Bad Boys mode. The guy is at his best when he wears a sporting rifle, drives a Ford GT and says “Oh, damn it,” because whenever he tries to act seriously, it looks like a pathetic attempt to get an Oscar, which he so desperately despaired of . This is probably the main reason why I was not looking forward to the film, although here it is very understated. There are comedy flashes, but they are subtle, in fact it was the most understated representation of Will Smith that I have ever seen, and for this reason he was fantastic and should be nominated for the main award ironically. <br /> <br /> All the supporting actors were great too - Rosario Dawson watched almost the entire movie die, and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were good, like all the other few players. <br /> <br /> On the whole, this is deplorable - but this is not throwing all the usual cliches and sentimental violins to give you a different choice than to cry. Several times even my tempered heart almost broke. It will be difficult for you not to find one of the situations unrelated to your own life, because of which it seems even more real. <br /> <br /> I would give 8/10. Will Smith's show moves to the drama without despair in the pursuit of happiness and brings all the best out of it.
