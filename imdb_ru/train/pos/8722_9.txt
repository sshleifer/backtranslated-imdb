For a start, this is a very funny movie, in which several crazy characters run around who will surely laugh (check out two Russian errors). <br /> <br /> Bug Bug has a classic Disney storyline, but this is one of the good things about the movie. They praise family values, and the main characters of the film undergo some changes in order to finally resist the grasshoppers. And it also has a couple of awesome offscreen comments from Dave Fowley, Julia-Louise Dreyfuss, Kevin Spacey (of course) ... But in fact, the most amazing thing about this movie is animation. This is just great. All the details, gorgeous colors, each ant looks different, beautiful backgrounds ... And the guys and girls in Pixar made it all so realistic. In general, a very good job. This is the best Disney animation since Aladdin.
