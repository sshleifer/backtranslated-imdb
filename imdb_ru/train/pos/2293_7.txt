This is a very, very early cartoon Bugs Bunny. As a result, the character is still in a transitional period - he is not stretched so elongated as he was later, and his voice is not entirely correct. In addition, the chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a bit unusual. Elmer is a poor fellow who buys beetles at a pet store - he has no weapon or desire to blow a rabbit into smithereens! However, despite this, it is still a very nice movie. The early Bugs were definitely more impudent and cruel than his later incarnations. In later films, he contacted Elmer, Yosimit Sam and others, because they started it - they contacted the rabbit. But in this film, he is much more like Daffy Duck of the late 30s — early 40s — an idiot who just likes to annoy others !! A real "anarchist" instead of the hero of later cartoons. Although this is not one of the best Bug Bunny cartoons, looking at him is certainly interesting, and interesting to see how much he has changed over the years.
