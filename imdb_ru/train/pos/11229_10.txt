With the number of actors who work on the project, they have a wide range of actors. A good CGI spacecraft in places, BUT their green screen needs some work. Anyone who has heard of Adobe After Effects 7 should buy it in order to better navigate. <br /> <br /> The stories are well thought out, there are many elements of the track in it to keep it in the right context. BUT BUT the idea of ​​two guys kissing makes me turn off the episode. I am not homophobic, but I cannot help, because I do not find men kissing in entertainment (not against women). Anyway ... For fans of TV shows, this is good stuff. With a slight improvement in their green screen, an update in acting, and some management evaluations, this series is staggering. In any case, I recommend this series to those who have ever used TNG and DS9.
