This is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists from around the world. Documentary films are diverse and relate to all sorts of concepts, the only thing they share is the topic of 9/11 (in some cases very insignificant). Some segments are weak, while others are very strong; some political, some not; some are devoted solely to the events of September 11, some simply use September 11 as a topic affecting human feelings, emotions and tragedies; some of them are basic, while others are abstract and artistic). This film was not censored by anyone, so the thoughts you see are very rough and strong. <br /> <br /> This is a very controversial film, especially for conservative Americans. I think the two segments can really mark the right (one from Egypt, where a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber return as spirits; the other from the UK, who talks about the US-supported overthrow of Chile on September 11, 1973, which resulted in 50,000 deaths terrible atrocities). The segment from Mexico was the most powerful, telling about the fall of the towers and the subsequent death in a lively way (you have to see it to believe it). <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the final product is uneven, with some segments almost “meaningless”, I still recommend it. It is very difficult to rate this film because the segments are changing everywhere (some are weak, some are very strong;). I give this rating to 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered problems that are usually censored (Mexico segment, UK segment, Japan segment, Egypt segment).
