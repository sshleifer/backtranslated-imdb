Like The Jeffersons, The Good Times was one of those classic American sitcoms that was never shown in the UK, not to mention it was released in the 1970s — the decade in which I was not born yet. <br /> <br /> But, like most fans of the show, I watched several episodes on You Tube, and then I liked it. <br /> <br /> James and Florida lead the Evans family — two parents try to make ends meet, and who, despite their lack of qualifications, encourage their children, who have their own life aspirations, to implement them and use their chances. James was a strict but loving father who did not dare to punish JJ, Michael and Thelma - if they crossed the line. While Florida, by contrast, was a fair, kind-hearted and attentive mother and loving wife, although she was much like James in relation to their attitude to parental and family values ​​from an African American point of view. <br /> <br /> The children were as lively and interesting as the parents themselves: Jay Jay was an aspiring artist with a stupid personality and a crazy sense of humor, who often wore colorful clothes and whose “DY-NO-MITE” phrase is so as infectious and familiar as Arnold Jackson’s “What a Talk” talk about Willis? from various beats. Michael was a smart Alec, dreaming of becoming a lawyer, and Sister Thelma had her own dreams and hopes. Her verbal jokes with JJ were mostly fun, as was the love / hate relationship between brother and sister, which was very well played by Mike Evans and Bernadette Stanis. <br /> <br /> During the seasons there were several cameo appearances, especially from Janet Jackson, Debbie Allen and young Gary Coleman as myself! I actually prefer the Good Times, say, The Cosby Show, which was the show of the 80s, because a) I preferred the Evans family, rather than the “hackstables”, both in terms of a) characteristics, and b) because I felt that she was tackling serious and complex social issues, in a way that found a response from many viewers. It was a comedy, but it was also a social commentary, the purpose of which was to highlight the life of the working class, African Americans in America in the 1970s. The Cosby show attempted to satisfy a popular audience in a “candy” way, since the Huxtables were portrayed as Blacks, who easily assimilated into high-class American culture, with which we would associate Whites, while Good Times, by contrast, was much I was afraid to realistically consider topics such as drugs and child abuse. I actually found that, although the Cosby Show can be fun to watch from time to time, he lacked that “audacity” that Good Times has and that made him more fashionable and cool. <br /> <br /> The show has really jumped a shark in recent seasons, as it continued after John Amos’s character, James died in a strange accident (in fact, it was known that when John left Good Times forever. the death of his character was written as it is on the show). Without John, the show suffered, and, alas, it lost most of its charm. <br /> <br /> However, for the comedy series Good Times all the right frames were noted. If only they had shown it in the UK during the 80s. How is this, of course, as JJ would say, “DY-NO-MITE!” <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 and a half
