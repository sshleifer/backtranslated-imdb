This is one of the coolest shorts of "Our Gang". Spanky is very cute and funny, and the children he gets left to look after are fun too. The Brigade forces Tiny Spunky to watch their little brothers and sisters. Their first picture in baby carriages, entertained by various things, hung by a gang on rods, is a wonderful gag. <br /> <br /> Spanky's appearance in a huge toy knife when he was asked to look after older children is priceless, as his answer: “Hey, where did you get this stuff - I don't care for children!” The tiny guy who says “wonderful” throughout the film, all the beautiful jokes and Spanky telling the kids “all about Tarzana” make this one of the best “Our gangs” you have ever seen.
