The film revolves around a person who believes that all forms of media are outdated. The idea of ​​his artistic project is to expose the absurd culture in which we swam. Naturally, the film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. He attacks comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, blockbusters of Hollywood movies and touches many other mediums. Eventually, he discovers that he sees the weapon that he set in motion. The film is five years old, and every day it sounds more likely. This is the best description of post-punk anger I've ever seen. This is also one of my top 10 favorite movies.
