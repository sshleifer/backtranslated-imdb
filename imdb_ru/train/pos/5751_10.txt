What can I say about this movie? I have seen this quite a few times since I was about 6 years old. I saw the English version, and it is done very well. This is a great movie for all ages, but it is more focused on children. I love children's humor and appreciate it. If you have not seen it, try to rent a copy, you will not be disappointed!
