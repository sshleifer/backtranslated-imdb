This is simply the most amazing movie you have ever seen. I thought it was just another documentary, but it really is something else. He is not trying to teach you something, he shows you how life works in nature. <br /> <br /> I will not talk about the quality of the pictures, because you obviously know from other comments that they have no equal. <br /> <br /> Earth is funny, tense and sad. It can make you laugh, it can make you cry. Sometimes both at the same time. This is the first film that made me cry, not because you feel sorry for animals, but because you realize how fragile our planet is and what treasures we have been blessed with, but we donâ€™t appreciate it a bit. /> <br /> This film must be shown in schools. This is the most wonderful movie you've ever seen, so go and watch it. Who knows, maybe this is the last time we can see our planet like this ... <br /> <br /> 10/10, but I would easily appreciate it more if it were possible.
