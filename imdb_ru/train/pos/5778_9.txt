Despite budgetary constraints, this is an excellent film, proof that effort and imagination can overcome the lack of money. The discovery in which the cave paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs, at least, survived in the human age, is a beautiful red herring. After that, the meteor descends into the lake and causes heat, which, in turn, causes the incubation of a frozen dinosaur egg (perhaps the rock paintings suggest that this is not the first time). When a prehistoric beast appears, it is a well-animated plesiosaur, which soon causes extinction in this area. Okay, so this is not the Jurassic Park, but it's still real fun for fans of monster movies.
