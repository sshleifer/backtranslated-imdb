Absolutely funny. The tribute of John Waters to the people he loves the most (Baltimore) is a perverted little song that you can watch and laugh at. This is similar to how you were lit in a kitsch museum! I have not laughed so much in the theater since the days of Serial Mom. I really liked seeing old friends from the time of the Fairy Tale Country, Sharon Nisep and Susan Low, in front of the Waters camera. The cast is great (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plympton). Uses the best elements of the past atrocities of Water (especially underpriced polyester) and many new surprises. Made me sick, miraculously. Thanks, John!
