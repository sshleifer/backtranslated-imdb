First, the only reason why people continue to quarrel over this film is that they cannot make several changes to the true story. Well guess what? Peter Jackson's film was also not a perfect performance. Good enough verbalization. This is a very beautiful film. The backgrounds are gorgeous and taken from famous Tolkien artists. The film is about half of the trilogy (“The Fellowship of the Ring” and “The Battle for Helms in Two Towers”) and moves at a good pace. Voice acting is top notch, and most of the characters look the way I imagined. Samwise is a bit ugly for my taste, but Aragorn looks AMAZING. The film has an excellent rating, which fully supports the film. If you like good fantasy stories, but you hate reading (books are even better), try this film, remembering that it was made more than 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> It is also worth noting: the adaptation of Peter Jackson The communication follows almost the same direction as Ralph Bakshi (Jackson said many times how much he admires Bakshi's efforts).
