Hello again, I have to comment on this wonderful, exciting and believable story of romance and intrigue. The music is wonderful and memorable. Very nice colorful movie. Another movie I liked later was High Society with Bing Crosby. Wonderful music. Thank you for your attention, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, NV
