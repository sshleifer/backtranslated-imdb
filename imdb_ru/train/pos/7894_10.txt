This is a great show that makes you cry. People of this group really loved each other in real life, and it shows again and again. Email me and let's chat. I was in Australia and they really talk like that. <br /> <br /> I want you to enjoy Five Mile Creek and convey these wonderful stories of good and evil and friendship to your children. I have all 40 episodes on DVD-R, which I have collected over the past 5 years. Watch my Five Mile Creek tribute at www.mikeandvicki.com and listen to the extended theme music. Let's talk about them. <br /> <br /> These people are so cool!
