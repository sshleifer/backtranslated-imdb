Rumor has it that in times when ABBA? The star of the Swedish favorites in discos, awarded many awards, reached its apogee, the group was disappointed in singing in English and was eager to speak in their native language. Shortly thereafter, problems arose in the formerly closed, watertight partnership, and records became less and less frequent. The group fell apart, albeit unofficially, in 1982, and the pop lost one of their most famous performers. Although they never acknowledged that there is any truth in these rumors, the fact remains that ABBA would never be so successful if they only recorded in their own language. If you want to turn to the world's largest market for earning money, then you need to serve an English-speaking audience. <br /> <br /> It is surprising to me how such a small island located two steps away from the European continent could be the most recognized, though not the most widely spoken language in the world. Everyone speaks a little English; whether it’s just a “hello” or a usual curse - almost everywhere you will find a speaker in English. Pedro Galindo apparently did not agree, because Trampa Infernal was never captioned for global consumption until it was released recently on a budget DVD. This is a real shame, because in fact it is a decent slasher film, which is much better than many of his compatriots who speak English. <br /> <br /> The film starts in the unfamiliar territory of a pistol match. Two unidentified characters are shown wading through a dilapidated complex, searching for each other for the inevitable final confrontation. After some waiting and a few blunders, one of the pistols appears victoriously. Then we learn that they were only paintball guns, and the two competitors are actually young people from the local city. Nacho and Mauricio are the most brutal rivals, and Mauricio always tries to show himself better than his quiet opponent, but so far he has failed. <br /> <br /> Later that night, while the victorious shooter celebrates his triumph with his girlfriend Alejandra and his friend Charlie, Mauricio enters the bar and says that he has the last challenge for his glorious sworn enemy. He says it will be a competition that will prove to the city once and for all who deserve the greatest respect. Nacho is reluctant at first, because Alejandra warns him about the dangers of constant competition, but in the end he yields pressure from peer pressure and agrees; much to the disgust of his morally superior partner. <br /> <br /> They plan to go to the remote region of Filo de Caballo, because recent press coverage has reported that many people have been killed by what locals consider an angry bear, Mauricio suggests that someone who kills an animal , could be considered the greatest, and he also promises that this will be the last battle that he will fight against his opponent. <br /> <br /> After visiting the arsenal to stock up on weapons and ignore the warnings of an elderly storekeeper, the group set off to the remoteness of a secluded forest. Hunters are hunted when they learn that the "bear" is in fact the killer of a Vietnamese veterinarian, who still does not know that the war is over, and considers all people to be his enemy. What began as a competitive adventure suddenly turns into a battle for survival, as the evil killer pursues them and kills them. <br /> <br /> I picked up Trump while studying in Madrid from a Mexican student who lived in the next room. for me, I remember that the copy I was watching was faulty, and the taping ended about 10 minutes before the final credits rolled, which meant that I could not see the final scenes. Fortunately, I recently stumbled upon a budget DVD on Amazon and immediately added it to my collection. <br /> <br /> Slasher Gallindo is an amazingly good effort, which differs from his skillful leadership and fascinating plot, which tries to cover areas that are usually not available in slasher films. It is actually so good that it reminded me more than once of the classic predator Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is especially evident in scenes in which a creepy masked killer runs through the woods and pursues a panicky troupe trying to escape from the playground of a maniac. <br /> <br /> Despite Gallindo’s obvious awareness of the genre platitudes (the scarecrow even uses a glove with claws, like Freddy Krugar); Trampa also tries to add something else to the standard template. While most of the games are during the performance according to the specific rules of this category, the last third reports a significant step in individuality, since the maniac is armed with an automatic weapon and seduces the hero into his lair for the final duel. From this point on, the film quickly changes genres and becomes almost a fighter who, depending on your taste, will either excite you or disappoint you. The last slasher who tried to cross two styles was this trashy eighties recording of The Majorettes, which is not always good. <br /> <br /> As in many Latin films (especially Spanish films of Almodovar). and Amenabar), Trampa has a subtle obedience to the moral of her story, which is successfully transmitted without crashing into the viewer's throat. Needless to indulge in the temptations of competitive masculinity, and you cannot always be a winner. This is a sugar-covered point, but it is processed quite delicately so as not to distract attention from this feature. <br /> <br /> Trump may seem trashy, but deserves to be seen and recognized as one of the best late slashers. , The killer looks great in a terrible military uniform and a white mask in the style of Valentine, and the attempts of originality are just about work. Perhaps he lacks the blood that most sincere fans of horror enjoy, but this is enough in terms of tension and creativity to guarantee at least one viewing.
