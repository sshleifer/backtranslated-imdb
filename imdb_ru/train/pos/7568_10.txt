I saw it on my last day at the festival and was glad that I stayed for a couple of extra days. Poetic, touching and, surprisingly, funny, in its own way strange. It is rare to find directors working in this style who can find real weirdness and humor in a hyper-realistic world, without looking precious and without upsetting the balance. It was possible to appear both improvised and fully controlled. I hesitate to compare, because these directors really digested their influence (Cassavetis, Malik, Loach, Altman ... ordinary suspects) and found their own unique style, but if you like modern directors in this tradition (Lynn Ramsey, David Gordon Green ), you will find real pleasure. This is a great movie and I hope more people will see it. If this film plays at a festival in your city, go! go! go!
