One of the best films I've seen in the last five years! The actor's actor's play tells of the young love and bravado on the Lower East Side of New York, and the two main roles are superstars. Funny, charming, sad and inspirational, this is an absolutely refreshing look at the urban youth that puts Larry Clark’s often nauseous blow into the trough where he is ... although I must admit that the Bully was a cut above his usual fare. Victor Vargas's upbringing is one movie that you’ll play for, so don’t miss it!
