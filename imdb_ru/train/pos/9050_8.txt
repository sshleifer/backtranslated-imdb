This is a gem, a real piece of Americana, despite all this. If you yourself are programmed to resist “life-affirming” stories, just stay away and let the rest of us who still believe believe enjoy. And what makes the icing on the cake really amazing is that it is a fact based on a true story from rags to riches, no need to quibble what details have been changed to make a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest living actors, and complex, controversial, the essence, good in the main father, whom he portrayed, can be successfully implemented only by someone with his skill and insight. Simple thinking comments who refuse to accept a father who is constantly trying to establish the law, feeling that he may not be up to date, expose the restrictions of the commentator rather than the authors or actors. It is not for cynical or ordinary people.
