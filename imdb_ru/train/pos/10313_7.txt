China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. The production of the Golden Harvet was led by veteran director Robert Klaus. Unfortunately, he was either lucky with the "Leader of the Dragon", or he lost touch, because he is not such a great director. The only reason to watch this movie is to see Miss Rothrock and Richard Nortonâ€™s combat skills. If this film were directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng, it could become a classic action movie, and not just a funny action movie. <br /> <br /> China O'Brien is returning home to help his father. He has problems with the local crowd, and he needs her help. Therefore, she returns home and restores order (with the help of two unlikely people). But will there be enough of them to overthrow Mr. Big and his evil comrades? <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of Cynthia Rothrock, then this movie is made for you. I only liked the fighting scenes, all the rest is rubbish. Why hasn't Raymond Chow laid out several shekels and hired a top-quality action director? <br /> <br /> Recommended.
