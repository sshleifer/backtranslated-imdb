This film is very underrated. It is very creative, creative and intelligent. It's just fun, and, in my opinion, this movie comes first. But the film was forgotten when it just came out, and over the years it became even more ignored. Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey were also bombed at the box office, while the first was quite successful and very popular. <br /> <br /> I think the problem is that this film was released a couple of years later. In 1991, Bill and Ted already seemed like “80s like that.” Despite the fact that the 80s were just a couple of years ago, the landscape of music and style for children has changed so radically with gangsta rap, hip-hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and sound from Seattle. Bill and Ted with their music Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses along with their 80s style seemed so out of place and very outdated in the 91st, and I think this is one BIG reason the film was bombed at the box office . Nobody, except the surfers, still said something like "excellent!" and "fake!" in 1991, Gremlins-2, also released in the early 1990s, suffered the same fate as becoming a good film that was bombed at the box office because it was too connected to the 1980s. The transition from the 80s to the 90s was much faster than now, from the 90s and 00s. 1991 was not like 1988 or 1989, whereas now, 2002 and last year 2001 still looks like / looked like 1995 or 1996. <br /> <br /> If only “Excellent Adventure”, which was made in 1988, was released this year instead of 1989, and “Fake Journey” was made quickly and released in 1989, then it probably , it would be as wildly perceived as the first.
