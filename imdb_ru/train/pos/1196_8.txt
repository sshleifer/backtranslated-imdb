That summer I watched the filming of this film for several days, as a result of which there were only two scenes in the film. The place was Sylvan Lake in the Black Hills. Bring a van, stop a van, etc. So this young Dakota was looking forward to watching the movie and was not disappointed. The local herd of buffalo was rejected, so the shooting scenes were real. (yes, Doris, the animals suffered while filming) I think the final was copied by Jack Nicholson in The Shining? Excellent western / social comment of the 50s. It should be in the same class as at noon for real western drama, or used as a social statement, such as Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause, for young people of the 50s.
