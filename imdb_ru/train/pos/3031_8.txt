It could be better if someone with more experience was leading it. Shumlin did not do a bad job, but this is not a great work of cinematic art. <br /> <br /> This is, however, a wonderful movie. I loved it, because the local channels showed it. Graham Green is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Some rather bad films were made from his novels and short stories. (Many people love Fallen Idol, but I am not among them. I think I saw Brighton Rock one day many years ago and I liked it, but maybe I just thought about love with love.) It is superbly played. . Charles Boyer, however, does not look like Spanish. But he seems to have the perfect character for this character - tired, cautious, caring. Lauren Bacall is attractive as a British girl who falls in love with him. But supporting players are the best: Katina Paksino is excellent. Her performance is a small Gran Guignol, but I attribute it to the director. Peter Lorre, the first time we meet when he gives Boyer a lesson in Esperanto-like universal language, is excellent - as always. <br /> <br /> Wanda Hendrix could break the most difficult heart. She gives the impression of an early teenager. The character wants to be useful. She does her best. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Not without reservations. The reservation, first of all, is that it is a bit stupid. But history and acting can hardly be improved.
