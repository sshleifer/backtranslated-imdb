Not seeing all the films released in 2002, I can not say that this is the best film of the year. I can say that this is the best movie I have seen in the whole year. <br /> <br /> Most American films with black people either focus on American concerns about “race relations” or end up in the clichés of the city’s inner ghetto, where every imaginable stereotype spews slang. In this regard, Antwone Fisher stands alone: ​​the race does not matter, except for one fight that could or could not be provoked by a racial blot. <br /> <br /> The story of Antwone Fisher has to find a response from any empathic person. He is depicted by Derek Luke with understanding and thoughtfulness. Denzel Washington, obviously using his star power to create the film, mostly remains in the background and allows the film to become the story of Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> At a time when BET and popular culture in general want to preserve the ghettoization of a large number of Americans (and including Canadians), this film tells humanity in all respects. from U.S. I just hope that not a black audience will go to watch this film for this humanity, and not to avoid it, because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the film with whom they could identify themselves. That would be a sad commentary on race relations in North America on its own. <br /> <br />
