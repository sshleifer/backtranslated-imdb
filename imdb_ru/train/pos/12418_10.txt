This film and its sequel Barry Mackenzie has his own, two greatest comedies that have ever been produced. Great story when a young Australian guy travels to England to get hold of his inheritance and meets his friends who are as sweet and innocent as he is. <br /> <br /> It's jam-packed with great words, where else can you find a person who needs a drink so badly that he is as dry as a dead dingo? great characters, great acting, and she has big sheiles and more Fosters consumption than any other three films combined. On the highest level. <br /> <br /> And some of the funniest songs you've ever heard, and they are full of great celebrities. Definitely my two favorite films of all time, I watch them at least once every two weeks.
