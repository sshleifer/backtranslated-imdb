I hated the first episode of this show (“Hippie Protesters”) in 1999 that I was wary of the others. However, when he appeared on The First Comedy Channel, I watched it completely and, to my surprise, found it completely ridiculous (motto: never judge a comedy series in the first week)! <br /> <br /> In 1969, “Hippies” starred Simon Pegg in the role of “Ray Perbbs”, editor of an underground magazine in the style of “Oz” called “The Mouth”. His friends are the feminist Jill, the laid-back Alex and the half-conscious Hugo. Back in the late 60s, there was a feeling of incredible optimism among young people that they could change the world by printing magazines that no one reads. Instead of scoffing at the hippie naivete, “Hippies” are gentle with it. Scenarios of Arthur Matthews boldly parody a number of icons of that era - “Hair”, “Woodstock”, “Graduate”, even the infamous “Oz” test in the early 70s. Excellent performances from the actors; Julian Rind-Tatt's “Alex” strangely reminded me of the character Richard O'Sullivan from Man About the House. It is a pity that the second series was not, perhaps because of people like me. If you missed the hippie, try it. As soon as you overcome a terrible debut, a treat awaits you!
