May 2004, Wonderland is pretty new in the UK. A brilliant film about a brutal true story. If you know Los Angeles since the early 80s, you will appreciate how well it is captured. Using the elements that make up his gritty cinematic style is original, enhancing the experience and bringing the viewer closer to being there. Using a scattered timeline in the Pulp Fiction style allows you to explore uncertainty about what actually happened, while the direction and actions of the actors attract attention, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; Oscar is for sure if I distributed them.
