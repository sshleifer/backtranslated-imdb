The story of "Women from Nowhere" is quite simple and largely adapted directly from the spaghetti western Eastwood: a mysterious stranger enters a lawless city ruled by a thief in law and starts shooting this place. Even the opening credits and music have such a feeling of spaghetti: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud. The really interesting reasons are that the stranger is a beautiful (!) Woman, Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) in Harley, and this place is in a city somewhere in Japan. <br /> <br /> This actor has a significant amount of firefights, some are good, some are predictable, and other places are somewhat ridiculous, but this is a lot of fun. Ryoko treats her weapon with believability and aplomb and gives the thugs their due. For her, this was not so much an actor's test as physical, but she coped very well. She shows her acting skills much more than Otsu in the NHK drama Musashi. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the film if you are a fan of Ryoko Yonekura (whom I adore) and / or “Girls with guns” a fan of the film, and he withstands repeated views. For me, there is something outstanding and inexplicable in the movie Girls with Guns, such as La Femme Nikita and The Long Kiss Goodnight. And having a great girl, like Ryoko in the lead role, is just a drop of ice on the cake.
