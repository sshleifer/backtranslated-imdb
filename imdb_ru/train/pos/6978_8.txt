Well, I have to say that I was waiting for his arrival. <br /> <br /> I will not try to spoil him, and quite a few people really spoke brilliantly about the pilot. On the other hand, I am not quite sure that I understand detractors who consider themselves BSG fans, and not a pilot. <br /> <br /> What did they expect? !! History 50 years before BSG, we are there to help the birth of the Cylons, to see the life of the Adam family (we already knew something from BSG), to get a deeper explanation of Capricaâ€™s population and its perception of other colonies, and perhaps the origin of the faith of the gods man and the unique faith of the Cylon gods. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the same abundance of special effects or space opera, as in the previous series, I distinguish between these two, although I know that Caprica will strengthen BSG. <br /> <br /> This is a promising start at 1:30, and I also believe that it will put pressure on scenarios that will be as good as BSG. I expect a lot from the following, but I have no reason to doubt that we will learn much more. <br /> <br /> Watching a deleted scene on a DVD also provides more material for thought. <br /> <br /> I look forward to January 2010
