The rapid economic development of the 1990s in China has witnessed a revival of traditional Chinese culture, partly due to the growth of nationalism, accompanied by an increase in wealth, and, more importantly, because of a sense of spiritual affiliation after the collapse of the old Socialist ideology in the post-cultural era. <br /> <br /> However, the revival of traditional Chinese culture, namely Confucianism, was not without disasters, because the Chinese adopted the whole tradition without eliminating the bad part, and the discrimination against girls shown in this film is an excellent example. <br /> <br /> Moreover, not only the part that should be discarded was inherited, the good part that had to be inherited, for example, the traditional opera and its technique, such as face change, was ignored in the revival, and in the face of extinction. <br /> <br /> The director used this film to criticize the problem of reincarnating the tradition in modern China and this is a deeper meaning of the film.
