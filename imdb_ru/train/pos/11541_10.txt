Mattau and Lemmon are excellent in this - everyone else in the film is great too. The dialogue is superb and very, very witty - and the scene when Lemmon's character tries to clear his bosoms in a restaurant makes me roll on the floor laughing every time I see it. Anyone who accidentally saw a not very successful continuation should not turn away from the original. I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - I just adore it. And the fact that Jack Lemmon plays his character so straight ahead with tragic notes, in my opinion, only adds fun. These two great guys together made a series of films, but this one is the best, without a doubt.
