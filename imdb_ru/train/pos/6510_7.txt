I really like what I've seen from this cartoon so far. Of course, animation is not the best, but, to be honest, I would prefer that this type of more cartoon style be performed quickly and cheaply, than the old style performed quickly and cheaply (which started to happen more and more often) is just a style that looks well, when a lot of time and effort are invested in it). There is nothing wrong with corner lines and small black dotted eyes - in fact, I think it is really cute. As a child, I never thought that Scooby-Doo's design was particularly delightful, but I think I would like him to know better. <br /> <br /> In any case, Shaggy has always been my favorite character, and, believe it or not, I think he has the most potential for some depth. Undoubtedly, the show does not focus on the original theme of “solving secrets”, but in any case it was just an outdated formula. Don't get me wrong - I'm sure there are writers who could attract much more interest in the traditional Mystery Inc classes. (what was missing recently), but at the same time, this Show is a funny deviation from the standard. Shaggy and Scooby are still funny, but not only with comic relief. They are still cowardly, but finally have the opportunity to use what seems to be (shocking!) Intelligence. They are the same old binge eating loafers, as before, but now it seems that they actually continue to live with the help of Uncle Albert's inheritance. <br /> <br /> I’m used to finding Scooby-Doo’s most original jokes to be pure cheese and inadvertently fun at best, but this show actually has an ability for real humor. Besides, I never like Casey Kasem as Shaggy, so the new actor doesn't annoy me as much as other people. (Although I still think that Billy West was the best) <br /> <br /> Overall, despite the fact that this is not the best cartoon in the entire history of cartoons, it is still an achievement among Scooby's other incarnations.
