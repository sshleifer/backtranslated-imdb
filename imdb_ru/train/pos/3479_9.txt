This show began with great mysterious episodes. I think everything is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. After this, the series began playing short episodes with Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy doo. <br /> <br /> I think that Hanna Barbera Productions should have turned the 20-minute episodes into short ones. Some of the voice actors have become unavailable. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) became unavailable. I think that Velma's voice changes after the first 12 episodes, because the first actress who played Velma was not available. <br /> <br /> And the network ordered the studios of Hanna Barber to make more shorts with Shaggy, Scooby-Doo and Skrappi do, because the ratings were high. So they should have made more shorts. I wish they were mysteries, like 15 episodes. However, this is a good show.
