* some spoilers * <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised to find out that harsh criticism (actions, outdated dialogue, unclear plot line) is unfounded. Belafonte is great as a brandy, threatening, abusive spirit that must earn its wings, but it is really poorly prepared for its past life. He is too late to find out how empty his fussy materialistic life without love is. The bridge is also as big as an agonizing man with his dying wife Fanny. Despite his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) one. Two social worlds, which are represented by characters, alternately collide and complement each other, resulting in a funny and touchingly sad. <br /> <br /> The stunning finale actually fits the rest of the movie. Searching for Belafte everywhere, Mostel raises his head and sees a falling feather, and he desperately reaches out to him, as if to finally believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte was not allowed to perform a miracle (either restore the health of Fanny, or Mostel's faith), so he never received his wings. A pen teasing mockingly from the hands of Mostela, a metaphor for the lives of both men: it's too late and you have no second chance. Like “It's a wonderful life,” this film is magical, wonderful, funny, but terribly tragic.
