This movie is the best movie Jim Carrey has ever made. Kerry did not have his usual face doing things in this film. He was both funny and sad. Kerry played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God (Morgan Freeman) for everything that goes wrong in his life. Then God descends from heaven and gives Bruce his strength. As I said, Kerry did a great job. I also thought that Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great as an actor / actress. The plot was good because there were many sub-items in it. This film can be funny (Bruce’s dog) and sad (“parting”). The script also worked well. I'm glad they made the continuation of this film. I rate this movie 9/10.
