IQ is an amazingly original romantic comedy, in which the greatest and deepest scientific minds of the 20th century are put as Cupidâ€™s assistants. Comparison of the heart and mind is the central theme of this carefree, but thoughtful film. You do not quite know how to react, because part of the time you see how great scientists do stupid things to cultivate nascent love, but sometimes you hear them discuss some of the deepest mysteries of the space / time of our age. The end result is a funny movie with surprises. Walter Mattau is a wonderful Einstein, Meg Ryan creates a dodgy mathematician with scattered brains, and Tim Robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated working man, fascinated by science. Together they create a strange journey through love and science, mind and heart.
