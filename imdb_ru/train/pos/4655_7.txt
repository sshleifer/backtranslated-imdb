Peter Ustinov plays a wasteful thing, which only comes out of prison when the film begins. As soon as he comes out of the gate, he immediately begins to work on the scheme in order to make a bundle again by theft, although this time he has rather high sights. This is actually one of the weak points in the film, as he obviously does not know anything about computers (few people knew about it in 1968), but he manages to become a computer genius literally overnight! Yes, right. In any case, he came up with a scheme to impersonate a computer expert and get a job in a large American corporation so that he could assign a ton of money over time. Considering that his knowledge of computers is rudimentary, it is amazing how he brings to life a brilliant plan and manages penetration into a computer system and its protection. But in the end, this is a film, so I was able to suspend disbelief. By the end of the film, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) can escape with a million pounds. <br /> <br /> At the very end, it becomes very, very confusing, and Smith announces she really managed to accumulate more than two million, investing reasonable funds in the companies Ustinov started (although she did not understand that they were all fictitious companies). This should mean that in the end these stocks, which she bought, turned out to be useless. What they seem to imply (and I might guess wrong here) is that Ustinov and his new partners quickly cashed out the shares before this became known, and the shares would thus become useless. Anyway, the film seems to publish a magical ending, in which no one was hurt, and everyone is happy - and it just didnâ€™t make much sense. This is really a shame, as the acting and most of the compositions were great. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were just great. <br /> <br /> If I seem to have interpreted the end, let me know, since the film at the end seemed very vague in details.
