As a pagan, I must say that this film has little magical meaning. This is a "funny" film about witchcraft, and it is not intended to teach us anything, except that love is the most powerful Magic of all, and never to use it as a controlling or vengeful method. This is a lesson to be learned by all, not just pagans. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, this film is wonderfully written and cutely performed by Kim Novak and the venerable Jimmy Stewart. <br /> <br /> Hermione Gingold presents a stellar performance in the role of Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with too many titles in the movie to mention, besides Miss Jane Mrumble from "Murder by Death"), was remarkable, as scattered but capable Miss Novak Quinnie's neighbor upstairs. Also starring Jack Lemmon (great performance) and Jim Kovach (brilliantly witty). <br /> <br /> "Witches can't cry." Why, they can not shed a single tear, because their heart is full of Magic. They have no time for stupid things, such as love. ”Queenie. <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and her brother Nikki (Jack Lemmon) are Manhattan witches. Covered deep in the secret underworld of artisans, they live among other New Yorkers as one of them, without causing a raised eyebrow. <br /> <br /> But then Shepard "Shep" Henderson (Stewart), a persistent, not stingy, dedicated businessman who is going to marry old rival Gillian, appears College. <br /> <br /> By a strange coincidence, he enters the building of Gillian and is instantly "bewitched I am her charisma and grace. Using Magick, with a little help from Pyucket (acquaintance Gillian trained by Robert E. Blair) and Queenie, Gillian starts working on this new handsome dream man to take revenge on his old enemy. <br /> <br /> But Magic should never be used either for control or for harm, and Gillian learns that this is the hard way in the most bitter and sweet way. Not only does she have to deal with what she did, but also with Shep in her fault. <br /> <br /> From a critical point of view; however, the film takes a serious turn: the effects are very outdated to such an extent as to be a clean camp. Some of the scenery seemed to have been removed in the basement of someone’s small house, but at least the characters were bizarre and funny. <br /> <br /> Personal note: Pjuaket stole the show. Great cat! Excellent training by Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> Like a note on trifles, these are the roots of a favorite enchanted television comedy series. This introduces the original of Samantha and Darrin. All characters notes are present and counted. You only need to look to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite pictures, and I often watch it. <br /> <br /> This movie got 9.1 / 10 from. .. <br /> <br /> Fiend:
