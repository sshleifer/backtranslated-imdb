In general, I fully enjoyed this film, but four things really stand out: Sam Raimi's perfect comic choice and acting as a deft (?) Man in the camp, Alan Arkin's excellent characterization for the camp owner and, most importantly, cinematography. The beautiful golden tones of the outer scenes draw me into a film, like a sunset on the lake - in my own summer memories. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and mood seem very natural and believable. Some reviewers criticize the absence of a deeper script. For me, this particular flaw makes this film work. Characters and their problems seem real, and therefore I care about what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that all the pieces come together to create a whole that seems right.
