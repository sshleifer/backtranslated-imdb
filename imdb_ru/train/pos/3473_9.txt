I admit that I had some trepidation when I first saw the preview for this film. VH-1 set foot on hollow ground? I mean, Harris and Quinn aren't really like or even like John or Paul. But I have to admit, this film really surprised me. This is far from the exploitation film I was expecting. Instead, it is a study of character, a discreet, capricious and ultimately bitter-sweet look at friendship and the final lesson we all learned: it is difficult, if not impossible, to capture what we once had and what passed past us
