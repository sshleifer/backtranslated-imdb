Sentimental and naive, but undoubtedly affecting, emotional request of a human assistant, in this case personified as German and French miners, forced to be closed from each other after the Great War from abroad, which led to the disappointment of the German side, as bosses French people. But when the fire begins on the French side, the general decency of German men leads to help, security and even friendship. It was a plea that had not been heard for a decade, since a certain man, for his part, Pabst would break this piece and turn the Great War into a mere prelude. But it’s obvious to me that Pabst really believes, or at least wants to hope for such a fundamental humanism, because this film radiates this optimism, while its more frivolous, cynical adaptation of The Trihedral Opera lacked the bite necessary for to make this work work. In addition, his sincere faith is also explained by the fact that the characters here are not simplified horns for posts, but real people, with real families, whose home life we ​​also have. These are ordinary people from the working class, who simply believe in the value of caring and proper attitude towards their neighbors, and on this day of individualistic opportunism, I will thin out of my conspiracy to get a positive message that represents a point of view to which I think we all can strive. <br /> <br /> (Note: obviously, the ending is cut out on most of the prints when the French restore the miner's gate, closing people again. This is a cruel turn of events, and could have made the film a better film overall, but I would complain that this will spoil the positive atmosphere of the final sequence, therefore, in short, I am glad that it was cut off.) {Rating: 8/10 (B) / No. 7 (out of 11) 1931}
