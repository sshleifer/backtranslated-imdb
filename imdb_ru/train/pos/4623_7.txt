Despite the rather obscene title, it is a light teenage drama. If you are not an old coot, you will probably find it enjoyable. However, this is not good for character development or situations. When you look at it, you have the feeling that you are running back and forth to the kitchen, even if you sit and watch all the time. This is one of those films that the characters really like and they are quite attractive. I know Jennifer Connelly is the heartbreaker of many, but I always liked the darker Maddy Corman. Teens get most of the time on screen without many intruders from these annoying adults. Is it just me or most of the young men who are very much alike?
