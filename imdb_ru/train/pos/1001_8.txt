Somewhat funny and dynamic fighter with Jamie Foxx as an unfortunate, fast-talking bully who is too demanding a US Treasury agent (David Morse) to release on the streets of New York to find a picky computer thief / hacker (Doug Hutchinson) who stole forty two million dollars and left two guards shot dead. <br /> <br /> Bait marks the sophomore of Antoine Fuqua (Replaceable Killers), and he does the task quite well, although she is not included in his first film. What unites these two films are action sequences that are excellent. <br /> <br /> Fox is very good here, although his character is annoying at the beginning, but throughout the whole movie I started to catch on. Hutchinson is marvelous as a mastermind who can be as ruthless as John Malkovich and as patient as the late Lawrence Olivier in the Marathon. Morse is fine, as an agent who came up with a brilliant plan to get someone who did it at all costs.
