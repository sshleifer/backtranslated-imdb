This film was excellent. The sad truth is that culture tends to conflict with the sexes. This is just one big warm fuzzy movie type. You have a master, rich in tradition and kind-hearted in his own way, Doggie, despite the fact that he is a girl who can conquer her feelings, and you complement him with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions. This is equivalent to the big happy movie at the end. This film shows well how steep traditions can be, so steep that they are ready to die without sharing their secrets. You see the sides of a culture that you have never seen before, which helps strengthen the drama that unfolds towards the end of the picture. Filming is great, in particular, a parade of discoveries with all participants. Must be in an Oscar competition for the best foreign film.
