Absolute classic !! The direction is impeccable, the acting is simply gorgeous. Words do not correspond to this great work. The most definite film about the Mumbai police. This film has stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Om Puri gives a stellar presentation, Smith Patil no less. All the actors did their best, and the film rushes to thrill you at any moment. This film shakes you terribly and makes you think about the many problems that our society faces. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a policeman (Om Puri), who began his career as an honest man, but ultimately degenerates into a murderer. The first attempt in Bollywood to hide behind the scenes and to reveal the depressing truth about the Mumbai police. Glory Nihalani !! <br /> <br /> After this film, many Bollywood films were released that exposed the connection between criminal politicians and the police. Thus, this film was really a trendsetter. This trend has dominated the Hindi film scene for more than ten years. <br /> <br /> This film was a moderate box office hit. <br /> <br /> Be sure to visit for the discerning movie fan.
