Yes, it was a bit low budget, but this film shows love! The only bad thing about this was that you can say that the budget for this film will not be compared with Water World, and although the plot was good, the film did not reveal its full potential! Strong performances from everyone, and the suspense makes it worth seeing on a rainy night.
