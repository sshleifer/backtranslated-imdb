Oh, it's so awesome to watch Silent Classic from time to time! Director Vidor is simply amazing and even acts in a long role (at least in 1928) as himself. This story is about how to succeed in life and how it changes you. Marion Davis plays a girl who leaves her friends in a small comedy studio to become part of a large "dramatic" studio. She becomes a big star, and as a result she really moves away from the real world. For a moment, she even denies her (poor) past! Cameos are just funny, of course the scene where the main character (Marion Davis) sees ... Marion Davies in the studio and concludes that she does not seem special ... This should be one of the first movies in the movie. the films are here, and for real freaks, it's great that then you could see the cameras and stuff. Be sure to take a look if you ask me!
