I love this film and have seen it quite a few times over the years. It gets better with every viewing. I agree with all the positive reviews here. Yes, it is gritty and cruelly realistic, as in those days there was life on the prairie. I found myself making comments when I watched it. Someone here said that Rip Thorn was wrong. I could not disagree more. He is gorgeous as a stern, miserly Clyde Stewart who speaks little and works like a slave / workhorse. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic, like the widowed Eleanor, whom Clyde hires as a housekeeper / cook (along with her 7-year-old daughter). Lilia Scala is superb as a distant neighbor named grandmother. Also star is the absolute prairie Montana. It is both a beautiful and cruel country in which to settle. There are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary. No special effects here, what you see is real! He even has an amazing musical score and a great script. When you see Heartland, you will never forget it. It deserves all the 10s he gets here.
