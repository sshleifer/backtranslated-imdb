I just thought it was excellent, and I still do. I am grateful that we can still see different things from the fact that Hollywood is almost flooding us. Rescuing Grace is smart and pleasant - for those who feel offended because of marijuana, it's better to go to the American brideâ€™s cinema. <br /> <br /> Grace Rescue also shows that a funny movie should not be stupid. I laughed at my ass for most of this, but also thought about what the main character had to do to pay off the debts of her late husband. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell - a witty storyline with typical English humor and good acting and directing. Could you ask for more. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
