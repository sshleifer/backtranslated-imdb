Dumland focuses on the life of one (American?) Family ... Father; cruel and obscene person who likes to fart and use profanity and does not have redemptive qualities. Mama; who seems paranoid psychotic, never says much. A son; vague annoying repetitive little guy. The animation is simple and cheese, but it suits the plot and characters. Episodes were originally available only from davidlynch.com, but now have been released on DVD. The DVD has 8 episodes and a brief overview: <br /> <br /> 1- Neighbor: We meet with a neighbor and find out about him three things ... he has a really good barn, he has only one hand, and he likes to do naughty things with ducks. <br /> <br /> 2- Treadmill: we find that the wife has a tendency to exercise, but the husband doesn’t really think that this is a great idea. In the end, the treadmill for exercise wins. <br /> <br /> 3- Doctor: father has an accident with a bare wire ... doctor's examination is quite thorough (if not unconventional), but the diagnosis is “you are perfectly normal” (but we knew it). <br /> <br /> 4- Visiting a friend: After a quarrel with a new lift for clothes, a friend comes to visit (believe it or not) there is one! but after we meet with him, we can understand why), it is not surprising when he tells us what his hobbies are. <br /> <br /> 5- Get a stick: we are meeting with another neighbor, he is stuck in the stick with his mouth (although we will never know how he got there). Unfortunately, removing a stick from a neighbor's mouth turns out to be more difficult (and more cruel) than expected ... but in the end he wins ... Jesus, some people may be ungrateful !!! <br /> <br /> 6. My teeth are bleeding: it was my favorite episode ... and it was the most tedious repetition and annoyance (hmm, what does that say about me ??). Not sure why my son started to bleed his teeth, but believe me when I say that this was minimal for the plot of the story. Which is an oxymoron, as the story had no plot. But she had a funny ending (with the participation of a fly) !! <br /> <br /> 7- Uncle Bob: After meeting with Uncle Bob and Uncle Bob’s wife, we have a distinct feeling that Dumblen’s gene pool is very small, Uncle Bob is a sick person (I won’t go into details not to spoil you this). Uncle Bob's wife definitely carries pants in his family ... and her father definitely turns out to be on the wrong side of her big fist (and spends the rest of her visit, crouching on a tree in the backyard). <br /> 8- Ants: After the ants got into the house, and the unsuccessful attempt to spray them was wrong ... he ends up spraying insect spray on his face and began to hallucinate. Ants arrange an incredible song and dance show ... he goes berserk, trying to kill them, turns out to be in a cast of the whole body ... and, let's say, the ants eventually take revenge. <br /> No matter how bad these stories are, there is something that made me watch them. They give a different insight into the mind of one of my favorite directors. David Lynch Maybe they were a way out for him to get rid of some of his cruel thoughts? I really laughed in many episodes. Many aspects are ridiculous!
