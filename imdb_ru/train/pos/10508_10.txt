You enter the world by viewing pictures. There are so many things to do and so many hours of gameplay, I donâ€™t understand how someone might not like this game. It's great. This launch title is a game that assured gamers that the N64 will have a good life. Every three-dimensional platform game we know of has something in common with SM64. Banjo Kazui and Banjo Tui are examples that are commonly used. Super Mario 64 is one of the greatest games in the history of 3D games. 10 out of 10. If you have an N64, buy this game. It's hard to find a used one, because no one sells this child for 5 bucks at a pawnshop. Ideal 10.
