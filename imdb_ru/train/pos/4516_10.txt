Since teaching Rita, Julie Walters has been one of my role models, and her performance in this capacity as a woman who helps a man she loves to harmonize with his female side is great. I would never have believed her character in the hands of a lesser actress, but Walters copes with it with pleasure and prank. Adrian Pasdar shows his best performance in the men's competition today.
