A sober, reflective piece, a small miniature that turns into a magnificent humane graphic sequence that goes beyond simple dramatization for the screen. This quiet little story will entice you - if you don’t have too many problems with different Spanish accents, from Mexican to Peruvian, and more authentic use of the Iberian Peninsula Marisa Paredes! Garcíadiego achieved the perfect adaptation of the novel: even the great maestro Garcia Marquez should be proud of his excellent work. And I take off my hat to Arturo Rapshtein, who so skillfully combined all his efforts into a gem, a ruby, and so refined, so elegant, so sensitive, so touching ..... <br /> <br /> El Coronel - Fernando Luján - is waiting to receive his pension, while he continues to live in his dilapidated forest, living deep in the Colombian jungle (however, filmed in a different place, not in Colombia) with his combat member and his wife (in this order? ). And that's all you need. <br /> <br /> But oh, much more ... This film is a rhapsody. <br /> <br /> I have to see this poetic little piece again as soon as possible. There is a high side of 8 out of 10, which is very high on my scale. <br /> <br /> These are not light commercial Hollywood things.
