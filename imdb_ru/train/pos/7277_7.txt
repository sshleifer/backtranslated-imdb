This is a strange film about an archaeologist studying the culture of ancient Indians hohokam. She takes a (really fake) mom out of the cave and brings her home to explore. Well, pretty soon, she begins to behave strangely and talk to this mom. And soon after this, her son becomes obsessed with the spirit of the mummy. Even stranger events occur when the spirit tries to destroy the family of a woman. In general, this is really TRUE, and it will make you fall asleep the first couple of times you try to see it. But if you continue this, you can just go to the end. <br /> <br /> Ahah! What is the secret of the mummy? Mom's spirit angry that he was removed from the cave? You may not be able to figure out what the motivation of the spirit is, but if you like the creepy machinations on the low-budget (and hairstyles of the 70s!), It will have a certain comforting appeal. <br /> <br /> The way I do this described story is much clearer than the chaotic, boring way in which a film tells a story. Can a boring movie really be fun? Well ... somehow this is achieved. Maybe it's a good movie at heart, but itâ€™s pretty awkward. I dont know. What I know is that I really liked it, despite its stupidity. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Spider Baby" will be interested to know that this movie uses a couple of musical replicas from this movie. (including instrumental version of the theme song). <br /> <br /> Shows one frightening and fairly well-made sequence showing possessed boulders and stones rolling around themselves and eventually attacking some people in the campsite. Other scenes in the film are just creepy or bizarre; but this scene is actually pretty scary. <br /> <br /> Look! It is strange and worth your time. You might even want one on your shelf.
