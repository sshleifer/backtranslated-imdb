It was the first film I've ever seen in Ashley Judd, and the first film of Victor Núñez that I’ve ever talked about, and boy, I’m glad I was shot. His “quiet tone”, his “calm pace”, “a realistic depiction of a young woman just starting out in life” ". the things, the people she meets - there's nothing wrong with this movie. It's as close to movie magic as I've ever seen outside of Star Wars films, and, considering what these films look like, this means that this film really deserves high praise. Ashley Judd's acting skills, the writing of Mr. Núñez and his wonderful simple story make this story a wonderful coming of age and a wonderful film.
