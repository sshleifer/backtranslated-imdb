I can't stop saying how much I loved this movie. This film is one of the least known and one of the funniest films I've ever seen. The film is about the exploits of the rap group NWH (Ni # $% rs with Hats). He goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group after its tragic collapse. Behind the group is the creator of documentaries Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> The film is on a limited budget, but it seems that it doesn’t matter, it’s a very well-made film, a well-made film, and all these actors and actresses perform well. The main strength of this film is the script, in this film there are so many bright lines and ups on rap that it is unreal. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> There are ups to real rappers such as MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey-Taste and songs (Booty Juice, Grab Your Dick and etc.) Grow Condiff made a great movie. In the film, he plays the rapper Ice Cold. The film does not come out, it is funny from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The film works so well because sometimes it becomes outlandish, but it reaches the point where it is funny without going too far. Listening to the three presenters, an attempt to tell some philosophy was one of the best parts of the film, for example, when Tone Def tells the producer the recording: “When you get on the bus, you get there,” and the producer answers: this is deep! <br /> <br /> A group depicting NWH has some kind of natural chemistry for them. They work so well together, and they manage to pull this film to a place where there is not a single week in the film. What really makes this movie so good is how true it is for some rap groups of the time. Many rap groups had problems with violence, with censors, and like the NWA, the group only became popular when the institution started doing a great deal of controversial lyrics. <br /> <br /> I like this movie because it is an offensive. There is something to offend everyone in a good-natured way. The film gained popularity with a large number of people outside of rap, the funniest creature from Spike Lee. Where they come from for this dialogue, I can not imagine. The film has line by line, in which you will roll on the floor. As I said, the script is just great. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that this film was released in limited edition. This is a clever, controversial and even thought-provoking film. This is too much for the mainstream, despite the fact that it is fun and almost flawless in its production. There are no major stars, but many familiar faces, including Mark Lawrence, who plays Tone Def. Watch this movie, at least you will definitely have an opinion about it.
