Gene Harlow and Clark Gable were a great team on screen and this could be their best movie together. <br /> <br /> Yes, “Hold Your Man” can be gentle and predictable, but I don’t like this movie. I like to see Harlow and Geible together, and in this film they are just wonderful. Obviously, they really enjoyed working together, and this is part of what makes this film so great. <br /> <br /> Witty dialogue, great screenplay and attention to detail are other things that make this movie so good. movie. I liked this movie when I first saw it, and with each subsequent viewing I always notice at least one new detail. For me, this is a sign of a great movie. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and screenplay is better than most films of this period (early 30s). I love classic films, but I admit that most of them are just average, and sometimes they don’t interest me. "Hold Your Man" is one of the exceptions. <br /> <br /> This is largely due to the fact that “Hold Your Man” is a film with a “pre-code”. (The Heys code was not applied until the expiration of the year after “Keep Your Man.”) This film could not be shot by code. Well, it could have been done, but it would have been a completely different story. Thank God, the code was not applied until 1934. Otherwise, we would have missed this gem.
