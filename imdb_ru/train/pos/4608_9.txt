Many film and martial arts fans see Jackie Chan as one of the greatest action movie stars who ever graced the silver screen, and the Police Story reinforced his reputation as the likely successor to the late great Bruce Lee. If “Enter The Dragon” exposed the so-called standard of greatness Lee in the 70s, then the same can be said about the “Police Story” and Jackie Chan in the 80s. <br /> <br /> Forget about the Rush Hour trilogy, or any of his efforts in the US - one film that truly embodies Chan's supremacy, not to mention the fact that he received the status of kung kicking, bone-breaking mascot Fu and his movie career, Police Story, is the first in a series of successful police films made on the mainland in modern Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> I have seen many of his works — for example, Rush Hour in the USA, Rumble in the Bronx, Medallion and Tuxedo by Name — and, frankly, many of them turn pale compared to police history . In these films we saw a less “stupid” version of Jackie, from which it was not possible to make the most of his fighting abilities, not to mention that the combat sequences were not as good as in such efforts as the Drunken Master, Police Story, to to name <br /> <br /> The tricks in this film are extraordinary and are best shown in any action movie. The scene in the mall is literally one of a kind, and you need to believe in it: flying glass shards, Chan, who is left to hang outside the bus just for his cane, when the mad man frantically drives through the streets of the city, and Chen successfully used all kinds of inanimate objects and assistive devices as a weapon to fight the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Considering that he is known for injuring and breaking every bone in his body and endangering himself, Jackie’s perseverance in demonstrating his versatility as a stuntman, not relying on him, is a kind of testimony to his reputation as an expert on kung fu. Especially since he has bruises to show it. Thus, he proved that he is not alone in his tricks when it comes to developing and inventing various and clever moves. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to talk about, but what is this lack of narration, he compensates for his consistent actions and sequences of struggle. As for the dialogue, this is not a very big aspect of the film, so most fans of Jackie and martial arts films are more interested in action, not history. <br /> <br /> Unlike, say, The Matrix, there are no wires or CGI, or any computer tricks. What you see is what you get - and what you get with the Police Story - this is Jackie Chan's great epic, full of action and throbbing tricks. He is much better than Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour and all his other American efforts. /> <br /> Police Story is a great movie, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is an aspiring Jackie Chan fan, but does not know which movie is worth watching first.
