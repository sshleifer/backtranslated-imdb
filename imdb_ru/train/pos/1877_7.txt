Arthur Bach is clearly unhappy in his life as a multimillionaire, and he is attracted to people "below him" in the social position - he pays for the prostitute in the first scenes, and then extremely attracted to the shoplifter. /> He also drinks a lot, and sometimes he also drives behind the wheel, which, of course, is not funny, never. <br /> <br /> The film is excellent, but behind the comedy there is also some kind of reality. John Gilgud wipes the floor with everyone else on the screen and created a character for the ages. Talk about a worthy Oscar. Moore and Minnelli have their moments, but his Gilgud as Hobson you will remember the most.
