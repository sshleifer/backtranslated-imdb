This documentary makes you travel around the world. It contains rare and terrific sequels from the desert. It shows how diversified and fragile our planet can be. The future of the polar bear is highlighted at the beginning and at the end. After all, his dark future is closely linked to the effects of global warming. This documentary, however, is a simplified approach to such a serious environmental issue. However, it can be easily seen for small children, as it basically remains descriptive. Scientists may well be disappointed, since this is not a remake of Al Gore's documentary film "Inconvenient Truth", but to be honest ... what a description !!! Then the question may arise: is it worth preserving the beauty of our world? Because this documentary proves that in 2007 such beauty still exists, despite various pollution. Living in cities and towns, we tend to forget that we are an integral part of this nature. All the things covered in this documentary remind us that we have a common treasure called “EARTH”.
