This stylistically challenging visual game is a story inside a story. The main character screenwriter Bart Klever, who fights hard with his new text ?? at the same time, the script of the film that we are watching. In the film, does Bart play the scriptwriter who writes the film script ?? Bart's struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme, as well as the environment of the apartment, where he works and takes care of his little girl. The intimate setting offers ample opportunities for playing illusions, including space, light, colors, and a couple of cats. Outwardly, the simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of the text, which is constantly affected by the intervention of the director, who appears on the computer monitor and serves as a counterpoint to the changing similarity environment. The constantly changing viewing angle complicates the answers to the questions that arise: what is “truth” and what is “illusion”? Which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest? Can anything serve as a primary reference point in the narrative space?
