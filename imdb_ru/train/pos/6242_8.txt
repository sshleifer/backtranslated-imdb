I agree with the previous comment in the title of the content of the film “Everyday Madness,” but I would like to point out that “Dog Days” is how women are treated in (male) society. The episodes that we see here show some differences in the daily discrimination of women, mainly by age groups. There is an older man who makes his new partner look and act like his late wife, treating her like a doll, which should behave “worthy of wearing” the dress of the first. There is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship she is almost a slave, and he (the cruel) master. In addition, we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friend / wife and, instead of being really jealous of her affairs, even befriends his competitor (s). A young adult man makes it clear to his friend - a girl who is really concerned that he has enough - that she should be a decoration for him and follow his narrow rules of etiquette. Finally, there is a man of about fifty who, counting on his advantage, delivers an ingenious woman to hitchhiker to an enraged client, who - taking her for blame for scratching his car - naturally beats her. To complete the examples, we find this man’s friend in the “master slave” - after collective violence against her - threatening and humiliating the former “for her sake” because she gets rid of her partner and accepts herself as her new “master”. At the same time, residents of the newly built block, in which the action takes place, are resting under the scorching summer sun - absolutely motionless (sic!). Unfortunately, I did not see the last minutes of this shocking and genuine depiction of the archaic structures that still dominate the relationship between women and men, but what I saw convincingly analyzed the discrimination repertoire. Probably a useful tool in teaching even the less sensitive viewer to what is going wrong - due to good visualization.
