An early film of Kazan noir received an Oscar. Some of the reviews presented here tell in detail about the film and its symbolism and rate it very highly. I almost see where they come from. But I prefer to use a more restrained approach to a long-forgotten film, which seems to have been filmed almost without a budget and in a quasi-documentary form. In the streets of New Orleans, pulmonary plague is common, and a military doctor (Widmark) and a city detective (Douglas) can detain the main carrier (Palance). The film is capricious, shot in black and white and uses locations very well. Widmark is, as always, wonderful. Forget about symbolism (crime equals disease, and illness equals crime) and just enjoy the chase. It is not always easy to watch a film like this now when we are in the new century, because it has a particular style that was very short (after World War II until the early 1950s) and is unlikely to be of interest to the casual audience . For those who will watch this for the first time, sit tight for a big chase at the end. This is something else, and to be honest, I donâ€™t know how they shot it. I can say that it probably took as much time to shoot the final as the first 90 percent of the film.
