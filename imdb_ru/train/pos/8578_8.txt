This film is one of the best American B-films of the 90s. If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for some kind of action, a lot of laughter and insecurity that the police are fighting gangsters, this is worth a look. Everyone chews up the scenery a bit, but that's really what the film is about, and everyone's pretty funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow are good at chemistry and should make another movie together.
