One of the most relevant and exciting documentaries you have ever seen. Although the story takes place in the capital of Venezuela, Caracas, it gives a deep look at the political dynamics that prevails throughout the western hemisphere. Although this film is, in fact, another chapter in the history of the “US-backed Latin American coup”, this film tells in real time what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity, political knowledge and courage! <br /> <br /> The political ideas offered by this film are invaluable. There are clear examples of private media as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda. We see the poor of Caracas struggling with the cruel realities of "American politics." The impending doom is clearly felt if people cannot cope with the blatant tyranny that was suddenly and unlawfully imposed on them by the conspirators. We also see the arrogance and fascism of private media supported by the CIA, plutocrats and generals who agreed to return Venezuela to the power of Washington. Despite the able leadership of President Hugo Chavez, the inhabitants of Caracas are forced to act without him, after Chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals. Their answer is the main thing in the film. If someone is looking for an excellent portrait of what the US government is, Hugo Chavez and revolutionary Venezuela, then this is a movie!
