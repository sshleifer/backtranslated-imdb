"Ice Age" is not only the animation of the year (in my opinion), it is also the best animation function I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> Teaser excited me last year, and I spent many happy hours on the Website. Scrat is cool! Like the rest of the Sub Zero heroes. <br /> <br /> Animation is awesome. Your heart really goes to the characters in this movie. They have good lines of dialogue and are well developed. It is difficult to say who is really stealing a picture. <br /> <br /> I survived their journey with laughter, tears and surprise. Nothing was forced or completed. Emotion was sincere, especially in the second dramatic half. The last film that deeply influenced me was Anastasia in 1997, also Fox Fox. And before that, it was the Earth Before the Time of 1988. All have real charm and seek to entertain all viewers, not just cynics. 10/10 <br /> <br />
