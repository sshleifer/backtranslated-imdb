An amazing film, which, in theory, should be boring, but is demonstrated with subtlety and incredible game, which I so desperately tried to find. Instead of relying on clich√©s and overly dramatized moments, the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. The main characters are not perfect, and therefore it is easy to treat them as people you know. The film does not attempt to cause laughter or push the ideal to the audience, but simply shows us the possibility of true love in any circumstances. <br /> <br /> I am now anxiously waiting for the weekend to see the sequel. A moving, thought-provoking, funny look at love, which, I think, should be an absolute romantic classic there with Casablanca and breakfast at Tiffany's. It will soften even the hardest heart.
