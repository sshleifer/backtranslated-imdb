Irresistible and Innovative! At the start of this criminally underrated film Whoopi Goldberg, the screenwriters draw a parallel between Theodore Rex and the 1941 classic Orson Wells film “Citizen Kane”. Authors have the right to make such a seemingly scattered parallel, but viewers are too often deceived to see an over-promoted Hollywood slok to appreciate the subtle similarity between these two films. In Citizen Kane, Charles Foster Kane is afraid and admired by his colleagues and subordinates who are very similar to Whoopi Goldberg in this film. This film is about the search for love in all respects. This is an epic study of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society dominated by greed and self-absorption. No matter who was paired with Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex, over the centuries a dyad has been compiled, the only valid comparison being Gods and Bacall, Hepburn, Tracy, Hall and Oates. If you would like to observe the sublime, celluloid philosophical study of some of the deepest motivations of mankind; Bergman-esqe, but not so depressing, Theodore Rex should be considered immediately!
