A group of American students and their mentor decided to visit the ugliest part of Ireland to study ancient religious rites. Despite the fact that they were repeatedly warned about the dangers of deviation from the beaten track (local creepy Irishman, natch), they do just that and find themselves inside with the kind permission of the family of inbred cannibals (descendants of the infamous Scot Bean clan , raised sticks from Scotland and settled on the Emerald Isle). <br /> <br /> If you think that porn stars plus low-budget horror automatically make up a ton of nudity and terrible Acting, then think: “Evil Breed” is replete with adult stars, but in fact nakedness is not as much as expect, given the "talent", and acting, although far from being worthy of Oscar, is not all. bad (with the exception of Ginger Lynn Allen, who, as we know, can do amazingly “in French”, but whose Irish is lousy). <br /> <br /> Evil Breed opens in excellent style with a cruel slaughter of several lovers tourists: after a short sex under a canvas, the silicone beauty pulled out of a tent and tore it in half; the guy has his arms and legs cut off and he's grilled on a spit. This is a very creepy start, and it bodes well for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after this promising start, everything starts to deteriorate seriously: we meet the main characters, an annoying group of twenty-something years, just begging to become a cannibal chow-chow, and suffer a significant loss of time in the form some terrible false fears, a lot of lies about the murderous Druids from the local Irish eccentric Gary (Simon Peacock) and, worst of all, some subcrimatic, postmodern talk about horror film conventions (how clever!). <br /> <br /> Then, as if the film will never get better, director Christian Viel takes a serious decision: the guy gets the knife rammed through his head, and there are gratuitous sex-in-soul scenes featuring beautiful blonde Gillian Leigh (not a porn star , but I'm sure there is a career waiting there, if she wants it). After that, everything improves quickly when cannibals start to work at the highest level, and the film turns into a real bloodbath: Gary stuffs a machete ass (around time!) And suffocates in the intestines; Ginger Lynn kikboksiruet mutant; Jenna Jameson is torn, gutted, and her silicone breast implant is gnawed by a confused cannibal; the guy is beheaded with cheese wire; and Taylor Hayes is bloody, bruised and naked with dead fruit between his legs (obviously, she was caught and used as breeding cattle). <br /> <br /> All this is so terribly awful that it makes you sit through less interesting material and earn Evil Breed a final rating of 7/10. <br /> <br /> nb. Very problematic production and studio intervention led to the fact that Christian Wil eventually abandoned the project. Repeated surveys were made, and blood was severely curtailed for release in the United States. The good news is that, although the film isn’t going as well as it could have been, and cursed by a terrible end, the British DVD (the version I was watching) seems to have remained relatively untouched with regard to splashing (only 13 were cut from the movie total).
