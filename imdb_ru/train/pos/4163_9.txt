I saw it as a child in the late eighties, and I must say that the Galaxy Express is one of those films that will remain in your mind for a long time. If you have never understood the attractiveness of anime, then the discovery of this film can be your golden ticket to the city of Otaku. <br /> <br /> The story is as delicate and poetic as the Blade Runner by Ridley Scott. Cell animation, although somewhat traditional, has a vivid style that explosively depicts Leiji Matsumoto's great talent for character design and visual narration. <br /> <br /> This is one of those unique children's films like Star Wars, Dark Crystal and The Wizard of Oz, which completely surpasses the status of family entertainment and is itself a classic of cinema. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
