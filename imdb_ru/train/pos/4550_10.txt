Daniel Day-Lewis - the most versatile actor of the living. English aristocratic snob in “Room with a View”, passionate Irish thief in the name of the Father, arrogant, brutal butcher in “The Bands of New York” (in the performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody’s in “The Pianist”) with cerebral palsy in the left leg (just to name a few). All his roles influence each other, but each of them is separate and completely unique. He changes completely with each character he takes. And I begin to believe that he can act as he pleases. Anything. <br /> <br /> Like Kristi Brown, he's awesome. He does not make fun of the character, and he does not pity the character. Difficult achievement. And Christy Brown comes to life. Clever man. Outrageous person. Person. <br /> <br /> This film, despite the small mistakes of a scene transition and the like, is a source of inspiration. Yes, it is predictable. But is it silly sentimental? I laughed I cried. Not a minute of cheese. Proof that this is not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is a restaurant scene when Christie discusses artists with Aileen, Peter and her friends. That's where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches the apogee of acting. "I will hit you in the only part of your anatomy that is animated." "Wheel crippled!" And his work never slows down, never hesitates and is beautiful. Simply. He has a lot of screen time here. I watch it again, and I never get tired of Christie’s penetrating eyes, twitching and guttural speeches. <br /> <br /> Must see. Fo sho, hey!
