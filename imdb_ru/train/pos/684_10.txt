I grew up on this series. I was about seven / eight years old when it was turned on. I still remember the 1st episode, which was called “New Home”. It scared me! I almost still hear this statue, laughing madly. And the end, my God! The spirit of the choir comes to the room for the child: Yikes! It was a classic television, and it was a one-of-a-kind series. I found a DVD collection for sale online: 2 in fact. My question to any reader: did anyone buy this kit? This is a bootleg. Both sellers claim to have a very good copy. I have a sketchy and bad DVD with the episode "New Home", and several other episodes that are a little better, however, if anyone knows how clearer they are, I should have bought and shared with my Children. Excellent series, smart, scary and boldly supernatural. Thanks in advance to all the fans who have something bad. In fact, I would love to discuss this. Chris Walker
