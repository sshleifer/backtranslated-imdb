After reading a few comments, I felt that I needed to add two more cents. “Lost Sadness” is one of the most memorable shorts I've ever seen. I got the chance to see it at the independent film festival in New York. I felt that this film was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complex - especially in such a short period of time. The story focuses on a young girl who was the victim of her abusive father. Soon she is given the opportunity to “stop” him with a demon played by Erik Etebari from Sorcery. After watching the show, I was surprised at how he played such a unique and different character. I never knew that he could act so well! His character was very complex, and he was very persuasive. Acting was absolutely excellent on his part. The girl was all right, and her father was all right. There is also death in it that follows the girl until she can escape from her future. The effects and cinematography were just awesome. I wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand dollars for it. It is rare to see such a quality short. The discovery was absolutely fascinating, comparable to any major feature film. This is not to say that it is not without its flaws - I thought it took a little time, and the introduction was a bit long. But it stuck in my head a few days after watching. Very few shorts with this level of quality.
