This is the scenario Ed Wood has been working on for over 10 years trying to succeed. Aris Iliopoulos finally got the nerve to shoot the script that Wood saved from his burning house at the expense of other, more fleeting values. <br /> <br /> This is a film without dialogue, which some might foolishly call silent. In fact, this is a rather noisy movie, without the insane chatter of most films. In the hands of these filmmakers, musical and sound effects provide a rich sound that works better than any character in a Hollywood screenwriting mill, especially in that stupid boat movie that last time had Billy Zane (“Watch out!”, “Oh no! "- J. Cameron ... Ik ...) In this film I will at any moment accept Zayn's surprisingly communicative monosyllabic grunt for empty dialogues. <br /> <br /> Billy Zayn leads a team of players who obviously wanted to be in this film. Ricci shines as always, and the gods shine when you can put Sandra Bernhard, Rick (y) Schroeder, Eartha Kitt and Andrew McCarthy on the same poster. <br /> <br /> The design is perfect, the pyramid set is exquisite, and Ron Perlman’s monstrous performance is simply wonderful. In general, it is a chaotic, intuitive masterpiece, created with love by Ed Wood, Jr. fans, author and cinenephile. Anyone who really loves movies should see what first-class Iliopoulos and his actors do. The film that makes you want you to do it yourself.
