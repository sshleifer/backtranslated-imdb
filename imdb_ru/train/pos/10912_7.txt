"Ex-Mrs. Bradford" (1936), starring the star of the series "Thin Man" William Powell (this film was released the same year as the second film about Thin Man, "After The Thin Man"), very close to the duplication of fun and style. from the films about Thin Man, but nevertheless he misses. However, this is an amazingly funny, very interesting murder mystery in the same comic way. <br /> <br /> Is Myrna Loy missing? Of course, we will not lie. However, I would hardly have called a better replacement than Gene Arthur. And the chemistry between Arthur and colleague William Powell is real, and it is fun, romantic and attractive. <br /> <br /> History and script James Edward Grant (Angel and the Villain) Anthony Vieller and partner of the production company John Wyne (Angel and the Villain) is close to being there with the effort of the Thin Man, but he lacks the ability and hiss. <br /> <br /> Although it is not included in the stratosphere of Thin Man films (what else?), Former Mrs Bradford is one of the most interesting and Dozens of mysterious comedies of the 30s and 40s.
