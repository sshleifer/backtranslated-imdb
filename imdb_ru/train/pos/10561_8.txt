089: Footlight Parade (1933) - released 9/30/1933, viewed 5/05/07. <br /> <br /> Ice cream cone invented in New York. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: After a long and tense break, we are playing another Busby Berkeley musical from Warner Bros. This time it’s the ultra-fast Footlight Parade, starring James Cagney as producer for Chester Kent's Jagernout. I am 100% sure that Cagney sent Berkeley to his performance as an irresistible Kent, who every minute has to come up with new ideas for speeches. Joan Blondell is also excellent as an acid secretary who has become love. The plot of Ruby Keeler / Dick Powell this time is not so important, but no less pleasant. One thing that confused me was Berkeley’s own performances, which seemed too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage, not to mention a stage that would show the film afterwards. Obviously, Busby does not allow trifles like a story to prevent him from collecting the most incredible musical numbers that he can come up with. I liked almost this whole film to the very end, with the shamelessly offensive number “Shanghai Lily”, which, as you might guess, twists its stomach in the same way as racially unpleasant performances. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Six films in three months. Must be a new record. In any case, this completes Warner Bros. the musical trilogy of 1933, preceding the "42nd Street" and "Gold miners of 1933". I definitely recommend watching all three in a row. Interestingly, James Cagney broadcast Busby Berkeley when he played Chester Kent in this film, or the role, as written, was inspired by Busby. I hope it was; it seems to make sense that Berkeley is the type of guy who would see difficult dancing in everyday situations like Chester. The funny thing about Cagney was that he didn’t look like a leading man in the traditional sense. He was 5'7 "square, and spoke with a strange New York accent. But the guy was quite versatile, coming out of poisonous gangsters who made him so famous for the quickly speaking types of producers we see here. And he could dance. By Essentially, he was the lead man in the character actor's body. The rest of the cast has familiar faces: Joan Blondell returns and almost steals the show in the role of loyal and passionate secretary Cagney; Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler play a pretty couple, but it seems she has less screen time Meni than before, Billy Barty reappears as a mischievous little imp. The film is typical of more colorful and adult-oriented pre-code era musicals, unlike the 50s and 60s musicals, which were more family-oriented, and this is a great The culmination of Warner's musicals of that year (the number “Shanghai Lil” does not stand up, Keeler does not do well with finding Chinese). <br /> <br /> Last movie: Dinner at eight (1933). Next movie: I'm not an Angel (1933).
