The God! Zorro was about the same number of films as Tarzan, and probably the same number of actors were in the lead role. <br /> <br /> This series is one of my personal favorites, and, as already mentioned, this is one of the top 5 sound series. Oddly enough, this is one of the works that came out in 1939. * By the time of the production in 39, Zorro was really known as a literary and cinematic character. The film begins with a short note on the history of Mexico’s struggle for freedom from the rule of the European monarchy, namely Spain. The story offers a comparison with the American Revolutionary War. <br /> <br /> This story focuses on the mythical province of San Mendelito and its Council. Benito Juárez ** addresses him with the question of the attitude of their gold mine to the new Republic of Mexico. Supplies of gold must be delivered to Mexico City. <br /> <br /> Don Francisco Uncle in Diego Vega states that he organized a group of patriots acting as a defensive force for gold convoys. The bandit with Don del Del Orobovets is “insulting” himself and challenges Don Francisco to a duel with swords. Don Frascisco runs. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, a swordsman in dark clothes in a mask begins to fight with swords and cuts the trademark 'Z' on the bad guy's face, he sends him to the afterlife. Don Francisco dies with a sigh in front of his charge Ramon (William Corson) that Zorro is his nephew from the city of Los Angeles. He also tries to tell about the true identity of Don del Oro, but it expires before the application is completed. <br /> <br /> Diego has a great reception at Hacienda Don Francisco, where Diego disappoints his sister Ramona (also ward Don Francisco) with his timid deed. “FLOOR !!” she announces. <br /> <br /> Later Diego and Ramon run off to join the volunteer meeting. When they ask: "Who will lead us to the dead Don Francisco?", Ramon declares: "Zorro, we are the fighting legion of Zorro!" Well, there is a big battle with the Legion, now everyone is dressed in gray, with masks and capes protecting the Golden Train. Then Zorro seems to be trapped by an artificial avalanche intended for a convoy, when, well, you know the end of the cliff of the first chapter. <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a lot of writing for one chapter, but, like for most other TV shows, the initial part is longer and has a lot of basics for creating a storyline. Let's just allow ourselves to say that there are 11 more good, well-made, action-filled chapters that follow. <br /> <br /> In the “Fighting the Legion” ZORRO there are all the elements that are created for the action of the top cliffhanger. We have an unknown evil leader who incites problems between different groups. There are many suspects as to who was really behind the Don Del Oro mask. We had soldiers, white renegades, hostile Indians and Legion. In short, it is safe to say that this series has everything that can be, and then some. And, by the way, they wisely choose that the actors do not affect any Mexican accents. <br /> <br /> What is it that makes the ZFL stand out among the rest? What makes it unique or unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> Firstly, it has a much more complex and exciting musical score that emphasizes drama and action on the screen. The opening theme even appears in the performance of the flamenco guitar in Cantina in the first chapter. This is probably the only time that such a highly specialized innovation appears in a serial audio track. <br /> <br /> Yet there is another feature that really distinguishes the Fighting Legion saga from the rest. That is, the film has not only a heroic musical theme, but also sports lyrics, yes, the legionaries sing! We hear them singing in the opening credits and in several chapters! It really works well and adds the sensations that we get from viewing. <br /> <br /> When the series was first shown on our local television (circa 1955), the whole gang immediately recognized the voice of Reed Hadley as belonging to Captain Braddock of RACKET SQUAD, the series. Mr. Hadley had a very distinctive, deep voice. *** He also coped well with the role. His suit and especially the elongated mask looked very good and probably were very functional. <br /> <br /> A small bug. This kind of insignificant anachronism arises from the fact that Benito Juárez (Carlton Young) refers to the Council of San Mendelito, since Juárez was about 18 years old (1824), and although later he was probably the greatest figure in Mexican history he undoubtedly has not yet achieved such fame. His inclusion in the story was probably to make money on the Warner Brothers JUAREZ release that year in which Paul Mooney played the main role. <br /> <br /> This is not only my choice as the top 5 sound series, but also my favorite film about Zorro. <br /> <br /> * We are reminded of the great harvest of the best films about flying this year, about which "Gone With the Wind" Mrs. Smith goes to Washington, Citadel, Juarez, The Wizard of Oz, Mice and Men, A million BC. e., ZENOBIY, WE WANT OUR MUMMY, all of this ranked as the weekend this year. <br /> <br /> ** Once again, Juárez reached no national significance until around 1850, about 25 years later. In addition, political divisions are referred to as “Provinces” in history. In fact, they are called "states". Just as we are called the United States of America, south of the border, they call their Republic of Mexico. <br /> <br /> *** Reed Hadley was noticeable in some very “A” scenes. in which his richly toned voice is used for good effect. Watch and listen to his narration in the HOUSE ON 92nd STREET (1945) and THE HUDALKANALNY DIARY (1945).
