I would like to know why John Amos left the show, and how did he die from the show again? I could not relate to everything, but sometimes they encountered problems that they encountered. By the way, did they ever get out of the ghetto? I think the black Jesus episode was my favorite. We should see their experience at some good times. something they didn't have very often. I would like them to return the show. In the daytime so that people can stay on their feet to look. I don't think a movie or a new show will work. Especially without the original cast. They really made Good Times GoodTimes. These are my questions and comments. Thank you!!
