It was the second entry in the regular series of Colombo, and today it is well kept. Since now I can look at it closely on DVD and see how it is built, I was very impressed by the leadership of Bernard L. Kowalski (who led the great MACHO CALLAHAN and countless television episodes) - see how the killer’s actions after the murder are shown on two screens with the split screen effect, see how the killing itself is shown in an assembly way, look at the frame from the point of view of the corpse. In addition, the wild, but impressive avant-garde musical score from the famous jazzman Gil Mella was incredible and very helpful in creating an atmosphere. And the performance of Brett Halsey as a golf professional was great - such subtlety and complexity in the role that nine out of ten times would be a one-dimensional cut. The “formula” has not yet been established when this episode was filmed, so there are still some surprises in the Colombo methods. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp and Ray Milland are top-quality actors, and it's nice to see how they work — all men are familiar with many other roles, but lose themselves in their characters. In general, this entry in the Colombo series - and MANY others - is as good as a very good feature film.
