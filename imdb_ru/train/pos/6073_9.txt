My college professor says that Othello is probably Shakespeare's greatest drama. I don't know if I agree with him yet. I bought this video version of the movie. At first I love Kenneth Bran as Iago, he was very difficult and worked very well in this adaptation. Surprisingly, he did not manage this, but played a role. Laurence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare just like British actors. not that there was a problem for the British against the American about it. In fact, if we all work together, then Shakespeare will be able to reach the masses that he fully deserves. Besides the other tragedies of Shakespeare, this is due to race. What existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could be better and show the complexity of their union together. While Othello loves Desdemona with all his heart, he is weak to jealousy and afraid to lose her because of a Moorish man such as Cassio. This is a pretty good scene at the end of the movie, but I will not reveal the ending. It's just worth seeing. I think they edited most of the lines in 2 hours, but they always edit Shakespeare.
