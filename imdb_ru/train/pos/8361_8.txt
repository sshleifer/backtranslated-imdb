I had mixed feelings for Les Valseuses (1974), written and directed by Bertrand Bleier when I started watching it, but in the end I liked it. I would not call it vulgar ("Stupid and Dumber" - vulgar, "The Sweetest" - and vulgar, and unforgivably silly); I would call it shocking and offensive. I can understand why many viewers, especially women, did not want or even hated it. This incarnation of misogyny (or, it seems, so), and how two antiheroes treat every woman they meet seems incredible. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that for some reason this looks like a delightful little gem. I am fascinated by how Blière managed to get away with it. The film is very interesting and very pleasant: it is well written, the acting skills of all are first class, and the music is sweet and melancholic. In fact, when I think about it, two friends did something good for the women they encountered: they prepared a woman on the train (sweet, obedient blonde Bridget Fossey, who began her film career with one of the most impressive debuts in “Forbidden Games” by Rene Clement (1952) at the age of 6 to meet her husband, whom she had not seen for two months, they found a man who was finally able to make the frigid Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) go out and be satisfied; they enlightened brought up a young and very ready Isabel Huppert (in one of her early appearances on the screen.) Their meeting with Jean Moreau brings this comedy to a tragic level. In short, I'm not sure that I would like to meet Jean-Claude Gerard Depardieu and Piero Patrick Dever in real life and invite them to dinner , but I had a good time watching the movie, and almost two hours went by - it was never boring,
