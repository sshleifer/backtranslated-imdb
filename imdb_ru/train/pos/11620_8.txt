Great little thriller. I was expecting some stupid horror movie, but I got a tough short thriller that doesn’t waste our time. In most of these films, we have to go into the history of the characters, so that we feel sympathy or hatred for them when people start killing. about such nonsense here. Yes, you see several characters, but they really only interact with principals. For example, a husband’s wife in a motel whose number has been canceled. We saw them in order to understand how effective Liza’s character was and how ineffective the new clerk was at the hotel. We see a little girl simply because she will play a very small, but important role later in the film when everything is damn split. Flight Atrendants, because we need, in particular, to move the plot forward. The bad guy especially needs her at the beginning of the flight. The rude guy at the airport was also important to the movie. The only two characters who were only 5 aircraft and did not make sense for the plot, were two young guys in the plane. It was smart, because I thought they would have something to do with the plot. From the first scene to the last - a female character, led by a young hotel manager named Lisa. Even when Jackson shows her true colors, she does not panic. She thinks she can do to stop time. Any other film that smart female performers will behave like idiots. But not this one. It was a very short film, and I was waiting for the appearance of conventional plot devices, because the film seemed to end quickly. Fortunately, none of them was used. The new clerk at the hotel did not call, as usual, and told her what to do: panic, hung up and ran out of the hotel without saying anything, or ask your boss and tell her that she needed to drink a lot and just fire make more such films. Also one last comment. Brian Cox in the film, but I had no idea who he was. I had to come here to see that he is the father of Lisa. He is completely unrecognizable.
