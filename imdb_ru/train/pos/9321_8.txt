As romantic comedies go, it was sweet and winning. I thought the letter might be better to create a final connection a little better, but this is not a huge trigger point. But Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf give great performances and are more charming than ever. These are my two favorite actors, and I was just happy to see them in romantic roles. I hope to see them soon in other projects. <br /> <br /> In general, this film will not change your life, but it is pleasant, warm and winning. Not bad to be at all.
