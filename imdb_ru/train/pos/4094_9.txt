For anyone who has seen only the colorful and animated version of Disney Productions “Beauty and the Beast” or even the surrealistic fairy-tale vision of Jean Cocteau, this French (but with a director from Poland) version of 1975 will be stunned. with a good english family family. The main catch is that the bridegroom carries an ancient curse on the family. The film also includes many sequences of memories (potentially) explaining this family curse. From the initial credits to the very end, this is almost a non-stop erotic trip to a fun house with some VERY explicit and graphic sex content (hence the rating of the film in the US in its original show, which is not currently appreciated). A somewhat contemptuous film in the ruling class will probably remind one of Bunuel’s flights to similar territory. If you have a taste for truly strange things, and you are not offended by the “taboo” material, then this film may simply scratch this itch.
