I really thought they did an * excellent * job, there was nothing wrong with that, I donâ€™t know how the first commentator could say it was terrible, it brought me to tears (I think it caused everyone to tears) I try not to cry in the film, because it's embarrassing, but this one got me. That was sooo good! I hope they release it on DVD, because I will definitely buy a copy! I feel that this renewed my faith and gave me hope, which I cannot explain, it made me want to strive to become better, they experienced so much, and we believe that we take it for granted. Compared to this, I feel that our own trials are nothing. Well, nothing, but they hardly correspond to what they had to go through. I like it. Who played Emma ?!
