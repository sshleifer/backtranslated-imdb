Moon Child with Japanese rockers Hyde and Gactt in the lead role was a better movie than I expected. In fact, I was very impressed, and he immediately became one of my favorite films. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film unfolds in Mallepe, which tells about a group of street orphans, Sho, brother Sho Shinji and Toshi, who rob and kill. earn a living. On one of the robberies, Shaw collides with the vampire Cade, who is burning in the sun. Through rude events, Kayâ€™s true nature is revealed, but no one escapes him. <br /> <br /> Time passes and implies that the immortal, immutable Kei raised Sho, and both have an extremely close relationship. Then Sho and Kay face the Son in an outrageous shootout, and they quickly become friends. Both Kay and Hyde fall in love with Sona's sister, Yi-Che. <br /> <br /> Time runs ahead again and shows adult Sho, this time devoid of Kay. It also explains that Sho and the Son became enemies. <br /> <br /> Through the tragedy after the tragedy, this film is immersed in the reality of life and all its difficulties, focusing on friendship and love. This is really a touching film, which is sad, but at the same time beautiful. <br /> <br /> As for acting, I think Gack did a great job. Hyde did an amazing job for the first timer. <br /> <br /> The shots were beautiful, but there were really rare and short horrible shots in the film. <br /> <br /> In general, I have to say this film is amazing, touching, and I highly recommend it.
