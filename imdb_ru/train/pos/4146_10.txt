Anyone who has survived the era of the Revenge of the Botanists and Girls will appreciate this film. This is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a “spring break movie”, plus it makes fun of the student film genre. Funny, he has the cast (Amy Poehler! Rachel Dratch! Sophie Monk! Parker Posey! Jane Lynch! Amber Tamblin! Missy Pyle!), And it is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. Writer / actor Rachel Dratch is a comic genius, and Sophie Monk is such a great villain. Wilson Phillips! OH MY GOD! (I just repeat now ...) It will live with girls who love Miranda Julie, but they feel they are eating ice cream and pretending that they are stupid.
