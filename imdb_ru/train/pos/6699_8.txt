When Sabrina first appeared on our screens, I was about 12 years old, and so I spent my teenage years watching how a teenage witch gets into all kinds of weird difficulties. <br /> <br /> This has always been one of my favorite programs, the witch feeling of the sixties sitcom “Sorceress,” but this time the character was cooler. I always liked Sabrina because she was smart. She was also friendly and relaxed, which made her enjoyable to watch. The characters in the beginning were great; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, master quiz, Salem and Mr. Poole (my personal favorite, shame, he left so early) Hilda and Zelda, her aunt started well, but then they became annoying. <br /> <br /> I liked Mr. Craft too, as he was always a little closer to revealing the secret of Sabrina. What I liked about the first three series was the original ideas, revealing family secrets and learning new spells, but as time went on, it became more predictable. Too many characters came and went, such as Valerie, Driam and Brad, and then they decided to make Sabrina in college, which destroyed her for me. <br /> <br /> Sabrina plunged into herself in college, there was less magic, No spellbook, no aunt living with her, and Roxie, Miles and Morgan were annoying. <br /> <br /> The last episode was boring, and I just looked to see what happened at the end. For some reason, the absence of Hilda and Zelda seemed wrong, and Miles just left. The last episode made me feel much better, although (SPOILER), when Sabrina eventually met Harvey on her wedding day with stupid Aaron, it was great! Overall, a great program if you forget the last two or three poor episodes that reminded me of many teen shows. Magical.
