This movie is fun to watch. If you liked "Dave" with Kevin Klein, you will enjoy it. Think Dave left South America when Dreyfus played Jack Noah, an actor between jobs, manually chosen by the head island nation of the secret police Parador to replace the drunken soup of dictator Alphonsus Simms after he had a heart attack and died. Noah stumbles, helping in his role as the mistress of the ex-dictator, when they try to thwart the plans of Raul Julia. Jonathan Winters also looks like a warm American expat who turns out to be the CIA. ALSO starring Polly Holiday and Fernando Rey. <br /> <br /> There are several absurd moments, such as the body of an old dictator, which will be frozen for a year, and the final scene, where Sonya Braga, a bee, holding a Dreyfus body bloody, pierced by bullets. After a few moments everything is visible in white, with a barely noticeable spot on it. But overall this is a great romp.
