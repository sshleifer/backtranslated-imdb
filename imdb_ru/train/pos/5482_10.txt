This is an amazing movie. In addition to showing the actual cadres of key events in the failed coup to overthrow Chavez, we are given a background picture that describes a society divided into classes. It seems that many of the rich have a choice in favor of the democratic choice of the people and are ready to use the armed forces for regime change. “Be careful what you say to your servants,” is a frank comment. The head of the country's largest oil company is appointing himself a new president with US support, and these young Irish filmmakers have it all on camera. Great movie to educate youth about democracy. We see transparent documentation on how the media can be manipulated and used in the interests of big business against the interests of the democratic desires of the people. Rivets
