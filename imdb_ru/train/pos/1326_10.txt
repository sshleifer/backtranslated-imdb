I saw this film at a film festival in college back in the 70s - I was ALWAYS waiting for the video to be released (finally, it was released). This was done in Brazil, so I assumed that this was why he hadnâ€™t yet seen the video. For the past 15 years, I've been checking out video stores, waiting for the release of this outstanding film! This is one of my favorites for all time - but be careful, it is strange, like the strange Werner Herzog - its oddity stems from its super-realism. <br /> <br /> The film is based on real events A few centuries ago, in precolonial times, when Europeans first encountered tribes on the Amazon. A wild tribe of cannibals mistakenly takes their enemy for white, so they intend to kill him. Before they send him, however, they make him part of their tribe (their custom). The entire film is like watching a National Geographic documentary, as it becomes an accepted member of their tribe. That's all. Space plot? Not. An intense understanding of the diversity of human life? Definitely. <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... be careful ... this film has a certain nudity - this is not some kind of Hollywood film about valiant savages ... this film tells how it was (reread above: National Geographic, super-realism) <br /> <br />
