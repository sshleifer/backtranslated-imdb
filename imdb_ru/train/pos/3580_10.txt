I do not think that such a film will be released today. It takes time to represent the depth of the characters, and the plot is not full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> But what this film really has: interesting, learn how families cope with their grief. Like when the language of healing and overcoming huge losses leaves us dumb, and instead we rely on gross emotions. Grief without cause and patience is anger, even hate. And, unfortunately, the main character (a young boy who accidentally shoots and kills his brother during a hunt) in the film gives more than his fair share. He finally leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley), who lets him know that it was an accident. I had the impression that this young man knew about it in his heart, but he needed to hear these words from his parents and receive their forgiveness. <br /> <br /> What I liked about this film: the lack of dialogue. There was a huge emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. And the slow pace of the film allows you to really watch the reaction of the actors. What we can not do with modern films. <br /> <br />
