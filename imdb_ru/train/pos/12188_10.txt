Orson Welles' pure genius makes this one of the greatest films. Wells is embroiled in a conspiracy to kill only to become the fall guy, to which he refers with a sarcastic comment "I am a big moron." The plot is so complex that I still do not know whether the victim knew that his life was about to die. The shooting scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most amazing shots ever made. This scene alone is worth the price of entry. This is the only time that Rita Hayworth played a difficult but believable character. No one except Wells would have the courage to cut his hair and dye it blond. No one should miss this picture.
