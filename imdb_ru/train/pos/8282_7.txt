** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The biggest part of the movie that doesn’t work is Wendigo, and when your title character fails, your movie is usually not far behind him. Wendigo’s filmmaker’s interpretation is interesting, and can be properly threatening when it’s taken off right — for example, when the runaway killer sees Wendigo in a flash in his rear-view mirror — and the shape of the tree was actually very good. However, as a monster character, he never comes to his senses. We do not get much explanation for his behavior, and what we really see from this is not consistent with the story told in the film itself, nor with any information about Wendigo that I have ever read. <br /> <br /> I think that one of the main reasons why a monster fails is that in the film it’s not enough for that. When you drive this movie to its bones, you have a certain monster movie. This is a surprise action movie with a small amount of supernatural element. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is good, albeit a bit. cheesy; filmmakers use the scenery, lighting and time of day to convey the atmosphere and mood quite well. Otis's character seems really dangerous and unpredictable, which makes him a real monster in the film. Perhaps it would be more effective to explain his behavior, since he was obsessed with the hungry Wendigo spirit, which would also be a more accurate representation of a real legend. <br /> <br /> I heard unconfirmed reports (from a newsgroup) the reason why Wendigo does little, is that when the monster costume was built, it was so heavy and uncomfortable (to imitate its position, standing on split hoofs, the performer had to walk on his toes), which was almost impossible to run, walk or otherwise perform in it. Thus, the multitude of flashes of the creature standing in place, and the apparent accelerated footage of his run. I emphasize that these messages are not confirmed.
