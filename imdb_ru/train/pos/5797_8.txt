And I do not say this badly. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in a movie when I was 6 or 7. For me and my cousins, it was magical, beautiful and scary at the same time. When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend, although we knew that he had no idea about it. <br /> <br /> Over the years I have seen this film several times, but I have always changed the channel. Even if you see for a few seconds, it will give me a sense of magic and warm my heart. And I liked it. <br /> <br /> So I only saw this movie once, and I think it was a good decision not to watch it again. If I saw it today, I know that I could not but criticize the actions of MJ, the plot (if it was) of this and that. For me, this is a childhood memory, so my feelings for him are the feelings of a child 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> I see that my adult personality interferes with my rating and gives him 8 for memories and beauty. Music. For the little child who watched it 20 years ago, it definitely costs 10.
