Although the soundtrack is a bit outdated, this story is more relevant in the US than ever. With not only jobs, but all contractors outsourced to US corporations, while government profits and Americans suffer. <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss - Emory, a steelworker who does the same job as his father is 35 years old. His wife is well depicted by Pamela Reed, who is very realistic and tries to support a family with two children when Emory loses her job. The mill is closed under the pretense of mismanagement, but there is also waste and cheaper wages, where they can pay one steelmaker for one month (outsourcing) that they would have to pay Strauss / Emory per day. Never mind that all these people are good faithful workers who have values ​​and who are trying their best for their family. <br /> <br /> John Goodman, Gary Cole (like Strauss's brother) and several other employees also suffered. This is very disturbing and realistic. Some scenes between Emory and his father are moving. Emory hopes that his local union will be able to re-open the mill, as they promise. <br /> <br /> Brother Emory, Lee already sees the writing on the wall. There are no jobs left in the rust belt (Ohio), and they have to move on. However, where can they move to the USA? Where would it be better for a steel worker? - <br /> <br /> At the end there is a triumphal scene where Emory and his team fill the loading dock with steel products. The guard allows them to do it as a last gesture, one of the men committed suicide, and he has sympathy. <br /> <br /> In general, a good movie with reports of difficult times right here in America. Something that few people encounter, while not personally affected. 8/10.
