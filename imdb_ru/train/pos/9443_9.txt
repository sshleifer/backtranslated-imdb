It's a shame that Deliverance is mostly known as a movie about rape and dueling banjo. Even people who have seen the movie cannot escape from this rape scene. It's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. This, of course, is not as bad as any female rape scene in almost any film. People, as a rule, miss the opportunity of the film, which contains the infamous scene of filth. <br /> <br /> Acting, plot, cinematography and the soundtrack for the film “Liberation” - all this helps the charming charisma. Backcountry, in which he was shot, is beautiful and quite contrasted with a dark subject. Actors, both major and minor, make you feel that you are floating down this river with them. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes this film from others is the tangible sense of fear that it inspires. Not many movies can make you feel scared. Bottom line: this movie is a classic. I can't say much more than that.
