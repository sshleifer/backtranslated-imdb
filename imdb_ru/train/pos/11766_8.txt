This movie has everything you want from an action movie. Explosions, shootouts, bad guys and worst guys. It's funny to see how James Belushi uses his humor to get rid of the troubles he got into because he stole $ 12 million from the biggest boss, Skipper. That sounds silly. Of course so. But boy, I had fun watching this movie. This is much better than all the direct junk on DVD that is being made these days. If you can overcome a stupid plot, you will find that there are quite a few surprises in this film. You could argue that the turns are predictable, but the fast pace of this film does not give you too much time to think about them, which is a blessing, because this film is not about revealing the final turn, but rather about the path to that moment. Only the title is a little misleading, and this may be the reason that so many people hated this film. They probably expected a film about bandits instead of several scammers crossing each other twice. Pure pleasure!
