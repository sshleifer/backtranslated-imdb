Stupid movie really, very funny. Yes, he has his dead moments, it may be a little too obvious, in the second half it is a little lower, and the story is an incoherent mess, but he laughs out loud all the time funny. And it's worth it that Ed McMahon be the right wing. This film is in the same class as Elvira, the Mistress of the Dark, another incredibly funny, underrated film.
