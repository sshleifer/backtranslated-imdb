"Still Crazy" is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all time. This was erroneous compared to “This is the spine,” to which it has nothing to do. “Spinal Tap” is a satire (and, frankly, not very good, despite the fact that it “comes out” of many rock cliches). Unlike Tap, Still Crazy is populated by great actors, great songs and wonderful human situations. You care about people in "Still Crazy". That's all that matters. Oh, yes, the music is pretty damn good too, written by Mick Jones from Foreigner and Chris Difford from Squeeze. The American audience was already familiar with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but only later met Bill Nighy (Underworld, Actually, Love Actually, Pirates of the Caribbean II) and Timothy (Harry Potter movies).
