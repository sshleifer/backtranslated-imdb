This is the best movie I've ever seen in 2002, while I'm used to mainstreaming. It is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act of these 11 short films. From technical information (selected directors), I was afraid that it would have an anti-American basis, but ... it is a kind of tribute (11 times). <br /> <br /> The weakest point comes from Y Chein: he fails to “swallow his pride”, and he considers this event a deserved punishment ... the whole work. The strangest Mexican film about conceptual art ... I'm still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu meant. 9 others were perfect (C. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me either smile, or cry, or even stun me. I still do not know whether the fable of S. Imamura is really connected with the catastrophe of September 11, but it is so good that its final place deeply “does it”.
