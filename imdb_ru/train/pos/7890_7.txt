Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) was the last movie in which Freddy Krueger was a solo act (not a character or a colleague). Years of murder caused damage to the city of Springwood. It got to the point that the small city became a virtual ghost town. The parents who killed Freddy Krueger so many years ago paid the final price. Only crazy people live in the city, and the survivors are scattered everywhere. But this does not prevent Freddie from seeking his last revenge. No matter how they try to stop him, he always comes back again and again. But this time he will learn a little more about his old life. Can children finally stop Freddie forever? What is this secret that is buried in Freddieâ€™s perverted mind? to find out what you have to watch Freddy's Dead. The end was originally shot in the 3rd. <br /> <br /> The right way to end a franchise. Freddie learns something about himself and his perverted life, and he goes with a bang! The star of Lisa Zane, Japhet Cotto and Freddy Krueger in this last part. Rosanna, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. Much better than the previous one, but it is filled with a few outdated jokes. If you like the show, you don't want to miss this one. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to Freddie fans.
