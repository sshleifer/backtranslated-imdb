If you're a Crispin Glover fan, you should see this. If you're a fan of Sean Penn, you should see this. If you're a movie fan at all, you should see it. If you don't know who Crispin Glover is, and you don't know who Sean Penn is, this film will probably still be of great value, but the more work you have seen Crispin or Sean, the better. <Br /> <br /> This film is so funny, but it is also pure genius. I don't know anything like this movie. This is its own genre. I doubt that anything like that will be done again. I can not say more about why, without spoiling it in part, and some other reviews here have done a good job. <br /> <br /> In response to any reviewer who gave him a bad review, I ask you to watch the movie again. In fact, it makes no sense to call this film “boring.” This is perhaps the funniest, most interesting and least boring movie ever created. And it only gets better with age and re-views. Classic, timeless, which, unfortunately, very few will be able to declare what they saw. <br /> <br /> The Beaver Trilogy is a brilliant work by director Trent Harris, also responsible for the amazing Rubin and Ed, whom Crispin Glover also stars in. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, copies of this film are rare and difficult to find. After some hard searching, I managed to find a version of VHS, and there are several ways to find it, which I know of. But I would really like someone to record it on DVD.
