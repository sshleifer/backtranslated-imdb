I was very surprised by this movie. Turning to the preview, not knowing anything about the film, except for one trailer that I saw, I thought it would be a bullshit-drunken feast like "Dude, where's my car." I was expecting bad sex jokes and farting, as well as a pathetic protagonist who would end up because this is how films work. Instead, I got a smart, surprisingly original film about a decent, ordinary guy who just never had sex. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is full of jokes about sex, vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-Nip! but this is done in the spirit of Bad Santa, and not Sorority Boys. All characters are people you probably know in real life, friends who can be redeemed, who are just trying to hook a brother and live their lives. <br /> <br /> I thought that this film would be complete shit, and I was very surprised. Yes, it is quite unnecessary (oh well, this is a film about a 40-year-old virgin!), But this is very cleverly done. <br /> <br /> In the end, do you really want this guy to be put, what does he say about the film, because, frankly, do you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?
