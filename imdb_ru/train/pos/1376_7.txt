It sounds as though it is the biography of Claude Monet, but in fact it is a very focused history of the relationship of three teenage girls in the French synchronized swimming team. There are no parents, no teachers to talk about, no schools, and the boys are represented by one minor figure, the naughty Francois, who goes into the story, which is determined from time to time, and is always embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Pauline Aquart is the youngest of the three, only trying to join the team she admires. She looks a little weird. She has not yet emerged from her teenage jerk, she has long bony limbs, large feet, and she has no inclinations. She is prognathic and athletic in those puffy tight lips. After a while, her appearance grows on you, and from certain points of view, it may seem fascinating. <br /> <br /> Adel Henel is older - more, well, in general, more developed physically. What a glamorous figure she puts on in her bathing suit, walking around, teasing the boys, combing her long blond hair. But she is not what she seems. Or is she? I could not understand it. The French are long on paradoxes and lack consistency. It is not surprising that Francois always sniffs her. <br /> <br /> There is not much ambiguity in the character of Lows Blacer. She is also on the team, but she is dull and simple, and sensitive to this, and deeply in love with Francois. Blescher - a good actress, which increases the clumsiness of the character in her performance. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the relationship between these three, that is, intrigues, deceptions, hidden feelings and everything else that we have. chat with young girls who spend a lot of time with each other. This is of course a difficult topic. This becomes more difficult during the gradual development of homoerotic relations between Pauline and Adele. Not that you should expect it to be a soft porn. The only nude we see is much less than outrage, and what little sex there is under a blanket, sometimes literally. <br /> <br /> I don’t think I want to get into the plot or its analysis too much, partly because it is thought-provoking, and not expressed in action, partly because it is complicated, and partly because I'm not sure that I understood everything. <br /> <br /> Let me give you an example. Good. Adele - a girl who is jealous of others. She is also quite far away and complacent. On top of that, she seems to be following every boy and man, if they can be helpful at all, from the beautiful but dull Francois to the bus driver she wants to get a favor from. She does not hesitate to show off her experience in fellatio. When Polina approaches her about joining a swimming team, Adele uses her as an observer during tasks with the guys. You know, an excellent and smug narcissist? But then the whore soy-disgruntled takes the skinny Polina under her wing and reveals to Polina that she is still a virgin. Indeed? Yes indeed. Polina begins to approach Adele, and Adele finally admits that she would like to get rid of her virginal hymen and would like Polina to do it for her. Polina, now sexually attracted to Adele, performs the task with muffled pleasure. NOW Adele would really like to talk to a man, preferably older and more experienced. So she takes Polina to the booth, where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows Polina to the restroom. Two girls are standing there, staring at each other, neither of which shows a clear sexual interest in the other. But Adele is standing so close that Polina slowly loosens her reins, stretches her hand and kisses Adele on the lips. Adele pulls back, smiling, and says: “Now, it was not so bad, was it?”, And then returns to the club. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly detailed description of what is happening. between Polina and Adele - but what the hell is going on? First, Adele treats Polina as an irrelevant child, later as a close friend, finally, as a potential lover - and at that moment when Polina answers, Adele leaves satisfied. Does she use Pauline in the way she seems to use men? Is Adele satisfied that she now has another person in forced slavery? I dont know. <br /> <br /> I neglected Louise Blescher as the third member of the trio, a simple and overripe wall flower, whose facial expression always indicates daze, but at least it is completely heterosexual and the first of three to get rid of this noisy virginity, but I missed it only for reasons of space. <br /> <br /> Should you see this? In all senses. (Just compare it with a typical American film about high school students.) For men, some of whom have never penetrated into female mysticism, this may give you some idea of ​​how this looks in medium shots.
