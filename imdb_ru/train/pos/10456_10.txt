This film is not about entertainment or even about the film you want to see to pass the time. This film really shows the true love that can come only from God. You can not touch, looking at this movie. We have several aspects of love that contribute to the value of this film. There is the divine love of God, which is beautifully depicted. God's love transcends the heart and mind, undergoes and is eternal. There is love in marriage. Although the main character is struggling with his wifeâ€™s illness, through God's love he realizes that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine. He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated. Finally, you have the love of a child and a parent. Children in the family get together and understand that nothing more than love conquers fear. Dear friends, love is not love if it does not come from God, because God is love, and love comes from God. Talk to someone and let them know that you love them. Love is useless if it is not given to another. I pray that this film can inspire and change the life of everyone who sees it. Amen!!
