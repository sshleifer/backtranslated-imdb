I really liked this film about relationships, which sometimes developed between American servicemen and Japanese women in post-war Japan, as well as the obstacles created by prejudice for them. Brando moves from contempt to the Japanese (which is natural during World War II) to falling in love with a Japanese woman and a desire to marry her. His performance is fine (I'm not a big fan of his playing style), and the film is great in everything. Red Buttons won an Oscar for the touching performance of another soldier who falls in love with Japan (although Japanese women playing opposite him also did a wonderful job). <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t want to spoil this but the movie is good for watching with a box of napkins. <br /> <br /> This film manages to say something and be interesting at the same time. Mostly an underrated gem.
