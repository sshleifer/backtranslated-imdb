In 2054, Paris, Avalon, the computer system, controls the city, and when a young woman is abducted, Detective Karas (Craig) must go against Avalon to find her. <br /> <br /> “Renaissance” is a great mix of movies mixed with conceptual futuristic narration that illuminates the screen in a shocking manor with a noir-themed ideology and conceptual montages that should please many. <br /> <br /> Pixar - animation masters. Their many Oscar-winning films are endless - from the charming Toy Story to the mysterious Wall-E, and therefore it’s really difficult for any company or director to knock them off their feet. Renaissance is not a film intended for a young audience, and, like Persepolis 2007, brings a strong and mature approach to the animation genre to make an older and more complex film for the targeted older generation. <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robert Rodriguez released a strikingly brilliant noir City of Sins, which shook all the use of a green screen with a great balance of black and white filming with strange bursts of color, and a year later Christian Volkman took a similar approach with equally visually masterful course of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Wolfkman’s picture, however, is full of animation, but it doesn’t look half realistic for most of her strong 1 hour and 40 minutes work time. The characters' faces are well depicted, and, in particular, this film should be the best to use the shadow. The fact that we will never know whether it is night or day is irrelevant just by looking at stony faces when shadows are mixed in their expressions. It is almost a clever use of a pitiful mistake, and it is precisely directed. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has seen Persepolis, you will come to the conclusion that this is one of the best directed animations ever shown for the simple but very conceptual art style of Marjane Satrapi. <br /> <br /> Renaissance equally corresponds to this picture and in many cases competes with stronger graphics and a darker tone reflecting mood. One scene, in particular, when Karas appears out of the dark, is beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> The narrative revolves around a stubborn and curious political government that watches every citizen. The administration of Paris is connected with the mysterious Avalon, of which we do not see enough to understand the essence of its true domination. The Renaissance controls the story around a tired cop trying to save a mysterious woman, and then we see Craig’s tired and boring cop trying to save by fighting other elements. There are many things that are wrong with the script, not to mention the tired and irritated cop routine is outdated, but there is a lot of adrenaline and stubborn banter between the characters to keep him alive, right up to the wonderful shot that shocks the last couple of stages.
