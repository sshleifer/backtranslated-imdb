This is a really fun show, done in a creepy way, very much like a Tim Burton movie. It’s worth a look, as it’s much more creative than most shows this season. Best of all, this is not a "reality show". I wonder why viewers are so ready to accept such shows (which are devoid of creativity) and ignore such wonderful shows that really have a creative inclination. <br /> <br /> Although some condemn the premise, I think this is really unusual. Much nicer than Ghost Whisperer and Medium. I think this is the funniest thing in the pipe, since "My name is Earl." <br /> <br /> Yes, both the story and the music are wonderful. If you like shows that are a bit off the beaten track, I would recommend it. This is not as strange as Twin Peaks, but it has a serious bend.
