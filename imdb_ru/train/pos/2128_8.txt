I just watched it on Turner's Classic Movies last night, seeing it for the first time, and I really enjoyed it. I like a lot of old movies, especially because of the lack of all the dirty language and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most modern films. I also think that they were made much better in many (but not all) cases. Jimmy Stewart is my special favorite. I just thought that this movie was very fun to watch, and I really enjoyed it. If you feel the same way about old movies, I don’t think you can be wrong with that. I believe that “You received the mail” - a remake (albeit a slightly different, and very pleasant film) of this film. For a quiet evening with a movie you should not be ashamed if your children or someone else comes to your viewing, get it or catch it on one of the classic movie channels.
