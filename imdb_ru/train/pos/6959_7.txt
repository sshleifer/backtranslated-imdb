Well, this is Ivan Reitman's film. with rare exceptions, Ivan loves to be entertained. His films are usually not "deep", but they are often quite interesting. My super ex-girlfriend surprised me that I was laughing more than I thought. Uma Thurman is simply gorgeous, and I love her images. I also like Luke Wilson, and Raine Wilson was a real shout. Never taking myself seriously, the film is overloaded and, nevertheless, not very unique, nor does it go where no one went before ... although itâ€™s a good rental and perhaps the movie is OK, especially you have a headache and do not want to strain your brain. This escapist fun, and there is nothing wrong with that. When you drop the "super-girl," you have a story about relationships, and relationships have gone bad. This boy meets a girl, the boy leaves the girl. And in the end, the heroes are looking for love. Not all of them are perceived as "discarded" as well as they could ... a piece of life with a twist.
