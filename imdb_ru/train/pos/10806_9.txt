I felt this film - everywhere. I was impressed with Russell Crowe's talent in developing his relationship with Lilly, such a typical Australian soft-mild mix, a bit self-deprecating and very persistent. He loved cinematography and direction. Pace was right, and the images of almost all the characters were impressive. Gosh, Russell's talent did not shine even in 1993! .. and I have not seen Gladiator.
