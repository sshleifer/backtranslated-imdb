I saw this film with a group of friends, and although only two of us left the cinema, thinking how cool it was, others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was. Well, that's because it shouldn't be taken so seriously, in fact, this is a film that makes fun of horror films and does a damn good job .. It seems there is another movie that goes the same way, uh ... Scary movie ?? Well, this is an Australian and the original !!! Jessica Napier plays superbly, and Sarah Kants has a definite bright future in acting! I hope to see more of them. Molly Ringwald was a good move, and Kylie was the best. Impossible princess was the queen of the screen !! I recommend watching this film, because until the very end you will guess about the connection with Raffi, Hilary and the film, which was never finished 20 years ago.
