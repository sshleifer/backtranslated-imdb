RATING STARS: ***** Works **** simply do not hit the target *** It's a bit between ** Pitfalls * Pitches <br /> <br /> Mike Atherton peacefully makes him in the Wild West when he notices a group of men who mistreat a lady. Being a gentleman, he naturally intervenes and stops it, and at the same time kills the son of the opposing security official. This is only the beginning of a blazing battle of all the cannons, to the finish, in which there will be only one winner. <br /> <br /> M. Dudikoff - the star of the militants, who never managed to fight with me. Maybe I discovered him too late, and after another film that I saw with him last Monday, “The Human Shield”, it was just another Dad (haha) added to the list. But I have something for westerns, because these are films that sort of transfer me to another time and place and provide real escapist entertainment, and thanks to this Dudikoff chose one of his best scenarios, since his films still go . <br /> The film strikes with several low points in the form of a naff-central villain, sounding like an empty Marlon Brando, and usually a little strange, acting from some actors, along with the obligatory cheap-looking sets. But if for some strange reason, your life ever depended on watching Dudikoff’s movie, that would be one of your best choices. ***
