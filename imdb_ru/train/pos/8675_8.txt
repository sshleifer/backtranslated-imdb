Not being one of my favorites, it's good to change the pace ... even for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> It all starts with a big fight between Tom, Jerry and Spike (which is renamed Butch here). They all beat each other, but suddenly Spike makes a heroic and admirable decision: he stops the fight and invites all of them to become friends. So, they all sign a peace treaty and become friends ... that will not last long. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, they are gentle, patient, and kind to each other. They even save each other when one of them is life threatening. Relationships go just fine, until a very large steak appears, and they all become greedy. All three are guilty of having returned to their usual battles and rivalries. <br /> <br /> But still ... seeing Tom, Jerry and Spike as your friends is a really exciting and rewarding experience, if only for a little while. <br /> <br /> By the way, it is curious that in the instrumental versions there are two songs from “The Wizard of Oz”: “We are going to meet the Wizard” and “Somewhere over the rainbow”.
