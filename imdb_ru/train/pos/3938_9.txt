Henry Fonda brilliantly captured what we had long believed Abraham Lincoln. This is a cheat. Thanks to the performance of the Foundations, we can believe (at first glance) that Abraham Lincoln was a village rogue. But thanks to his confrontation with the crowd of vigilantes, and especially during the trials, you can see that there is a brilliant man under his external postures who knows very well what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him. <br /> <br /> In this film, Henry Fonda shows that he understands very well how to present humor. This is an aspect of it that has been lost over the years. When he tells stories and jokes, he has the perfect time. In the process there is an episode that made me laugh quite strongly. He again demonstrates this gift in "Lady Eve" in 1940. <br /> <br /> John Ford’s ending is absolutely gorgeous: Henry Fonda rises to the top of a hill, and in the distance a huge storm symbolizes civil war. He goes ahead in history. The film is fiction, but Lincoln’s understanding is amazing. Definitely worth seeing again.
