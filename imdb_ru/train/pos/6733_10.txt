There was a stream of recent surfing films that I seem to have accidentally ran across without prior warning. I caught this treasure on digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise it was! The focus is on the big waves of pioneers surfing from the 60s Greg Knoll to our current Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay to Mavericks and Jaws. Hell, I could watch a film about Laird Hamilton - one of the great athletes of this generation - so the rest is just sauce. There is a ton of good surfing mixed with interviews of past and present surfing stars in a pleasant, relaxed and unpretentious manner. Of all the surfing films I have seen, this tells the story of a big wave, and I think this is my favorite story. Enjoy!
