What is good about this: Some inventive and truly creepy little effects that will fall under the skin of even the most hardened horror fan. Does not rely on beaten soundtrack for its moments of "caught". Even if you've seen everything, there are a few more things in this movie that will make your jaw fall. <br /> <br /> What could be better in this: from time to time the game was flat and unconvincing. In some places, he had the quality of "shot on video" (although, basically, he achieved the atmosphere he was striving for), and camera work is full of unnecessary close-ups of meaningless actions. Although the effects are really terrible, I think that with some of them they could get into the well too many times. The ending seemed hasty and turned a blind eye to what could be more impressive. The viewer has a lot to figure out for himself, not as a call from filmmakers, but because they just missed it. <br /> <br /> However, a good little indie horror movie in which itâ€™s easy to walk a few steps above average. Worth renting.
