I accidentally caught this film at a show in Brooklyn - it's hard to describe the plot; there are many stupid characters in it, but let's just say that it will be difficult for me to choose which one will make me laugh the hardest, I don’t know where to start. Even the minor roles are well written and well played. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of small strokes that make it unique and very pleasant, it has several “devices” that pop up and add another fun layer. It is a pleasure to watch; not some recycled things that I've seen many times before. If this film could reach a wider audience, I am sure that it would be a real audience, the story would be so original and soulful. <br /> <br /> There is something to love here, funny stories, failures and misunderstandings that establish the final act and the dramatic conclusion. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with a huge heart; This is a touching story with a fast-paced comedy. Definitely worth a look!
