Imagine turning off the lights in your remote farmhouse on a cold evening and then going to bed. There is no need to lock the doors. The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees. After some time after midnight, the car with the lights off rises on the roadway. After a few moments, the attacker sends a flashlight to your darkened living room. <br /> <br /> What makes this image so scary is the setting: the remote farm ... at night. Based on Truman Capote's bestseller and with black and white lighting comparable to the best noir films of the 1940s, In Cold Blood presents a terrifying story, especially in that first act, since the plot unfolds mostly at night and in the rain-drenched country road . These are nightmares. But this is not a dream. Events really happened in 1959. <br /> <br /> Two crooks with their heads full of illusions kill a whole family in Kansas in search of cash that does not exist. Director Richard Brooks used actual places where real events took place, even a farmhouse ... and its interior! This is a memorable and memorable film. <br /> <br /> Both main actors are very similar to the two real killers. Robert Blake is more than convincing, like Perry Smith, short and stocky with an ass who wants to find the treasure of Cortes. Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hicock, a quiet con artist with a general American smile. <br /> <br /> After the murder, the duo goes to Mexico. Everything goes wrong there, so they return to the USA, steal cars, hitchhike and, as a rule, feel unhappy when they wander from place to place. But this is the life of a fool, and two criminals will soon regret their actions. The last twenty minutes of the film fascinate: the rain falls, the rope draws in, and all that we hear is the beating heart beating. <br /> <br /> Even with the slightly mundane middle act “In cold blood” The stages of riveting the details of a real story that still hypnotizes almost half a century later. This is the parameter that does this. Do you think people in the countryside of Kansas still leave their doors unlocked ... at night?
