This is one of the best films, and it says that it was for television. I really would like it to be on d.v.d. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt gave such a rough job. She perfectly played a rookie-cop, thrown into the business of a serial killer. When she falls apart because he kills another child, it was amazing. She is so alone, so he gets to her. When she talks about her mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber, the serial killer, was so shocking! He really led her into his dark world. It was an Oscar-worthy. When he talks about killing children, scary! When he will understand who she really is! What a scene !! <br /> <br /> They really don't make them that way anymore. It was a real thriller without horror.
