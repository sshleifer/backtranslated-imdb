... and if you are very, very good, it will resemble the Moon Over Parador. <br /> <br /> This film was a bit of a stupid story, but in the end it was fantastic, and the actors and actors were unmistakable! Dreyfuss was beautiful as an actor / imposter, full of all the little neuroses and vanities that you present to the actors. You will get an idea of ​​what the actors are like behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> This was one of the best roles of Dreyfus, just like his character plays the best part, depicting a dead dictator! And the farewell scene: as if something from Casablanca, really! <br /> <br /> Raul Julia was the superior chief of Paradorian’s secret police. He gets some really funny lines, some of which are tributes to other films, for example, “Round the usual suspects!” <br /> <br /> And Sonya Braga was a great girlfriend - besides the fact that she was a very hot number: You have to get an Oscar tonight! ”<br /> <br /> Let's not forget that Johnny Winters is a CIA agent and several guest stars playing themselves: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett - everything is perfectly done. <br /> <br /> In general, a catchy romp under the parador moon. <br /> <br /> -R.
