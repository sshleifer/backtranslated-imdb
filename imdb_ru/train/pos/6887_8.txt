This is a unique and bold film. It is energetic, with highly developed characters. Very good performances. <br /> <br /> I love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think ... <br /> <br /> Bret Carr dares to look inward, ask questions and dig under the surface. By the nature of the film, he practically demands that the viewer also look inside himself. It may take some courage to do this. I see how some narrow-minded people may find this quite disturbing. However, I found that it makes you wonder, much more than just entertainment. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is truly an original director with foresight. I am curious to see what he will do next. <br /> <br /> Watch him.
