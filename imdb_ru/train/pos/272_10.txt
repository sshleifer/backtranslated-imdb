I liked it, but there were still nightmares because of the hotel manager. The film was presented well, with a choice of actors performing their roles in the reality of writing. Many scenes capture the imagination and create a nail. The sequence of situations was cleverly written, making me believe that the story is moving in one direction, only to find a new twist in what, in my opinion, might be obvious. It is a pity that there should be commercials. I told many friends to watch further shows, and of course I will look again. I enjoyed the landscape of the film and felt that it added to the plots and intrigues. Hot discussions between husband and wife (or, I would say, fights?) Were very realistic. The initial situation is usual, but, fortunately, the escalation of the presented history is not. I want to thank everyone who participated in this wonderful entertainment film. Thank! Looking forward to following movies --- when? Whidby
