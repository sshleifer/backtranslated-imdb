This movie is just fun. I've seen it a couple of times, but there is always something funny that I remember. Car scene "crumbs and bunnies" - one of my favorites, and I still quote the version of some of the words Morone! <br /> <br /> So many running jokes that it is amazing. But I still love Michael Keaton!
