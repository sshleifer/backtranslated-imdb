“Crush” is a combination of drama, humor and such irony that I think the British understand very well when it comes to matters of the heart. Basically a famous director, John McKay, wrote this wonderful script about three forty-something friends in a small town in England. All three professional women who were unlucky with men organized a ritual ladies' party with gin, cigarettes and sweets, included in the endless chatter about the wrong behavior of their dates or the needs of their libido. Andy McDowell, once again abandoned by the British entourage (this is where I find that she exudes the most), is absolutely fascinating, as the main owner of a prestigious school that is associated with a young man. Gossip from a small town and disapproving jealous friends (great cast) are in conflict with her relationship. A series of cruel unfortunate events unfolds and shows us many difficulties when you are striving for true happiness. Keep in mind that the main premise of this film is friendship, and the final shows us exactly that. This is a type of film that you either love or hate, so I believe that the many mixed reviews are not as great as the result when this film was released. As I am sure, most are just digging up the movie. I really liked this film, and I highly recommend it for those who love films such as “Love Actually” and “Three Weddings and a Funeral”. Not to mention the soundtrack, which perfectly captures these important points.
