The best film about marriage and family. These are very interesting thoughts for couples who will fall into the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family. This decision may be the best or worst in our lives and the lives of our children. A real invasion or the help of “friends” or executioner if we leave. The real role of families: they can help or they can destroy us. A mad priest, who may not be so mad, tells what can happen according to statistics and reality. A couple that thinks in a “special” marriage experiences a painful history in its own history. <br /> <br /> Who likes contract marriage? Nobody, after the priest tells his story ?? if they leave the future in other hands, if they don’t know what marriage is. That problems are true, that life requires real participation, guarantees from everyone. That the real victims of divorce are children with the real name Andrea in the film or names. The fact that abortion is only an easy way out: sadness, regret and unhappiness will be there after an abortion. It is the state and social security that each time less and less think about the real problems of families. Gossip about “friends”, infidelity due to Stephanie’s weakness and despair, because Tomaso lives his life as if he were alone. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone might think that this film is a pessimistic film, but not, Stephanie and Tomasso deep down love a beautiful marriage and family, if not, why they love marriage? A genuine and beautiful marriage depends only on a couple: on their every decision, on every action in their life. A family can be a place where everyone feels loved, because he or she is only existing. The script is wonderful. The performances are magnificent: Stefania and Tomasso, an almost cynical priest! Great direction and script. The colors and camera controls are superb.
