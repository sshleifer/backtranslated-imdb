As the first of the television special offers offered on the carefully thought-out box set "Barbara Streisand: Television Special Offers", released last November, this disc is issued separately for those who do not want to fork out all five special offers. As an investment, this is really the best of this group, if only because it is Streisand in its purest form and really wants to make an impression. That she succeeds so brilliantly is a key component of her legend. Having signed a long-term contract with CBS for the production of watch varieties, now almost extinct, Streisand was only 22 in this special first CBS show in April 1965. At this stage of her career, her fame was limited: A handful of best-selling albums, some great television shows on pop shows and talk shows, and her successful Broadway show in "Funny Girl." <br /> <br /> Filmed in a clear black and white color, the program is divided into three separate parts. With the creative transitional use of Disney's “I'm late” from Disney’s “Alice in Wonderland”, the first segment cleverly shows her growing up from childhood in such diverse numbers as “Make me believe” and “I am five”. Opening with a comic monologue about Pearl from Istanbul, the second part goes to the gorgeous Manhattan Bergdorf Goodman, where she is elegantly dressed in a series of glamorous costumes, performing depression songs such as “I have a lot of Nuthin” and “Best things in life are free” with comic irony. Returning to the basics, the third segment is a direct concert, which begins with an incendiary version of When the Sun Comes Out, includes a mix of Funny Girl and ends with its classic, melancholic take Happy Days Here. Again "at the end of the credits. Also included is a brief introduction that she recorded on tape in 1986, when a special video was first released on VHS. For those who know Streisand only from her expensive concert tickets and political fundraising, it really opens her eyes why it is so respected now.
