This film slipped through the cracks of movie history. This is much better than some other New York movies of the same era, such as: “French Connection” or “Taking Pelham 1-2-3”. There is a harsh reality in this film that also manages to effectively use humor to advance the storyline. It attracts from beginning to end and is not tainted with age, as is the case with the two examples mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Ron Liebman turns into a bravura performance in the role of “Batman,” and it's a shame that his career didn’t take off as a result of this project. <br /> <br /> Gordon Parks directs, and, as after the “Val”, at first glance it seems like a strange choice. However, this is the flip side of this early effort, and masculinity also comes to it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film was not available on DVD or VHS in the United States. United Artists do have a jewel, and it’s a pity they don’t do anything about it.
