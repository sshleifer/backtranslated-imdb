Tess of the Storm Country was a Mary Pickford car that I was going to buy for a while. I finally found a VHS copy at a reasonable price and enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Mary demonstrates her typical, innocent, sexy image of a girl with the wrong orientation, who won the heart of a rich man. heir. Only this time, the stakes are higher: the charge of fake murder, the illegitimate child (and the subsequent case of erroneous motherhood) and the alleged suicide. <br /> <br /> One can understand why Pickford wanted to repeat this. History is the true story of morality, in which she loved starring. Controversial topics are not always clearly stated; should the viewer pay attention and pick up clues to catch everything that is implied when viewed first ?? although everything is more or less explained at the end. <br /> <br /> The only negative comment I can make is about Jean Gersholt and the dog. Gersholt, whose character Ben Letts seems to weigh about 6-2,200 pounds (more than next to Mary, of course!), He runs in a panic when a 60-pound chocolate lab rushes to him! Then, in order to complete him (or, perhaps, to justify his bewilderment from fear of the dog), he manages to press him to the ground and somehow injure him so much that he is still trying to get up much later when a strong storm rages! This is the same favorite lab that sleeps with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and cuddles with Mary! Yet Mary later throws boiling water into Benâ€™s face, which barely slows him down! Well, I talked about Ben and the chocolate lab! In addition, the film was quite touching and certainly caught my attention. Pickford's cast was strong and believable. This is definitely among her best films.
