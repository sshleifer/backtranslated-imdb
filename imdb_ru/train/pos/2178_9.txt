Thanks to a lot of sunshine, subtle light and shadows penetrating through windows and into rooms, tracking pictures, passing through a crowd of people with a hand-held camera, fast editing and extreme close-ups, there is something in this interesting, artistic artwork Ready film. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film begins with a little fluff about a beauty contest. The film begins on a warm Sunday at the local pool, where we meet the beautiful Lucien aka Loulou (played by Louise Brooks) - a little show-off in front of drunken men by the pool, she soon decides to enter herself to represent France at the beauty contest “Miss Europe”, much to the chagrin of her very jealous groom sticking to the dirt (albeit a rather annoying guy). Walking along the runway, ten participants demonstrate themselves in swimsuits, while the winner is chosen as the participant who receives the longest applause (I was wondering if the girls couldn’t just go slower to extend their duration - and thus applause) on the podium?!). Soon, the prince and the maharaj are chasing after Lulu, but her hot gentleman does not like the attention given to her by other men or her adoring public, for that matter (I think he just wants her to be in his house, cooking his food and what he was out of sight, eh?). <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks is beautiful and charming, her presence helps to improve this film, but in fact it was the way I was photographed that most interested me. A little distracting strange dubbed sound, which is a little removed. The print on this version looked very clear and full of good contrast, though. Watching this, I just tried to ignore the problems with sound and watch the film visually, and I found the film to be excellent and worth seeing.
