I find this film very enjoyable. The plot is simple and easy to digest, humor is light and clean, and since the storyline, including an erroneous identity, is fairly common, I look forward to how this film will complement this story. It turns out very nice. Female lead performance is admirable; her image of an innocent, naive girl trying to fabricate some white lie for Davidâ€™s complex role was very charming. I also find that Vera is dancing very, very well. I feel attracted to her fingers when she effortlessly and perfectly jumps around the stage. <br /> <br /> For those who already have enough of today's films with profanity, you will like this movie.
