This film is about the Harlem baseball circle of the mid-eighties. Much more fun than the Volpi Palace, although, like many others, this film is a real gem of misery. It is impossible not to sympathize with the characters because of their strangeness. The sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomena of garbage and glitter. Here the very genius of garbage is extremely well documented and properly fascinated. The tendency of the characters to idolatry in everything that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves from the viewer, creating the effect of the "phenomenon of the phenomenon" that makes this film a work of art.
