Yes, this is an anthology horror film, and it was a lot of fun! This is because although the film was clearly a horror, in some stories there was a light spirit - and sometimes there was even a little laugh. This is not bad at all, because sometimes horror films are a little stuffy and too serious. Because of this, and because all four of the stories were pretty good, this is one of the best films of this style that I have seen. <br /> <br /> The unifying theme that links each story is the house itself. In four different stories involved people who either rent a house or investigate what happened to the tenants. <br /> <br /> In the first episode of Denholm, Elliott starred in a horror film that has a writer's block. So, for the change of scenery, they rent this house. Almost immediately, Elliott’s block disappears, and he is constantly working on a story about a serial killer. Surprisingly, soon after his block disappears, he begins to see his fictional character! The psychotic killer appears again and again, and then disappears, giving the impression that he is going crazy. It may just be the best of the stories, as a nice twist completes the story. <br /> <br /> The second, although not bad, is probably the weakest. Peter Cushing plays a bachelor who pines for a friend who died some time ago (although her picture looked amazingly modern). When he enters the wax chamber of the horror museum in the city, he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost woman, and he is both fascinated and scared. A friend comes later (Joss Ackland), and he also sees the figure and admires it. All this leads to an ending, which, frankly, was a bit of a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee begins to play the role of an incredibly harsh and stern father for a pitiful little girl. For most of this segment, Lee seemed like an idiot, but in the end, you can understand his behavior. Although slow, this one ended very well. <br /> <br /> The fourth segment was the most stupid and was intended to parody the genre. John Pertwee (the third “Doctor” from the DR. WHO television series) is a very temperamental actor, known for his images of Dracula. However, according to him, in the film there is nothing right, and in a fit of frustration, he leaves the set to find the best requisites for a movie about vampires. It’s actually quite interesting that he played this role, since it seemed natural for Christopher Lee, who played Dracula or other vampires a few billion times (give or take a few). I liked the Pertwee line when he basically said that Lee and other recent incarnations of Dracula were crap compared to White Lugosi! Perhaps this is why Lee did not accept this role! Despite some very silly moments, it was very exciting and fun - perhaps as good or better than the first segment. <br /> <br /> Considering that the film began and ended so well, played well and wrote, it’s hard not to like this film.
