Man, I loved this movie! It really brings me back when I was a kid. Those were the days when the teachers still showed great films on real drums, and if you were good, they would slowly rewind the film so that you could watch it in the opposite direction. I still remember one of the first lines ... â€œHis name was Tutazem, he was an orphan. He and so lived with his sister in the village. " This is a great movie for kids, as enduring as a red ball. In the end, other Indian boys in the village attach feathers to Tutuzeme, and he himself becomes an eagle. He lives the way he always wanted. He takes off to the skies.
