Call me stupid, but I really liked the horror movie of 2001, Valentine. It was so well done, well written, well acted, well directed, etc! Everything about it was wonderful! There were parts that were relatively ordinary (Lily's death), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), completely horrifying and creepy (Paige's death) and just heartbreaking (first scene). I think the whole cast did a great job, especially the three main roles: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (I met both of them and got autographs during the filming of this film - VERY good people!) And Marley Shelton. <I am very tired of the people who call this film "another clone of the Scream". This film is in no way a clone of Scream. In fact, this movie sounds around Scream. It actually makes sense! Scream was also NOT the only film that featured a killer in a mask. Sorry, but it looks like Creek was also a clone (hmm ... Friday the 13th, Halloween and many other scary movies that also featured killer in masks). I also think that the new killer masked cupid is brilliant. It is strange to see how a sweet, cupid face does all these terrible things. Another novelty (nosebleed) opens the way to a fantastic ending! The ending gives me a chill every time I see it !!!!! So even if you didnâ€™t like it the first time, look at Valentine again and give him another chance! <br /> <br /> PS- Follow my new site (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Coming soon ...
