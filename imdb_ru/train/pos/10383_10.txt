I saw this film in 1976, in my first year of life in New York. I lived there for the next 26 years, but I have never seen anything as delicate and beautiful as this little television movie. As I recall, it was part of the PBS series, and I never forgot about it. <br /> <br /> There are no sex scenes to talk about, only delicate, touching, extraordinarily touching moments, full of tension and excitement, all this happens in a conservative, Boston (I think) environment of the First World War, where women played the role of a devoted wife in anticipation of the return of her husband from the war, and not the search for a career and financial independence. Francis Lee McCain is great in the role of a professional photographer, and for the next 30 or so years I spent searching for her in equally complex roles, but to no avail. <br /> <br /> Should there be a video of this film? Of course, it should be on DVD, but, of course, at least a video?
