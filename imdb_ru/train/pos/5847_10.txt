Although this series lasted only a season, he stayed with me for 20 years. It was certainly my favorite cartoon. I would give almost everything to have it on DVD or any other format I can get. If you find any means to view this series, I suggest you take full advantage. This series was the first (in my opinion) in which there was indeed a consistent storyline covering several episodes. It also made me really care about the characters and what happened to them. Gosh, the character Gus sometimes scared me. He was so strange at the time. Also the leader of the group very much reminds me of the combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If anyone has the opportunity to contact the creator / owner of the rights to the series and release them on DVD, be sure to do it !!!
