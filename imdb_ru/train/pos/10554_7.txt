ANYTHING (3+ out of 5 stars) Another strange premise from the director of the movie "Cube". This time there are two protagonists who turn out to be and their house is moved into a mysterious white void. Behind their little two-story house there is literally nothing. Of course, intriguing, but I thought that the comedic tone set for this film from the very beginning was extremely ill-conceived. Of course, there must be some kind of humor ... and I have no problems with humor, which was ultimately caused by the plight of our two heroes (their final “showdown” was definitely a scream) ... but I really think that it would be much better if at first he remained more rooted in reality. After watching the movie, I looked at the DVD's “Withdrawal” function, and the short trailer at the end is almost completely devoid of “silly” comedic aspects ... making it look like a completely different (and slightly better) movie. The last half hour of the film is where things really start to come together ... like some of the recent film "Primer". With the actors, everything is in order, if they do not overdo it with comedy. They are really quite plausible in more “normal” moments. Probably, I was ready to write off this film as an unsuccessful experiment halfway ... but by the end he won me over. (And keep looking past the credits for the final scene ... just don't ask me to explain this.)
