Is this your typical woman in naval chains? Perhaps, hell, you know how the formula works, the pretty woman is represented in the picture, someone should fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> I think this movie follows some typical plot lines, but it says nothing about the content. There are great scenes with Crisp Glover, Dennis Hopper and Gary Busey, albeit short ones. Some things did not make sense, such as the need to engage in random fights, but it is interesting to watch, the fights were actually well done. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a comedy, but there really is a lot of good feeling for it. Humor is well balanced, you do not hurt your stomach at the same time, but keep the smile. <br /> <br /> There is a little pair action, so not one for children.
