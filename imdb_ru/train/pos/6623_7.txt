First of all, this movie is painfully beautiful. Someone working on 3D CG movies as a lighter / composer was amazed by the visual effects. Every second I was stunned by what was on the screen. As for the story, well, everything is in order. It won't set the world on fire, but if you like your futuristic tales of Blade Runners (and who doesn't?), Then you will be fine. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I felt that the dubbing was particularly mild and distracted from the film as a whole. I saw it at the cinema in English, but I hope that somewhere there is a French version. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
