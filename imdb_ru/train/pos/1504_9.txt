Four great stories from master Robert Bloch, adapted to the screen by the best actors in the early seventies, are the basis for this wonderful production of Amicus. It was a kind of film, very popular in the sixties and until the mid-seventies, and this is one of my favorite horror films. This one, in particular, covers the episode “Sweets for Sweets”, where Christopher Lee is pursued by his evil little girl, the heiress of his maternal tradition. Great fun from beginning to end, from good to very good - also three other episodes (the latter is a bit comic, but with a magnificent addition of Ingrid Pitt, the most famous vampress of English cinema).
