Back in 1994, I had a really long vacation around July 4th â€” about 17 days off in a row, with two weeks of paid vacation, a weekend, and the vacation itself. At that time I stayed in the city, talked a lot in my parents' house. <br /> <br /> There was no TV in my apartment, so I was watching my parents' phone. I just finished viewing the X Files segment when a program called Personal FX appeared. I immediately hooked. I have always been fascinated by the things in our house that came from the family houses of my parents and through inheritance from the estates of relatives, and often wondered about their history, values, etc. <br /> <br /> After my long vacation, I usually came home to his parents at lunchtime just to chat with Personal Currency. <br /> <br /> I remember one episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the apartment in New York, in which the serial was filmed, repaired, and once said that the repair work was completed, that Personl FX would be back on the air . <br /> <br /> This was not the case! Personal FX was the first and best of the collection exhibitions. And it disappeared from the air! After nearly fifteen years, I still hurt. <br /> <br /> Forward, FX.
