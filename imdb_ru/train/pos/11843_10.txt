Spirit: The stallion of Cimarron is a wonderful film. Mixing animation types is unique, the storyline is awesome, and the music is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Hand-drawn animation is a feature of many animations. The way they expressed characters, especially horses, is especially impressive thanks to their animation. While the way horses communicate using body language is easy to understand, many young children and people who have not studied horses may not understand. Without words, I think it would be difficult to express them through functions. Because of this, I understand the “eyebrow” that they added to the horses (while real horses do not have such thick lines). One of the few things that I noticed about horse habits that could be strangely portrayed is that the Spirit is leading the flock of his mother. In herds of wild horses, the lead stallion usually drives off young foals. <br /> <br /> While some people might think that depicting white army officers as “bad guys” is a stereotype, think about all the films in which Native Americans were depicted as such. Sometimes then; they were very bad at the mustang. For example, in real history, the Appaloosa breed was almost destroyed thanks to army officers. Imagine what would have happened to one of the most beloved horse breeds in the world if the Native Americans had not saved them. <br /> <br /> I think it is amazing how realism is not subtracted when the horses talk to each other. The feelings of the spirit were expressed by a small narration, but mainly through music (Brian Adams). The songs really reflect the story well, and Hans Zimmer and Brian Adams did an excellent job telling the story through melodies and lyrics. <br /> <br /> Emotions that I experienced when watching a movie for the first or twentieth time (yes, I watched so much), you won’t believe. Some scenes capture your breath, while others seem to cause tears in your eyes. The introductory part, showing the homeland of the Spirit, immediately sends you into an exciting action. <br /> <br /> I don’t understand why some people hate this brilliant film so much. Overall, I rate it as 10/10 - you need to watch.
