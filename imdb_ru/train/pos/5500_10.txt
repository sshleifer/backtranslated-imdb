This documentary (which is now available for free on Video.Google.Com) is a fantastic demonstration of the ability of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everybody must see it. <br /> <br /> Chavez was elected as a result of a landslide vote in 1998. His goal was to divert the fantastic oil wealth from 20% of the middle class to 80% of the poor. He banned foreign drifter fishing in Venezuelan waters. He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to the slums to treat patients for free. He destroyed illiteracy and created new free universities. <br /> <br /> But it was his 30% tax on the profits of the oil company that brought him into trouble with the Bush administration. In 2002, when Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnach O'Brien interviewed Chavez in the presidential palace about his social programs, a coup d'Ã©tat was organized with the support of the CIA. With rotating cameras, Chavez was captured and flew out of the country. It was announced on national television that he "resigned." <br /> <br /> But the poor of Venezuela did not believe the media. They went to the palace with their millions and demanded the return of Chavez. In the face of such overwhelming numbers, the military turned to the leaders of the coup, and the conspirators fled to the United States. Chavez was rescued by a military helicopter and returned to jubilation.
