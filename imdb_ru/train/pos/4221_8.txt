I loved this episode, but it seems to me that there should have been some quick reference to the punishment of the secretary for effective complicity after the fact. Although I like it when an episode with Colombo has an unpredictable turn, like this one, its resolution should be part of the end of the episode, along with the killer revelation. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Peter Falk and Peter Falk Ruth Gordon is priceless. At one point, Gordon, who plays the famous writer, makes some comments about being flattered by famous Lieutenant Colombo, mockingly hinting at the real life of a detective as a crime solver. This is one of the best great articles of Columbo.
