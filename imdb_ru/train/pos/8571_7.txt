Perhaps this is a very good “continuation”, better than the first live action film “101 Dalmatians”. He has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and everything is fine! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVille, who has undergone a rather serious therapy, now loves dogs and is very friendly to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, the owner of one of the dogs that Cruella once tried to kill, do not believe it. Others, such as Kevin Shepard (owner of the 2nd Chance Shelter for Dogs), believe she has changed. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Dipstic and his buddy have given birth to three cute Dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Freak ... <br /> <br /> Starring Eric Idl as Waddsworth (funny macaw), Glenn Close as Cruella and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another villain, the name must give a hint) This is a good family movie with excitement and much more !! One of the drawbacks of this film is that it has many painful farces, but not as excessively as in the previous film. It's also funnier than in the past movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
