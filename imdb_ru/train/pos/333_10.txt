To be honest, this series is the same classic (as television), like the original poem for world literature. This is not a gross exploitation, it is an excellent and respectful translation of one of the defining texts of Western culture. <br /> <br /> I was touched by the plight of Odysseus and his followers; touched by the drama of the fall of Troy (which was felt, but not visible); intrigued by how the gods played with the fate of mortals. (It should be noted that the gods appearing here are not ridiculous CGI creatures fluttering on their ankles or badly thrown models in bikinis. As in Homer's work, they act through mortal agents or, rarely, are represented by classical sculptures) <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it is not available on DVD, especially given the extremely poor and unhealthy adaptation of the Odyssey, which can be found in video stores.
