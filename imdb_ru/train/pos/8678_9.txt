Butch peacemaker? Obviously. After a cruel start with Spike, Tom and Jerry all turned away from each other, Butch stops and wants to know why. This is a good question. <br /> <br /> "Cats can get along with dogs, right?" He asks Tom, who nods in agreement. "Mice can get on with cats, right?" Jerry nods "no" and then sees that this is the wrong answer. <br /> <br /> They go inside, and Butch draws up the “Peace Treaty” (complete with professional works!). Most of the rest, and the main part of the cartoon, are three of them, which are extremely pleasant to each other. What a refreshing change in pace. It was interesting to watch. I can make a million such cartoons in which everyone hits each other in the head. <br /> <br /> In any case, you knew that the world would not last long. A big piece of steak means the death of the “peace treaty,” but on the way it was a pleasant change, and he still had some ordinary smart humor of Tom and Jerry.
