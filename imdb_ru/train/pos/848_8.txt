The turning point in “Matador” comes after about half the film when Danny, an unsophisticated man from Denver, sits on the balcony of his hotel in Mexico City, enjoying the silence. Someone knocks on his door, and, knowing that this is Julian, the paid killer, he refuses to answer. But is he really? <br /> <br /> Richard Shepard, director of Matador, introduces us to the character Julian Noble, who does not display any redemptive qualities. In fact, we have already seen him in action, doing what he does best. When Julian meets Danny at the Camino Real Bar in Mexico City, he sheds beans and tells his new acquaintance how he actually makes his living. <br /> <br /> Danny, who came to sell his program to a Mexican company, but he seems to be competing with a local outfit, who seems to be ahead of the contract. Danny is a naive person who falls victim to the charisma and charm possessed by clever Julian. Only at some time on a cold winter night, the killer appears at the door of Danny, asking his friend to pay back the service and accompany him on his trip to Tucson. It is at this moment that the secret that binds them is revealed in an unexpected way. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan, speaking out against the font, makes a great contribution to his disrespectful Julian Noble. Just to observe how he walks in the lobby of the hotel in a speedometer and boots, gives the correct impression of his character. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays the direct role of this strange couple. Hope Davis appears only in several scenes, forcing us to mourn why she did not stay longer. Philip Baker Hall acts as a liaison between Julian and his appointments. <br /> <br /> Richard Shepard is guided by style, working with his own material. The musical accompaniment is written by Rolf Kent, and David Tattersall's clear cinematography enhances everything.
