Life begins - and ends - in the typical maternity ward of the 1930s, where we see 48 hours from the lives of several high-risk pregnant women played by Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, Clara Blandick (Aunt Em ???), Vivien Osborne, Dorothy Three and Gloria Shea, as they wait to give birth. While the film presents plot devices that today seem flimsy when maternity wards are much more controlled and limited, he invites us to look back and see how the births of our grandmothers and great-grandmothers were born in a regular city hospital in 1932. grandmothers. I found this movie fascinating and extremely touching. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male actor, young Eric Linden in the role of Jed Sutton, Grace's husband (Lorette Young). What an actor! Being the father for the first time, Jed is confused and anxious about the hospital staff, who seem to relieve him of his wife’s anxiety, as they can shake crumbs off the table in the dining room. I felt his every concern acutely. I would like to see more work of this actor. He had a very emotional voice that was used to an unforgettable effect in Gone With The Wind. In this film, Eric played a young soldier who had his leg amputated without anesthesia, who shouted, “Don't cut it! Don't cut it! ”Scarlett ran away from the hospital in horror. Cooling! Another great performance from Alina McMahon, who plays Miss Bowers, a nurse. Her character is a terrestrial salt shaker, the nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stay, which constantly violates hospital rules to show a more humane side of the medical profession. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young did another great acting job here, very authentic and deeply felt like Grace. Oh, she's good at these precodes, I really grew up to appreciate her as an actress the past few months. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell played her role as a piercing unmarried mother just slightly higher for my taste (didn’t anyone know in 1932 that a sip of brandy from a hot water bottle could be dangerous to the health of unborn children?), but in the end, her character saves herself. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast was an uncredited Gilbert Roland, a silent film star, like a saddened Italian husband. His screen time was short, but noticeable. <br /> <br /> Life Begins is an obligatory pre-code, try to intercept it some time on TCM, but do not forget to bring a few reasons to cry. 9 out of 10
