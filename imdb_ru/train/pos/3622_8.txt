I knew that I would see it when I saw the first preview. Dennis Quaid was one of the reasons, but the topic of holding on to their dreams speaks to me. People talk about it as a film for children, but I think it is a film for baby boomers who reconcile with aging, weak parents, our own mortality, our children who grow up and throw us, and everything else weâ€™re talking about. never thought would be with us <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into the trap of the tragedy; it's about what it means to live your dream when you have a real life. <br /> <br /> Quaid is too small for a pitcher, but it makes him look good, and Rachel Griffiths makes a small role as a wife in a thoughtful multi-layered presentation. The operation is slow and sweet. When they put together this film, they left all that was not necessary. Very good.
