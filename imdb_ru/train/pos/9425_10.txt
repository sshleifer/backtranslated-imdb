Super comedy series of the 1990s (a total of two episodes were made), which suffered in the UK ratings due to poor planning. When you come up with well-established comedies, such as Minder, even the best new comedies will struggle to be noticed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I caught the show from the first episode and eagerly watched him. I mentioned this to friends and family at the time, but everyone seemed to be watching something else. Very, very frustrating. <br /> <br /> In any case, I loved both episodes and never forgot about it. <br /> <br /> Then I looked at them on the Internet and found that the ultra-fan is trying to release both series on their own. <br /> <br /> Now both episodes are available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1.
