This is a great film that, I think, does not deserve due attention as “Saturday Night Fever” or “Fat” in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl, but too excited to admit his feelings for her. Instead, he wants to ride a bull mechanically, because he thinks it will show his manliness. Despite the fact that this was done in 1980, today is still relevant. The great soundtrack of country music is awesome. 10/10
