Few films have been made about the lighter-to-air (LTA) aspect of aviation, but this is one of them, and it's damn good. Watch just a funny movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place on the US Navy airship at Lakehurst (played by NAS Tastin). Wallace Beery plays a handsome, but similar to Munchhausen, senior leader Ned Trumpet, a soldier enlisted in the army, whose fabrications have become so frequent that no one believes him. Half the fun is nearing the end of the film when events begin to prove that most of his more outlandish stories are in fact true. <br /> <br /> During World War II, the main plot centers around the bachelor Trumpet, who cares for the local widow only for the ultimate relationship between father and son with the widow’s mutilated son, Jess. Saying that he will never walk without crutches from doctors, Chief Trumpet pulls the strings, and the on-board surgeon of the Navy helps to restore the guy’s injured leg. Jess joins the Navy to become a flight officer, flies back to Lakehurst in the wild and faces a number of new challenges. <br /> <br /> A very well-made film, albeit without some banal Hollywood dialogue. past technical consultants and Beri’s apparent inability to keep up. Otherwise, this film gets good marks for technical accuracy and gives a rare look at the Navy operations. The Cash Scene, an exchange between Trumpet and the future love interest of Jesse Katie, is an absolute cry.
