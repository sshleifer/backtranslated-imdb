I feel that this is one of the best films I have seen, Iâ€™m an older man and I love most westerns. I love movies based at least partly on facts. If I'm not mistaken, this is such a film. I also like movies like revenge, in my opinion, this also fits. Some of my favorite parts of the film were the opening scene with the whipping and the barn scene. I felt that the scene of beating the corral was a bit redundant, but it did not affect how I feel about the film. I saw what I think is the continuation of this film in the episode with the smoking of a gun. I also liked it. I recommend to spend time watching this movie, I will watch it again. I also felt that the romantic parts of this film were well played. I thought that for Randy Travis it was uncharacteristic to play a villain, but I always like his game.
