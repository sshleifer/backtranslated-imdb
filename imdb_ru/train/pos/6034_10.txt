Last November I had the opportunity to watch this film at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say it was a lot of fun. Besides a few technical mistakes, it was a great experience. I liked to write and play, especially from the guy who played the main role. In this film, a lot of heart, a lot of mind. I had the opportunity to speak with several directors after this was done, and they seemed very nice. In general, the whole film was just a positive experience, and I definitely recommend it. The story was interesting and cool because, as a woman, I ran into the same problems as the lead guy, and because of that I could really understand his problems. The film does a great job, giving us people we can sympathize with. Friends in the film are really well written, they are realistic. I know such people, I just want me to have friends, and I could sound as cool as these people when we talk. The whole film is just awesome, I wish there were more such films. <br /> <br /> - Jayden
