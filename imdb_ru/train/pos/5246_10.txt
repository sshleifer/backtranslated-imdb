This film deserves 10 points for the brilliant image of the world that the playboy’s mind has experienced. While I discovered that the world is morally repulsive, the film showed the best that a story should do, and it brought us experience that we would never have experienced otherwise. Tim Meadows portrays Leon Phelps so convincingly, and this story so fascinated me to Leon’s reckless world that I forgot for a moment that I was watching a parody of the playboy world and was forced to rebel against him. This is the destruction of the film, because its great and bold achievement in telling stories comes at the cost of its own success. Understanding that the overwhelming majority of film fans will only react to the history of this film lying on the surface, and reject this story, I do not dare to misunderstand them and admit that I liked it. I loved him not only for his fascinating understanding of the playboy delusion, not only for his funny image of the idiocy of human sexual desire, but also for his courage to fearlessly explore what is in the shadow of heterosexuality. Besides, this is just ridiculous.
