I know that initially this film was NOT a box office hit, but in the light of recent Hollywood releases (most of which were strongly formulated, the plot is less meaningless, “save a blonde chick-non-matter”) What a “bullshit”, “Holiday of All Saints ”certainly in this sad context deserves a second opinion. The film - like the book - loses its anchor in some historical events, but it depicts a uniquely American dilemma posed before the uniquely terrifying American institution of human enslavement, and some of its tragic (and ridiculous and touching) consequences. <br /> <br /> And young Robert Richard, played as a leading figure, Marcel, whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal, deserves special mention, as he sets out at the beginning of his “majority” only to be severely disappointed that, as it turned out , became his true education on the ways of the southern plantation world of Louisiana, at the top of the front-century period. When I saw the preview with the participation of (scary) fair-haired Richard, I expected that the jester, jester, caricature - I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, the late Ben Verin, Pam Greer, Victoria Rowell, and even Jasmine Guy provide vivid images and tremendous skill as actors against the backdrop of tapestries in voodoo, voodoo, Creole “aristocracy” and Haitian uprisings woven into this tale of human passion, hatred, love, family, and racial bewilderment in a society that supposedly disappeared, and yet somehow still with us.
