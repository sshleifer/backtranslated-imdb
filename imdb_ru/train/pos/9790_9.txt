Although there is a melodrama in the center, or rather at the bottom of this film, the story is told beautifully and subtly, and the acting is great. <br /> <br /> Yara, a student at Princeton, returns to her native Israel for the funeral of her oldest and dearest friend, Talia. Since Yaara practically lived with her friend's parents after the death of her mother, she lost her foster sister. And since Yara, who was blind from birth, was guided and guarded by Talia, her friend’s suicide is as unbearable as inexplicable. <br /> <br /> A blind girl inevitably decides to uncover the mystery of this death Although she has an understanding without vision. Although she cannot see, she can find something that is hidden from view than the "normal" people around her. Thus, the film becomes an exciting mystery, as Yara looks for clues in memories of her relationship with Talia, in the house of her adoptive family, in tapes, diaries and people in the past and present Talia. <br /> <br /> It is said from Yara. From this point of view, the film is also viewed from her point of view, as she visualizes what she hears, believes and imagines. The disclosure of the mystery is rather arbitrary, but the search is conducted with such subtle care and an answer that is made so beautifully and without fanfare that this moment is easily forgiven. Truths appear gradually, but inexorably, clarifying not only the life of Talia, but also her relationship with Jaara. Tali Sharon, like Yara, effectively uses her mobile face and voice and is completely believable to both an adult and a teenage girl. We fully accept her ability to find her place in the world more confidently by the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Noteworthy is the accuracy with which the places and actions are repeated with small but significant changes that never become tedious, dead - due to the action of secondary characters and the interesting decision to present Talia only as a teenager. I will find fault with Yara’s final statement about how he stands with Gadi, Talia’s last boyfriend, at the edge of the cliff, but this journey to the edge is so exciting that the image will remain in sight longer than her words will be remembered.
