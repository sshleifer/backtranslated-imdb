Of course, this is a super image and a terrific sound, this is an excellent disc for home theater, but it is also a touching drama and an informative documentary. Parallel stories that are intertwined in this film will interest all viewers. Both young and old, both boys and girls will understand that deep down we are all fans of the car, especially high-performance cars, which are the result of generations of blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and perseverance. The Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder soundtrack perfectly matches the visual design and content. I donâ€™t want to play the finale, but the final road sequence to "Days like these" by Quincy Jones can lead to tears in her eyes. Enjoy it!
