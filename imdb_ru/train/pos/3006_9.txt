Although 9 may seem an unusually high rate for such a small film, however, compared with the hundreds and hundreds of serial detective films of the 1930s and 40s, it is one of the best and very profitable compared to the later “thin” Powell Man. ” Movies. Now this does NOT mean that this film is similar to the films about “Thin Man", since THE KENNEL MURDER CASE is not a comedy, but rather a traditional detective-detective film. Now you might think that the absence of Nora Charles or Asty or the traditional comic friend (h something that can be found in almost all serials of detective films) for the sake of entertainment would be detrimental, but I didn’t miss them at all, because it was an exceptionally well-written film - with a really interesting case and equally great performances of all. <br / > <br /> The film begins at a dog show and is called the KENNEL Killer Case, although this film by Philo Vance is actually spent on it. Little time at the dog show and dogs are not a super-important part of the film. Instead, a completely hated person is killed and left in a completely closed room - the idea is repeated in several other detective films (such as The Strange Case of the Doctor's Criminal). However, the way all this is explained seems plausible enough and fits very well with each other - keeping my interest throughout. I’m sure that other detective films of that day had the same intelligently written plots and an exceptional game like this one. This is definitely a keeper.
