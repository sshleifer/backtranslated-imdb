“Sunny Boys” is a funny adaptation of Neil Simon’s play about the retired vaudevilla team in 1975, played by Walter Mattau and George Burns, who had a very bitter break and were asked to reunite again for a television event or something that they still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other. Richard Benjamin looks like Mattau's nephew, a theatrical agent, who was given a huge responsibility for making this reunion a reality. This warm and winning comedy is a great valentine for a forgotten kind of entertainment ... vaudeville, and it works mainly due to one of the best scenarios of Neil Simon and the outstanding work of Mattaw, Burns and Benjamin. For this, Burns won the best supporting actor, but I think Mattau is leaving with this film with his impeccably cheerful performance in the role of Willy Clark. Mattau was nominated for "Best Male Role," but Nicholson had no chance to play "ONE TOP ABOVE COOKIE'S NEST"; but a year later it was an Oscar-worthy performance. Matthau controls the screen, and there are no false notes in this beautifully designed performance. The scene where he auditions for an ad for potato chips and cannot correctly name the product is a classic one. THE SUNSHINE BOYS is Neil Simon's warm and victorious comedy that shines thanks to the unsurpassed chemistry between Mattaw and Burns.
