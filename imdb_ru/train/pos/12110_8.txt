For those of you who think that anime is a giant reptile, raping schoolgirls, think again. Japanese animation has a completely different side. Yakitate! Japan is one of those shows. This is a cute tale about a boy with a gift to make delicious bread. His universe - the creation of Japanese bread, which can be compared with the famous European bread. The show is just as stupid as they are, and Iâ€™m sure that non-Japanese viewers will miss many jokes. But it is still very pleasant to watch because of the complete innocent atmosphere of the show. <br /> <br /> In the world of yakitate! People often look as if they have just had an orgasm after eating bread. Bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide range of supernormal abilities, from time travel to swimming like fish. This strange aspect makes it one of the least predictable and amusing shows I've watched lately.
