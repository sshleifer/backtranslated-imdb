I watch the show back to back as quickly as possible. I'm trying to see all things Star Trek. This is the 3rd month, and now I'm in the third season of TNG, and I have already completed DS9. Star Trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever to be achieved. <br /> <br /> “Grayscale” is the first episode in the TNG series. Just watching the show, these clips were fresh in my memory, but I noticed how several of them were re-shot, because the film looked better. The first season always seemed gloomy and ugly to me, and the actors looked silly, as if they didn't fit under their skins. <br /> <br /> The show essentially consists of the best hits of the happiest and saddest moments in Riker's life on the Enterprise up to this point. The scene of Data and Riker in the holo-deck is a classic moment of new friendship. My other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the Klingon ship defies Riker's authority as the first officer, and Riker knocks out the live CRAP from this Klingon. Then the admiral kicks him, but well. This whole episode is a damn reminder that there are A LOT of crazy, wonderful things that have already happened in 2 seasons, 5 more and a few more films! At this stage of the series, they are really starting to develop the emotions that link Riker with Dinah Troy as Imzad. Up to this point they mentioned this fact, but they have yet to use it. Let the record show that ST Wiki - Memory Alpha claims that Imzadi means "first" and means that she had a close relationship with Riker, and also remains deeply close to emotional. This episode proves once again that for a long time there will be intense romantic interest in each other. <br /> <br /> Here is the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi At this point in the series, the production value is at its best, and Star Trek TNG turns into a science fiction hippo with which was destined to become. Looking at it again, as an adult, I now see which GREAT Star Trek universe works. They really need to make a new ST series after all current shows. A DS9 movie would be good too.
