It was incredible, it meant that it was hard to believe that the “forgotten tribe” would perform this amazing migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Shodzek, did not put on some scenes and scenes. But what they are shots! The cinematography, mostly in extreme conditions, is gorgeous, and the multitude of Iranian music added to the video release adds extra wealth to this memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing this and “Kon Tiki” on the same weekend, which was exciting and, of course, made me realize how cool, hardy and courageous people can be, whether it’s primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science.
