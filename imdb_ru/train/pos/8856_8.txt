Before the devil knows that your death begins promisingly, he creates a simple robbery that does not go as they say from different points of view (in the style of RASHOMON). For about an hour, Sidney Lumet turns this film into something much more than the sum of its parts; ultimately, it turns into a multifaceted family drama that explores the whole sphere of human emotions / relationships when the story reaches its chilling climax. <br /> <br /> As in the case of Lumet, he manages to persuade the exceptional performance of his star-studded cast, without any concept of excessive action or hyperbole. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious and interesting character and often a dwarf by Ethan Hawke, who plays his brother Hank. This does not mean that Hawk is not bad; in fact, he is completely inadequate, in a problem role corresponding to his style. Marisa Tomei is great for her relatively short appearance (the fact that she exposes her flesh adds to this). The character of Albert Finney (the father of Andy and Hank) is the most intriguing, and in my opinion, he deserves a little more time on the screen. Amy Ryan also does her job adequately. <br /> <br /> BEFORE EVIL THAT YOU ARE DEAD, this is not an exceptional film, but it proves that Lumet is still at the top of her game in the (apparent) twilight of a glorified career. Many of his features and trademarks appear here, not least of which the use of his characters is connected. Infiltrated with a killer scenario (no pun intended), intelligent dialogue and stimulation, and a decent score, BEFORE YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE DEAD, you definitely need to see. A truly undervalued gem. 8/10. 3 stars (of 4). Must just enter the top 250 at 248. Highly recommended.
