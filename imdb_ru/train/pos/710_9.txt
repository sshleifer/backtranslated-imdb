Although I do not agree with the decision of Bob and Tammy to leave the child to Jesse, and I would never do that, they tried to do what was best for the child. The way this film is written, you see how you immerse yourself in the story and ask yourself what you really believe in from all different aspects. Patty Duke? Antagonist? As far as I know, almost unheard of. But during the movie she really convinces you that she is a psychopath or at least something seriously wrong with her. Her character means "emotionally disturbed." The film seems to end quickly, leaving some things unsolved. But besides this, this film is really great. It really makes you think. This is not a movie to watch when you just want to relax and watch something cute that makes you laugh. But this is a good film to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs, look at things from the perspective of others and learn something about yourself. Warning: you can even grow while watching this movie! And all this is worth it in the end.
