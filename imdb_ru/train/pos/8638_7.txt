David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young couple of journalists who want to go to California but cannot afford it, so they “share their stakes” with another young couple (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save on expenses. so that they stop at different places of murder along the way, places where serial killers did their work, since Brian (Duchovny) is a writer, and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. What they don't know is that Pitt (Earley) and Lewis are a serial killer and a girl who just agrees with what he says. I, as a rule, do not care about Pitt, but he rightly refers to psycho roles. It is terrible that he makes them so well; I am actually FAMOUS people like him before, no, not killers, but with almost the same thinking. In any case, when the trip goes, Kerry realizes that the others have almost no money, but it seems that Early always somehow comes with cash ... ... never think that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though. Lewis fulfills her role, we All, in which she succeeds, not too bright wafers with a good heart, but not realizing that she does not need to put up with the beating of Airlie, when she does something that he does not like. As things become more and more unacceptable, Carrie insists that the other couple be thrown out to the gas station, and, unfortunately, at the very moment she is inside, she sees a newsletter that says exactly who they share trips to, after which things go down for them on a quick clip. This is not the best movie in the world, but it's not bad ... I watched what was supposed to be "without rating", but I wonder how much it was cut from the nominal version, because it seemed to me rather tame, in fact. .. not that it makes him family, or something like that, unless it is Manson. 7 out of 10.
