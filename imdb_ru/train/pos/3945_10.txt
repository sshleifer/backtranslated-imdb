The rating is only 5, because it is a film in which one could use the best action and direction (or at least music!). Nevertheless, for the achievements of Walt Whitman, he deserves 10. The previous poster calls the film trashy, however, I think that this is a simple case of not seeing the forest for the trees. The filmmakers were obviously more interested in telling a story than in a brilliant Hollywood feature film. And for that, I applaud them - the fact that this is not the mainstream also reflects the life of Whitman. This film is more documentary than acting. Being fascinated by such a story, when you rarely hear about such stories that shape today's mental health, is the most important thing. I found this a very pleasant look at the story.
