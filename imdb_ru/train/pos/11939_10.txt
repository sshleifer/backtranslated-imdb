I always liked this great baseball movie! He has a good cast, including two amazing actors and two of My favorites, Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in this movie are Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Toni Longo, Tony Danza and Matthew McConaughey! Also Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The film has great special effects and acting of all the actors of the film! All baseball scenes are realistic! The music of composer Randy Edelman is very good, and it fits very well with the film! Some of the actors who reminded me are real baseball personalities. Ray Mitchell's character from Stony Jackson reminded me of Royce Clayton, McConaugheyâ€™s character reminded me of Steve Finley, and commentator Jay Sanders, in my opinion, reminded me of what Al Braboski looks today. This is a fantastic movie for non-baseball fans, and I highly recommend this movie!
