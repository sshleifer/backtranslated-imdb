This is not a movie that you watch for fun, at least most people I know would not. <br /> <br /> This is a portrait of the cruelty of both the body and the mind, which happens quite well in the war, the characters seem believable, especially because you “read their thoughts”, something is more common in books and rarely in however, this part is very well done. I would put it next to “Everything is quiet on the western front” and “Die Brücke” to leave an indelible impression. <br /> <br /> I would like to show it at school along with two other films - but finding a copy was quite difficult - it is a shame.
