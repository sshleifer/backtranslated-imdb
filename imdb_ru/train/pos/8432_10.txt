I did not read anything about the movie before I accidentally watched it last Saturday night. And then, when I watched it, I felt the sufferings of Lena and Boesman in their bones. I was so fascinated by the game, the tone and the shooting that I only listened to the dialogues in part. My husband fell asleep shortly after we went to bed, and I was sleepless under the influence of the film. I wanted to wake him up just to say: "If I ever voted for an Oscar nomination, that would be for these two actors." I decided to wait until the next day. Then I read more about the movie on IMDb, and I was sad to know that Mr. Berry died before the movie was released and that he probably never saw the latest version of his brilliant masterpiece. I still want to tell him that for me his film was a real independent film, in its concept and spirit. Actors deserve praise not only for their brilliant performance, but also for the fact that they took the role without brilliance, without boasting, but, on the contrary, demonstrating the true image of human depression. Sad but sharp.
