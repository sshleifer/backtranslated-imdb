This movie does it right. As a former aviation cadet of the USAF, I can say that there is everything in this film. Boredom of the application process. Waiting for the word. The joy of acceptance. Anxiety about passing the course. The sorrow of watching your friends (perhaps the best of them) is washed out. The torment of paying the final price is the death of student pilots. Glory to the prom. Always fly, fly, fly. Many are called, but few are chosen. We did for a fee that we would willingly pay to do.
