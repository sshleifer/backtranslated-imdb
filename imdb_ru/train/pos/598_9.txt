Here's a funny fact, I was a kid in a movie, the one in the crib. :) I'm 19 years old now. my parents took me to try for a role, we lived in texas at the time. I think I earned only 80 bucks, but I haven't been in this for a very long time. My parents said that I would cry when I should have been happy, and would have been happy when I should have cried. I was all confused. A strange and funny fact, I suppose .. and no, I'm not a child actress. I live in San Antonio, I work at Walgreens. I ended up here in Texas, but I lived most of my life in Maryland. This film is a great movie, but a good concept. I have seen it several times in my short 19 years.
