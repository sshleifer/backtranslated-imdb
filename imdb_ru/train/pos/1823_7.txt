I remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old, but the strange thing is that I never watched it after that. I looked after the other day, and my cousin never saw All Dogs Go To Heaven, so we rented both films and watched them together today, and he really loved those films. When I watched this movie again, I remembered so many memories, and I have to admit that I even cried a little. I'm 22 years old and the ending comes to me. All Dogs Go To Heaven is one of the most moving cartoon films, and I'm honestly shocked by the 5.8 rating. I thought this film would bring good memories to others. I admit that the animation was a bit typical, but the story is just enchanting and funny. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a gambling dog killed by another gambling dog, Carface. But when Charlie wants revenge, he returns to Earth with a clock that cannot stop ticking, or is this the end of his life again. When he and his best friend, Itchy, look for Carface and watch him, they find out how Carface gets all his money, he has a little orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who is going to win the race. Charlie picks up the girl, Anne-Marie, and makes false promises to get the money. But in the end he learns that perhaps he should put Anne-Marie in the first place, when Carridge takes revenge on him. <br /> <br /> All Dogs Go To Heaven is the perfect family movie, it's not Disney, but it's a great family movie to watch. Not to mention that it is so cute and touching. I know this is ridiculous, and some people call me crazy, but this film for me, when I was a kid, made me believe that dogs have souls. How could they not? They just love it, and I think I'll cry again. But in any case, I would recommend this movie to everyone, this is a funny movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
