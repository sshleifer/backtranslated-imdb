I admit the creation of high expectations before viewing, because some friends mentioned it (and they are not perverts!), As you should see. And this is a must see! Just do not expect to see something great. <br /> <br /> Freudian psychoanalysis is interesting in many parts of the film, but there are too many perversions in them, and as a result they do not stick. <br /> <br /> Some of the good things are an analysis of Blue Keslowski, most of David Lynch, some of Hitchcock, and perhaps a couple more that I missed (I just remembered ... Dogville), and I usually don’t I skip things, if only they are too obvious or poorly visible. <br /> <br /> The documentary is not only repeated, which makes it too long, but also pleasing in the sense that it notices some of the perversions that feed our unconscious, and therefore, the commercial success of most thrillers has been studied and used as basis for this theory. <br /> <br /> I really liked the energetic tone of the narrative and Mr. Zizek’s efforts to revive Freud’s theory, which was too numb, especially in North America. Again, this is too much, and I believe that this is not a waste of time, because I believe that most people gloomily value death and blood.
