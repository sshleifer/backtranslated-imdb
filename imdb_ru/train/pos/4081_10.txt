I have seen almost all the Miyazaki films, and they are all beautiful and adorable. But this one rises above the rest. This film made a strong impression on me! <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Paz and Shita, with their sweet, caring friendship. They made the film for me. Of course, the animation is also superb, and the music perfectly conveys the feelings in the film. But the characters in this film are a bright point: they are so well developed and full of individuality. <br /> <br /> Now let me clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie submarines). Although English dub is good (mostly), it just fades away from the original language version. The voices are better, the dialogues, everything. Therefore, I propose to watch (and hear) the film as it was originally.
