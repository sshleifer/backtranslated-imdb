Miss DeCarlo’s star debut has everything writers could think of — from the Franco-Prussian War to the American Civil War, the great American West, the heyday of San Francisco, ballet, opera, vaudeville, bandits on the stage bus and Chinese trash. Just when you thought that the plot could not be crazy, this is so. This is great, tongue in cheek. DeCarlo's character (here she is called Anna Marie - NOT Salome, this is the role she dances) is largely based on the career of the notorious Lola Montez, who was the mistress of the King of Prussia and caused a revolution, when he gave her the crown jewels, She escaped to the American West . In Arizona, there is a city called Salome, where she danced, based on the historical fact that Lola Montes danced the role of Salome there. StageCoach Cleve and the Russian nobleman who fall under her spell are not historically accurate, and I believe that this is a Chinese sage with a Scottish accent - but this is one of my favorite classic songs of all time, and DeCarlo is amazing in everything.
