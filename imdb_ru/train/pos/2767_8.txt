Gregory Peck gives a brilliant presentation in this film. The last 15 minutes (or so) are great, and Peck is an absolute joy to watch. However, this is not the case with the rest of the film. It's not terrible, and I'm sure it was done with good intentions, but the only real reason (to be honest) to see is Peck. Otherwise, you better just read the Old Testament.
