As a person who was looking for existence as a “professional” person with an income supported by a bachelor in chemistry and a master in business management, my sanity was always spastic supported by external concessions in more artistic things. My postgraduate courses have always been emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, stained glass, ceramics, metal forging / welding, and artistic drawing, which also included screen printing. <br /> <br /> I also keep healthy with running, walking and, more recently, hiking to remote places in California and nearby states such as Utah, Arizona and Nevada. Jogging, walking and hiking brings a person to the ground, and he has time to stop, watch and listen, as well as take a picture or record sounds. <br /> <br /> Against this background, I was obsessed with rivers and tides. I was equally impressed with the documentary content of the artist Andy Goldsworthy, as well as with the skill and smoothness of the director / cinematographer Thomas Rydelsheimer. In fact, I could not separate the art of Goldsworthy from the Riedelsheimer camera. <br /> <br /> Great. Wonderful. Wonderful.
