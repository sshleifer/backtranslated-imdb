Execution of "Oscar-caliber" Peter Falk in the role of "Oscar-caliber." I liked the nuanced, balanced study of a long-standing marriage - how often do we get it in films, where the film usually ends when a boy and a girl get together? This is a film for adults, a complex look through the eyes of all parties - husband, wife, son - how each has adapted to each other in the past and has developed throughout the story. On top of that, it gave me about 10 major belly laughs, and I'm one of those people who usually sit without addiction, when the rest of the audience laughs. It was one of the few really funny movies I've ever seen. Great original jokes.
