What a night. Then Perry Mason had Gun, Will Travel, and then Gunsmoke (when it was half an hour), and finally, “Sea Hunt” with its wonderful opening music theme and sailing of Mike's boat came to a new adventure at 22:30. Awesome Regardless of the story, it was the main character (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest, sincere. Man and Boy. This aroused interest in the boats, which lasted for years. Why they do not show on cable or do not make it available on video, I do not know .. Sorry, bad.
