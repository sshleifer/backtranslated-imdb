Generally speaking, the plot was much better than I expected. The laugh track was a bit annoying at times and tended to interfere; however, in this episode there were enough real giggles to make up for it. My biggest surprise was finding some of the best lines, and the situations were not shown in trailers. Spade, in particular, was not presented in the best light in earlier promotions, but his character is fairly well found in the pilot game. There are enough candies to please almost anyone, and all the ordinary characters seem ready to perform their task. Now, if the authors can simply correspond to what they started.
