[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> I have this girlfriend, for whom the idea that her parents have sex makes her terribly awkward. It occurred to me when I reflected on the reaction of the audience to Mother. <br /> <br /> People gasped when May (Ann Reed) was passionately wriggling in bed with her younger lover, Darren (Daniel Craig) or later saw sexually explicit drawings for May. I doubt the public was horrified by the nudes or the content of the drawings, and I also felt embarrassed to see a woman aged 60 enjoying sex. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi (“My Beautiful Laundry”, “My“ Son-Fanatic ”) once again proves why he is one of the scariest narrators on both sides of the Atlantic. His story is not easy to take. This stinging family drama is not the movie that you can say you enjoyed watching because it is rough, complex and often makes us very uncomfortable. However, this is a very good thing. <br /> <br /> Kureishi and Roger Michelle (director of Notting Hill) create an unsentimental, painful and magnificently acting portrait of an elderly woman who, in the end, understands these years she can and should enjoy all the joys of life. At a surprisingly obvious moment, when her son Bobby asks her not to be difficult, May answers, “Why not?” <br /> <br /> Why not. <br /> <br /> Ann Reed deserves an Oscar nomination for her turn in May. It is thin, discreet, powerful and sad, often all at the same time. Watch Reed as Mei watches Darren and Paula (Catherine Bradshaw) in a seemingly passionate grip on the pub. Or when she asks Paulo to open the front door after a disastrous date. Reid's eyes and face reveal all the sufferings and despair of May. At the most destructive moment of the film, May falls to his knees in front of Darren, wanting to do something for him, only asking him to be kind. This is an amazingly bold performance by a wonderful actress. <br /> <br /> I liked the use of Michell's natural sound, especially when May and Toots first came to see Bobby. This beautifully illustrated the cacophony around May and Toots, the frivolous manner in which their own family welcomed them. <br /> <br /> This film at times reminded me of the honesty and rudeness of Mike Lee’s work, with the exception of “Mom” holding on to a slight sense of optimism to keep afloat. <br /> <br /> My only deception: the decision Michella gives May and Darren's first love scene an almost cheesy sensibility. The lovers are out of focus, while in the foreground a white curtain flutters gently in the wind. And the only sound in May is in the throes of passion. <br /> <br /> The problem with Michella’s approach is that both Reed and Craig, who fully performs the po eh Darren, so fearlessly make their way into these roles, that it is dishonest to hide the almost primitive energy of their characters from the audience, especially since Michell has no doubts about making the later sex scenes internal. <br /> <br /> There are no very nice characters in this film. We sympathize with May, but she also causes her daughter to suffer, but I doubt that Kureishi wanted to tell people his story with a pleasant people. I believe that his goal was to expose a family that has already broken up when something emotionally catastrophic happens. It is unshakable in its sincerity and ultimately unforgettable.
