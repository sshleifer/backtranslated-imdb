Zashchita Luzhina is a good film with excellent central productions, but too much novel and not enough director skill. For most of the film, it was felt that the characters simply helped to advance the story. Marlene Gorris could possibly have studied Luzhin’s psyche, instead of portraying him as a tormented, innocent victim, torn apart by the cruel motives of others. <br /> <br /> Adaptation of literature for the screen is certainly a difficult task, especially a novel written in the early 20th century. This film does not sufficiently reveal the relationship between Luzhin and Natalia. Natalia's break with her mother comes up against her mother’s gross disagreement, and not a dramatic flash in the film. I felt that I had experienced the torment of Luzhin and the possible tragic end, without having enjoyed the revelation of his unusual and complex personality. Nevertheless, it was a touching and pleasant film, but, of course, not very good.
