After I had just “welcomed the house” of my 23-year-old daughter from a year in Iraq, at Camp Anaconda’s medical department, I felt obliged to get this DVD. I wanted to hear other feelings of returning vets, to try to better understand her mentality on arrival and not to wait until something bad happened. Regardless of your view of war and peace, this film will be a great start for all Americans to begin healing our returning veterinarians for emotional emptiness. The paramount approval of the entire film is “Act” on the issue. Incredibly emotional movie. I highly recommend this film to the veterinarians of the entire mature family and ask them to complete the plan to listen to consolation and help the returning Gulf War veterans. My daughter saw this DVD. He took into account her emotions and in fact made a commitment to recharge another 6 years. Her time on the sand is that she did something good. Local Balad children received first-class medical care for various common ailments that they usually cannot afford free with an escort and a translator. Her gaze over her shoulder was on her tour of Iraq. “We have changed some hearts and minds there.” A magnificent DVD, you must be unbiased and watch from all sides.
