Why do you watch this? Of course, there is no reason why you should not watch this! Great and funny director Albert and David Mazles, Gray Gardens was originally conceived as a film about East Hamptonâ€™s gentrification, but it turned out that it would be more interesting for the brothers to conduct a study on the eccentric life of two Edith Bouvier Beals, aunt and cousin Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Their life was certainly funny (Edith spent most of her day in bed operas, sings, Edie performed pirouettes and majorette dances with her numerous cats, one name was Ted Z. Kennedy). The film is interesting because he was funny and sad. Edith died shortly after the film was released (in February 1977) at the age of 82 after experiencing the fame that she and Edie received after the film (she danced and sang at a nightclub. Eddie Beal Jr. was born in 1925 and still lives in Miami. The beach is a fascinating and fascinating film.
