I saw a couple of movies about eating disorders, but this one was definitely my favorite. The problem with others was that people with eating disorders by the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help, that's all. This film, it seemed to me, was more realistic, because in this film the main character Lexi does not automatically get better. She gets better and then has a flaw. I think that this film shows more than others that I have seen that improvement does not just happen, it’s hard work and takes time, it’s a long way to recovery. I think this film shows it all very well. There should be more films like this.
