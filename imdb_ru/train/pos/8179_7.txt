It would be a lot of fun to see in the theater back in 1996. In my taste of the film there is a corner of pleasure that truly appreciates really shocking films. <br /> <br /> The “dentist” is sometimes panned, probably because people usually have strong feelings about the teeth. The ADA may have launched a campaign against this, since dentists report that they should apologize for this film and for Marathoner (in which there is only one scene comparable to many in Dentist). <br /> <br /> It is surprising to note that, according to the trivia page, the film was shot in 21 days. Of course, post-production can sometimes take longer than shooting a movie, and editing "The Dentist" is the perfect image. The quick cuts so exacerbate the tension that in the scene where the Dentist “cares” about his wife, there are only two quick cuts showing what is happening. The rest is left to our very fruitful imagination! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for this role, as he has a lot of experience playing with psychologically “non-standard” characters, and he completely sold obsessive-compulsive aspects of the dentist. <br /> <br /> For me, the pace of the film was just right. The filmmakers show the arrogance of his wife in the right direction. All the characters in the dental office look like real people working in a real office. There are a lot of stress when they are dealing with impatient people waiting for the arrival of the dentist. Meanwhile, the dentist is on the verge of a huge psychotic disorder! Unlike many films of this genre, the script is very, very tough. All victims fall into the dentist's trap very prudently. Two types of law enforcement officers even participate in a small plot that ultimately creates an autopsy shocker at the end. <br /> <br /> Definitely not for the faint of heart or the fantarists, but for real roller coasters and highly recommended for lovers of intelligent city festivals.
