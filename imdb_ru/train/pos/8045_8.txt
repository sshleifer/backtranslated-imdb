I finally set myself up to rent a DVD by mail in order to find films in stores inaccessible to me. I chose Opposite Souler because I love Christopher Meloni, and I also like small, often ignored films. <br /> <br /> This is a pleasure! Meloni has such a charm in this piece. It's easy to catch him, if only you see him as your alter ego of Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this film, Meloni is an impregnable middle of life, which in many respects hits the runners, only to find the path to happiness for someone unexpected. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Basfield's character is realistic and not over. I have not seen Busfield since he was 30, and he was interested in watching. But it was the whole movie of Chris. I became such a fan again. <br /> <br /> At first, I'm a little slow, I admit. I thought some of the "memories" might have been edited. But overall, this film will delight you, be it a man or a woman, because today he has an honest, refreshing look at relationships.
