It was a really great movie. I loved Dennis Quaid and the whole baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very pleasant actor who is very pleasant to watch. The chemistry that the team had when they collected things was impressive, it simply shows what you can achieve when minds are united in a single goal. This team returned from the brink, winning several seasons to win almost everything. I like these films because they are really very inspirational. <br /> <br /> In addition, Dennis Quaid's character gets a place in the big leagues. You can't do anything, but you support this guy. It just seems that when someone needs to do something, he is going to do it. It just happens that everything falls into place. <br /> <br /> Based on real events, this film really makes you think that “nothing is impossible.”
