<br /> <br /> Charlie Kaufman made a strange metaphysical longing popular, but this pearl of Canada makes him jovial. <br /> <br /> As in most strange films, the less talk about the plot, the better, but let's prepare the scene, two friends Anthony and Dave have been together since childhood, they cannot cope with the world, and ultimately This means that they do not want to have any longer. But it is here that even more problems begin. <br /> <br /> I liked this film, it made me smile long after the final credits, and this is a rare case with so many massive “nothing” pieces. <br /> <br /> Don't miss. <br /> <br />
