This is a superbly made, simplified film that explores the topic and gives each viewer something special that they extract from it. The premise is simple: an unnamed celebrity actor (Morgan Freeman) decides to look for a new role by visiting the store and watching people. He takes a special interest in the box office in the “10 Objects or Less” Lane (Paz Vega), whom he finds an amiable, strong and curious presence. <br /> <br /> Both actors brilliantly play with each other and bring a solid dimension to the characters in what is learning the character. Not the usual learning character; each of them represents whole worlds. The cashier’s life is bogged down in the harsh and disappointing “real world,” while the actor is so immersed in his fantastic existence that he cannot perform simple tasks, such as memorizing phone numbers. He readily admits that he is looking at his face when he is talking to people, and the whole point of research of real people shows that he is not one of them. <br /> <br /> But not only the actor is inspired by real people for his work; we see the reverse process. Several characters recognize “Him” and refer to how he inspired them with his movie roles. <br /> <br /> The cashier’s favorite song “Al Pasar la Barca” about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and instead prefers to pay (that is: do honest work) for going through the boat, it’s better not to choose. He parallels the character of Vega, the only store worker with any brains or ambitions who is willing to work hard to succeed. (This is a true ambition for someone who looks like Paz Vega.) This is a strange little film, perhaps made in small quantities. If you do not mind the slow pace and the "talkative" approach, this film will be entertaining. The characters contrast beautifully, and the spectacular game makes them attractive. Nice watch
