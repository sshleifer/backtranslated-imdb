In 1594 in Brazil, the Indians Tupinambas became friends of the Franks, and their enemies - the Tupinikins, the friends of the Portuguese. The Frenchman (Arduíno Colassanti) is captured by Tupinambás, and, despite his attempt to convince them that he is French, they believe that he is Portuguese. The Frenchman becomes their slave and lives married to Seboipepe (Ana Maria Magallians). Later, he uses gunpowder in the cannons left by the Portuguese to defeat the deadlocks in the battle. To celebrate the victory, the Indians decided to eat it. <br /> <br /> Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês is another great low-budget film by the great Brazilian director Nelson Pereira dos Santos. The script is very original, and the story is told in the Tupi language. The film is shot using natural light most of the time and is very realistic. Actors and actresses are naked, and Anna Maria Magallans is gorgeous, demonstrates a beautiful body and gives an amazing presentation. The sound is produced by a Brazilian musician Zé Rodrix. This film shows the beginning of the exploitation of my country by Europeans, while concentrating in Portuguese and French, trading with the Indians and exchanging combs and mirrors with our natural resources. This film was awarded at national festivals such as the Brazilian Film Festival in Brazil in 1971 (Festival de Brazília do Cinema Brasileiro), for best screenplay (Nelson Pereira dos Santos), Best Dialog (Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Umberto Mauro) and Best kenograf (Regis Monteiro); Association of art historians of São Paulo (Associação Paulista dos Críticos de Arte) with the best Revelation of the Year (Ana Maria Magalhães) and some other prizes.
