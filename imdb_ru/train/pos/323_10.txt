This is a really great film with a revolutionary message (both in form and content) that no fan of the French New Wave or the Underground film should miss. There are hardly opening or closing loans - we are simply immersed in the world of consumer art, revolution and youth. This film has nothing to do with the documentary and is more interesting, playing with our ideas of advertising and its relation to reality. The lines of the real and the unreal intersect in ways familiar to the films discussing documentaries, but this time we do it for the sake of consumption and marketing, and not to describe the real.
