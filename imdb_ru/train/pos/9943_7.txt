The film never claims to be something exciting, like in many films. Movies are supported as a fun and entertaining time. And this is exactly what it was. This is the Korean version of "Bring It On". <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, you can feel the rest of the film and how it will end, but the pleasure does not cause unexpected turns, and at the same time, the film is an exact copy of another. Instead, pleasure is held in the journey of how the two remaining "thugs" became human beings in their own right. Therefore, the film is fun and exciting. <br /> <br /> Camera work, especially undercarriage, was very well executed. The script, being a bit weak, was overly pleasant in the fact that the characters were not two-dimensional, but full of life and desire. This film won neither an Oscar nor a DVD blockbuster sale, but also a fun time and a fun experience.
