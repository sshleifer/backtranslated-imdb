Kurt Russell is at his best as a man who lives by his past glory, Renault Hightower. Robin Williams - his polar opposite in a rare low-key game in the role of Jack Dundee. He threw the Great Pass in many ways. <br /> <br /> You will see some of the most worthy of scenes ever put into a single movie, when Jack hisses on a rat, Reno poses and the call of the caribou go. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this classic, which is not afraid to show football in the dirt as it should be played.
