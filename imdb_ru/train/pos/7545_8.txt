I really loved it, although, reading reviews, it was quite disturbing to me .. But as an anime art fan, I can fully understand this beautiful work of art, although some of them were against my cultures and beliefs .. But hey, this is the world of art .. !! The beginning of the film is very strong, strange and confusing. it's hard to understand the content that makes me respect the one who made it. only one who is extremely open can make such a bold film .. this is absolutely not for children .. even though the characters are cute and charming, they experience some disturbing adventures that cannot be erased (sorry if the spelling is wrong) from the memory ...
