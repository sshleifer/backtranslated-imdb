I saw this film only after having heard about it for many years. Needless to say, the actual experience turned out to be a bit controversial. But, nevertheless, Alec Guinness is energetically led by a wonderful cast in a hilarious, albeit formal, rush around industrial England after World War II. <br /> <br /> This is a familiar story about how to invent the perfect everyday product. Remember the machine that runs on water? Remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, it is a fabric that does not wear out, does not fold, and does not even get dirty! Of course, fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified by the prospect of ruin, and therefore the plot becomes a little denser. <br /> <br /> Guinness makes the whole enterprise worthy of attention, and watching it blow up The factory research laboratory is a real explosion again and again! (These Britons ... always have a tight upper lip when under fire.) The film may puff just like a silly Guinness invention, but still itâ€™s a good trip.
