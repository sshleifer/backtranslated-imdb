Moonwalker is probably not the movie you want to watch if you're not a Michael Jackson fan. I'm a big fan, and I liked most of the movie, the final was not fantastic, but the first 50 minutes were - if you're a fan. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that the first 50 minutes can be viewed many times. Dancing in every video is breathtaking, fantastic music to listen to, and fascinating dialogue. <br /> <br /> Many of his best videos from Bad and excerpts from his previous videos were included. It also includes several live concerts. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Michael Jackson, this is a must, if you are not a fan / do not like Michael Jackson, stay away. <br /> <br /> 9/10
