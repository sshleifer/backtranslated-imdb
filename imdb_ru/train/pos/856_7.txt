Delivery of some very humorous rude lines by Pierce Brosnan is itself worth the cost of admission. He plays a kind of "psycho twin James Bond," separated at birth, no doubt. As a strong assassin, his character is very sexy, but even better, very funny. Add a kind-hearted, very handsome American “next door” Greg Kinnear to adjust the contrast. A lot of locations, bright colors and quick-witted humor provide excellent entertainment. Hope Davis is well perceived as a “pearl wife.” But the focus of the film is two guys, the new “Strange Couple,” and this is the part that works very well. deeper
