First of all, I have to give it to the people who put this thing together. September 11 is such a delicate question that it takes a lot of courage to create a film that dares to argue about it. It's a shame, though not surprisingly, that the film was banned in the USA. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I think the film is great with a couple of weak points. The film begins with the Iranian segment, which is somewhat reminiscent of the work of Majid Majidi (absolutely beautiful "children of heaven" and "color of paradise"). As in these two films, the clip demonstrates what happened with the innocent eyes of Afghan refugees in Iran. Absolutely beautiful clip. The same goes for the clip by Sean Penn, which is also great. But just as some of the clips are beautiful, others are absolutely cruel. Alejandro González Inarritu performs the Mexican music video and, like his torturous "Amores perros", does it as badly as he can. Most of the clip is a black screen with a few sounds playing in the background. These sounds relate to the reporters and their shock from the fall of the second plane, those who called home from burning towers and left messages for their families, those who were angry ... and he combines this with flashes of people jumping from the towers, Very complex to view a clip that you will not forget. <br /> <br /> Some clips can be very difficult for Americans to watch, because some of them can be interpreted as “you are not the only ones who suffer.” In particular, Egyptian and British clips that not only talk about it, but and turn the tables over and say how much suffering the US has caused other people. <br /> <br /> I will also specifically mention clips from Bosnia. Herzegovina, France, India and Japan (although the last one may seem terribly inappropriate, but in fact this is not the case). <br /> <br /> However, not all videos are good, and I I will note this clip from Israel, which, in my opinion, is extremely weak. While the idea was good (the reporter is on the scene of the terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, but his story comes up because what happened in New York - this is what many of us who live in countries at war refer to as understanding it is awful. The video ends with being just an entertaining reporter trying to get airtime at any cost, the guy who says he is a witness and hopes that he can go on TV and the soldiers and m workers simply shout "because." The video can not cover the drama of this situation. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see this, then you should, that is, if you are not a conservative, in this case you shouldn’t interfere, as you might be offended. But if not, you can find out how many of us outside of the United States have experienced September 11th.
