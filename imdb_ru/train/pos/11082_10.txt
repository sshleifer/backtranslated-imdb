I watched this film when I was almost a child, and naturally I was moved to tears by this story about a family of foxes. Fantastic landscapes in Hokkaido, superb story-telling and, equally important, a wonderful soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the characters. I'm still looking for some kind of great soundtrack copy. For German viewers, it would be helpful to know that the DEFA dubbing is the only one worth listening to. I taped both (DEFA and BR), but I only continue to look through the first one.
