Many of the user comments that I saw on IMDB for this film are not really justified. First of all, let me say that this film cannot be taken seriously. It should be a fun and at the same time stupid film that you donâ€™t need to think about, just enjoy it. If you are watching this film with the intention of seeing a masterpiece in a movie or in humor, then you will be very disappointed. However, if you just want to watch a dull movie with some talented actors / actresses and some successful phrases, then you will like it.
