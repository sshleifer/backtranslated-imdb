If the themes “Girls from Missouri” sound familiar, it should happen. This is because Anita Loos, who wrote the script here, also wrote the classic Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in this film, Gene Harlow will accept any decorations from people with means. <br /> <br /> And this is Gene Harlow - these are people with the means. She leaves the house on the side of the road, driven by her mother and stepfather, because she decided that the best way to get an easy life is to marry her. Her talents as singers are limited, but she will be able to exchange this beauty. <br /> <br /> Her odyssey begins with the fact that she and her friend Patsy Kelly receive an invitation to speak at a party hosted by a millionaire. Lewis Stone But without the knowledge of Gene Stone, just a wild last shot before you do it yourself, because of the money that he should not. Nevertheless, she extracts a few trinkets from him that are noticed by another millionaire Lionel Barrymore. <br /> <br /> Lionel is surprised by this, while Gene does not look at his playboy son, Franchot Ton. After that, he is not surprised, and he seems to be rid of Jin from climbing the family tree. <br /> <br /> “Girl from Missouri” was launched into the serial adaptation of “Codex”, therefore it was subjected to special censorship. I have a feeling that we would see a much more risky movie. Nevertheless, Gene Harlow as a younger and audacious version of Mae West is always appreciated. What a wonderful comic talent this woman has - to see “The Girl from Missouri” is a sad reminder of the great loss that the world of cinema has suffered with her departure three years later. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, the casting of Patsy Kelly with Na Harlow undoubtedly influenced the successful shorts that Kelly did with another famous platinum blonde Telma Todd. Harlow and Kelly have the same light chemistry as Patsy and Thelma. Todd will also die a year later as a result of a monstrous accident / suicide / murder, which has never received a satisfactory explanation. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the girl from Missouri, she is bright and bold, must be from all these sparkling jewelry.
