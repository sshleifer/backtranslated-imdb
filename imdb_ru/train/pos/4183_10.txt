I saw this film a long time ago, but I found it amazing, and to this day it never ceases to amaze me. <br /> <br /> A beautiful film about a group of Australian commandos who tried to sink some Japanese ships in the Singapore harbor during World War II. <br /> <br /> These commandos are captured in civilian clothes, and the Japanese kidnappers consider them spies. But something happens that has been little studied in any Hollywood film about World War II, which I saw. <br /> <br /> A close and friendly relationship develops between the captors and the captives. They begin to respect each other, while the captain of captured Australian soldiers becomes the best friend of a senior Japanese prison guard. This is the most wonderful part of the whole movie, and it really pulls your heart out. <br /> <br /> Soon, when two friends are talking, the Australian captain finds out that some other prisoners will be brought to trial, and executed for sinking Japanese ships in the Singapore harbor. <br /> <br /> He mentions that it was his team, and not some other one, that sank the ships to his Japanese friend, and when he heard this, the Japanese guard said to be silent, as this could lead to the execution of his entire group. But the captain remains adamant in admitting this to the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Japanese authorities sentenced them to death in the most respectful manner that conforms to their rules. This is the highest award given to captured warriors in Japan. <br /> <br /> This is the most amazing part of the film, where Australian soldiers are waiting for their imminent death and tense indecision of a friendly Japanese guard, who is still not ready to believe why his Australian friend admitted his guilt. <br /> <br /> I will not play the ending here. But he is sharper than you can imagine, and can easily wake to tears. <br /> <br /> In general, a great underrated film that may not have received recognition that it deserves at the international level. Get one copy today and hypnotize.
