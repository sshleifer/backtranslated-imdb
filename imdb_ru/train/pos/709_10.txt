Hello everyone, this is my first post, and I just adore the movie. There is no my child, and I could watch him again and again !! well, I recorded it on tape a long time ago, like a few years ago, and threw it, broke it, and did not see it for several years !! Can anyone please tell me when this will happen again! I would really appreciate it !! Feel free to email me if you want it to be my favorite movie of all, including “Empty Cradle”, and if someone knows when this will happen, PLEASE let me know, I would really appreciate it! ! <br /> <br />
