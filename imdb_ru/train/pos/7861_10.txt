Uneducated and defiant, beautiful country TESS OF THE STORM is the daughter of a fisherman squatting on the ground of a rich man. Fascinated and courageous, she captures the heart of a millionaire’s son, but violence, terror and sudden death are what will haunt her near future before she can claim the sweet world of happiness. <br /> <br /> Mary Pickford is absolutely charming in this gorgeous, heartbreaking film. She considered Tess to be her favorite role, and fills her with all the playful joy and enthusiasm that have made her the most popular movie star in the world for years. The story has all the essential elements for a modern fairy tale, with Maria, a sweet, unhappy heroine, surrounded by all sorts of dangerous, stressful situations. The atmosphere is gorgeous, especially well thought out sets of fishing villages in the open air. <br /> <br /> In the cast, Gene Herscholt stands out as an ugly villain who tries to get Pickford to marry him. Hersholt, a very tender soul behind the scenes, manages to brilliantly portray the complete moral decay of his character. <br /> <br /> This was actually the second time Pickford filmed TESS. The 1914 version was one of her first important films, but her production values ​​were a bit outdated by the standards of the 1920s (for example, no close-ups) and Mary producing her own films and powerful enough by 1922 to do all that whatever the film that she wanted decided only once in her career to remake the film. The end result certainly met her expectations. Both films were very popular at the box office. <br /> <br /> An interesting exercise for the future researcher will be the influence of Christianity on the life of Mary Pickford; this, of course, passes like a golden thread in the silent films she shot. Although due to the romanticism inherent in the very nature of silent cinema, these spiritual feelings may seem somewhat awkward today, we are forced to accept them as a sincere reflection of their very repetition of the sincere convictions of Mary. In TESS, one beautiful scene stands out in this regard: Pickford teaches himself to read using the Bible. She points out to Lloyd Hughes (who plays her beloved) a word from the depths of the Book that she does not understand. He imitates her (the word “crucified”), and, looking at Heaven, when the full meaning of the Sacrifice comes to her, Mary’s face becomes blissful. <br /> <br /> A magnificent new orchestral score for TESS was provided by Geoffrey Mark Silverman, who beautifully emphasizes the beauty and pathos of this wonderful film.
