It is good that I rented the film before I saw the rating of viewers from this site. It was a great movie Iâ€™ll add to my Christmas selection. The cast was wonderfully chosen, and Ben Affleck plays a good lead. I would tell viewers who have not yet seen the movie, go ahead and buy it. I appreciate it right there with the Christmas holidays. The film was very funny and well written, and Ben plays an eccentric rich man very well. What he says and does is how I imagine a person who has too much money to act. The film is much funnier than "Santa Claus and Christmas with the Weirdoes." In addition, he has a good storyline and teaches the true meaning of Christmas, which lies in the fact that you can not buy love for money.
