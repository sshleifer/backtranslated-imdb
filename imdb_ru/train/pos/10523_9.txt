Emma is a real novel. If you love such cute things filled with wit and stupidity, you will love this movie! This is true for the novel, which is very important, with a few twists added for pleasure. Gwen is not one of my favorite actresses, but she pays tribute to the role that demanded everything she could offer. She plays a role that I think no other actress could do properly. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam as a hero. are you in shock? I never looked at him as clearly beautiful, but damn it! What the right role can do for you! He looks as good as a reasonable, regal Mr. K., that I literally look at him in a new light. He does an excellent job and romantically leads. The charm and character he brings to his role are wonderful! <br /> <br /> Evan MacGregor, Greta Sacchi brings to the rest. good cast. Good movie If you're a fan of Jane Austen, watch this movie with Pride and Prejudice - and, most importantly, buy books. It increases the film to heights that are extraordinary.
