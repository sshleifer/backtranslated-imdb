I watched the movie On Thin Ice on television in India. I must say that the film was really well done and really made me chill. The main story makes me think about what makes some addicts decide to move on, as others are still addicted ... <br /> <br /> however, I felt that Diane Keaton was at his best ... scene where she craves, and starts rummaging around in her house for cocaine ... was the best ... two boys are good, and Linda Boyd also showed what a good actress she is .... The script is well done, like cinematography and direction. .. and casting <br /> <br /> Must watch a movie ..... for everyone
