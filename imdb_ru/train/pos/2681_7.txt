As you probably already know, Jess Franco is one prolific guy. He has hundreds of hundreds of movies, many of which are crap. Nevertheless, he sometimes managed to sneak up to quality work among all operating assembly lines. “Succubus” is not his best work (this is “Devil Doctor Z” or “Vampires Lesbos”), but he has many of his trademarks that make him obligatory for anyone interested in immersion in his large catalog. He combines erotica (alternating the display of a head-headed arrogance and leaving something left to the imagination) and surrealism without problems. This is a very fabulous film, full of great atmosphere. I especially liked the constant namedropping. Despite the fact that it sounds incredibly pretentious, it is fun to hear all the influences of Franco. <br /> <br /> However, many users do not like Succubus, and I see where they are from. Its leisurely pace, but I can handle it. More problematic is inconsistency. The script here was obviously hastily, and five minutes after the beginning of the film, I had absolutely no idea what was going on (and from that moment it did not work). Those who want some substance with their own style are looking elsewhere. In addition, if it is a horror film, it will never be scary or even disturbing. Nevertheless, I was entertained by all the psychedelic nonsense, which I did not particularly object to these serious shortcomings. (7/10)
