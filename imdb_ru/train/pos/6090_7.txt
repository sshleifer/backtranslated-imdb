Envy is not as funny as I thought it would be at first, but after some reviews that I read, I found it to be much funnier than what people did for it, now it's true, this is not a tiny film like zoolander or dodgeball, but Ben Stiller and Jack Black work well with each other, and Christopher Walken is great as always, so the story of how Jack Black's character invented the spray that makes the fluff dog disappear, of course, Ben doesnâ€™t want to participate but when the product makes jack black rich ben stiller begins to see envy, it's not great in all respects, and Ben Stiller, and Jack Black have more funny and better films under their belt, but if you're a fan of one or the other, I recommend it as his still funny movie and I laughed at my ass quite a few times, as a big fan of Ben Stiller, I must say that it is not so easy, but still very fun, give him a watch
