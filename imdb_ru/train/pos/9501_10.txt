I saw this film when it was released, and when I was 12 years old :) And I still vividly remember wonderful scenes of how a hero / heroine runs away every time when he is in danger :) And the best feature of the film was the image of a villain! I think that many of the so-called action films copied many "escape scenes" from this movie !! And this not only does not impress me when I see such a copy, but it always improves my appreciation of this masterpiece! :) Leading actors acted remarkably. The slow and realistic development of the chemistry of the b / w hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully depicted. As children, we felt that the love that developed between them was very natural :) The way they faced and overcome all their trials and tribulations was something that could make even children realize the value of real love, sacrifice and care. I recommend everyone to watch this movie when he has a chance !! --Vijay.
