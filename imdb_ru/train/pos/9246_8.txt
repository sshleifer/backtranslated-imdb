One of the great mysteries of life that everyday problems suffer from is that cute girls are so often more interested in jerks and heels than cute guys. <br /> <br /> Worse, when cute guys even want to marry these girls, girls still prefer jerks and heels, even after jerks and heels have shown their contempt, have shown that they are simply interested in using girls. <br /> <br /> Stu Erwin is a good guy who continues to be cute, being deceived and deceived, and even after he completely lost the girl. <br /> <br /> Clark Gable is a jerk and he is perfect in this role, rather a sad note for his fans. br /> <br /> Gene Harlow looks like more slender Mae West, even sounding like La West in some of her cynical catchy lines. <br /> <br /> Somewhat strange that many other characters intended to be bad guys - I mean, damn, they are locked up, so they must be, obviously, such good people. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are a lot of good people here, people who are less so. This film or story may be grumbling and stabbing in the back, but here it’s hard to help someone else. <br /> <br /> So maybe the story is rather mediocre, at least by modern standards, but ultimately the viewer will be glad to have looked. <br /> <br /> The biggest complaint I have is that so many really good actors do not receive recognition. Once again, we can say hot “Thank you” to IMDb.com.
