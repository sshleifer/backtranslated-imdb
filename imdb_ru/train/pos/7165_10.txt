I recorded it a long time ago, but only today I looked. I was sick, so I ran out of things to watch! I am so glad that I saw this, and that I could erase my memory and look again for the first time. This movie is so wonderful! It reminded me a lot of fried green tomatoes at Whistlestop Cafe. <br /> <br /> The story is a thing of the past, and at the end of the film we see the connection. Some people say this is a kids movie. I do not agree - it can be done by Disney, and many characters are children, but I am 23 years old, and I LOVED it! There were moments when my spine hurt. The story is not like any other film these days, full of adventure. I just ordered a book from Amazon, can't wait!
