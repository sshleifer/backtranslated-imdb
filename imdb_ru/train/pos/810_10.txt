This is probably the best of all Star Wars films. <br /> <br /> The starting point of the film was almost like Episode IV - the spacious cabaret music and thoughts about the place of the cabaret, where the seriousness of the thug Jabba the Hutt became even more serious. He ordered Luke to die in the basement pit at the bone-decaying Bows, which looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark. The forces of the Jedi Luke finally finish off the monster. Adding to the secretive rescue of Han Solo, who was frozen alive at the end of Episode V, Jabba was very angry that Luke was sentenced to death in the Sarlacc pit outside. <br /> <br /> But all of the “good guys” in Star Wars, especially R2-D2, had other ideas ... and these other ideas reflected the execution of Luke; in the end, most of Jabba’s soldiers died, and Princess Leia was able to use force to crush Jabba to death. <br /> <br /> As in Episode IV, the Death Star appears in Episode VI. When I analyzed the fleet of rebels attacking imperial fighters around the Death Star, I assumed that Star Destroyer personnel had accelerated the armament of the main laser, using Imperial fighters as a diversion. The 20-25 Star Destroyers who lined up were ready to attack, but were withdrawn, and instead the laser weapon on the Death Star was released unexpectedly. As soon as he fired, the only hope of the rebel fleet was that the Death Star's protective shield had to be knocked out, and this had a strong influence on Lando because he wanted to destroy the Death Star, but could not until the shield was removed. And this was removed due to Lando’s growing impatience. <br /> <br /> As in Episode V, Imperial Rogues look threateningly thanks to their double guns, killing at least one Ewok ... but the Ewoks have found the ancients so far an unusual way of dealing with them. For example, Chewbacca, like another Ewok, was able to command one of the walkers (and actually used this to destroy one of the walkers from behind), and the other Ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers. <Br /> <br /> It’s amazing what Luke could do with his Jedi abilities on his Light Saber, for example, on the scene at Endor, where Luke rejects incoming laser shots from the Storm Trooper ’s swagger motorcycle and uses the Saber to knock out a part of the bike. Or, at the climax, using Saber to tear off his father’s hand during Saber’s last battle with Sith Vader. <br /> <br /> You probably know Ewoks's celebration after the Death Star exploded, complete with a short display of fireworks, drums on victory trophies (for example, Stormtrooper Masks), and Luke finally met Leia after his own sworn Luke's side - Darth Vader, now dead, burned at the stake. The celebration includes Ewoks singing, but I think Lucas did not buy it - even with the strong respect of the film's composer John Williams. <br /> <br /> In the home cinema version, I think that Lucas himself wanted a different end. In addition to celebrating at Endor, he wanted to shoot festive scenes on several rebel surviving planets, including a festive laser shot that destroys the statue of the Sith. The Ewoks song has been replaced by an alternative instrumental piece. He probably wanted additional materials to prove that with the destruction of the Death Star, the balance in the rebellious galaxies was restored.
