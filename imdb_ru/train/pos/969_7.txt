Miike makes a children's adventure film similar to The Infinite Story. In fact, this is one of my most unloved films of the director. Even the worst “Miike” is better than many films, and there is much to recommend in “The Great War for the Yokai”. This is at least as loud and disgusting as most American kids. I would have thought that the children themselves would find something interesting in it (there is an English dub on the DVD), but, like all Miike films, it can move very slowly. This means that you have some strange irregularity, when sometimes there is a loud sequence of actions, and the next scene is delayed forever, when the characters talk. The story itself is also not very good, and the eternal lack of incoherence Miike raises his ugly head. Most of what I liked came from the technical side. It should be Miike’s most expensive movie, and it looks fantastic. "Yokai" are Japanese perfumes, and they come in all sorts of fantastic shapes, and the costume designers, the special effects team, and everyone else who participated in the design just did an outstanding job. I saw the 1968 film, on which this film appears to be based (“Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare”), and the raw monsters in rubber suits that you can find there were turned into more believable entities using modern makeup special effects. I especially liked the look of one of the bad guys (or, in this case, girls) Aga, who wears dark eyeshadow, tight white outfit, white beehive hairstyle and whip. By the way, she’s played by Chiaki Kuriyama, whom you may remember as teenage girlfriend Lucy Liu in the movie Kill Bill: Volume 1. 1. The film’s hero plays Ryunosuke Kamiki, who has provided voices for "Gone with the Spirit of Miyazaki" and "Howl's Moving Castle."
