A sharp, well-made documentary about the beads of Mardi Gras. I have always liked this approach to making films - to bring ideas about a larger, more complex and often incomprehensible phenomenon, breaking the problem into something familiar and close to home. <br /> <br /> I am sure that most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understood the main motives of profit and capitalism, as well as the influence of globalism on poorer countries (no matter how people feel about this). Instead of setting out these topics and getting up on the soap box (not that there was anything wrong with this, except for those documentaries that are usually preached to the convert), this documentary just shows the mardi gras balls, as they are made , from which people and under what conditions, and then how they are used by consumers at the end of the process. He openly and decisively examines the motives of all participants in the process, including workers, factory management, US importers and, finally, the consumer at the end of the chain. <br /> <br /> It confused me a little; equally by the gourmets of Mardi Gras, but also by the way the workers in China accepted their situation as normal and perfectly acceptable to the course (even if they have some objections to the details of how they are managed). The shots of the janitors who clean the beads from the streets at the end made a special impression. But it was just my reaction; I can understand how someone else can read this documentary a little differently. <br /> <br /> Unlike other documentaries on the subject, I donâ€™t think you need to have any particular political opinion to influence it. In the end, this is a story about people and our attitude towards the goods we produce and consume. If you have ever bought a product made in the Far East, you should think about it. <br /> <br /> Outstanding and highly recommended. Need to see more of these documentaries. Kudos to everyone involved in the making of this film.
