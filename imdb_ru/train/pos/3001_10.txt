Cracking a good yarn with all the actors giving great value. Michael Curtiz at his best. Lots of nice turns and probably the best from the Philo Vance series. William Powell looks amazingly relaxed and at its best. The predecessor of the Thin Man series. Recomend for everybody. Do you understand everything?
