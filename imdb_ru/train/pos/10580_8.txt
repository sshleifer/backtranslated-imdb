You need to watch this fabulous film, knowing that millions have collected 10 cents to see it and forget about the grim everyday economic conditions of the 30s. Remember, then 10 cents bought a loaf of bread, so for many it was a little luxury. This is evidence of how Hollywood did its best to make the US feel a little better. You will notice that with the studio system in Hollywood at the time, many actors and actresses were filming similar films, such as James Cagney, William Powell, Ruby Keeler, Frank McHugh, Joan Blondel, and Guy Kibby. In addition, units of the US military have always been respected with enthusiasm and patriotism, as when using the military march of the great choreographer Busby Berkeley at the end.
