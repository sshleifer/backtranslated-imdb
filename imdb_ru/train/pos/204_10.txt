First of all, I don’t like almost all the films of Neil Simon. But there is something unique in this that attracts me, and I would say that this is one of the most interesting comedies that I have ever seen. The second time I watched it, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers? <br /> <br /> Ah, they are afraid that they can sue, so he turned them into men. And how boring it would be if they were only housewives, show-business stars are more fun. Well, this is a personal review, and my still-living grandmother at the age of 97 (she even survived the great imitation of Walter Mattau!) Would deny it - but some of you have to resonate with these characters. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I have little patience for George Burns, but somehow he turned into one of the best supporting appearances that I can remember (and my late grandmother even liked it, although I didn’t able to recognize the amazing similarity that she shared with the character of the film). br /> <br /> Very ethnic in taste and beyond that, you will either laugh and laugh, or turn it off. For me, the pleasure remains.
