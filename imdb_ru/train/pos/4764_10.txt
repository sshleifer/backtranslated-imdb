There are some comments about this film that say that it is a bad and stupid film, and such a wonderful actor like Pierre Fresnay should not have taken part in it. <br /> <br /> I think the opposite Even if the film is strange and has some flaws, the performance of Pierre Fresnay is so formidable that it turns the film into something excellent. <br /> <br /> His performance is probably the best in history. <br /> <br /> The film itself has a very polemical scene about the consecration of wine in a cabaret. <br /> <br /> For someone who does not believe that the priest ?? even unlocked ?? may turn it into the blood of Christ, the scene is perhaps strange. But for someone who grew up in a Catholic environment, this is very emotional, even if it is rather unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The scene of the death of a junior priest is extremely shocking. But it worked very well. Pierre Fresnay transforms the crazy act of murder into something understandable in the temporary insanity of his hero, an exhausted Moran, deprived of liberty, who so horribly returns to his duty
