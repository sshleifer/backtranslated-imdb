We recently discussed educational and ethical factors with a friend when we grew up in the 1950s compared to today. She mentioned Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who in 1798 wrote "The Frost of an Ancient Sailor". We both had to read parts of an epic poem in high school and in English literature courses in college. My friend said: “His messages can even be called metaphysical in today's context.” <br /> <br /> We tried to read it and remembered only bits. (I have trouble remembering Dr. Suze.) I said that I would receive two copies of the poem so that everyone could read it. It was simple enough, but I was very surprised to find that it was turned into a movie. We were looking forward to watching the movie to see how it was interpreted. After all, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is not exactly an easy read. After everyone read the poem, we watched a movie together. <br /> <br /> We found the film a remarkable achievement, especially considering that it was made in the 1970s, before the advent of computers, prior to the so-called Ken Burns effect. “And before that, special effects too often began to compensate for the lack of substance. Particularly noteworthy are the illustrations of the 19th and 20th century, written by "lesser-known artists", such as Willy Pogani, an early Hollywood designer. <br /> <br /> The film is narrated by Sir Michael Redgrave, who taught the poem when he was a schoolteacher, adding a tone of credibility and authenticity, while remaining true to the poem. <br /> <br /> His mastery lies in layers of subtle messages transmitted without “instructions” or turning into an oppressive and obvious tale of morality. We found such a refreshing change from the “face” mentality and “to beat their heads”. Most of today's morality messages in the film are two-dimensional: extreme violence, murder and lawlessness point out bad things. The bad ones are really, really bad, and the good super heroes. As if the human character lacks nuances. The rime of the Ancient Sailor is a celebration of personality, character, gratitude for the celebration of all the wealth that life can offer, in the wider context of humanity, that is, the ability of a person to give to others. <br /> <br /> Proud of having found this “unknown” gem, we learned that he received the highest award in his category five out of six times at the international film festivals “name”. Another surprise was that film director Raul da Silva, a recognized authority in the field of early animation, wrote six books about the film that won many awards. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is just as relevant today, if not more than when Coleridge wrote the original epic poem and when Raúl da Silva translated it into a movie. If I was still teaching in high school, what I have been doing for five years, I would take it and show it to all my students. There is a level of wealth here, which naturally leads to a discussion of the big and important problems that we all face, whether in 1798, 1978 or today - in fact, as long as humanity has a spiritual component. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
