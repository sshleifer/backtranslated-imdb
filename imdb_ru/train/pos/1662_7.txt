The film "Artemisia" can be viewed as treason or as a real artistic license. <br /> <br /> Who can be denied? <br /> <br /> In a documented history, Artemisia Gentileschi was subjected to a knurled screw, and still claimed that she was cursed, as Mary Garrard and Gloria Steinem eloquently confirmed. <br /> <br /> In the film under another torture, she refused to condemn her lover / offender. <br /> <br /> How can a film deviate so much from the story it has received, yet still keep the human heart informed? <br /> <br /> The answer is not so difficult to find. In the film, the director and the cast filled the spectacle in the historical recording with the power of imagination. <br /> <br /> This led to a conclusion that is different from the report. <br /> <br /> So be it. I find _both_ recording and film to be persuasive. <br /> <br /> In the film and (it seems) in history, Artemisia was an artist, above all. <br /> <br /> For I am sincerely grateful for this vision, created in a delightful (so-called) film composition. <br /> <br /> Rarely did I see a film that attracted my eyes so much. <br /> <br /> David Broadhurst
