The film failed at the box office. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the preview. <br /> <br /> I always liked the movie. <br /> <br /> I live in one of the cities mentioned in the film, where the last players moved. <br /> <br /> Not the best movie ever shown on the screen, but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Robin coped well with the role. <br /> <br /> The best line of the movie at the beginning, from the character of Robin Jack: "I was this SOB!" Cleared here so as not to offend anyone. <br /> <br /> I was glad when several years ago a DVD came out on a wide format / mailbox format. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m not a soccer player or a real sports fan. But you do not need to be the one who loves this movie.
