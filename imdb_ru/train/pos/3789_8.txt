Bravo to the Czechs, their once-powerful film industry seems to have awakened from post-communist sleep. <br /> <br /> “Singles” is a comedy that uses all the elements you expect to see in modern “Hollywood” production, minus the rubbish that seems to have become attached to the genre over the past few years. Excellent soundtrack, excellent visual editing, a beautiful Prague cityscape, and these are just a few of them. <br /> <br /> This story actually consists of several sub-themes that often intertwine and intersect; in essence, this is a collage of destinies, Destinies, desires ... This follows a group of urban young people until the mid-thirties in a variety of situations - from everyday life and leisure to career and obsessive ideas. And this is ridiculous. In fact, there is a moment in the film when the whole theater I was in (about 100 people in a small art gallery) laughed non-stop for about 40-50 seconds. How often do you come across this in modern Hollywood productions? <br /> <br /> Although the entire main cast is superb (especially the future Macedonian star Labina Mitevska as an immigrant facing too familiar difficulties), I have to mention Jiri Macaceka for his incredibly believable image of Yakub, constantly slaughtered by a god, whose the brain is strongly influenced by the fact that it smokes, landing it in a variety of funny situations. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: do not miss this! Have something to offer.
