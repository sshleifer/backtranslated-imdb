In those days when we had a big studio system, the coolest casting decisions were made. The good old American James Stewart, who plays the role of a Hungarian in the "Shop around the corner." If I were shooting a film, the role of Kralik would be perfect for Charles Boyer. His accent, mixed with all other European accents, would be nothing. Stewart had the same problem in the “Death Storm” and with Margaret Sullavan. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on screen, he starred with her in four films. But only this one where none of them dies. Sullavan and her husband Leland Hayward knew Stewart as early as the day he was a struggling player in New York. In fact, Sullavan’s husband was then a good friend of Stuart, Henry Fonda. <br /> <br /> I think that only Clark Gable was able to withstand the role of an American in a group of non-Americans in the Bounty Mutiny. Stewart in the “Death Storm” was German, but all the other players were also Americans, so nothing stood out. <br /> <br /> But if you accept Stewart, you will see Ernest Lyubich’s beautiful film. The plot is quite simple, a man and a woman working in a department store in Budapest do not get along with each other. But it seems that they are in correspondence with some anonymous fans who find themselves with each other. Also, employer Frank Morgan suspects Stuart in wrongful kanudlinge with his wife. <br /> <br /> Although the leaders are all right, and Frank Morgan is moving away from his usual embarrassment, the two best players are Felix Bressar and Joseph Shildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he leaves after Morgan starts asking people for opinions. He makes himself very meager. <br /> <br /> And Joseph Shildkraut, who is always good, just gorgeous, like a little worm, constantly kissing Frank Morgan. You really hate such people, I know too many people like Shildkraut in real life who are involved in office politics 24 hours a day. It is sad that it pays a lot of time.
