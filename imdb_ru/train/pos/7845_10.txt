So, Fox pulled the plug halfway through the drama / mystery ... <br /> <br /> How unconvincing? Do they expect us to spend our time on their new shows when there is a real risk of never knowing what's going on? Why are the remaining, already filmed episodes not broadcast in the US? They were broadcast elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Hey Fox! You are listening? It was a great show, but you left us alone. If you are going to present new dramas / riddles, at least pass on the conclusion before suddenly completing the middle theme. Every time something like this happens (and it seems that it often happens to you, that is, with Fox), there are more and more of those who will “wait and see” before wasting their time. This means that you will see an artificially low percentage and are more likely to end the series. See? This is a vicious circle. Do not let us down again ...
