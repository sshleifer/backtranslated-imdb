This film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding, the music is as good as the movie, and the killer is as creepy as possible! The actors are awesome, RIP Donald Placense, you were fantastic, like Dr. Loomis, he made the movie even better. Without it, the film would lack a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is as gorgeous as our beloved scream queen! Her innocence makes her not aware of the real evil that haunts her until she finds her friends brutally murdered in the house, which, of course, is one of the best scenes in the film. She gives a terrific presentation. I liked this film because it scared the hell out of me when I saw it at the very beginning of the 80s, and I still watch it to this day, because it is an amazing film that just leads you to this world, where you can gut like a fish at every turn! The fact that this is a simple format of a madman in a mask who escaped from a psychiatric hospital and is ready to kill everyone in sight, without having the slightest idea that he is there, is just shocking and indulging you even more in the film as an event, although fiction can become a reality. We all know that, unfortunately, evil exists in this world, and a madman with a knife is certainly not uncommon, which is very disturbing for the deep fear for all this. Death at any turn. Halloween, of course, shows it in the most horrible way. The horror must be believable, and that makes the movie enjoyable. Itâ€™s just a simple story that turns into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. In addition to Psycho's magnificent storyline, which I adore, I believe that formats are the best that horror has to offer. For me, Halloween and Psycho are the best films I've ever seen, and I will watch them all my life and never get tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.
