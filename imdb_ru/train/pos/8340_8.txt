This is really fun, fresh, frivolous romantic comedy. You can't go wrong with Meg Ryan's sweet fervor combined with the genius of Albert Einstein. Usually I am not a fan of completely fabricated fictional stories about real people, now deceased and unable to protect themselves, but I think that the late Einstein could have gotten a laugh from this. <br /> <br /> This is the 1950s ... Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around pretty, young scattered mathematics, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who is ready to marry a stuffy jerk, a behavior researcher named James, simply because he has the brains that she is looking for in her future father's children. However, this is love at first sight when her car breaks down and she meets an auto mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). Since she does not think that Ed is smart enough, her uncle, none other than Albert Einstein, plays the matchmaker, helps in his efforts to three harmful comrades, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert must make Ed look smart enough, so he comes up with a charade depicting him as physics ... naturally, with funny results. <br /> <br /> Walter Mattau is his usual cheerful personality, and he pretty quickly removes Einstein's character effectively. With his three fellow professors, Kurt, Nathan and Boris, lots of laughter. The real Einstein had a real human side, and this film takes another (outrageous) step forward. If you suspend all logic, you can almost imagine that this stupid story is happening! <br /> <br /> This may not be rocket science (despite its main character), but this is a wonderful, enjoyable, refreshing film. One of the best genres of comedy novel.
