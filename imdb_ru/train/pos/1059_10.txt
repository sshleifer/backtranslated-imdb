I love this show, it will definitely be a winner. Jessica Alba does an excellent job, it's about time we had a cool girl who is not so cute. The whole cast is wonderful, and all the episodes have good stories. Everything is laid out well thought out. It must have taken time to put it together, because no one was in a hurry, just hit something. This is a great show overall.
