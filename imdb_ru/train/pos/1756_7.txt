"40-year-old virgin" made me laugh a lot. I don't care if this is a very sexy comedy, I just liked many of the jokes and scenes presented in this film. Steve Carell is perfect as a virgin nerd Andy Stitzer, and I think the scene where Andy removes hair on his chest with wax is one of the coolest, especially because it is real. By the way, many actors and actresses present in this film are well known or already known. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. It is a bit strange and collects a lot of toys, but it seems harmless. One day, playing poker with their friends at work, they discover that Andy is really ... a virgin! And he is already 40 years old! After this amazing revelation, all his friends are trying to get Andy to sleep with a woman ... the problem is the confusion Andy is in, especially now that he really likes Trish, the woman he met when she bought the DVD player in the store in which he works.
