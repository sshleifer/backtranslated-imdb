Max and Jessica Alba from the Original Cindy movie Valerie Ray Miller shine in this action and atmospheric series. Wonderfully politically incorrect. The quality varies greatly from episode to episode, but as a rule, the standard is high, and when not, Jessica is always worth a look. Urban live African American Valerie sometimes pulls the Dark Angel into comedy territory.
