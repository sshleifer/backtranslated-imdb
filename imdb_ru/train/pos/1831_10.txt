this movie was pretty awful. The last movie of Vipula Shah was good, this movie was just bad, although it is a good story and is superbly handled. Aatish Kapadia, who adapted this film from another Gujarati piece “Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu”, made a good but slow pianist. Two and a half hours to watch, there are many flaws in this film, but it's still an entertainment program, the songs are rather discouraged and don't work, but overall they are still good, not a film that you would watch enthusiastically, it is still a story to take into account, and it’s good if you are a type of relationship, a pretty good movie with a lot of flaws and humor that really don’t need not a step
