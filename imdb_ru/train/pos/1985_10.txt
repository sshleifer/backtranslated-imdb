I usually do not like musicals, but if I had to choose what would be my favorite, it would definitely be Oliver. This film is very well made, the characters are well depicted, the costumes on the acting scene are good, and the songs are superb, my favorite creature is Ron Moody's Review of the Situation, which brilliantly depicts Feigin. I was not old enough to see Oliver when he was released in the late 60s, but my sisters were, so I had to put up with the fact that they were singing bloody songs for weeks in a row, usually it was “Who will buy my wonderful roses” , so I knew all the songs before I saw the movie. This is an eternal musical, which you definitely could not alter, By itself. This is not quite true for the book, and I don’t think it would have worked so well if it had been. I don’t think that Charles Dickens would have been disappointed because he wrote Oliver to depict poverty in London, orphanages, work houses, and that the poor had to resort to survive, and the film portrays It’s also good. Another good reason to watch this movie is the Bullseye, an old type English bull terrier, pay attention to his long thin legs, this was bred from the breed many years ago, they must have hunted high and low to find a pattern like him and it is exactly the same as an English bull terrier would look like in Victorian times. Note that he has scars (which is probably makeup) on his face, Bill Sykes probably used him to fight a dog or for a rat pit. Victorian bull. A terrier had a record number of kills in a rat pit. In any case, this is a beautiful dog, and he notices that he does not submit to Bill Sykes after having killed Nancy, he obviously has his own standards, and not the boob head, as Bill Sykes thought. An excellent musical to watch, if you like musicals, and if you do not like musicals, try it anyway, everyone will find something for themselves in this film.
