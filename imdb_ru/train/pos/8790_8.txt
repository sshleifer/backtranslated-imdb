Funny movie. I saw this film at the 2002 Sydney Film Festival for Gays and Lesbians Mardi Gras and laughed from beginning to end. The action was subtle, but very funny. I’m not quite sure about the influence of “Real World”, we don’t understand this, but the film stands without an understanding of this show. Heather B steals every scene she appears in, especially when she plays with her rarely talkative red star. Highly recommended. I would like to see this on video / DVD in the future.
