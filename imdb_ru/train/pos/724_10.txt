The film is just fun ... maybe more fun for those of us who were young and for the fans of The Ramones at the time the movie was made. I watched the movie again and again, myself and with friends, and it is still fresh and funny. The risk of being too serious, the idea of ​​being a big fan of a certain group is eternal, and the boredom of schoolchildren due to the hard work of some classes is just as timeless. <br /> <br /> And the film has some pearls / scenes ... links to how our "high-profile" high school will follow us through life. (Let me assure you that I haven’t been in high school for several years and he hasn’t been following me) ..... the famous "static" line ("I get some static" ..... "Not so much how are you going to get ", as the director Togar approaches) ..... a member of the school council who is so decrepit that nurses attend ... Nazi Hall Monitors love" personal search "...... Chief Togar announces:" I give you the final decision "and write down the records of the Ramones (note: the recordings were what they were before the CD) ... and, of course, Joey Ramone, noting:" Things changed since we were kicked out of high school ", and then Togar asked:" Do your parents know that you are Ramones? »<br /> <br /> Only one piece of advice ..... don’t look where the stars are now ..... Joey Ramon, unfortunately, died young. Day Young, who was the main beauty in the film, reminds us today that we are all aged ... The career of PJ Soles never developed as we might expect ......... Marla Rosenfield, like the others the students appeared to appear only in this film (one of my male friends dies because of her every time we watch a movie), although I contend that her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more roles for teenagers. And does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steele? <br /> <br /> So look and enjoy ..... don't think .... just have fun!
