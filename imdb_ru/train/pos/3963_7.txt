The story of the FBI, told by Agent Stewart through flashbacks, is intertwined with the history of his personal life. Stewart and Miles (like his wife) are pretty good, like Hamilton as a serious agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes participation difficult. It’s like watching a dozen pieces of different movies, when we catch a glimpse of who plays the gangsters. Some episodes are too long, some are too short, and some just look out of place (Stewart's daughter’s school sequence). In general, it lasts too long. Nevertheless, it is worth looking at its attractive production values.
