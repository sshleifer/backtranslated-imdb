I love doodlebops. My son has been watching them for over a year. We went to the Doodlebops concert last year, and also to one concert yesterday (Connecticut). He loves them. Doodlebops do not teach the alphabet or numbers, but who cares? are you serious? A television should not teach your children numbers or alphabets. parents should. Overcome it. Doodlebops can actually sing. Didi has a beautiful voice, and at a concert you can say that all 3 of them have good singing voices and DO NOT sing their lips. Imagine, they dance, jump and STILL sing. they have talent, children love them, I even like to watch the show. This show is definitely the best show for kids on television. And a rock band for kids. How amazing is that? Why do people say chad (Rooney) is gay? how did you hear that? Whether he is or not, he's awesome! Leave him. This is not how he or anyone else promotes homosexuality for our children!
