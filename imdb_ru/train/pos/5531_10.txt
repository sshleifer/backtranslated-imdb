Watching Fox and the Baby was an intoxicating experience. The lush visual effects, the integrity of the viewpoint and the complete beauty of the setting and characters left me in a swoon of pleasure. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. Deceptively simple. In the container of this simplicity, a world unfolds, which draws you into itself and makes you gasp. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I cried I found out. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you can trust - give yourself. I dare say that this is an act of love, designed for any innocent heart. It reaches the heart of the viewer - of any age - and opens the world with new eyes, as if it can be seen from the heart. <br /> <br /> Adi Da Samraj once said that true art takes the viewer beyond the point of view of ecstatic participation in reality. I feel that I had the honor to watch - no, to participate - this film, a work of real art.
