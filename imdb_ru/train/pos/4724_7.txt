Caught in a trap: buried alive leads us to the resort, which has just opened and will close soon. <br /> <br /> We start by saying that the guy on the gear blows a skid to avoid the possibility of avalanches. anyway, it does not make sense. in any case, he is going to blow off one especially large when he notices that the resort is open. despite all his efforts, the highest authority tells him that his day is over. <br /> <br /> Soon, as everyone expects, an avalanche will strike. <br /> <br /> Listen, I'm no longer going to reveal everything I can say is that it was a B-movie intended for a family channel (which I just saw, and the fact that there was no advertising, in any case, it proves that this is a B-movie), it is a pretty decent movie, but it is partially unreal. <br /> <br /> First, when people are buried with ice and snow, they are buried. not just traceable from the powder. or how about a cd for a screwdriver? it's impossible. and finally, I can not stress that the explosion cannot stop the avalanche, guaranteed. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is worth renting or watching TV, but not owning it. 7/10. <br /> <br /> The film was rated PG, but perhaps it should have received something stronger. the boy almost loses his leg in the elevator, but his leg is cut around his ankle, the guy is roasted with electricity and diesel, and dead people are lying in the gym. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
