A WARNING!!! Tons of dead gifts !!! DO NOT READ IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THIS SERIES! OR YOU CAN, WHAT. <br /> <br /> These are a few words to describe a film that claims to be the last and goes with another; Liars, cheats, perhaps even some words that can not be uttered. But when Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead shows everyone who thought the show was old and wanted to stop seeing him, or people who wanted their hero (or Willian) to just stop at the last breath, it was a movie. <br /> <br /> This film begins with a parody of the Wizard of Oz, then you see a child who is called only John Doe, who is the last child in Springwood, Ohio, leaves and leaves Freddie’s territory. The woman who is in the hospital / place to make the child with the legs of that place meet this boy, and at the same time she has a dream about a man, a water tower, and a promise of a secret floating in her mind, returns to Springwood to find out a frightening vision, and soon learns that she is Freddie’s child, and we will soon learn that Freddie can leave Springwood only if his daughter can be a kind of master for him. And this is followed by fear. This film seems to hit on the head all that you wanted to know. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of humor and cameo roles in this film, such as Rosanna Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp and the very young Brekin Meyer playing teenage stoner, who sees the psychadal vision of flowers and “In- -gadda-da-vida "Iron Butterfly, and then gets stuck in some kind of parody of super Mario. This movie will make you hate this movie, or even more like Kruger. The best of the best.
