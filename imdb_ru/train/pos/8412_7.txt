Those who used the movie camera so early in this century probably already understood some of its possibilities. This is a good playboy type story that needs money and inadvertently sells its soul to Satan for big money. Unfortunately, the soul is its twin, and it must often collide with it, tearing its life apart. There are some wonderful scenes with the disappearance of people and, of course, scenes when they are on stage at the same time. The middle part is a bit boring, but the story of Faust is always in the mind of the viewer. One thing I have to mention is the general unattractiveness of people in the film. In addition, they largely shied away from a large number of actions that at least would give some life to things. I first learned about this movie about 25 years ago and, finally, I was able to see it. I was not disappointed.
