This Belgian film, shot by Tom Barman, the singer of the famous group dEUS, was not liked by everyone. For the simple reason that there is no clear story or even plot. This film simply shows 24 hours in the “city” (here Antwerp) and allows you to watch and truly enjoy dialogue, directing, humor (Dario!, Osteopath Bruno!, ...) and tragic (Windman, Paul) Garcin,. ..) characters. <br /> <br /> There are several memorable scenes: “A windmill on the beach”, a dance party at the end, a KISS fan, “Windman” visits an osteopath, ... <br /> <br /> Obviously, some other viewers did not understand what is so beautiful and interesting in this film. They complain that there is no history in this film, etc. But it is the atmosphere that makes you look and draws you down. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t watched it yet, be sure to listen to the music carefully. The soundtrack is extraordinary, like that of Tom Barman and his group dEUS. <br /> <br /> And "ssst, mondje dicht hé". (do not tell anyone)
