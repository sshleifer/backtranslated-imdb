Put yourself in Carla's place. She is an overworked, underrated administrative friend who is invisible. You know her: she trained three of her last three bosses, knows where all the bodies are buried, and can even look at you in the mirror when you brush your teeth. Always having time for another ungrateful task and doing it better than most, despite a serious disability, she has a table on the way to the toilet, which becomes a repository of half-ready cups of coffee asking to spill. What kind? You do not want to hear it? Well, she can't, and you can't, until your hearing aid is in place. Get ready to experience life in terms of hearing impairment. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuel Devos) needs to change her life. Work leads nowhere; friends rely on it to satisfy their internal needs, and the only way out begins with a crash that goes almost unnoticed. She will not take a vacation - the contract becomes critical, so the only alternative is to hire an assistant. Karla makes demands that reflect her real needs: a “well-groomed” man. This brings the claimant to a statement that reminds us that we must be careful with our wishes. <br /> <br /> Paul (Vincent Cassell) is doing everything wrong from the very beginning of the interview, and his hiring clearly demonstrates Carla’s interest in his unrelated qualities. She sees the potential in this former thief, and when the story unfolds, their relationship develops in a very unusual pattern of interdependence. <br /> <br /> Paul is going through a difficult transition, returning to a world outside the prison walls, and is sent to another prison: one from the service and the other from wage slavery, to pay off the old debt. His thief skills help Carla win the political battle in the office. But Paul sees a more daunting opportunity with Carla's ability to read lips and draws her even more into the world of intrigue. <br /> <br /> This is a cruel noir film without a rating and is probably suitable for older teens. Karla is becoming increasingly influential, both professionally and personally, as the plot progresses, and her disability gives her clear advantages over all of us. She grows up as a woman who opens her sensual side, while she uses her resources to overcome obstacles that prevent men from competing in the world. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are strangely meant for each other. Without Paul Carl will remain in the role of a rug. She has our sympathy, hope and best wishes, even if she does not make the best decisions along the way. <br /> <br /> You will hear the world through Carla’s ears, from the clumsy settings of a hearing aid, muffled sounds that are almost impossible to hear without him, to relatively distinct voices when you can see who is speaking. When we turned off one basic feeling, we see Carla’s increased intuitive ability to compensate. And we can all use this feeling to hear not only what people say, but also what they really mean.
