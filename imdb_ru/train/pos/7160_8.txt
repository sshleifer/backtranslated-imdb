A Disney film that dares to do something else should at least be rewarded for its efforts. Holes doesn't make the same mistakes you would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teens in camp. For the first time, events are not explained in detail. Flashback scenes do serve a specific purpose and represent several mature themes that may surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first I was a little surprised by the seriousness of the film. But I soon realized that we had to go through those moments to see the beauty of the story. In addition to the story, this film also questions well some of the methods used in correctional institutions. (One example of when Caivan is forbidden to teach Zero to read, because they need to dig holes to build character, for example, learning to read will not help it) Holes is a smart and beautiful film. Must watch!
