Looking through the Sci Fi weeklies at the local Video Rentals store, I was losing hope of finding good films that I hadn’t seen yet. Cypher’s rent was like a pant on a possibly very lame horse. My son is so exhausted by modern science fiction "B" that he has not bothered to see it yet. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that I did not see anything in Cypher when it was released in Australia. It must have been very quiet, or I just missed it. <br /> <br /> Well, it was a really pleasant surprise! This is also not a B movie. This is not a “blockbuster” of an epic variety, and it is not trying to be - a quieter film that needs to be watched several times in order to completely change its plot. <br /> <br /> Special effects are powerfully presented when they are used - my only complaint is that super-helo is apparently CGI, as on the fly, but they understand that this is in the 2nd appearance, and, among other things, at the highest level. In any case, the effects are secondary. <br /> <br /> I will not tell anything about the plot. The structure of the plot has the aspect of “Russian doll”, a bit like “Basic instinct” (albeit with completely different content). <br /> <br /> I’ll just say that Jeremy Northham’s choice as lead was a good move. The actor was born in Cambridge, ENGLAND, and his focus on this film amazes hearing as a kind of extremely forced New England dialect, this is a bit of a clue. Look at the final turn of the plot, and you will understand why this is such a brilliant choice! And Lucy Liu is also with her: “She will kiss me — will she shoot me?” <br /> <br /> I rarely watch films several times over the course of several days — this is one of them.
