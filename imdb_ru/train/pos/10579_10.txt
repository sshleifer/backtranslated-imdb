The energetic young producer of theater prologues (those staged performances, usually musical, which were often held in large cinemas in the past FOOTLIGHT PARAD. <br /> <br /> This film, very similar to Warner’s other musical performances, especially GOLDDIGGER films, was not particularly attractive to any of the others: Jimmy Cagney. He is a miracle, loosely connected and flexible, as dexterous as any cat - a creature that he actually imitates several times during the movie. Cagney attracts the attention of viewers and never lets go, nourishing a quick fire and a banal plot with its charisma and cheerful charm. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is also doing its best. Joan Blondell is beautiful in the role of a smart blonde with a big mouth, keen Cagney (the main deception - why she did not give a musical number?). Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler again play lovers on and off the stage; the fact that her singing and acting skills are a bit scarce is compensated by her dancing; Powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in its unusual position as the second male leader. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibby and Hugh Herbert are very funny as a son-in-law, both plotting to fool Cagney in different ways. Ruth Donnelly is considered the rich wife of Kibby, a woman who is devoted to her beautiful protégé The worried choreographer of Frank McHugh is the successful foil for Cagney's wit. Herman Bing has fun in his tiny scene as a musical arranger. During musical performances, the Mavens will see little Billy Barty, Jimmy Conlin, and perhaps even John Garfield. <br /> <br /> Finally, Busby Berkeley, a choreographer who has nothing to do with music. His terpsikhory confectionery, powdered during the decade of the 1930s, was the highest example of cinematic escapism that viewers of depression wanted to enjoy. Of course, the big joke about the works of Berkeley was that they were supposed to be part of the plot. But no theater will ever be able to keep these works of the master's imagination. They are an excellent illustration of the type of entertainment that is only possible with a movie camera. <br /> <br /> Berkeley's musical suggestions were usually based on one of two approaches: a story (often rather strange) told with a song and a dance; or some more stunningly geometrically designed numbers, eye candy showing copious choir girls, camera work on their heads and a romantic melody. In anticipation of extravagance, FOOTLIGHT PARADE culminates with three masterpieces of Berkeley: the Honeymoon Hotel and its preparatory code telling about the couple's wedding night; “By A Waterfall” - dozens of tireless females splashing, swimming and diving in perfect drawings and designs (take a close look, and you will see how synchronous effects were achieved); and finally, “Shanghai Lil” - a worthy tribute to Cagney and Berkeley's talent.
