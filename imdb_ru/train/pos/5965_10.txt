I gave it 10 out of 10 points. I love him so much. I am a child of the 80s and for many years I love heavy metal. That's why I like this movie so much. It’s so cool to see these posters in this boy’s bedroom (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted sister ...) and his vinyl collection (promulgation of the wicked from Exciter, Rise of the mutants from Impaler and Killing master metal ). Also, the FASTWAY soundtrack is absolutely incredible and fits very well with the plot. If you are fond of metal, TRICK OR TREAT is your friend. Do not buy or watch this film for OZZY or GENE SIMMONS, because they are in the film for a few seconds, watch it, because the soundtrack and the story that will bring you back to the glory of the 80s. You will not be the same person after.
