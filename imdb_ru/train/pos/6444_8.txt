Of course, this is a line from the Lord’s prayer: “Your will will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” Sweden, especially its extreme north, is not my idea of ​​paradise - the temperature in winter is -30 degrees C for me a bit low, but the good people living there undoubtedly think that they are in God's own country. <br /> <br /> The storyline here is familiar.
