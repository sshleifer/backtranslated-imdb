Although I did not start reading “Classics” in literature until the age of 47, it is never too late. Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons, mainly because I didn’t like the wrong part of the book. The 1983 TV miniseries with Zella Clark and Timothy Dalton are all I hoped for. I saw it as a full-length film in 2006. Mr. Dalton's “Rochester” was very good, but I really liked “Jane Eyre” Zel. Remembering the other film “Classic”, which I saw recently, I was disappointed in the production, direction and dialogue. He was faithful only to the greed and arrogance of Hollywood. An artistic license for great literary works is nothing but plagiarism. Use of the name after such a license is fraud. Leave it to the British to get it right (among others). You will not be able to re-read the book without reliving the film with the appropriate context and spirit. Well done BBC.
