Netflix should mention this short feature in silk stocking information. Superior in all respects this overproduced fluff. It had Cole Porter's much better songs and a lot more energy. Silk stockings turned out to be a big disappointment. Fred was getting too old for this kind of thing, although Sid and the dance are beautiful. I will follow the version of Ninotchka Garbo - Melvin Douglas. Was Peter Lorre ill when creating the Silk Stockings — does he seem very passive in more active numbers and with fewer lines? I am very glad that I came across a Bet - Bet by chance. Made the whole experience so much more pleasant. Bob Hope, as a simple “singer and dancer” is pure joy.
