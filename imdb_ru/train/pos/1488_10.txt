This is one movie to see if you are getting married or married. The film is about a couple in Italy and covers such complex topics as abortion, infidelity, juggling and family. <br /> <br /> The so-called “death culture” that we experience in the world today is terrible and this film will surely make you think. <br /> <br /> Be sure to take a look. I hope it will be distributed as it should. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the cast and the director. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs and a 10 star rating from me!
