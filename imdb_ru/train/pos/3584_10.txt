My name is Heather, and I'm a girl whose story was based on this film. I want to thank everyone who watched this movie and enjoyed it. Despite the fact that some of the things that were depicted in this film were rude and coarse, in fact it didn’t even come close to describing how bad things really were. not to mention the impact of everything on my mother and younger sister. Thanks again for the wonderful comments everyone had, I sincerely thank them. <br /> <br /> Hello everyone! <br /> <br /> This is Heather's mom. It is hard to believe that so many years have passed since the creation of this film. It’s harder to believe that people still watched it a year ago. For any of you who have encountered the same or a similar situation, please know that there are people in cyberspace who fully understand how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each of you.
