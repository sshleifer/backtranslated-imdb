I just had very nice quick 45-minute videos. <br /> <br /> “Roll” tells about the village guy Mata (Toby Malone), who dreams of becoming a sports star. Mat travels to the city, and his cousin George (Damien Robertson) must take it. Well, anyway, it was a plan. George is associated with gangster Tini (John Batchelor) and makes delivery for him. Needless to say, Mat is being dragged into the world of George. <br /> <br /> I thought it was great that Mat teaches George morality and respect, and George teaches Mata how to relax a bit and enjoy life. Toby and Damien were well-knit and did a great job. <br /> <br /> Each character in the film complemented each other very well, the two policemen were great. David Ngombujarra brought a great comic relief to the film. Tini played a cute gangster who reminded me of one of my favorite characters, Pando, from Two Hands. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I liked about Rolle was that it showed the cities I grew up in, and lived in Perth and Fremantle for 20 years. It was nice to see the sights and sights I grew up on, especially the old Ferris wheel. <br /> <br /> This Rocks 'n' Rolls
