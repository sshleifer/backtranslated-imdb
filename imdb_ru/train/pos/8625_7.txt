Jörg Butkerayrete sometimes goes too far with his films and themes, even for my taste, but his films are always something special and difficult to classify. They are made artistically, and often have a deeper meaning for their themes. This film is an excellent example of his work. <br /> <br /> It's also very difficult to name this movie. This is not really a movie with a story, in the sense that it has a beginning, middle and end. He also has no main character, but instead focuses on 7 different suicides and murders, on 7 different days. <br /> <br /> All different stories are told with a lot of class, although some of them are, of course, more “interesting” and realistic than others. They are not necessarily related, but together they still tell a story. The film does not feel fragmented at all. All different stories are perceived differently, and Batgereit tells the story almost without using any words (which is also typical of his style), but instead allows the images and the obvious sensitive emotions of the characters to tell the whole story. It helps make this movie effective for viewing. <br /> <br /> Again, production values ​​are not too high, and this can scare some people off. Nevertheless, it is this film that helps to establish the correct tone and atmosphere for the entire film and its dark, disturbing and depressing themes. <br /> <br /> Buttgereit movie, which I “liked” when watching. <br /> 7/10
