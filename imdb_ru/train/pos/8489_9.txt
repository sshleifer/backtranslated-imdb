I teach Japanese in an online school and include cultural activities so that students can learn not only the country, but also the country. And watching “Gong Ho” is one of the requirements. Students can buy or rent a movie. Stereotypes or not, it helps students see that other people see the world and their lives differently than we do. Many of my students told me that they liked the film so much that they were going to get a copy for themselves. It is really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture. I just wanted to get a cleaned up television version. I don’t quite understand the coarse language that car industry workers use all the time.
