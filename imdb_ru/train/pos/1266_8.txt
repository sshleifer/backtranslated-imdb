Iâ€™ve read some previous comments that said that this film is no longer valid by the end of the film, and that it has an end that looks like Cape Fear. I completely disagree. I'm going to give a simple overview for ordinary moviegoers. I thought the casting was perfect. I thought it was one of Ed Harris' best performances. What an evil psychopath !!! I really respect his actions after watching his performance in this film. I was chained to this film. If you like mysterious thrillers, then this is definitely the movie you want to watch. I also noticed young Scarlett Johannson in this film. This film is filled with the best stars, and I highly recommend it!
