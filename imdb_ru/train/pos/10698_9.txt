Little funny movie. It is absolutely unbelievable, unbelievable, impossible. But it’s funny how a closed masochist can become completely addicted and hypnotized, even a hypnotized girl who he hardly knows, but who was able to plunge into her fantasies. Of course, this is exposing the silly deals that you can get online. You must not believe ten percent of what is said there, and never and never agree to somehow connect your hands with someone or something or with some organization that you do not know personally. Most of their "businesses" are somehow going to fool you and raid you. But here the guy deserves to become a victim of such gangsters, because he is not only naive, he is absurdly stupid. But then the film becomes ridiculous, because it ends up with the victim of dishonest business taking over and eventually playing the same game with its victimizer and winning. One is sure too. Safety at English airports is not exactly what it should be, but I believe that it is no better anywhere in the world, and even now they have tightened all the rules and regulations, it’s just interesting to go through their procedures and systematically interfere with them. Then they will take revenge by losing their luggage, the real plague in modern airports, and do not expect fair compensation. Or even confiscate a bottle opener or tin can, because it can be dangerous. I see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener. Funny is not it?
