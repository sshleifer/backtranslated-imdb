I saw it on a plane to New Zealand last week, and I was wondering how this would fit in with both the British film and the book. I must say that I was impressed. In any case, fanatical affection for the Red Sox in lean years works even better than the initial dedication to Arsenal, which has been successful for many years. As a Briton, I was also interested to see that you do not need to understand baseball to understand what is happening. One question comes to mind - was the script written using Sox as a team before they finally shot Curse of the Bambino? Or was there another team in the frame? As a Red Sox fan (strangely, I know, a Brit who understands baseball), I have to say that it added pleasure.
