this film is absolutely funny. basically, the plot revolves around a serial killer, which somehow turns into a snowman as a result of some kind of chemical accident in the movie "B". Then he goes to the city and begins to terrorize the locals. deal with the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him. it is done on a tiny budget, and it certainly shows, but the big thing about this film is that it is rubbish. Styrofoam and polystyrene improvisations imitating a giant snowman killer are classic, and this is definitely the intention - this is one of the few films whose main goal is budget. Along with the comic bad taste, there are other great comedic moments - at the very beginning listen to the voice of the father, frightening his children to death, and the most amusing rape scene ever made in the movie. fantastic sticky fun
