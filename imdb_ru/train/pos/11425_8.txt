The story of a little girl who grew up in colonial Africa, but this is much more. <br /> <br /> Anyone who grew up in the South would experience the same thing. Longing for another, another race that cannot be completed. Even the look is forbidden. There are no words required. Their facial expressions talk about everything. <br /> <br /> This is the story of the black servant Proteus (Isaah de Bankole) and the white woman Amy (Julia Bosky) Their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they cannot have each other. <br /> <br /> A little girl, France (Cecile Ducasse) is lonely and spends all her time with Proteus. She really can't see this dance. <br /> <br /> One of the most annoying aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonialists. They can't even get undressed for the bed by themselves. There the world comes to an end; they just don't know it yet. Their racist views will be erased with their presence. <br /> <br /> I think I would like to visit this Africa. It seems so quiet; especially at night when you hear only animals.
