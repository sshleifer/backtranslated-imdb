Being a big fan of Japanese singers Gakt and Hyde, I was terribly excited when I found out that they had made a film together, and that was my mission in life to watch it. I was not disappointed. In fact, this film greatly exceeded my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers, not actors, I was ready for bold, but not very successful performances, but I can happily say that both of them managed to hold me captive and believe in the story as it continued. The Moon Child has only the right amount of humor, action, romance, and serious, heartbreaking moments. I can not say that I have ever cried more in the film, and these more tender moments act wonderfully in a couple, in my opinion, definitely confirming my actors' skills. The battle scenes are absolutely amazing, and although there are a few moments of uncertainty from which you start, you quickly get into the film and start to get involved with the characters. I highly recommend this film to everyone, especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.
