I finally got to see this classic TV film on an unofficial disc recorded from an old VHS, this is a classic piece of horror. It is a pity that this forgotten corner of horror from the point of view of official releases on DVD and VHS ... a television horror film. Recommended for all fans of the 70s television film, very similar to the terror trilogy. Those who are interested should get a book on this topic from David Dil - Television films of the 70s. Email me for a chance to see him ..... it's incredible to see him again. <br /> <br /> He has problems, like in many television films, they have to be quite resourceful in the effects department and it may even seem that in 70 minutes we were all used to more modern editing, but still great much better than many theatrical films released today.
