I saw this film at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival, and I was honored to meet with directors and Tobias Schneebaum, who are all lively and forthright New Yorkers. The name of the film in Amsterdam was “Keep the river to the right,” which makes the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less noticeable. Equally important were the love and homosexual relationships that Tobias Schnebaum had with members of the groups that he studied as an anthropologist. His reunion at almost 80 years of age and the inevitable departure were very touching. I can highly recommend this film to anyone looking for an exciting story that is not pedestrian.
