Absolutely brilliant show. The second season began where the first one ended, with a big mystery. Suspension in most, if not all, episodes and riddles everywhere. The one that made me think and think again. It is truly amazing how a writer can reveal all the connections, link all the characters and combine all these elements to make the characters' life on the show so meaningful. I do not cease to excite and look forward to the new season. We hope that more secrets will be revealed, and at the same time more mysteries will be revealed. A good selection of actors for this show, perfect for characters. Really can not wait to finally reveal the secret. I hope all the hype will not spoil the ending.
