Michelle Rodriguez plays Diana, a high school girl with a brazen frown 2x4 on her shoulder. She is ready to fight anyone, especially her father, who pays for her brotherâ€™s boxing lessons. Diana decides that boxing will be a good way to focus her anger. <br /> <br /> I liked the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas as Adriana is excellent. See how their emotions in relation to each other are formed in a square.
