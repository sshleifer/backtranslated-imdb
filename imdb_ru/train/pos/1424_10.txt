Rather annoying that reviewers continue to compare it to Planet Earth ... Of course * Planet Earth is better - it has a lot more than the same. Earth as an extended trailer for the Planet Earth series, and, as such, is inevitably inferior and simplified. But it doesn't look like that. <br /> <br /> As a documentary about a full-length film (or, actually, about a full-length film), it surpasses almost everything you see in your whole life (if you donâ€™t choose) to fly over the Earth by helicopter long-range cameras and wait for months in the most extreme conditions, to catch a glimpse of the most unusual creatures on earth, which - let's face it - is unlikely). <br /> <br /> About the narrative: yes, everyone in the UK, including myself, adores David Attenborough, and he has few excuses for not telling here, but it hardly deserves to bring down one or three stars. He was not a presenter on Planet Earth, just a storyteller, and I am sure that he is modest and kind enough to understand that everything that attracts more viewers is good. <br /> <br /> Anyone who sees this will be amazed by his trembling, greatness and glory. All reviewers agree with this. Those who love this (that is, everyone) will / should see Planet Earth. Thus, three greetings for his cinematic release, and a big buu for anyone cheap enough to buy it on DVD and not bundled with Planet Earth. But, like works of art, they do not compete here, people. <br /> <br /> Earth is large enough for both.
