Dana Andrews is one of those actors that I probably saw in a dozen films, but who never recorded for me. Often silent, silent, playing the same roles and similar to the underrated Glenn Ford, he is an actor who needs some effort to truly appreciate; but as soon as you hit the right movie .... <br /> <br /> And that's it. Preminger's sullen look at the abdomen of New York is as dirty and battered as any noir of the 1950s, and Andrews in his element as policeman Mark Dickson, who just doesn't know how to play the game to get ahead : he hates criminals too much to always play by the rules. At the beginning of the film, he accidentally killed a murder witness associated with an illegal shit game created by a gangster that Dixon hates for personal reasons, and he spends the rest of the movie trying to hide his involvement and bring the gangster to a kind of justice Along the way, he contacts the alienated wife of the man he killed (Gene Tierney), and should also try to take her father off the hook for murder. <br /> <br /> Amazingly photographed by Joseph La Chelle with Ben Hechtâ€™s tough and sparkling dialogue and a truly powerful finale with elements of tragedy and finding grace in just one or two minutes, this is another noir for centuries and perhaps my the favorite film "Preminger" is still - it is no worse than good, as the more proclaimed Laura.
