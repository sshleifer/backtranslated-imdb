This is almost a perfect movie. The ideas would be repeated by Mamet, but never spoke so briefly. This is actually about the failure of trust, the human condition. The film weaves the thought that we are all criminals, no one is guilty. Is there anyone alive today who has not seen how this happens in our own society, every day? The film is very similar to the Hitchcock thriller. Except that there are no more innocent characters. The world is now completely polluted, destroyed, and everyone is involved in fraud. Can anything be more truthful? <br /> <br /> Don't miss the soundtrack. This is good.
