A lot of things happen in student killing. A mad scientist creates a nearly undetectable poisonous gas. Before he can reap the fruits of his discovery, the scientist was killed by a monk who was welding in a hood. After gas is killed in the church, Scotland Yard is called in to investigate, but the murder continues. Who can stop this crazy killer who seems to be able to come and go as he goes to and from college? <br /> <br /> What works: <br /> <br /> - The killer. What might not like the killer, who sneaks around in a bright red KKK outfit complete with red gloves. The white whip, which he wears and uses very effectively, stands out against the bright red dress. Although the idea of ​​a killer in flaming red dress with pointy heads, sneaking around a school for a girl, is pretty contrived, it is one of the most sinister costumes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> - Groovy 60s Music. I really would like to track the title music to “Killing a College Girl”. He has a jazz, fashionable feeling of the 60s, which I just loved. <br /> <br /> - Bizarre Touches. In addition to the red dress and the killer's hood, the film has a sliding fireplace, an alligator pit with a cage in which cells lie, poison sprinklers, a strategically placed dummy, miniskirts, go-go boots and mile-high hair. I would describe it as a cross between the TV show “Batman” of the 60s and the Italian gallery. Killing a college girl is a real treat for the eyes. <br /> <br /> - The end. Let's just say: turns more than a mountain road. As soon as you think the killer has been uncovered, a turnaround occurs ... and another one ... and another one ... and another one. <br /> <br /> What doesn’t work: <br /> <br /> - Chief Inspector Sir John. I know that this guy was supposed to be comic, but his crazy character has too much screen time. <br /> <br /> - Why alligators? Earlier I mentioned alligators in the pit. And although they are pleasant, they serve very small purposes. Why go through all the trouble and not use them? <br /> <br /> - The plot. Some murders in a college girl have no flow or rhythm. There are too many moments in the film when things inexplicably freeze. Because of the better rhythm, this film would be much more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I didn’t see many of these German crimines, but of the few that I saw (Soho's Ghost, Blackmoor Strangler, Dead Eyes from London) this could be my favorite. It has a really weird feeling that I really enter. If the plot were a little better, I could easily have given the “College Girl Murder” 7/10.
