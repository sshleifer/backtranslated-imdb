Although it was not without his mistakes, this drama was suitable to be shown during Easter. This reminded us of our spiritual self and showed that behind our facades we often hide our deepest sufferings and experiences. There was so much fun in the drama, not least the tapping teenagers who provided the best musical accompaniment to the drama than the rather bad sound in the background. The game was excellent and Timothy Spall was great again. The climax was very satisfactory, although rather simplified. The “release” of Timothy Spalom of his long-dead wife’s suicide was plausible and well reflected the feelings of despair that were present in a teenage girl who had hurt herself. The decision between the graffiti boy and the Muslim was pleasant, but less believable. A wonderful drama that made me and my husband feel that the evening was well spent. Congratulations!
