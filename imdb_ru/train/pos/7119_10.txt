My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (retired major of the United States Marine Corps), was in Guadalcanal and lost a leg in front of the Japanese, and also received the Naval Cross. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was a technical consultant for this film, and I hope that he influenced the film by making it look like it really was, as I read in various comments written by viewers a film that seemed real to me. My father is a fan of facts and figures and always wanted everything to be as it was, so I would like to believe that he is somehow connected with this. <br /> <br /> He currently lives in Okinawa, Japan, married my mother for more than 40 years (ironically, she is Japanese), and several years ago was awarded one of the highest awards from the Emperor of Japan for his the contribution and activities of returning Kendo and Iaido to Japan, since MacArthur banned them from World War II. <br /> <br /> My father was once a marine, but I know that if you're a marine, you're always a marine. And this is exactly what it is, and I love and respect him very much. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this movie if anyone has a copy of it. And I would like to give it to my father for his 94th birthday this year!
