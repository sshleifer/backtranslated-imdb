I recently found this film on VHS after several years of watching it, I was not disappointed. It gets better every time I see it. Peter Ustinov plays a major role and is the co-author of the original script (nominated for an Oscar). Other stars you've heard of are Carl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov plays an accountant / embezzlement, just released from the notorious English prison "Wormwood Wormwood" (he was abducted from the headquarters of the Conservative Party, chosen because he is a liberal). He immediately begins to search for a new employer, from which he can kidnap, and discovers that computers are the wave of the future. He works in social networks in the London men's club and learns the identity of the best computer experts in the city. He steals the identity of Caesar Smith, who had just left town for South America, to start collecting moths in the wild. He leads his way to Ta-Kan-Ko, an American conglomerate headed by Carlton Klempere (Karl Malden). Clemer hires Smith and shows him around the computer center, especially his security function, consisting of flashing blue light. Ustinov asks the computer how to defeat its security, and the computer readily tells him: "Turn off the blue light." Using hacker methods 30 years later, Ustinov bursts into the system and programs the computer to generate checks written to various fake companies. The scheme begins to fall apart when Assistant Klemper Willard Gnatpol (Bob Newhart) notices the amount of business that Ta-Can-Co concludes with fraudulent Ustinov companies. With the help of his secretary, Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov managed to avoid prosecution and live happily ever after. To tell you how to spoil this very funny, romantic, intelligent and proactive picture.
