I only saw two of his photographs earlier, I accepted Altman. I used to always call his filming style “boring.” You just have to be sane to appreciate his crazy genius. <br /> <br /> “HealtH” is quite undervalued and highly questionable. Actually, I don't think he ever was released for VHS. Why? When all these crappy movies go out to DVD every day, is this movie without a reason? Honestly, I had no real problems with this film. It was, for the most part, constantly funny and funny. For some reason, almost all the scenes are mysteriously interesting, be it a wonderful dialogue or subtle presentation. There is a real skill here. <br /> <br /> Paul Dooley's stay at the bottom of the pool halfway is amazing. <br /> <br /> If you can, try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem. This is not ideal, but it is much better than most of the sludge receiving DVD releases. Damn, I'd be happy with a good VHS copy of this thing. <br /> <br /> Although this is often on the Fox Movie Channel, so watch out for it.
