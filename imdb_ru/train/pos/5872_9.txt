Who votes in these ratings? “Jacknif” is a beautifully played, brilliantly observable work with actors, especially Ed Harris and the incomparable Robert De Niro (please don't mention Marlon Brando in the one breath of this taxi driver) “to confirm this point). This is a “worldly” movie, because there is no sex / meaningless action / nudity in it. This film is about the complexity of the characters. Ed Harris makes you feel every moment with him, and his emotional outburst towards the end is heartbreaking. The way he orders a young man in a bar to take off his military clothes is an excellent observation of how fashion and cinema use tragic situations and how upset real men should feel to see a young, jumped sports suit. While we are on this topic "Casino" 7.8 out of 10? One of the greatest films of all time, from one of the greatest directors, starring the greatest film actor of all time, with the worst movie psychotic gangster ever, only warrants slightly above average? COME ON!!!!!
