A series of vignettes, most of which fake 1970s television, but also with some splits in government and corporate America. One of the longest segments, "Dealers", is not so funny for me, and I do not know that it parodies. Some of the others, though, are absolutely split. I especially like the culinary show. Most of the dirty words I know are used in the film, and if you object to total frontal nudity, do not fit.
