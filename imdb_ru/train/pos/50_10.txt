My children once stopped at this film that night, and when it all began, it really aroused my interest. I had to go to the bowling league, so they recorded it for me on the DVR, then to see the rest. Well, I just finished watching this, and before my shirt should be soaked after crying buckets. It was a great movie, although I almost felt the pain and suffering that these girls were experiencing. And I would never have guessed after a million years why Alicia had turned from this beautiful girl into an antisocial goth. It was probably WHY my shirt got wet because I experienced the same pain that Alicia felt. I would not look for this film either, but I am sure that I am glad that I saw it. Very touching, very touching. Great for those who love good drama or jerk.
