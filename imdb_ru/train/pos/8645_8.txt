I saw this film many years ago, and it made a lasting impression on me. Alas, over the past years I have steeled myself to many films and did not expect that “California” will be impressed with the recent viewing. I am pleased to say that he is as nervous and watchable as he was ten years ago. <br /> <br /> There are two things that really give this film all the power. The first is the cast. We have a tremendously worrisome turn from young Brad Pitt as Early Grace. Knowing how we all know Pitt, as one of the most persistent heartbeats that Hollywood has ever experienced, it's good to see that he plays such a nasty, unattractive character. Pitt puts on a show without resorting to cliches or parodies of "white trash", and he manages to remain truly scary throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Juliette Lewis is equally impressive, as is the tragic girlfriend Grace, who has been playing a character for ten years. an old woman with forty years of life experience. Lewis manages to cause pity (for the life position of his character), as well as contempt (for her naivety), but she reinforces her performance with the subtlety that such a young actor rarely notices. Personally, I think it is a tragedy that neither Pitt nor Lewis was nominated for any awards for his performances here. <br /> <br /> David Dukhovoni and Michel Forbes perfectly played the role of a young couple who unwittingly ends up traveling the USA with Pitt and Lewis. Spiritually successful and naive, and Forbes looks extremely cynical and detached, but both actors manage to convincingly portray the changes of their characters, because they are equally intrigued, repulsed and strangely attracted by Pitt. <br /> <br /> A beautiful cast and evenly brilliant image aside, this film really captures us with the notorious balls due to its impeccable stimulation. At the time the film "California" was released, Hollywood produced many good films about how to turn into psychos (Lonely White Woman, Pacific Heights, Hand That Swings the Cradle, Deceived with the enemy ", etc.). Most of these films followed the same formula, the only variation was the nature of the relationship between a good guy and a bad guy. “California” is actually not too far from this territory, but its first two acts are a great example of a slow-flashing thriller, and we sit on the very edge of our seats, waiting for the tide to turn. /> <br /> When the penny falls, and Pitt is released to play the maniacal bad guy, the movie switches completely, and the last twenty minutes do not quite match the rest of the movie. However, the action is thick and fast, and the resolution fits cold. The fight is over, but the scars will always be there. <br /> <br /> Much of the narration (provided by a little whiny, pre-secret "Clergy") is a bit invented. Of course, this should be from a book written by a journalist character in Dukhovoni, so it can be argued that a shy story should be a tribute to the sensational style in which most journalists write. <br /> The film is a success in many ways and, of course, head and shoulders above 90% of thrillers over the past twenty years. Highly recommended, but not for a weak stomach or mind. This film is disturbing on several levels. But then it should be.
