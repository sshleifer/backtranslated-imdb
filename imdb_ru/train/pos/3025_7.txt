Bacall here is doing well - especially considering that this is just her second film. This one is often overshadowed because it falls between two great successes: “To have and not to have” (1944) and “Big Dream” (1945), both of which connected her with Humphrey Bogart. Of course, this film does not correspond to other films, but I think it is not through its own fault. I think it was a bit strange when she portrayed a British lady from the bark. No accent. I think all the strange accents were distracted - Boyer, of course, was not Spanish. It was difficult to determine exactly which country people were from. <br /> <br /> I really liked black and white cinematography. The mood is very influential - I especially liked the fog scene. Lighting also perfectly complements intrigue and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacall is awesome. Boyer is simply not suitable for me as the romantic role of the protagonist - so he and Bacall were a bit strange. Not great chemistry - and, of course, there is no magic Gods and Bacall. But I still really liked this picture. There is a strong tension, and it moves quite well. I must say that I found the killing of a little girl brave enough for this historical film. <br /> <br /> Katina Paksinu and Peter Lorre stand out in a supporting role. Paksinu as the keeper of the hotel is absolutely villainous and evil in her image. Her only scene where she laughs like a maniac when Mr. McKerji leaves after exposing her as the child’s killer is quite disturbing. Lorre is also quite successful in his slimy, snake-like image. Konteras is a dastardly coward to the end. Wanda Bendrix also portrayed the child pretty well for the rest - especially considering that this was her first photo, and she was only 16 years old (although she looks much younger). It turns out that she later married Aui Murphy, who was a short, stormy marriage.
