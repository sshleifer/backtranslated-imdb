Barbara Stenvik gives this early, universal Douglas Sirk soap to the exact blow he needs. Not as memorable as Sirk's later melodramas, it's easy to see by looking at “All I Want”, where Sirk will move artistically in the next few years. Stanwyk is a dancer who returns to her family in a small town, USA, after she left them a decade earlier. Her family and society have mixed emotions with her shocking return. Part of the cinematography is amazing, and Stanvik is as tough as a nail and really gives this film a boost of energy. Overall a pretty good show.
