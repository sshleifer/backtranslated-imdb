I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago, and since then it’s stuck in my head. In the film, unfortunately, a mediocre documentary, the two main characters. To get a true story about Beals, I had to go through all the bonus DVDs and comments and search the Internet. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Maysles and their fans (not to mention Edith and Edie themselves) abound with the assumption that this film is exploitative, it is exploitation in the truest sense of the word. Very little effort was made to explain Beals or how they came to the state they were in - it seems that Myles’s approach is simply to turn on the camera and wait for Edith and Edie to say something outrageous. The sound even on the reprint of Criterion is bad and difficult to follow. Although I appreciate that this film was shot a little earlier in the history of documentary, ironically comparing it with the TV series Geraldo Rivera (!), Which tells about the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at Wiltenbrook Public School on Staten Island since 1972, for four years . before Gray Gardens was shot. <br /> <br /> Paraphrasing the review in New York, Edith and Edie were needed by many in their lives, and the documentary was not one of them. <br /> <As for Edith and Edie, what I kept thinking about when I watched the movie was “where the hell is their family”? They lived in dangerous, unhealthy, unsafe conditions. How did it happen that Jackie O, married to one of the richest people on earth (or the richest Bouvier family), could not allow Edith and Edie a decent home? Or at least hire a temporary housekeeper or caregiver to come and watch them both? It is a shame and a long shame for the whole Bouvier family. <br /> <br /> Although this review may seem negative, I strongly recommend Gray Gardens to anyone who loves documentaries. Maybe someday someone will come and make a documentary about this documentary, bringing the rich backstory (and backstory) of Beals and the whole sub-section of Hampton society in the 1970s.
