I was impressed with the beautiful photo in this film that was shot on the Alaska site. Although technically it is a melodrama, we see many activities that Eskimos do, such as hunting, dancing, building igloo, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to their visitors, are usually present in this story. Hunting sequences were sometimes removed from the warehouse, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but even they were fascinating. Underwater hunting for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it a documentary at times. There was no cast list that reinforced the documentary flavor. The filmmakers tried to make it seem very authentic, as the Aborigines spoke only Eskimo language, which was translated by someone on the screen or with the help of inscriptions. The introduction stated that, apart from the white traders and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not quite the case. The two main characters that Mala and Lotos Long played were Eskimo by origin, but were professional actors who had subtitles in earlier films, and sometimes you could see what makeup they were wearing. But they were excellent in their roles and continued their careers in Hollywood. In general, the film is definitely worth watching.
