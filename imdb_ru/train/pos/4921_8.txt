Like “A Streetcar Named Desire” (also directed by Gadg on stage and on the screen) “Panic on the Streets” portrays New Orleans, in which its main claim to fame — the birthplace of jazz — is not even mentioned. It was Richard Widmark's seventh film, and he may have come a long way to validate him as the great actor he really was, and not just a psychotic killer. Gadg himself plays a small role as an assistant of the morgue, but the film is rich in talents, starting with Jack Palance (still exposed as Walter Jack Palance), when the local Mr. "Big" followed the side impact of Zero Mostel, Barbara Bel Geddes, Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig and another trustworthy Paul Douglas in the role of a policeman who comes to the point of view of Dr. Widmark. This is a very useful film, because it is not enough to see it. Catch it if you can.
