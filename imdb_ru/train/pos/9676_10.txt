The film was very sweet and touching! I cry almost every time I watch a movie. I would recommend this film to everyone. The film was very inspiring to me. The actors did a great job, and the film was very well played and ready. The film was about a little girl who had a parrot she called Paulie. Paulie separated her from her parents, because they thought it would be better for her. <br /> <br /> After Paulie had survived so many people, he ended up in a cage in the basement. Finally this Russian man who got a job as a cleaner. He found Paulie in the basement, and Paulie began talking to him, telling him the story of his life. In the end, the man helped Paulie reunite with Marie (the little girl who raised Paulie). Love overcame all obstacles.
