I love this movie because it's a great movie made by people who care about making it an art, not just a home movie. It is filled with Greg Noll's Super Surfer home movies, and a variety of amateur videos from others that join his 50-year passion. However, it has been expanded to such an extent that it is approaching aesthetic glory. It is filled with artistic talent and sports talent, no matter how simple you think that surfing is a sport. Surfers are neither astronauts nor test pilots. Nor are they surgeons (perhaps) or PhDs (again, perhaps). He believes in the search for a surfer. He believes in the beauty of human stupidity. He believes in the great gift of peace that comes from ending the war. Surfers celebrate the end of the war on the north shore of the Hawaiian island, which was attacked by Japanese zeros fifteen years ago. It celebrates the downtime of a country that waged a cold war instead of a hot war with the Russian socialists. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism. It is dangerous, but only a little historically. I suspect that Alexander the Great will not be famous for his surfing technique. He had to go out and subdue dozens of countries to get the favorable press he received. There are no military heroes in this movie. He has no weapons. The only conqueror of beach surfers has a beer stand and surf shop. This is not a problem. The world is not desperate. This is the joy of expiration.
