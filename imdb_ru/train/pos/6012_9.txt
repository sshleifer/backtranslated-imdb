Antonioni was aiming for another masterpiece of the hip, this time on the other side of the Atlantic, than "Blow up". This was not a success with critics and youth as the first one though. What for? Perhaps because it was a European view of America, filled with a cliché that did not work then and that could not stand it. (Revolutionary students are initially confused.) <br /> <br /> It’s possible when big blockbusters were released, and films aimed specifically at the youth market seemed outdated. If he had been released the year before, perhaps the hippies in the deserts would seem fresh ... This is a very interesting film, very beautifully shot with some brilliant and Antonion scenes between them, like making love in the desert, silence about the desert mansion and explosive the end ... The fact that the guides were two lovers did not help. They were beautiful, but inexperienced. Marc Fréchette is slightly better than Daria Halprin. It would be much better with real actors! Maybe Michelle Phillips or young Jessica Lange ... The dialogue is actually quite funny and shrill, sometimes you don’t know how the lines are delivered ... <br /> <br /> A very interesting document from the end of the sixties is definitely worth looking at the photo and soundtrack ....
