Despite the patronage of George Lucas, this fascinating and completely original fantasy in “Lumage” (a combination of animation through live action clips) is about as far from the usual children's fare as everything that Ralph Bakshi did during his heyday. Brilliantly thought-out characters, such as the shape-changing dog Ralph (one of a clumsy duo of rejected heroes), Botch Synonyms, a cheerful villain with dirty lips, and the Rescuer Rod (a pompous beginner superhero) breathed life into a uniquely clever concept: Freedvs against Merkwood or everlasting the struggle between dreams and nightmares. In this context, songs filled with MOR on the soundtrack should not have worked, but somehow. Therefore, it is a pity that I had to watch this through a truly stupid boot (selected from a television screen) version without censorship ?? is there also a softer version that softened the language for its release of VHS ?? because the film is otherwise not available on DVD. Interestingly, Henry Selick and David Fincher worked on this picture in a subordinate capacity.
