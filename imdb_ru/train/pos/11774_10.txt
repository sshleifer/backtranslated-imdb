Is it a good idea to use live animals for storefronts? <br /> <br /> No, and this is why .... <br /> <br /> In the book “Hare conditional”, the sale in which the promotion assistance is mistaken is over, and the store manager (Nelson) translates it into new department: taxidermy. Naturally, the Bugs object, and the fun begins. <br /> <br /> using almost all departments of the store (children's clothes, sports goods, shoes, suits, women's nightgowns - do not ask), Bugs comes out on top in every turn, even addressing the manager as “The Great GilderSNEEZE” . Even being trapped in an elevator, Bugs does everything he can to cope with the situation. <br /> <br /> Director Jones, as always, is at the top of his pictorial game, like Blanc (like Bugs, Natch) and Nelson the manager, who sounds like Gilderslives radio station, go ask your grandparents). <br /> <br /> And wise advice: when faced with a fuzzy woman who wants to try on slippers in the bathroom, always check her ears. <br /> <br /> Ten stars for "Air Conditioning Hare" - the best argument in favor of the laws on the work of animals.
