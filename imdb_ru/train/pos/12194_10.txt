The surreal film "Noir" was released soon after the "real", defining the classic genre of "The Maltese Falcon", "Double Refund" and "The postman always calls twice." Wells films should not be evaluated against others. He played by different rules. He actually played. It begins where other films about the femme fatale end, so the vaguely logical (but interesting) film is decorated with a demonstration of Wellesian scenes (typical style of rapid fire), dialogue (a lot of “cool” philosophy) and an unusual acting game. (a good Hayworth is supposedly intentionally one-dimensional). For Wells, “genre” could mean “formula,” but he seemed to like to use “riddles” as a background for his “entertainment.”
