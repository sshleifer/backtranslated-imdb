This review is about the late China Moon and John Enthistle. <br /> <br /> Original drum and bass. <br /> <br /> It seems that these days sooner or later there will be frames with movies. Moreover, let us allow ourselves to experience this, nowadays it is, as a rule, of a completely different kind. Who in general is a parody, a shadow of their (much) better years. Honestly, none of them need to prove anything to anyone anymore, they deserve their respect over time. <br /> <br /> This concert video for me is one of the best. To command an audience of about 400,000 and more powerful people, one needs skill, charisma, wit, and a lot of damn good music. <br /> <br /> We all know about other actions on the account, The Doors (their last show a few weeks before the death of Jim Morrison), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many others. The fact is that, whoever was there, it was He, who came the majority. This show was a year after the 1960s Great Hippie Festival; Woodstock The film and the plate came out, like the greatest work to date, Tommy. The always hungry crowd wanted to try, to be able to experience their unique event, to be able to “Grove and Love”, knowing that this concert was their own. To do this, you needed the best of what rock and roll should have thrown into an eagerly enticing crowd. <br /> <br /> At two in the morning at the end of August 1970, M.S. Announces: “Ladies and gentlemen, a small rock and roll band from Shepherds Bush London, OO.” <br /> <br /> John Entwistle's black leather suit, front line is the Human skeleton from neck to toe, Roger wore his traditional stage outfit of long tassels and long flowing hair, Keith in a white T-shirt and jeans, and Pete had a white jumpsuit and Doc Martins, which he preferred to wear. <br /> <br /> The Who never stopped their onslaught of High Energy Rock for more than two hours, playing them and other great tracks by other artists, such as Young Man Blues, Shaking 'all Over, and then, like in the queue, Kate mobbed the crowd “Shut up, this is a bleeding opera” with Tommy, Rock Opera. Grunted crazy. This is what they heard, and the One who did not disappoint went straight to the Overture and never went on the air until the last note: “Tommy, can you hear me?” Amazing. <br /> <br /> Shooting a show of this magnitude with a group of such growth at their peak at the festival, which was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the world, was a fantastic piece of Cinematic History. <br /> <br /> English DVD comes only with English soundtrack / Linear PCM Stereo, as in the States, I think you can get it from at least 5.1, "Check the local press for details ??" on this one, alright. <br /> <br /> The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes, without further ado, which is disappointing. Yes, for a piece of rock history and festivals, this DVD will take you on a nostalgic journey through the memory lane the moment you hit play, for some of the best Who live videos they should be, Live, Raw and in your face. ! <br /> <br /> I would give this DVD ten if there were not a shortage of 5.1, and some additions would be good. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Roger, Pete, John and Keith.
