The play, similar to Kurt Russell's chameleon in combination with the impeccable film production of John Carpenter, makes this film, without a doubt, one of the best biographies in the genre of boobies. This is also true: the emotional foundation is strong enough to never age; Carpenter retained for posterity the strength and highest urgency of the life of the only king of rock and roll. (I was a frontier Elvis fan for most of my life, but only when I saw this stunning film did I look OUT of the manâ€™s image. It was quite a revelation.) ELVIS remains one of the top ten films of all time.
