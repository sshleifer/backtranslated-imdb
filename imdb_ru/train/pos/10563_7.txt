Wow ... what ... whirlwind. The thirties is a decade with a lot of films of all types that I can imagine, especially at the early stage of conversations. There were films that were painfully static and boring, like, for example, “Dracula” with Bella Lugosi, and there were some that simply do not allow him to rest, sometimes in a good way, and sometimes not. This is one of the films that does not stop for a minute, and it is both a miracle and a pity. Lloyd Bacon, who also directed 42nd Street, was supposed to be the king of the Depression era musicals, and he was probably excited by the possibilities of sound brought into the world of cinema, as he filled this picture with it. There should not be a minute or two without music or talk. This is completely insane! I thought the film deserved 5 (or 6 peaks), because the pace was very bad, because it was insanely fast, and sometimes I didn’t know what was going on and what to think. The characters seemed to just run back and forth, talking about things that I was not interested in and, probably, no one else. I thought I would just be rewarded with a little headache. I noticed that Lloyd Bacon also played a major role in 42nd Street, Ruby Keeler, and 42nd Street was a film whose final was the best part of it. And you know what? The same thing happened with the "Parade of legs"! The ending is absolutely incredible! He became the most impressive musical I've ever seen. The final part presents some musical numbers, and believe me, this is something that is worth looking at the rest of the film. The numbers are perfect! There are three big bits, and the most impressive is definitely the second. Suddenly the screen was filled with magnificent and inventive camera work, beautiful people and simple entertainment that made me forget my little headache.
