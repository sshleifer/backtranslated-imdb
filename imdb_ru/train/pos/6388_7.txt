Here's what I knew about Atlantis before watching: <br /> <br /> * - this is officially the first animated sci-fi adventure of Disney. I'm not sure how accurate this is (I like finding fault), but I was curious when I first heard its description. <br /> <br /> * - The preview was pretty damn cool for the most part. Obviously, it was also “too mysterious”, according to some critics, after this fact. <br /> <br /> * - Obviously, it was so terrible that Disney said: “Screw, let's republish“ Spy Kids ”. <br /> <br /> So after all this, like a movie? <br /> <br /> Hi, awesome. <br /> <br /> I am a lover of animated fantasies, in which participate In any case, incendiary music and impetuous special effects, but Atlantis is doing everything possible. This is a return to all CGI frames in Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, so much so that it is almost the best animator in effects. Perhaps the characters are not so memorable (except, perhaps, the medical officer of the ship), and the plot is a bit boring, but this is not the film that you are watching the plot. <br /> <br /> Here is the argument that bothers me. The “failure” (like, for example, “only” took about five hundred million or so; I know the animators who would have killed to see fifteen bucks of this) of this film compared to the popularity of “Shrek” and “Monsters Inc.” was seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation. I do not think this is true. How do you feel about the film "South Park"? What about "Final Fantasy"? Indeed, history and artistry are all, not a method. I don’t know what Disney’s movie will look like, but I don’t think they’re visible yet.
