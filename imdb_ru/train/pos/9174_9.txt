There were a lot of movies and TV shows about Jane Eyre, each of which had its own recommendations, but I suspect that this is what people will continue to discover and fall in love with themselves decades later. It is just a classic (and offers much more history than others). Timothy Dalton is completely in his element as Rochester, rarely missing a mark; his game is amazingly clever and colorful, and at the same time never deviates too far from the dark complexities of the character. Jane Zella Clark is more cerebral than the otherworldly, but she makes the perfect foil for Dalton (which, accordingly, towers over her!). At the second viewing, the nuances of her performance are better manifested (as soon as you absorb the shock of Dalton's charisma). There are some technical issues and a couple of moments when production figures could be better; although this was largely a first-class production according to BBC standards of that time. But it is the performances that bring real pleasure. Do not miss it!
