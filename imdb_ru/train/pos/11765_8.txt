This film surprised me, it had good remarks and laughter, + a non-stop storyline with a lot of gun actions and explosions. In this film, surprisingly, there were a lot of good turns. The plot is solid, despite what others may think, he maintained my interest all the time until the very end. Finally; This is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time on.
