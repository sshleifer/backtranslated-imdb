I watched this movie on DVD a couple of times, the first time I watched the second half after an hour, and then went back to the first hour. an exciting, fascinating film, thank God, not Keira Knightley in it, refreshing, and it gives us a real idea of ​​the difficult life of Queen Victoria and the difficult choices she had to make. There is nothing wrong with the film, there is nothing wrong with the language or something of a sexual nature that could offend family viewing. May encourage children to learn a little about Queen Victoria herself and possibly less well-known characters such as Conroy and Lord Melbourne.
