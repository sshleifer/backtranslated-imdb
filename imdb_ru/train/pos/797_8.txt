For those who did not follow the case of the murder of Anna Marie Fahey. You are missing out on one of the saddest but hardest kills of all. The killer is a popular lawyer for the state of Delaware, Tom Kapano, and the victim is the secretary for planning of the governor of the state of Delaware, Ann Marie Fahey. Their relationship was kept secret until her disappearance and murder. She wanted to leave him, but he simply would not let her go so easily. On the other hand, he had a mistress, a wife, and four daughters. Where did he find time for two mistresses and family life? In addition, the case is extremely complex and fascinating for a four-hour mini-series. While the actress who plays Ms. Fahey does a great job, she has no dark long hair. His other lover is definitely more attractive than a real woman. Mark Harmon looks better and performs an Emmy Award as Tom Kapano. It would be better with the actual locations of Delaware and Philadelphia. With executive producer Ann Ruhl, she adds precision to Ann Marie's characterization of the organization and her personal struggle with eating disorder. These bits of information can be skipped by any other executive producer or director. If you have not read the book, it is worth it. Ann Ruhl is a fascinating true crime narrator. Ironically, Mark Harmon plays Tom Kapano. He also played a former friend and subject of Anne Ruhl, Ted Bundy, in another book adaptation many years ago. He was great then and now. He does the work above average with an amazing story. Even President Clinton offered his help in the Ann Marie Fahey case. And now former Governor Tom Carper is now the senator from Delaware, who won the November 2000 election of long-time popular Senator Richard Roth. If you do not find the film interesting, then read the rule book.
