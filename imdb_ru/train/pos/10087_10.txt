The fabulous costumes of Edith Head, who drew them on Liz Taylor in all her glory! <br /> <br /> SFX are very good for a film of their own age, and alternates actually looked like actors, even to the physique - a rarity in this vintage movie. <br /> <br /> A cozy movie with great panoramas - even when it is shot to pan and scan.
