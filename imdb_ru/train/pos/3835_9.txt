This movie is awesome - it's just a nightmare. Strange history, dark decors, insects that swarm everywhere, the idea of ​​jumping and surrealistic dreams ... Really great! People who like cult films or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic. David Lynch’s films seem little: a strange story, strange dreams, red curtains. Nuit Noire contains almost no plot. It is rather a series of surreal events, nightmares and meetings. This is a flaw. If the film had a really exciting plot, full of tension and fascinating ending, I would give it 10 out of 10. But this is not enough, and therefore I gave the film 8. Nuit Noire is a film worth watching. Look for this DVD and you will be rewarded!
