I like this presentation - I read Bleak House and I know that presenting the whole book the way it should be, is very difficult, and even people like Little Dorrit - I have to admit that they did a very good show with production director Nicolas Nickelby. I love Diana Rigg, and I could see the pain of Lady Dedlock, even through the expected arrogance of the aristocracy. I'm sorry, I think she’s the best Lady Dedlock ... I'm not sure who could make Jarndays better, but I'm fine with Mr. Elliott. It’s not easy to imagine these long Dickens books - Oliver Twist will be easier - it’s a long time, and if you don’t care, all legal situations can be boring or boring. I think this presentation is interesting enough not to be boring. I just loved Mr. Smallview - that might be interesting. There is always a child - Joe will break your heart ... I think we should give a chance to judge for ourselves ... <br /> <br /> I must say that I liked the show. Maybe if I read the book again, as usual, after watching the movie, maybe I can be more critical. For now - I think this is a good presentation.
