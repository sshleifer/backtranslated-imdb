This is definitely one of my favorite American Pie Spin offs, mainly because in most others the main character (one of the young Stifler) always seems unrealistic in nature. <br /> <br /> For example, AP: Naked Mile. You have a teenage boy surrounded by naked female students, and he is especially hot to save him from a “problem” with virginity, and he eventually stops the middle of the business and rides his horse back to sleep with his girlfriend, who in mind gave him a "pass without guilt" for the weekend. I can appreciate the romantic aspect of all this, but let's be realistic; most people who watch these films are not particularly looking for a romantic story. <br /> <br /> While the latest release seems to be finally aware of who the viewer is, good old Eric Stifler seems to wake up and smell the rose and, as always, Mr. Levenshtein attaches to his “completely natural” humor eyebrow equation and won the touchdown in this new film.
