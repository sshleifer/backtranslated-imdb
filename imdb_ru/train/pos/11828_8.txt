"Dick Tracy" - one of the favorites of our family - the actors are wonderful - an exceptional artistic direction - the music is magic. It should not be "Kill a Mockingbird" - this is a fun experience. <br /> <br /> Steven Sondhimim’s star songs are "Back in Business" energetic, "Sooner or Later" is just right "" What Can You Lose "haunts - even tunes like" Live Alone and Like "add to the story <br /> <br /> Enjoyed the incredibly exciting performances of Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Hadley, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, supporting villains ... The list is too long. And yes - even Madonna and Warren Beatty is awesome. Written with a smile at the minute (how many times we looked at each other and said: “Wait, I had a thought - it is gone! ”). <br /> <br /> However, one of the most striking things in this film is that all the participants seem to have a good time, and this, above all, adds to the enjoyment of the viewer. So, if you haven’t done so yet, why not give Dick Tracy a chance to accept him as he is - Sunday comics brought to life - and in a wonderful way !!
