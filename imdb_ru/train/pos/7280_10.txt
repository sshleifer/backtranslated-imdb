look like a kid. Although now I’ll probably find it terrible, it was a bit strange since I was only seven or so. I also remember how I worked on the riddle on Saturday when I looked at it, so I didn’t pay much attention to it. However, the scene with rotating boulders has burned in my memory since then. I asked many people if they had seen this film, but to no avail. 12 years ago, one person mentioned that he may have seen it, but he thought it was just a dream; A bizarre wind like a freak. This is not a dream, my friend. Do not dream now. Again, I have not seen it since then, but I can't wait to find a copy and paste it into my VCR. Everything that can remain in my head for 23 years deserves a "10".
