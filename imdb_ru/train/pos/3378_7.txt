This film came to me highly recommended by Matt Groening. Well, in fact, I watched The Simpsons and Futurama, and in both cases it is mentioned, so I decided that for crap. The film tells about several “what if” that make you realize how lucky we are today, when we take things as simple as soap and water for granted. Interestingly, in 2022 men still shave with one razor! It's nice that those in charge did not overload the film with unnecessary special effects, ray guns, etc. Some kind of "furniture" that looks good, when you understand what this means. Remember, “Tuesday is Soilent’s Green Day”
