A wonderful early musical film from Rene Claire, just as fun and witty as his quiet Italian Straw Hat. Using sound in an expressive way, not just for dialogue and effects, Claire influenced early musicals in America (for example, the opera Night at the Opera was greatly influenced by Le Million). Must (but will not) be seen by all movie lovers, and the Criterion DVD will be as good as expected. There are no tons of add-ons, but most of the DVDs I've seen are useless, and the interview with Claire on the disc is something I have never seen. Get it while it's still nearby.
