This is a great movie for all Generations X. What a different world America 1972 compared with our psychotic 21st century. You can feel how America of 1972 went by watching this movie. I found that clothing and car styles brought back pleasant memories of a much better country than now. Just think ... then there were only 4 or 5 television stations to choose from. There was no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Road Rage, 911, Bird Flu, Freeway Snipers, etc. And so on. The Vietnam War has just ended. Until the release of "Star Wars" another 7 years. Personal computer and the Internet will be 29 years old. <br /> <br /> When this film appeared, the producers had to sell the film themselves, like no other film company wanted it. Thus, he began touring small Protestant churches throughout the country shown on film projectors (it was a few days before VCRS, of course). The pastor of the church, who would be interested in showing “The Thief in the Night” to his congregation, will receive a copy of the film. He then arranged the evening to show it in the church meeting room or in the dining room. Members of the congregation invited "unsaved" friends and family members, and this would be a social event of the week. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome the limited production value of a movie and just watch its nostalgic value, then I think you will like the movie more. Of course, I speak as a general. <br /> <br /> If I had a time machine, I would have returned in 1972 and said goodbye to the cesspool of the 21st century, which we have now.
