I really liked this movie. I was fifteen years old when this film came out and I was able to tell about it. This will be a film that I will show my children so that they know what their normal feelings are. It's funny to see how we can be so devastated by things at such a young age .. who knew we would recover ... again and again .... Great movie !!!!
