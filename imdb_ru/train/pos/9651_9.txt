What at first seemed like another reticent French film, offering nothing more than sinister feelings, for the second time, it became for me a really insightful and very satisfactory presentation. <br /> <br /> Next is a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Poor Cedric; he obviously did not know what hit him. Bad audience; At first we were involved in what seemed to be a truly beautiful and romantic story, and only then returned to the dark reality of inconsistency. The two guys just didn’t belong to each other since their first mixed meeting. Since Mathieu and Cédric were sexually attracted to each other, the lack of a deeper emotional connection made it impossible for Mathieu, an intellectual being, to achieve satisfaction by sharing life with someone whose feelings were more adapted to carnival festivals and noisy performances on the beach. <br /> <br /> From a purely technical point of view, I liked the action in this movie. The subtitles were completely unnecessary, although my French is “preque rien”. I could watch it again without the annoying translation to English and enjoy it even more. It was a sharp, very professionally made motion picture. Although many scenes seem redundant, I rate it nine out of ten.
