When I first saw this film in the 1980s, I was in my teens and was somewhat reluctant to see it, since I considered myself an adult and beyond the age of Sesame / Doll Street. Honestly, I don't remember whether I liked it at the time or not. However, somewhere in college, I watched this film again, and it was (and remained) in my personal collection of Best Films Ever. <br /> <br /> This movie is DOWNLOADED with humor, which is much higher than that which goes beyond that. expected from a doll. I mean, it is obvious that adults and children always liked puppets, because humor is oriented to both generations. But come on ... Janice accidentally heard someone say: “I don’t remove clothes to anyone, even if it’s artistic” ... a joke from father to son that if a son is in love with Kermit Frog, then the father does not want to hear it ... Gonzo rescues a chicken with resuscitation from mouth to mouth (sp?) And then says: "I think we are engaged now" ... this and many other moments in the film made me roll. Add to this a very clever dialogue, a very clever New York / Broadway humor "wink", the usual large number of famous cameos and some really enjoyable songs that do not border on the "cheesy kids level" at all ... this film is a masterpiece! I do not throw out "10" on a regular basis ... but this one deserves it. After 20 years, this film is fully justified, perhaps even more so. Dolls have never been and never will be as fun, clever and just brilliant as this film was and is. --- Q
