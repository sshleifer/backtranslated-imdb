This is the first film from the Guinea Pig series, and is one of the most notorious films from the collection. <br /> <br /> It took me a long time to finally figure out and get a copy of this notorious group of films. I bought a set for guinea pigs and decided to see the collection in order to the release date. So I slipped this sucker and sat down. <br /> <br /> Based on what I read on the Internet, and realizing the content of this film, I expected to test my nerves in full force. In the end, this was not the case. <br /> <br /> The film tells about a group of men who abduct a woman and begin to torture her in the hope of finding a turning point, and for how long a person can endure pain. . <br /> <br /> Looks like one sick click, right? Wrong. The film is not shocking. This may be due to the fact that over the years I have lost sensitivity to my obsession with horror, but I think that it can be said with confidence that any real hound could easily go through with it. <br /> <br /> A person who doesnâ€™t know well this type of film is more likely to be amazed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen. Although it did not shock me, the film contains several rather vile and graphic scenes of violence. Including snatch nails, intestines, thrown into an unconscious woman, and a needle through the eye. <br /> <br /> In general, I think that for most hounds on this board you should just pick up a copy of this film for the novelty of this, but I suggest that for any newcomer to these types of films, you must break through to that.
