I thought King Solomonâ€™s mines were beautifully made. My only reservation was Alison Doody. Her acting was excellent, but her make-up and hairstyle were not the time, and always seemed to make her look out of place with other actors. I thought Patrick Swayze was a great choice for Alan Quatermain. It was nice to see an experienced, stern-looking actor in this role after watching a movie after a movie with fair-haired, fair-skinned actors such as Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. He was a great choice and I liked every minute of the movie. This version can not be compared with the version of the 1950s with Stuart Granger. It was a big screen movie, not a television movie. I thought both Quatermains were plausible, but the two means should be separated. I look forward to seeing it again, and I hope Patrick Swayze will look at this type of role again.
