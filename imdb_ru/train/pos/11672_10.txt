Great pirate entertainment! It has all the good ingredients to keep attention - a fascinating story about intrigue, a fiery lady pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara), who attracts the compelling Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn), who is on his secret mission. They make a wonderful romantic couple on the screen - sigh! <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is an evil, bad pirate, weaving his own evil web "divide and conquer." I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick, who plays the minor role of Mrs. MacGregor, protector of the young princess Patma (Alice Kelly). <br /> <br /> Landscapes of the coastline, ships and bay are beautifully shot here. , Many actions of battles with swords, battles on ships, bold jumps of Errol Flynn (Robin Hood aboard ship!). From the most glowing redhead, I once heard in an interview with Maureen O'Hara that she boasted great possession of the whip and in those days could have surpassed Flynn in a sword fight, but here it wouldnâ€™t be necessary to check it. <br /> <br /> Very nice movie.
