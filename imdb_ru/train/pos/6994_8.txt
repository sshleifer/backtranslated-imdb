Bela made 9 photographs for the Monogram, but only in THIS, the 4th, things began to converge. All others in the series will use this template as the main template for the production, writing and development of characters. From now on, better or worse, the series will also deal with one important topic: the scientist (usually Bela) conducts experiments in the basement or in the old house (sometimes in the basement in the old house), which causes things to go damn strange. It was also the first time that art director Dave Milton had the opportunity to spread his wings. He climbed aboard for the BLACK DRAGONS, click before, but THIS is the one where he gets his craft to start clicking. Lewis created a great atmosphere almost for nothing and was next to all the other Monograms. Casting plays a key role in this, and this is a pretty good movie in this film. You get Barclay and Harlen (also from Black Dragons) along with Russell, who will star in Lewton's CAT PEOPLE films ... and Rosetto from SPOOKS RUN WILD ... a wonderful piece of Poverty talent. If you have limited time and budget, start with this ... it sums up everything they have learned up to this point, and gives you something to compare with the rest. Plot? Bela steals ferrous juice to keep her nasty wife young. They both love to sleep in coffins. If you can read it and smile, the rest will be easy.
