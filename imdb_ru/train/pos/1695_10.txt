Usually the best way to annoy me in a movie is to add a link to Orson Welles. But here is a sci-fi comedy with reference to the War of the Worlds broadcast ... and this is gold! The very concept of a small handful of small, aggressive and stupid aliens who are mistaken for children in a Halloween dress is gorgeous. Do not be fooled by the fact that it looks like a children's film, it is unsophisticated - itâ€™s not like that, there are a lot of hidden treasures ... A gem!
