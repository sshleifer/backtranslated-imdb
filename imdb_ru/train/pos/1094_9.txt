This is one of the few comedies that I can watch again and again and still laugh out loud. In other places I read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious, politically correct statements. There is neither one nor the other if you do not define sexism as a woman as a housewife, and racism as a family in which the colored maid works. <br /> <br /> The lines are fun, and all conclusions have never been better. Melvin Douglas is especially brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you ever wondered or tried to build a new home, you will be pleased to know that no matter how infuriating it is, no matter how lamb you are, you may feel like wolves, you are not alone !
