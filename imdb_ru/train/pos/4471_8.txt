Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Catherine Grayson and star Jose Iturbi in the film “Anchors Aweigh,” directed by George Sidney. <br /> <br /> Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two nautical guys who are on holiday in Hollywood. They meet a little boy (Dean Stockwell) and, taking him home, meet his aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls in love with her. She wants an audition for José Iturbi. They are trying to help, but there is confusion. <br /> <br /> This is a very energetic musical with great dancing and singing by Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse in a delightful sequence. Grayson sings "The Blinds" and "My Heart Sings." Not one of my favorite voices, but she's fine. Iturbi's piano work is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Sinatra shows its versatility and why girls fall on it with such big blue eyes and boyish face. For Kelly, it was a serious break for him at MGM. <br /> <br /> A wonderful film, very cheerful.
