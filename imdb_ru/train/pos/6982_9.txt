Good show. <br /> <br /> The main background is humanity at a crossroads. There are a number of moral dilemmas encountered. Humanity has made a number of technological breakthroughs, but is it enough for humanity to cope with its new toys? In the virtual world there is moral decay. There are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention. I predict (based on the BSG experience) that there will be problems with the Cylons and the slavery. In addition to this, there are other problems that we humans put before us. <br /> <br /> This is not a BSG show - at least as far as humanity is on the run from the ruthless problem that was ultimately their own making. Also, there are not so many special effects related to shooting or cosmic effects - at least in the first few episodes I've seen before. <br /> <br /> These are very good stories, characters and themes. It also has good performances from the actors. They can make a culture similar to modern society, but at the same time alien, absolutely believable. Like BSG, this is a show about humanity - our strengths and weaknesses, potential and disadvantages. It may seem a little strange that in human society in different worlds there are ties, antique cars and chicken. But these things are really more to create a semi-familiar background than anything else. Anyone stuck on these details really misses the point. Regardless of whether you are a mafia culture or a rich and high-tech culture, people and human nature do not differ 150,000 years ago in the high-tech past from what we see in the modern world. I wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something?
