After Chicago, I began to lose respect for Richard Gere, and then the Pack came. So far, only a pleasant smile and a couple of gestures on the face can get you, but he proved to me that he finally mastered his skill and can act with the best of them. Claire Danes was also super as his "trainee / replacement". Some have suggested that there was too much unnecessary violence, but I do not see it that way. Nothing I saw diminished the strength of this film. I was really shocked, I hadnâ€™t heard about this movie release, and instead stumbled upon it in a blockbuster. A truly exceptional film with the right mix of action, expectation, thrill and social awareness. As good as 7even? Well maybe. And you will see that it is better to play with the Gear than with anyone from Pitt.
