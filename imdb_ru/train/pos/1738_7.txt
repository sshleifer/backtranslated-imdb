This is a fun movie. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star who signs a sponsorship deal with Ned Beatty's Chicken Pit restaurants. The contract contains all sorts of humiliating conditions, such as forcing Bert to wear a suit with chicken during the race! Jim Sets - his (not quite convincing) chief mechanic. Loni Anderson (oh, yes!) Beatty appointed to keep Reynolds honesty and strictly adhere to the contract This is a funny movie in which Bert proves that he is not too proud. I like it!
