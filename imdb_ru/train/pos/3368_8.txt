Hitler's visit to Rome is the backdrop of this tender story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children, who remains at home until her entire family goes to a military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She has to stay at home because the family cannot afford a maid. She would love to go, although, like the entire residential complex in which she lives, she is an ardent admirer of Il Duce. <br /> <br /> Although there is one exception. Across the courtyard, Marcello Mastroianni sits in a chair, thinking of suicide. Cause? He is homosexual and because of this he recently lost his job as a radio host. The film is really shot when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is desperate and in dire need of a friend. Lauren, upset by her changeable husband, misunderstands Mastroianni and in a masterfully filmed, directed and acting scene on the roof of the building complex offers him his body only to be rejected. Soon after, the initial chock is replaced by her hunger for this man, this anti-fascist, this homosexual, this other world who is so ready to give her everything she longs for. <br /> <br /> This is a beautifully crafted film with two of the most talented actors ever. Lauren proves here that she is an actress of caliber when well directed. This is a simple but powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people and, most importantly, about the human condition. Despite the sad end, there is a glimmer of hope at the denouement, everything will change, someone understood.
