Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This crazy movie bustle revolves around the heavy metal culture and the 80s horror films - two things that I really love. So, as you can imagine, I liked this movie quite easily. Plus, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays the preacher. <br /> <br /> This film is about an unpopular schoolgirl who, like all of us, losers, turned out to be in the world of “evil” heavy metal. His favorite Metaldude is dying and, of course, miraculously resurrected - playing his last unreleased album backwards. This allows the corpse singer to kill people with demons and help them. <br /> <br /> Well, sometimes it's pretty stupid, but you know what? He has an amazing amount of good qualities. Decent game (including Gene Simmons as a DJ on the radio), pretty good special effects, very short nudity, decent atmosphere ... In general, this is actually a decent horror movie. But what really sucks is the music. Ironically, huh? Well, this "evil" metal guy is one of the most disgusting, piercing, screaming, which Motley Crue rejects on the planet - and "Metal" is a little more than the rotten 80s Pop / Hair Metal. He hits all the clichés here, from jumping around like a gay fairy, to indecent looks, to the shout of "Rock and roll !!!" in the field high enough to make King Diamond vomit. Besides this terrible musical performance, it is actually quite good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
