The creation of “The Thief of Baghdad” is a story in itself, almost as amazing as the story in this film. Alexander Korda almost went broke making this film. <br /> <br /> According to the series of films about the great British films “The Citadel”, the adoptive son of the United Kingdom, Alexander Korda, conceived this film in 1933 and spent years planning and preparation. But the Second World War, unfortunately, caught up with Korda and the rising costs of shooting a grand spectacle. <br /> <br /> Budget expenditures also happen in American films, only Cecil B. DeMille always had a free hand in Paramount after 1932, when he returned there. But DeMill and his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs when shooting a film. Throughout the journey, Korda transported the entire company to America and filmed these episodes with Rex Ingram as a gin in our Grand Canyon. He, of course, was not going to receive such landscapes in the UK. Korda also completed interiors in Hollywood, in time for the 1940 Christmas Eve. <br /> <br /> The spectacle of this subject won four Oscar nominations for the Thief of Baghdad Oscar and three Oscars for the best color cinema. Art and installation direction for color film and the best special effects. Only the original musical score of Miklos Rosza did not bring home a prize in the nomination. Korda must have been very happy about the decision to shoot in the Grand Canyon, because it’s impossible to get bad color photos from this place. <br /> <br /> However, special effects do not suppress the simple story of how good defeats evil. Good is two young lovers John Justin and June Dupres, and evil is Conrad Weidt as a sorcerer who tries to steal both the kingdom and the heart, both belonging to Duprez. This was Veidt’s career role as far as Casablanca, where he played the major Luftwaffe Stroeser. <br /> <br /> Of course, a good one will get some help from an unlikely source. A beggar boy and a thief Sabu, who quite possibly were among the few who could call themselves an international film star at the time. Literally risen out of poverty, working as an elephant stable for the Maharaja of Mysore, he was noticed by Alexander Korda, who needed local guidance for one of his jungle features. Sabu catches all the innocence and mischief of youth when he fulfills the fantasy of Arabian nights about a boy who overthrows a tyrant. Not bad message to send in 1940. <br /> <br /> The thief of Baghdad is doing well today. This is an eternal story of love, romance and adventure in any order.
