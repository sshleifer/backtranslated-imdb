I did not expect much from this, but I have to admit that I rolled on the ground several times, laughing during this film. If you are not offended in the first ten minutes, it may be a movie for you. The same, if you're one of those who like to watch Amanda Pete shuffle the cards for an hour and a half. This, of course, is not an important comedy work, but, given the low-budget indie genesis, this is mastery. To level the playing field for comparison, imagine that all studio films with their budget are cut about 100 times and see what you get! Kudos to Peter Cohen and his network for watching I look forward to his next effort.
