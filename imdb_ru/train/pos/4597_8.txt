Having achieved fame for the first time with Drunk Master, Jackie Chan was again in the spotlight thanks to Project A of 1983, an extremely enjoyable pirate film that restored him as a major star. By the time the Police Story was released two years later, the extraordinary hype around Jackie had reached its apogee, and crowds of people gathered to see this crazy mix of stunning stunts, fierce battle scenes and dubious comedy. He broke numerous box office records and inspired a 50 percent increase in police recruits, but if you look 20 years later, is that good? <br /> <br /> As a militant, the Police Story undoubtedly gets to its feet. There are some amazing fight scenes, some stuntmen who are reminiscent of the best hero of Chan Buster Keaton, and an irresistible, albeit overly violent, climate fight. Jackie's play is also very strong, and although frequent forays into difficult comedy only slightly dull the influence of the film, his charisma permeates it. In addition, introducing our hero as a border psychopath, whose recklessness puts others in danger, Jackie took a chance ... although in this case, it seems no one noticed! Praising the “Police Story” as a simple “good against evil”, fighting critics diminished the ambiguity of the film, and although the Brothers Karamazov hardly describe this ambiguity, the film nevertheless represents a noticeable and praiseworthy transition from traditional ideas. > <br /> In short, it remains a quality “popcorn” film * (although you can empty your stomach as many villains push or fall into glass cases in the final scene of the film) - a powerful, passionately interesting action movie that ranks among the best in its period.
