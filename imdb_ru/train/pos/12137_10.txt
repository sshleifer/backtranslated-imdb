How amazing this movie is! I have seen it again and again over the years, and I am always fascinated by it. The reason why the film is so easy to review is, of course, the exciting performance of young Betty Davis. She not only steals every scene she is in, but in fact she is much more beautiful and better photographed here (not to mention sexuality) than she was in any of the films she has shot so far in her home studio Warner Brothers (this film was made by RKO Radio Pictures). She wears very flattering makeup and very attractive hairstyles and, oh, those cute big eyes (especially in restaurant scenes that take place in London's Soho). Her body was so seductive when she was small. Get a load of it in cheap negligee, which she carries for her big explosive confrontation scene with Leslie Howard. And, god, she has absolute power in this scene. Howard is a little nervous, but he picks up the sensitivity of the hero. Francis Dee is considered to be a sweet, pretty young Sally, who truly loves him. Max Steiner's rating is both charming and poignant. Great views and tastes of the thirties make this version of the classic novel a must-read.
