This, along with Hare Tonic, is considered one of the best cartoon bugs, truly one of the best mistakes ever. There are some comments about how the “Bugs” in these cartoons are “basic”, and I think it is not fully developed. I actually prefer this “basic” version of the mid-40s (Chuck Jones was the best version), which is actually bigger than the rabbit and much more fun than the possible leggy version that towers over Yosemite Sam and Duffy Duck. The bugs of the last days were too sophisticated and sophisticated for me. Also check out Hare Lifting Hair (1946) and Rabbit Smash (1948) for great examples of classic beetles and classic Chuck Jones.
