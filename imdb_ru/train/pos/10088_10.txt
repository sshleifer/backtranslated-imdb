Walking on an Elephant (1954) Starring the early Peter Finch as the owner of an estate on some abandoned plantation, where there is always the danger of elephants or crazy Englishmen who can stay in the noonday sun and go crazy. Well, in the end, they do, after an outbreak of typhoid or cholera, of course, and a lot of chaos will follow. Taylor replaced the sick Vivien Leigh in this cauldron / adventure movie. When the elephants storm the house and catch Liz on the front staircase, I still get goosebumps. Thank God, Dana Andrews is near to save the day. One of my favorite pleasures. In color too!
