“Heartland” is a beautiful image of what it was like to live on the border. The hard work and individual strength that was necessary to overcome the climatic difficulties and the lack of medical care are combined with camaraderie and the interdependence of the settlers. The drama was especially significant because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants still live there. It was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people. No one was fascinated and did not look as if they had just had a session with the makeup or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is simply wonderful. She is an example of strong, persistent people who came to Wyoming in the early 20th century and did not allow any difficulties to stand in their way of a new life on a new earth.
