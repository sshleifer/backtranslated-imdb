I love this show. Period. I haven’t been watching for a very long time, probably only about six months or so, but now this is my favorite show and will probably be quite long. I love all the characters, except that I don’t care about Donna. I'm not quite sure why. I just ... I do not find her funny, and I do not think that Laura Pripon is a very good actress. Besides her, I find the rest of the actors pretty good. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played Eric's parents, were very funny. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike many fans, I didn't quite hate season 8. I still watch it, and it makes me laugh. But, if you compare it with a show of earlier seasons, it is ... not good. Randy is terrible. The finale was decent, nothing surprising, but good. =] I think it would be better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topfer decided to leave, but oh well. I have a fourth season on DVD, and someday I hope to release all eight seasons on DVD. Some of his funniest episodes, in my opinion, were “Dine & Dash”, “Grandmas Dead”, “Red & Stacey” and “Streaking”, but I like every episode that I have seen so far, which I think , most of them, =] 9/10 stars, I definitely recommend it. =
