The good thing about this movie: the concept is interesting, and there are some funny scenes. It also makes you think about those little things in life that can greatly affect someone else’s life, even if you don’t know about it. This is a small world, and this small film shows us. <br /> <br /> A bad thing: there are too many characters, and it’s hard to say who the main character is, but it's still a great movie. <br /> This is a great movie, and many compare it to Magnolia, which I have not seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> No assessment --- I would rate this PG -13 for short-term violence, some language and sexual situations.
