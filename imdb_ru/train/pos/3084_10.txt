Oh dude why? “Six degrees” is a show about this so-called theory that we are all connected by someone. If you focus on the life of a group of people and the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about this show, it didn’t get my attention at all. In fact, it seemed too trivial. Then I saw some episodes ... and I liked it! First of all, the characters. They are all well written and different from each other. There is an alcoholic, a woman whose bride deceives her, a woman who just lost her husband, a driver who has a problem brother and so on ... Unlike what we are used to, most of the characters interact with each other in the victims as in our daily affairs. Big! My favorites are May, Carlos and Whitney. <br /> <br /> Then the actors. They are all great. Jay Hernandez from "Hostel" shows his acting abilities here in a more three-dimensional character than his previous work as Paxton. Others also give great performances, especially Campbell Scott, who plays Stephen and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney. <br /> <br /> Well, when I came to IMDb, after watching some episodes, I could not believe that I got canceled. Seriously, I can not understand the low ratings. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that there was no more than one season. That would be a really good show to follow!
