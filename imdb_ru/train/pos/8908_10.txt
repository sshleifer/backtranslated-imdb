First of all, I have not seen Blob since I was 7 or 8, and watching it as an adult was an incredible experience. Pages can be written about its impact on horror movies even today. And even more could be written on his social implications from the 50s "fear of adolescents." But this simple little story about interplanetary horror still remains a damn scary movie, if you allow it to be. <br /> <br /> Of course, he looks stupid, like everything that happens in our modern world. But "The Blob" is packing in some really scary moments when a group of children are tracking an irrepressible creature when adults donâ€™t believe them. In fact, there are even some rather gloomy moments in the world of candy color. And Steve McQueen gives a lot more than a well-deserved story on paper that we, the audience, actually come across for a moment and believe in it. <br /> <br /> To sum up, can you remove the postmodern filter of irony here is much more love than it seems at first glance.
