More like a psychological analysis of films, but Psycho sounds better as a headline. The person in charge of the film (the narrator, if you will) really portrays the films here in his own way. Most of them are classics, but all of them are listed here on IMDb, and I highly recommend you to watch them (especially Hitchcock, Solaris, Conversation and Lynch films), because Slava Zizek will refer to them! <br /> <br /> Or in other words, he can spoil them for you. I don’t remember if he messed up more than the ones I listed (I think Chaplin’s films as well), but, as I’ve already written, it would be better if you watched them all in advance! There is no movie in the IMDb list that I told them about, so that it may appear soon. This is a film about Meg Ryan, but this is just a small excerpt, which in any case is not special. <br /> <br /> The views and opinions of Zizka are insane and interesting to hear if you are open to see things through another perspective (even if it ruins your favorite movie for you a little ... it doesn't mean that it will , but could)!
