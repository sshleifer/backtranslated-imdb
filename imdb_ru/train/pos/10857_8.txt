Johnny To does here one of his best style exercises, creating a strong movie with a good yakuza story. The election of a new yakuza boss is the beginning of a war within the organization. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is advisable to use violence in context, creating a very strong film about gangs. I especially like the way he tells the story, moving around all the roles in the yakuza family and making us see violence as the only way they have to solve their problems ... <br /> <br /> Oh, technical aspects, the film is a good example of a suspended, rhythmic and orderly way of shooting a film. One of the Hong Kong films of the year. This is similar to Hellish affairs, but without easy scenes of action-violence and a confusing storyline. Strongly recommended to all fans of Asian films. <br /> <br /> (sorry for my english, better in spanish lol)
