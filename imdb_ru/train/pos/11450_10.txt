This movie is amazingly beautiful. Goldsworthy art really wins thanks to cinema, because you can see art at its most beautiful, exciting, changeable and flourishing. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. I can't think of anything else to say about it. This is exactly the film that you MUST watch because it is so visually convincing and left me very fresh when I left the theater.
