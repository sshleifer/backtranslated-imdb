I thought it was a totally enchanting movie. This story seems to be a slightly veiled autobiography of John Waters: Pecker’s greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong plays a leading role well, but the best performances are his grandmother, Mink Stole (a cheerful cameo) and of all people, Patty Hearst. I think the reviewers are far from the base on this. It seems that they perceive Pecker’s worst score as his gospel, when I think the film makes it quite clear that he is a really promising artist.
