This is a great movie to watch with your girlfriend. My friend and I love to dance and came across this movie in the video store. We had to get it. Without violence and such a warm story, this is a great movie to relax and just enjoy your night. I would recommend this movie to any family or just a group of girls who are looking for a cute movie.
