My choice for the best movie ever was Lawton's “The Night of the Hunter”, which remains magnificent in my canon. But, perhaps, he was ousted by "Soul," which is the most artistic Taoist film I have ever seen. The way of caring for others is represented by the flow of water, and the way water can be a source of inspiration, comfort, purification, etc., is the essence of Tao. It can be argued that the themes “NOFT” and “Souls” are similar, and that Lilian Gish in the first represents the purest form of Christianity, and the bath operators represent the purest form of Taoism. I would by no means object to such an interpretation. Both films are visual joys in their integration of ideas and images. However, the Douche represents such a blank look at the holiness of everyday life, that I nod. I read both.
