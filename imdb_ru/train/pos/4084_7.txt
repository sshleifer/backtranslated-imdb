I assume that this is a kind of refinement or update of "Beauty and the Beast", but I can not say that I have ever watched a movie that began with a few minutes of graphic equestrian sex. Wow. Anyway, it seems that the young woman and her .. aunt? We visited this castle in France, where a woman should marry the son of the castle owner, who takes care of the horses removing the stones. It seems that in this area of ​​the beast there are legends that were quite frisky, I think, one might say, with the ladies, or at least one of them. In this regard, all kinds of references are hidden, but each time when the future blushing young bride puts her curious little hands on one, which the groom's father removes from sight. In any case, the young future bride goes to bed upstairs while the family is waiting for the cardinal to show up for the wedding (family member, I think), and as she dreams, she dreams of a beast in the forest who has her way with her. The effects in this case leave much to be desired, and any attempt at eroticism (not what I know about it) looks ridiculous, especially when some of the appendages shown seem as realistic as a post by the bed or a baseball bat. He has a rather strange and sharp, but still turning end, in fact, there are no clues or special bells and whistles to him, but it was a kind of fit and definitely not what I expected. I don't know, it's rather difficult to survive, but he has his own moments, and this is definitely strange. 7 out of 10.
