This is a show about three little girls. (DJ, Stephanie and Michelle) Their mother was killed by a drunk driver, so their father Danny invites his son-in-law (Jessie) and his old friend (Joey). So all the show is about living life. Girls experience life problems and learn life lessons. They develop relationships, guys and more. The whole show is basically going to go with the flow. You should not hold insults, you just have to let go. I think this show is really good and fun to watch. I grew up on this show and still watch it today. I'm glad they still show this show on television. I watch it almost every day. I rate it as 10/10.
