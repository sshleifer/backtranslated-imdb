This film really surprised me. I did not have very high expectations, but I was wrong. Mary and Rhoda were very funny and well written. They didn’t spend too much time rethinking the past, so they didn’t rely on the success of the old TV show to show the film. Overall, it was very interesting. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend said that this could be a weekly sit-com, and I think I can agree with her.
