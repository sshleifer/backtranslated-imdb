If someone asks if a movie is an art form, you can do worse than send it to this movie. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this is the perfect combination of history, script, actors and cinematography ever committed to celluloid. <br /> <br /> The story of a doomed bomber pilot missed by his heavenly guide in an English fog during World War II, and his subsequent clashes with the heavenly authorities (or he in his head) plays out with David Niven and Kim Hunter and incredibly touching - especially in the first scenes, when the doomed pilot (Niven) describes his position to a ground radio operator (Hunter). <br /> <br /> Feelings of the Otherworld Enhanced by Jack Cardiff photos and incredible production solutions. <br /> <br /> The brightest strokes cover images of heaven appearing on black and white and earth scenes presented in Technicolor - even the celestial conductor (fantastic Marius Goring) mentions this. <br /> <br /> Not only the highest point in British cinema, but also the highest point in the movie, point.
