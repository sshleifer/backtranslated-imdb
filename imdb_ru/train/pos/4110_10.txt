This and “Hidden Fortress” are the most dear to me Kurosaws. I don’t hand out dozens like sweets, but it certainly deserves it, anyway. Despite the fact that he is quite long (like all Kurosawa), he agreed with the problem that makes me worry about most of his films; the storyline is often too loose and slowly evolving, contains scenes that are not needed or just too long without any real purpose of the storyline or character description. Dodesukuden gave me the same experience as, for example, “The Hidden Fortress”; despite its duration, I did not single out a single minute. <br /> <br /> This is also a very unusual film of Kurosawa, it does not have a plot, but there are many small independent stories that are based more on the character description, rather than the plotline, unlike any other Kurosawa film that I saw still. It also relies on a dialogue that he uses brilliantly (especially in the story between father and son, planning his “new home”). <br /> <br /> However, the thing that makes this masterpiece is how the object, as tragic as it is, can be described so humanely and sympathetically, without pointing the finger at anyone. From the very beginning to the end, he conveys the whole emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance.
