Why are more movies (especially American ones) no longer look like the Meatball Machine? <br /> <br /> This is my first official online review, and I’m accused of “electric ecstasy” after I chose Meatball Machine as my first effort. This is a review, so I will try to stick to simple thoughts and intuitions. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is one of the creative works, although it is clearly inspired by the classic TETSUO! So, if this is not all original? I own both of these films, and although Tetsuo is one strange son of a bitch, the Meatball Machine is far superior to her and can be experienced without a strong desire to take a dose of mind-altering drugs to clarify the meaning of the film. The meatball machine is as complex in its history as it is in its large supply of blood and blood. Thank you, Jesus, for the Japanese movie! <br /> <br /> Simply put, the last time my dreams were filled with a vision of horror after watching a Nightmare on Elm Street, when I was 7 years old or so. I could imagine in a dream a language coming out of the phone for several weeks. This time (at the age of 31) my dreams were pleasantly inspiring. <br /> <br /> In this film, human bodies take on aliens, whose only goal is to try to fulfill their endless pursuit of human flesh and blood. People become flesh, eating cyborg !!! There is something else!!! Fight the scene! Great music!! Excellent pictures from the point of view of the review! Cyborg woman's decent behavior (at least, better than her male colleague). In the end, it is worth seeing a fight that is worth seeing ten or twenty times. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I forgot to mention that this is a love story! Wow, I hate love stories, but it's too tough! <br /> <br /> I can’t wait for my friends to watch this movie again to see the reaction on their faces. Unfortunately, I took the time to write this review, because I am afraid that most friends and families will not understand the Meatball Machine. The truth is that America as a whole is not ready for the Meatball Machine. <br /> <br /> Finally, my wife entered while I watched the dramatic battle scene at the end, and she was speechless. Usually she says something like “why are you looking at this junk?” This time she had nothing to say. I was happy! <br /> <br /> This is not rubbish. This is not just SPLATTER (spray for the spray too great). This is the art of my friends. Art. <br /> <br /> CHACHO
