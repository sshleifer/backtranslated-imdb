There were no funny parts in this film, mostly just funny units, but there were no really bad parts in it either. Worst of all was Sid's voice. His grubby stain was too much for me. After about 5 minutes I was tired of hearing him speak. Besides the annoying slothful voice, the film was good. There were numerous side jokes that, if you caught them, make the film much better. This is a good movie for children. It is enough to keep content for adults, and enough to entertain children. This one is definitely worth renting if you have children and want to watch a movie with them.
