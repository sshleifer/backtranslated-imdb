This film was really a great movie about what affects us all. I know that I have personally encountered this many times. Thank God, Will Smith jumped on the social problem of text messaging while driving. People, don't do this. An hour of forty-five minutes is not enough for this cause. Personally, I wanted to throw away my mobile phone after the movie. I was glad to see that other people in the theater saw the message and threw their phones with empty popcorn packets. I decided to turn off all the text messages on my phone, and encourage others to do the same. If you care about your family, ask them to watch this vital public service statement about text messaging while driving, otherwise they could kill seven people. Thank you for showing us the way.
