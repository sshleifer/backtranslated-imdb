Great movie with great performances by Zack & Lochley. To their displeasure (and mine), Garibaldi arrived at the station. (With all due respect to Jerry Doyle, but in seasons 4 and 5 I lost sympathy for the character.) He does not need much time to start criticizing Zack (whom I love most in the series) and take responsibility. I'm sure Zack could handle. The plot of "The Soul Hunter" is fascinating, especially if you believe in the sky, like Zach. Humor perfectly complements it. 10/10
