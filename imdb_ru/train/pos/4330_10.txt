<br /> <br /> “Cold House” is the best adaptation of the novel by Charles Dickens who has ever appeared on the screen. Always one of my favorite novels, I was extremely pleased with this mini TV series. The late, great Denholm Elliott played well in the role of the noble John Jardys, and Diane Rigg was absolutely perfect, as doomed Lady Dedlock. The film captures the essence of the Dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book, making minor plot cuts that do not affect the story. over all brilliant, touching and atmospheric film.
