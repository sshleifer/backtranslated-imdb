On a winter day, December 28, 1986, two bored 14-year-olds shoot a film. “Hmmm, the police story looks interesting,” “who is this Jackie Chan?”, “Never heard of him.” Two hours after watching the movie in a daze, we wanted to learn more. 16 years later (and due to the fact that I did not collect films from JC!) This film still captures me like no other. Well, maybe I have a weakness for this, since it was my “first” movie (“Cannonball doesn’t count!”), But this is a great movie. It has all the classic elements of JC, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and ACTION! Some comments say that it is dated, it was made in 1985, of course, it is dated! But the same should make the Jaws, Casablanca, Singing in the rain and the Godfather !!!!!! Without films like Police Story, where will the Hollywood action be today? PS set standards; many scenes were stolen for use in other films. To truly appreciate this, you must see it on a widescreen screen, otherwise you will miss most of the film (yes, it really falls off the bus around the corner!). If you have not done so yet, SEE THIS FILM NOW !!!! <br /> <br />
