This movie is good for television. I like it because I am a HUGE fan of disaster films, although itâ€™s a family movie. The accuracy in the movie from the book is half-half. They correctly understood the names of the characters, but there were no storm pursuers in the book; the car scene in which the Hatch family ran away from a tornado was not in the book; instead, she Dan Hatch and his friend drove along with a policeman on their way to the police station to provide security. and in the book to Dan and his friend for 12 years. That's all I can think of. Overall, it was a good film, although it could have been a little more accurate for the book. Did you know that the book is based on a true story about a series of tornadoes that devastated a small town in Nebraska in 1980?
