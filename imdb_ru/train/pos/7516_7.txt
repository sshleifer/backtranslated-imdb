The first two thirds of this biopic about the Betty Page fetish model is very interesting. Betty, whom Gretchen Mole portrays with great sincerity, looks like a nice girl next door who saw nothing wrong with what she did (and, of course, there was nothing “bad” about it). Directed by Mary Harron, who also shot I Shot Andy Warhol and American Psycho, recreates Betty's America by mixing old black and white footage with new, degraded black and white footage. As Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, color appears. Betty's fame was mainly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Clow (Lily Taylor, in excellent performance, and Chris Bower), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Betty's captivity photo shoots are charming and cleverly performed. The first suppliers of fetish material are portrayed not too condescendingly, and we have the feeling that these people were part of a close “community.” Betty has never had any particular problems with her notoriety, although we have the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the world of direct action. Since the third act of the film is virtually absent, we have the impression that we watched a full-length documentary on Betty Page, rather than a structured drama. In addition to the flaws, this film is worth it to catch, and it represents another beautiful feather in the cap of the producer Christina Vachon.
