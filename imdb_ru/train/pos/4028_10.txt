I came to Pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers who posted here. I am relatively new to Bollywood and was born and raised in the USA. Therefore, I do not have a broad base for comparing Pinjar with other Indian films. Fortunately, no comparison is required. <br /> <br /> Pinjar stands by itself as nothing more than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> In one line, I can say that Pinjar is one of the most important films to come out of any studio, anywhere, anytime. On the scale of mass appeal, this would be the Indian equivalent of the “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” if it were properly promoted in the United States. It could well be the film that put Bollywood on the American map. The American cinema public has an old love affair with Gone With the Wind, and although Pinjar does not borrow from this plot, there are some fleeting similarities. Not the last of which is a colossal (by American standards) 183-minute run time. <br /> <br /> Against the backdrop of a tough partition between India and Pakistan in 1947-48. - the irresistible human drama of a young man. a woman imprisoned by circumstances and embroiled in troubles that she had nothing to do with the creation. Being at a disadvantage, she somehow manages not only to survive, but also to grow - and even flourish. <br /> <br /> If the story is missing in some way, it is in the exposure. The growth of Puro (the main character) as a person would be better illustrated - at least for a Western audience unfamiliar with Indian culture - if the “background” of her character was more fully developed in the early part of the film. But it would extend the 3-hour film to 3.5 hours, or perhaps even more. Because not a single minute of the film was wasted, and none of the things that made it edited could really be shortened for the sake of time. It is better that the audience should fill in part of what was before, than omit all that is left. <br /> <br /> I could use many words to describe Pinjar: “sharp,” “disturbing,” “irresistible”, “heartbreaking” come to mind immediately. But “uplifting” is perhaps just as appropriate as any of them. Any story that indicates the indomitability of the human spirit against the worst odds should be considered as such. And Puro's triumph — although perhaps not immediately obvious to those around him — is no less inspiring. Because of the power of the story, I cannot recommend this film highly enough. <br /> <br /> Urmila Matondkar’s presentation of Puro is no less inspiring. Too often overlooked among a multitude of younger, newer actresses, Urmila has the unique ability to transmit an absolutely trustworthy character in any role she plays. She doesn't just play the role of Puro, she breathes life into the character. The choice of Manoj Bypaya as Rashid was inspired. He controls something that too few Indian film characters can: subtlety. His command of expression and nuance is important for this role. With his piercing gaze, he brings more threat to the early part of the film than all the fighters who wield the sword combined. <br /> <br /> If you only see one Bollywood movie in your life, make it Pinjar.
