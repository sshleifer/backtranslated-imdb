A model from New York City Alison Parker (Christina Raines) rents a room in an old brown stone, where she meets several strange neighbors and experiences some terrible hallucinations. As fellow lawyer Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) continues to make inquiries on her behalf, she struggles to maintain her sanity (not to mention her will to live), since her experience affects her physical, mental and emotional health. /> <br /> I do not want to spoil the best moments in this psychological horror film for those who are not familiar with it. The story is interesting and fascinating, but the film actually gives little in terms of real fears. Or, for that matter, any atmosphere. It's a bit quiet, but not like a traditional horror movie. It’s rather a story about a troubled woman trying to cope with the growing unreality in her life. At this level it works, but not powerfully enough. <br /> <br /> “The Guardian” * offers * some attractive scenery (in particular, a fascinating, incredibly eerie climax, and there is a scene with Beverly d'Angelet who needs to be seen to be believed). You can also see some blood, but not much. Gil Mella's ominous musical score adds to the threat. <br /> <br /> No review of this film would have been complete without the assessment of filmmakers who have brought together such great actors for the filming of the ensemble. Some of them do not do too much, but seeing them all is impressive. Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith make the greatest impression, as, respectively, the stubborn detective and caring neighbor. Other legendary names include José Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy and Ava Gardner. Future stars such as D'Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berenguer, Jeff Goldblum appear for a short time, and other familiar faces include Jerry Orbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickey and Martin Balsam. Whoever directed this film deserves some sort of prize. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Michael Winner is probably best known for the “Death Wish” series, which he co-starred with Charles Bronson from Jeffrey Convitz’s novel. <br /> <br /> I would not consider this a truly great horror thriller, but it has its own moments and it is quite interesting. <br /> <br /> 7/10
