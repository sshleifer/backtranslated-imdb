This is the first Michael Vartan film I saw - I didn’t see Alias ​​- and I was curious to see if the guy could act. He is sure that he can be cute in this film. Natasha Henstridge, of course, is gorgeous, but she is usually in more physical and active roles, so I found her very nice and cute in this other “sweet” role of the school teacher. Some of the negative comments I read are true, the film is full of cliches, and the story doesn't sound believable at all. Also, although each character in the movie notes how good they look together, I don't think there is screen chemistry there. However, I liked this movie. The places are nice, the characters are nice and cute, and the supporting actors are pretty good. If you expect to see a great romance, it is not. But if you want to watch a nice innocent cute film with cute characters, this is very good.
