I remember that I liked it more than Nausika from the valley of the winds at the age when this tone of the story was too serious for me. Laputa, whose name seems to have influenced its release in the United States to avoid confusion with a wide Latin American audience, has the cartoon skill of directorial debut production Conan. In fact, Pazu had thick bones and the immortal life force of Conan, who jumped off a thousand stories, carried his girl in his arms, landed on his feet and began to run. This makes him the most lively and enjoyable character to watch. Techies Nausica fans may be disappointed with the flying beetles and retro technologies from Laputa - the only exception may be a robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and the Valley of the Winds, the theme in Laputa is not directly related to environmental protection. If it has a theme at all, it is an anti-war war. The importance of natural life - it is associated with a flying castle, is disparagingly briefly discussed and is not actually being fulfilled. In general, now I believe that the work is at the intersection of well-being and banal.
