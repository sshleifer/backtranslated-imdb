This film really captures the sense of freedom ... and what the freedom of your own honesty costs ... in the most delightful, carefree way. Not a serious, but fun adventure. <br /> <br /> History reflects life. We do not always get what we want right away, but we find that we get what we need in order to understand why we did not get what we wanted ... which leads to what we get more than we thought what we get! You will get it when you see the movie. <br /> <br /> And this film is really about how to find love and find out that someone found her and that she completely changed his life. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite albums of all time .... ... not easy to find, but worth hunting ......... I guarantee you will watch it more than once!
