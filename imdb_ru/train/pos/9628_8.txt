Some of my favorite films are Laurel and Hardy with a very, very little plot. Instead, they give them a rather trivial situation and just allow them to be fun! Films like HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES are some of the most fun, as you can see how boys work or clean the house. Here, in Dirty Work, most of the film is similar to these two other films — Stan and Ollie — the chimney sweeps and spend most of the film, trying (unsuccessfully) to clean the mad professor's fireplace. Seeing how Olli falls through the pipe, the boys turn the house into a mess, and the insane deeds of Stanley work together to make a very nice movie. <br /> <br /> However, in a strange turn there is a really strange story that begins and ends with a film. The professor seems to be a really crazy scientist, and he is working on a formula that makes things younger. At the end of the film you see how he turns a duck into a duckling and even a duckling into an egg! Given that he then leaves the boys in the room alone, is it any wonder what will happen next? Although this site was not needed, it worked quite well. What worked exceptionally well is the middle part. Give the boys nothing interesting, and you will be amazed at the fun results. One of the best films of the team, and he almost earns 9.
