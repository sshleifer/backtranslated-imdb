When I grew up in England in the 1930s, the radio did not work around the clock, but 7 days a week, so the Children's hour became a real holiday for me when we had spare batteries and a battery for power. Therefore, several programs that I heard made a great impression on my young mind, and 3 that I remember are still “Toytown”, one of all the animals in the zoo, and the Gray Owl telling about animals he knew which he called his "brothers." Only recently, I learned that the Gray Owl was not a real “Indian”, but the tribute to the Sioux chief makes a lot of sense to me: “A person becomes what he dreams of.” If we could all dream of how the world is changing and benefiting, like Archie Gray Owl Belani. Can the new Gray Owl influence world leaders to clean up the environment?
