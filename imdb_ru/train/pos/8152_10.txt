I just read the last comments about this movie and I would like to reply. You are probably not familiar with the original history of the rap group N.W.A. which originated in 1988, in 1989 the ice cube left the group to become solo, and eventually in 1991 the group broke up when Dr.dre left. which led to a lot of beef, starting with the departure of the ice cube, etc., in 1991. This story was to some extent based on that. <br /> <br /> Even more, this film was 90 minutes of fun, as they explained that the juice song, as a political statement, was ridiculous. not to mention the "love song" tasty pick up. and when the vanilla sherberta kicked his ass, just like the head of the record company is also cheerful, and their managers are also shot every time. <br /> <br /> people who didn’t enjoy this movie probably didn’t understand or were complete idiots, my opinion
