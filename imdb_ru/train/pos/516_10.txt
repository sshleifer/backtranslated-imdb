One of the few best films of all time. Directorial excellence shifted from black and white to color for the Sequences of Heaven and Earth. <br /> <br /> The plot is very clever, a full film leaves you stunned by all human emotions, and although it is not a film about war. I must have seen this movie more than any other, and I never get tired of it. This is a film that makes you doubt your own mortality and the belief in what happens after our demise.
