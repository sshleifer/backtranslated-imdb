When John Wayne was filming his story about the Alamo, he built the complete Alamo set in Bracetsville, Texas, which is still there, and quite a tourist attraction. As long as this is the case, we will have a set for future interpretations of Alamo for the screen. One of them with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton was made in this century. <br /> <br /> But I would say that “Alamo: thirteen days before glory” is the best Alamo story I have ever shot. The John Wayne film is good if it is too popular, but it is a John Wayne film, whose story is altered to fill the parameters of the screen character John Wayne. Brian Keith plays Davey Crockett here and gives an excellent interpretation of the terrific border character he was. <br /> <br /> This is much closer to the book by Professor Lon Tinkle about the Alamo than the Wayne film, and has read books for years. back i can witness it. Tinkle’s book is listed as a source in both films, but Tinkle, who was alive when Wayne’s film was made, wasn’t satisfied with the result. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin was about the right age for the young William Barrett Travis, an idealistic freedom fighter who, by the way, was a slave owner. Previously, no one saw this ironic contradiction. One thing that was not investigated and was not was Travis's hyperactive sexual attraction. He was Casanova from the southwest, he even kept an obscene diary of his libidinal gains. <br /> <br /> But the man who always gets whitewash is Jim Bowie, played by James Arness. Of course, he was a hero in the Alamo, but his career before the Alamo was a scoundrel affair. He was a smuggler, a slaver, a crook who sold land on which he had a dubious title. But his heroic death certainly redeemed him. Not a hint of this, either in the image of Arness, or in those whom I saw at Bowie on the screen. And, of course, he designed the design of the Bowie knife in accordance with its specifications. This man needed such a weapon. <br /> <br /> However, the main merit of the Alamo: Thirteen Days for Glory is the full-length image of Antonio de Lopez de Santa Anna, the President of Mexico, who personally approaches to suppress the rebellion caused by North Americans who came to Texas at the invitation of the Mexicans. Unfortunately, these Americans came with some preconceived ideas about freedom, which simply did not make it to the south, at least for white people. Raul Julia plays Santa Anna, which remains an even more controversial figure in Mexican history. He was also quite a rascal, but he was the best in Mexico until a real reformer named Benito Juarez appeared. <br /> <br /> This film was a farewell performance of Lorne Green, who briefly appears in the role of General Sam Houston. Green is not exactly my idea of ​​Houston, he is really too old for this role, Houston was about forty years old in 1836, he was not yet the patriarch of Texas. But within the limits imposed on him, Green does an excellent job with his work. <br /> <br /> The romantic narrative of the history of the Alamo is sure to be in the John Wayne version, but for historical content I highly recommend this film.
