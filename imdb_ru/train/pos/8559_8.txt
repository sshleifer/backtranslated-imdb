There is a certain genius in this movie. I was laughing all over. The scene in the telephone sex office, discussing how love heals the twin, was a good attempt at this genius / humor. The performance leaves much to be desired, but you can see the message of the author, and they have talent. The split of the double at the end was like “well, I did not expect it, but let's see what the film says.” Of course, a funny, but pleasant idea and in fact a very strange story. <br /> <br /> The meaning of the film is to be logical or entertain or communicate on an emotional level? I can easily miss many movies, but this one fascinated me in everything. <br /> <br /> I think the story may have some autobiographical roots, but this is only a guess. Terribly bad, but good. I am looking for other films that this person could do (with a lot of experience).
