This is one of those films - like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - which again and again draws the attention of the viewer. Light films rarely win an Oscar, but those who starred in Soap Film deserve it. Even after someone watched the movie and found out what was going on, it’s still nice to see how different facets of the plot develop. True, the whole drama is a melodrama; but it is completely suitable for a movie with a background of a soap opera. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: “Why can't I write like that?” I think, unfortunately, that censorship of television and websites insists on all this unnecessary sanitation.
