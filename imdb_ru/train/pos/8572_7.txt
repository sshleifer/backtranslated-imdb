The first film was good, but it is not as good as a wonderful animated classic, which seemed to me more sharp and sweet. This sequel is inferior, but not bad at all. Of course, the farce is too big, the script has its weak points, and the plot is a bit boring. But the dogs here are very cute, and Eric Idle is as cheerful as ara. The film is nice to watch with stylish cinematic and stunning costumes (especially with Cruella), and the music is pleasant. The acting is mostly very good, Ioan Griffith is attractive, and Gerard Depardieu, while he plays better, has fun as an accomplice of Cruella. But the best advantage, as it was with the first film, is the amazing Glenn Close in the amazingly superb performance in the role of Cruella, even more angry than she was before. Overall, nice. 7/10 Bethany Cox
