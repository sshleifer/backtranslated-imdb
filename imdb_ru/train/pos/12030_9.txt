Hi, I'm Scott (A.K.A woody7739) I like the Twisted Desire movie, and I love watching Melissa Joan Hart on TV, since I think she's fine. I'm a real fan of Sabrina teenage witches, so this helped me to watch him (do not ask). I love how Nicole is very capriciously plotting to kill her parents, as she ensures that someone else pulls the trigger and practices on the bottles, so she won't give up her fingerprints (a very well-planned idea). everyone turned to nicole when she was caught when her old boyfriend came in and put a hidden camera under her shirt. I give this film nine out of ten and put it on MY list of the top 10 films. Last but not least, if someone sees this film in stores, please tell me how I saw it on TV and did not record it. goodbye
