Why was this not released? I kind of thought that it should be a bit of trash, as it was not. How wrong could a girl be! In short, this film is fascinating. <br /> <br /> You will be fascinated. It keeps your attention right from the start, and its pace never slows down. <br /> <br /> The final part of the film, the “episode” as if (without giving anything away, you saw it in the trailer), also cannot be missed. You will choose your beloved, you will be shocked, you will not be able to go and make a cup of coffee, because you need to find out what is going on. Adrenaline rises, and you can not help but watch. Glory to the actors, this is very believable. And it does not stop there; they have the last shock for you. <br /> <br /> This also forces you to ask questions of reality shows, and if you want to watch. And how far away are we from that, right? Last year, Endemol (who makes an older brother) made a television show in Holland, offering the kidney of a dying woman to patients in need of a transplant. At the end of the show, it was shown that it was a hoax, ostensibly to raise awareness of organ donation, but are we getting too close to comfort?
