Actually, I really liked this movie. Not because of the plot, acting, jokes, no. I liked it because it is one of the worst films ever made. It is so lame, so bad that it becomes terribly ridiculous. Some jokes are really cool, but others make me pray for unemployment for a screenwriter. "People in white" are so stupid and stupid that you can only do two things. Turn off the TV or roll on the floor laughing (beer helps a lot :). I chose the second option.
