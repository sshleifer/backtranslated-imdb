Joan Fontaine - “The Girl in Distress” in this 1937 musical with Fred Astaire, George Byrnes and Gracie Allen. The story tells about a British woman (Fontein), who is in love with an American, who is mistaken for Ester, the star of a musical comedy. <br /> <br /> The film, shot by George Stevens, contains wonderful Gershwin music, including “Good work if you can get it” and “Foggy Day.” The best scene is the number “Hard upper lip”, which occurs in a merry house. <br /> <br /> Astera’s singing voice sounds more convincing in this film than in others, and he has a couple of excellent dance numbers. Burns plays his chief publicist, and Allen plays Burns' secretary. She is fun. The problem, as others have noted, is that Fontaine must dance with Aster at the end of the film. Stevens could easily use the double, because he shows the dance in a long frame, and it happens among the trees. I would have thought it was a double, except that the dances were so lousy. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing, despite all the flaws.
