Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> “Coonskin” is the film of the one and only Ralph Bakshi, who is said to be a satirical indictment about films of blasploatation and negative black stereotypes, as well as a look at black life in modern America ( modern for the day, I mean 1975). Paramount threw it like a hot potato that just caught fire. <br /> <br /> But this is a film of Bakshi, contradictory, exciting and obligatory for review almost by definition. Not just another random "shock-jock" from the film, which is trying to shock for the sake of shock. This is Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows this name knows that if he made a film, he has something to say ... <br /> <br /> Although its roots are based on cheap exploitation, “Coonskin” is not just another cunning blow . from basic white film or any kind of cast. "Coonskin" wants to be more. He sets a goal and fries a much larger fish. <br /> <br /> The film doesn't just make fun of the genre. And while he does not just blame the blacks, but in fact, it seems, shows love, beauty and heart in the most strange places. <br /> <br /> Coonskin tells the story of some convicts awaiting a break in prison. The fact that in the Coonskin world alone one can even get out of prison makes it old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> One of the prisoners tells the story of a trio of black brothers in Harlem named Brother. Bear, Brother Rabbit, Fox Preacher, who want respect and part of the case and want to get it by any means necessary. The Italian mafia controls all real actions. <br /> <br /> Famous black music stars: Barry White and Scatman Crother, as well as Charles Gordon, the first black playwright who took Pulitzer home. Obviously, something big is happening here. <br /> <br /> The film unfolds as a dive into this world, this side of the racial abyss. From an evil, femoral, deep, heartfelt black man with hatred in his heart and a gun in his hand. <br /> <br /> Bakshi films never know the meaning of the word “compliance”. It seems that the word never heard. But perhaps such a subject needs extremism. A real satyr sledgehammer. Some items cannot be handled gently. <br /> <br /> Bakshi is damn merciless. Here, no member or minority on stage in Harlem looks unharmed. <br /> <br /> The characters here are “quickened” to “real”, it all depends on your mood and situation. Animated and human characters have the same reality and should be taken literally. <br /> <br /> Bakshi doesn't just show ugly caricatures just for shock. He always has something to say. Black face is also not free. Here, unlike Spike Lee's "Bamboozled", he seems to be using him to try to really say something. <br /> <br /> As in 99.9% of all Bakshi films, this film includes animation and live action. Usually at the same time. Bakshki here are not just useless. All this technique is all intertwined when it says something. <br /> <br /> Somehow this method is inevitably obsolete. Many of these types of films (including Bakshi) are very relevant, very momentous. They reflect a certain tendency during the day, but looking back after a few years, you just feel nostalgic (and also the eternal truth). <br /> <br /> Even if music, clothes, slang and the city clearly look like photographs that belong to a time capsule, the attitude, spirit and heart remain the same, regardless of what that rumor is. Anyone who has actually seen films, a state of affairs and was in the company of people knows what I am talking about. <br /> <br /> Even some of the black characters are a rabbit (junglebunny), a big old bear and a fox. One of the most sour and dubious racist characters is the dirty policeman Harlem, who does not like the traces of these dirty killers after the death of the policeman. But for him it is not just a business. And not for the rest of the brothers who wear a shield. It's just pure sadistic racist pleasure to hurt black. <br /> <br /> The plot involving the Godfather and his lady is one of the most touching plays in the whole film, of which there are many. It sounds like opera or ballet. <br /> <br /> Promotional line: ATTENTION: “This film insults everyone!” This is not just a hoax. Act with extreme caution. <br /> <br /> You were warned ... <br /> <br /> Dane Yousef
