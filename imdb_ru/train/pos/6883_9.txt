In rare cases, there is a film that can expand the mind, warm the heart and touch the soul itself. "LOU" is such a film. I received a “LOU” from my wife, who received it from a neighbor who is in the film business. She watched it a second time with me. We were both delighted. She seems to be the first time again. <br /> <br /> “LOU” is a magic piece, designed to bring you back to the moment when all your dramas started happening. It makes it, being relentlessly interesting. Bret Carr, who plays the role of director, does not allow you to look away from the screen. He creates a character who disarms with a rabbit bug, stutters innocence, but the heat is transferred with such an underestimated sincerity that you forget that you are watching a movie. When the epiphany sounded during a brilliant climax, the second time I saw my wife in tears. <br /> <br /> As a trainer in life, I help individual growth and transformation, and this film is “must see” for Life Coaches and anyone who is looking for his own personal growth and transformation. This is a brilliant, creative masterpiece that can change life!
