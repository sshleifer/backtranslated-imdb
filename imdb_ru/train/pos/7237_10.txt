In the movie "Die for the sake of" there is everything. This film has a great cast. Lots and lots of romance and horror. Not too terrible, but still enough to appeal to horror fans. There are many more vampire love stories. If you are a fan of vampire love stories, I highly recommend this movie - 10/10.
