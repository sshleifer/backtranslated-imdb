This is a useful American story about teenagers who are interested in launching their own rocket in the rural coal town of West Virginia after the launch of the satellite in 1957. <br /> <br /> Through trial, adversity and perseverance beyond the confines of faith, they are ultimately able to achieve their goals. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal, as the leader of the group, plays a major role. Like his motivating science teacher, Laura Linney is pretty good, but her southern accent is superb. <br /> <br /> Chris Cooper, the chief miner, supports the outstanding work that wants his son to follow him. Steps, but gradually come at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so unusual for our times is the fact that there are no overnight scenes in it and no profanity. This is the embodiment of American history, which is well done. <br /> <br /> In addition to the scientific approach, we have disagreements between father and son, football scholarships as a way to avoid coal mining and loving family spirit. <br /> <br /> Why such photos are not recognized during the award ceremony?
