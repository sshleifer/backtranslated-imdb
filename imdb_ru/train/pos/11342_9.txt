I used to watch Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10. It was right after Bay City Rollers. Once I saw him on Family Channel and taped him for my three-year-old daughter. I forgot everything I loved in childhood, the magic flute, zoom broom, Witcheepoo makeup. <br /> <br /> This show is clearly low-tech. The mayor, of course, is a precedent for mayor of Makkiz, and all are stuffed with annoying Google-eyes. But kids love it. They, rather, rather observe how the guy works on the doll, than sit in front of high-tech computer animation. There is a (soft) farce, but there are no adult themes like sex or dying people, and children accept the Jimmy scheme. Children think that it would be nice to carry a bag of smoke and convince someone that their house is on fire, and I liked how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky, she thought that the Witch was flying over her head. The music is old, but you really got used to it, and my daughter really enjoyed it. Previously, she sang "differently hard, differently lonely" in the car. My daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months, and it still remains one of her favorites. <br /> <br /> I see that the new Pufnstuf 2000 is getting ready for work. I really hope that they are trying to keep the old taste and do not do anything like computer characters, etc. I think that a whole new generation will like Pufnstuf.
