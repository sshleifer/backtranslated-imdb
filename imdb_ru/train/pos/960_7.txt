This is a film in which there are many things that only the Japanese can understand. Even in translation there are some things that are clearly private jokes or regional symbols. I guess he tried to send some message, but it was just spent on me. <br /> <br /> What I felt was basically a mediocre movie with good special effects. Some child becomes “the only one” and, after all, has little to do with the Yokai War, which in any case has no meaning. It would be nice to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between the Azumi bean washing the yokai and the one that looks like a big tongue umbrella (Rihanna devours your heart!), I could not see the plot. <br /> Bottom line: nice visuals, a child screams a lot, the river princess is terribly cute, and everything else is crap.
