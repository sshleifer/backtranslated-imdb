Anna Christie (1931) <br /> <br /> At its core, this version of “Anna Christie” Garbo, filmed a year later in German with a completely new cast, is simply relaxed and refined to work better than English. version (both are American production MGM). Garbo, if something more command (or more beautiful, like a screen), and her actions are more restrained. And she seems frankly more relaxed, probably for many reasons, but we can assume that she no longer did her first talking picture, so she quickly adapted. <br /> <br /> Without always comparing one film with another, this Anna Christie is still the same O'Neill play with too many words. His topics about a woman who wants love without losing her independence are here, but still it looks strangely old-fashioned. Some scenes are missing - the Coney Island section is shortened and not so good, but overall this is a direct echo of the first film. Director Jacques Fader (a Belgian-French) is simply reworking what has already been done, which I suppose must be a disappointing experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see both films in a row, because they are definitely blocked. in the same way (not only sets, but also frames are the same). There is an episodic scene taken from an earlier film - it is clear that this is a storm, but also a short scene in which Marie Dressler (from the English version) walks with her friend on the board over the canal as drunk as possible, But this is all only silhouettes, and when their faces appear on the next scene, we see German actors playing their roles. Of course, it is impossible to replace Dressler, but for me the German father is more believable and honest in his work. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the themes — immigration, wayward fathers, daughters turning to prostitution, and the problems of finding true love — have strong currents then, especially with European threads (Garbo, respectively, plays a Swedish young woman).
