A powerful adaptation of the bestseller and the stunning Broadway play about the life of Bessie and Sadie Delaney, two “colored” sisters who lived after 100 years. They played great in old age Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll respectively, they tell their story in the memoirs of Amy Hill Hart (played by Amy Madigan), the white reporter for the New York Times. Memories and modern scenes do not have as much inspiring value as they do in a book, but in fact they are powerful. However, some aspects of the life of the sisters, such as the interracial origin of their mother and the reasons for the harsh personality of their father, are not clearly presented. You must read the book to fully understand these things. And this is also good, because the book is just as wonderful! In addition to these shortcomings, it is wonderfully made and executed, especially Dee and Carroll, and a very powerful and informative film.
