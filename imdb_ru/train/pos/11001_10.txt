Canadian director Vincenzo Natalie stormed an art-house scheme with an intriguing and surprisingly clever Cube, which is my personal favorite SF film of the 90s. This created the main vanity of a group of strangers trapped in a maze in the form of a giant cube, shot entirely on one set, and developed this idea in exciting directions. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to continuing Natalie’s work, and although it took him five years to create another project, I am pleased to report that it was worth it. Cypher is a fascinating study of the place of one person in the world, and how, thanks to a completely logical chain of events, he finds himself in a situation that does not depend on him. <br /> <br /> I do not want to talk too much about the plot, because one of Cyfer's joys is the different ways in which he distracts us. Nowadays it is so nice to see the SF film, in whose head there is more than one idea. Cypher is such a movie. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), one of the bravest people who have ever walked the planet, is hired by DigiCorp. He is sent to different parts of America to record various seminars. To his bewilderment, they are incredibly boring. Covers mundane themes like shaving cream and cheese. <br /> <br /> While Morgan waits for one seminar, he encounters Rita Foster (immaculately filled with the role of Lucy Liu), the definition of an ice maid. She shrugs off him, but there is something for her that he finds irresistible. This is not surprising, given that he is in a dry marriage. <br /> <br /> When Rita arrives at another Morgan seminar, she tells him that his life is not what it seems. And I say nothing more about the plot. This will make the rest of the film more expensive for us, as well as a winding path that is so fun to follow. <br /> <br /> As in the case of Cuba, Natalie demonstrates a talent for embracing seemingly ordinary people, taking them out of the usual, and mostly see what happens when they are shoved into the unknown. And Cypher follows similar patterns. But this is not an exact copy of Cuba. It has its own inspiration. <br /> <br /> Cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories. One of Cypher's great features is how these themes penetrate the story without your knowledge. When Morgan realizes that his false personality is part of a much larger puzzle, he becomes as much a shock to us as he does. <br /> <br /> One thing that distinguishes the Cypher from the Cube is how much more polished it is. While the Cube was limited to a minimalist setting and a limited budget with a set of unknowns, Cypher also has a small budget, but Natalie saves him as much as possible, allowing him to expand his horizons and launch Morgan on an amazing journey. through the maze of his self. <br /> <br /> Natalie’s direction is exceptional, with a deft hand on the reins. Above you can see amazing views, such as the vastness of the DigiCorp building in the form of a huge, durable office block in combination with a minor spot that Morgan is standing outside. All colors seem to have been knocked out of the picture, which perfectly complements the tone of the film, like a modern film noir. <br /> <br /> Everywhere is equally excellent. Jeremy Northam - a pretty figure from his loveless marriage to the doubts in his own personality. His performance is excellent because it is so modulated. It seems that he is literally transformed right before our eyes. From the clinical spineless weakling to the self-confident person who will do everything to preserve his new identity. <br /> <br /> David Hewlett looks very welcoming, having such an impact on the Cube. He lives in a secret bunker that looks like it was borrowed from people in black. His scene is one of the best, because it is an exercise in carefully calculated tension and paranoia. He is a reputed expert in identifying double agents, and this is a fantastic piece brilliantly played by Hewlett. All he needs to do is look at Morgan, and we are drawn into his challenging intellectual game. <br /> <br /> But this is Lucy Liu, who is stealing the scene here. Too often, it is filmed in films where its potential is not fully exploited. But in Cypher, she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove. Rita is an estranged, protected femme fatale, whom Liu enjoys enjoying. I was awake every time she appeared, because she was always in control and could reduce the room to be silenced by the power of her icy gaze alone. <br /> <br /> Everything comes to a very pleasant end, it does not conclude on an ambiguous note, as Cube did. But Morgan deserves his happy ending. After he went through that call, I greeted him in the final scene. This is the perfect final moment, because after the gloomy 90 minutes it becomes a ray of sunshine. <br /> <br /> Cypher achieves success on all counts. Exciting, shocking, always interesting, that's all Total Recall wanted, but didn't. And it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable Matrix. <br /> <br /> Natalie's wonderful continuation. And now I am a devoted fan of this man. Excellent stuff!
