Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy MacGregor from the beginning of the 18th century. He is a real actor. He charms the audience with his charisma, as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is superb like his wife Mary. Mary is such a beautiful woman. It is her love that makes Rob Roy a legend, but it is his passion that makes her love immortal. They need each other. Tim Roth is as evil as Cunningham perfect; one way or another, after seeing the movie, you will find that Cunningham is disgusting. Scottish landscapes are beautiful. The environment and conditions of the time are depicted fairly well. If you like history, romance, passion and love, you will love Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it is inevitable in the story of this story, as it should be said; no unreasonable violence. And you should listen carefully if you are not used to the Scottish accent. One important point that makes this film so good is that no actor or actress is fascinated; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in different scenes. They are attracted to acting, they do not rely on the names of tents, the popularity or attractiveness of sex symbols. This is something special.
