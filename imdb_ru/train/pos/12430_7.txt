Usually I don’t watch action films because they are usually very similar. There were a lot of stereotyped action films in this film, but the characters and the originality of the film’s premise made it much easier to watch. David Duchovny bent his normal acting approach, which was good to see. Angelina Jolie, of course, was beautiful and played beautifully. Perfectly filmed all together. Be sure to look for people who are tired of the same old fighter.
