I can't believe others take it all so seriously. God, how fun it was to cheer on Cassidy Hop-long. It was a great tribute to western TV shows years ago. It should not have been a great movie experience, other than that. So, if it were not for the big bonan special effects. It was fun, tongue in cheek, look at the old Western. Man, relax and enjoy.
