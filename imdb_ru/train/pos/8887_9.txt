When I saw the film, I was very shocked to see what the 60s is. I know that I can be mistaken in some things, but it seemed that the 60s really influenced the people of that time. Some people said they would want to go back to the 60s. From what I saw, I would say “yes” for excitement, and “no” for the result. But this is my opinion.
