A thrilling canoeing drama of four people on a weekend down a distant river. This is the pacifist Ed (John Voight), the enterprising, cruel Lewis (Bert Reynolds), the nasty Bobby (Ned Beatty) and the handsome guy Drew (Ronnie Cox). The first 40 minutes are great - this is an incredible sequence of dueling banjo, an interesting interaction between the characters and simply amazing widescreen cinematography of Vilmos Siegmond. Then two hills attack Ed and Bobby. One of them will rape Bobby ... and the trip turns into a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Just incredible. The landscape is incredibly beautiful, but this terrible violence occurs. To be honest, Beattyâ€™s rape never bothered me - I understand perfectly well that he is being faked, despite the good game. This film also shows how the characters change - Ed tests his pacifism, Lewis becomes weak, Bobby is disturbed by one of the people he mocked earlier, and Drew tries to keep himself sane. Directed by John Boorman is also very confident, and the sounds of the forest and the river are very helpful mood. <br /> <br /> The game is mostly good. Voight is just good in the lead - he was better. Beatty is fine too - but this is his debut film, and he has the courage to take on such a risky role. Coke is very good, especially when everything starts to fall apart. And Reynolds is just great - one of his best acting works! As it was not even nominated for an Oscar, it eludes me. Also, Bill McKinney and Herbert Kaward are too believable as assholes. <br /> <br /> A powerful movie is NOT for kids. Try to see the uncut version - TV version slaughtered. In addition, browsing in your inbox is necessary to capture breathtaking images.
