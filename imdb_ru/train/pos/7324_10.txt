My personal favorite horror movie. Carpenter's masterpiece - from long first tracking to the final turn of history. <br /> <br /> On Halloween night in 1963, little Michael Meyers kills his older sister. On the eve of Valentine's Day in 1978, Michael escapes from the Smith Grove Sanatorium. On Halloween night, Michael came home again to kill. <br /> <br /> The story is completely simple, Michael pursues and kills nannies. No frills, just the basics. This is the almost all-consuming atmosphere of Carpenter’s fear, which creates tension. As in any big horror movie, events are broadcast long before they happen, but they still seem to happen at random, never allowing viewers to guess the movie again. <br /> <br /> Dark lighting, long and steady camera shots, and (most importantly) this damn creepy music creates the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I haven’t seen in movies. There is a number of corpses, but compared to those killed by slashers, after that it is rather small. That and most of the killings are almost bloodless. Fear is not in death, but in ignorance. <br /> <br /> The game is good. PJ Soles provides most of the films with limited humor (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis turns into a decent performance, and then Jamie Lee-Curtis is young (at the time). At first, her game seems shy and uncertain, but you quickly realize that she is perfect for a character who is shy and insecure himself and is not at all prepared for what she will face. And, of course, in the role of the decisive (perhaps a little unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis, there is an excellently played Donald Pleasant. Rest in peace, Mr. Pleasant. <br /> <br /> If the film has a disastrous disadvantage, it will be time. Since the release of this film so many years ago, almost countless clones, copies, robberies and imitators came and stole (usually bad) the best parts of the film, until almost everything about it became habitual. Combined with changes in viewers ’expectations and appetites, one can see that most of the raw power of films is weakened. To truly appreciate it in our time, it must be considered as something unique. <br /> <br /> However, I unconditionally recommend this film to anyone looking for a good one. terrible time. Best wishes. <br /> <br /> 10/10
