The Bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil. The love of money leads to greed, which can lead to pride and ultimately to destruction. The two brothers, Andy and Hank, will find out how much love for money and those whom they love the most will cost. <br /> <br /> Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) could not be more excellent. Andy seems to be enjoying the success of working in the real estate market in New York and is married to his beautiful wife Gina (Marisa Tomei), who is the idea of ​​a trophy wife, if any. Hank, however, is divorced, who is at the mercy of his ex-wife, his daughter's expensive school bills and an infinite amount of alimony. A man who has good intentions and good intentions, Hank, nevertheless, cannot escape the water, which he slowly lifts above his head, no matter how hard he swims, to stay above it. <br /> <br /> However, Andy has his own problems with the only difference between him and his brother that he hides them better. He committed fraud against his company and is actively involved in drug use to avoid his fears. The pressure of his life and the lies he needs to maintain his appearance have now made him think about running out of the country with Gina to start all over again. Of course, like Hank, he needs money for this, and he believes that he knows how to get it. How? Abducting a jewelry store owned and managed by their parents. This act of betrayal is where the Hanson brothers, their families and a few other lives will be destroyed because of greed, pride and fear. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of “Before the devil knows you're dead,” is how the story is told. After the robbery goes wrong, and Nanette Hanson (Rosemary Harris), who is the mother of Andy and Hank, is killed, the story is told from different points of view from different days before and after the attempted robbery. We learn more about the motives not only of Andy and Hank, but also about the reaction of their father, Charles (Albert Finney) to the death of his wife. The relationship between Charles and his two sons, especially with Andy, is also being explored, and another possible motivation is revealed when it turns out that there is little love between these two people. Nanette may have been very fond of her sons, but their father is another story. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman once again proves why he is one of the most impressive actors in Hollywood today, portraying Andy not only as a greedy criminal with a lack of morality, but also in a controversial way as a person to whom we can sympathize . Ethan Hawke also returns Hank to life, not only as a loser, but also as a man who is desperately trying to grab hold of what he has left. Thus, Andy and Hank come to life so realistic that it is easy to imagine them not just as characters, but as real images of lost and confused people who now face the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> Before the devil finds out that you are dead, this is a moral story about how our actions lead to consequences that we could not otherwise have encountered. Moreover, our choice can also affect the people around us in ways that we never expected. In what should have been the best picture of the year, we see how life breaks easily when the love of money becomes the ultimate desire to ease our hectic life. In other words, we do not have simple solutions or answers to our problems, and an attempt to find them can only aggravate the situation. <br /> <br /> 10/10
