Massive multiple chills on the spine! I am surprised that there are people who did not like it! I saw it at 10 am and is still scared! And I saw hundreds of thrillers / horror movies! I'm crying out loud, I'm 22 years old! I mean, well, the voice acting is not particularly good, probably even a b-film. But the authentic kind of terror, sound effects, flow! From the very beginning, hitting you again and again with merciless, unforgiving, terrifying scenes! So many cliches, but no one can surprise / scare! You know, it goes, it goes, it goes, BOO! and you still jump off the chair. Take a pillow and blanket, call your closest friend and do not watch it at night! Hats off to the Japanese!
