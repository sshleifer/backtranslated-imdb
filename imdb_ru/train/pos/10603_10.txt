I get tired of the fact that my 4 and 5 year old daughters are constantly monitored by Nickelodeon, Disney and the like. It seems all the same old tired cartoons reprinted over and over again. When my daughters could not go to the fair today because of the illness of one of them, I wanted them to just get some rest and rest. I turned on the TV and, looking for something else, switched channels. My finger stopped switching channels as soon as I heard Harvey's voice. I adore every single thing that this man did, and when I saw that he was doing work behind the scenes for a little duck ... well, I could not change the channel! The cartoon immediately enchanted my daughters, and the more we watched the show TOGETHER, the more I loved it along with the message I was portraying. This is not necessarily a gay rights advocate, but rather for anyone who has ever been ostracized as a child for ANYTHING. I had friends who were chosen for one reason or another ... too fat, too thin, too feminine, bully, not smart enough, with only one parent ... you call it! Children, as a rule, can be very, very cruel to each other, so I was glad to see an entertaining cartoon that actually conveyed LIFE MESSAGE to its audience. My girls already accept others as they are, and do not choose others for being different. My eldest daughter actually stands up for her friends, if they are chained (one happens to be the same mother, and this little girl is often put on - this warms my heart when Cassie stands up for her!). > <br /> So, those of you who condemn this show, because you feel that he stands for “gay rights” or are forced to “take certain views”, you clearly and completely missed the point of this sharp little cartoon. <br /> <br /> And if you need to explain it to you ... well, you need more help than any television show can offer.
