I have a painful tornado craze for more than 40 years since my 5th grade teacher, a native of Texas, told stories about those he saw in his youth. Fortunately, I lived all my life in the mid-Atlantic countries, where tornadoes are rare and usually not as violent as in the Midwest, but I had two close encounters, one in PA and the other in New Jersey, in the past decade. <br /> <br /> I liked the family scenes, especially the conflicts between Jack and Dan Hatch. When the tornado was close, Dan knew most of what he had to do, and he probably found out about it at school, since I know that tornado safety is an important subject in those parts of the United States where these storms happen more often. However, the characters in the film did two things that, according to some people, should be performed or safe in a tornado, but in fact they cannot be done or they are unsafe. <br /> <br /> When the siren first sounded, Dan and Arthur went through the house and opened the windows. For years, this is what people have been told to do, but tornado security sites are no longer advised to do this. They also showed people how they hid in the underpass. This method was popular in the early 1990s, filmed by the T.V. during a relatively weak game in Kansas. However, in the most serious tornadoes, people can be sucked out of these underground passages. This happened during an outbreak in May 1999 in Oklahoma. <br /> <br /> A tornado hit this film in the fall, which is not the usual time for them. (Again, one of my close encounters occurred at the end of September.) In addition, they traveled from northwest to southeast, while most of these storms in the northern hemisphere run from southwest to northeast. However, this is not so unusual. The famous tornado that hit Joliet, Illinois, traveled in that direction in the early 1990s (like the one that participated in my other close encounter). <br /> <br /> I think the film was supposed to be set in the spring. This film was based on a book that, in turn, was based on an actual event that happened on June 3, 1980. But it was still a convincing story.
