I remember seeing it on TV in the late 70s - and it stayed with me! It is charming, loud, colorful - a great children's film. I recently wore this for some friends at a party - and, naturally, they thought I was crazy, and expected that the dolls would happen something sick a la "Meet the weak." > Jack Wilde in great shape, like Cass's mother, and some attractive witches. <br /> <br /> If you like banana splits and you are over thirty, this recreates a surreal childhood on Saturday morning Vibe! <br /> <br /> Even if I realized now that Poof himself is a little crap - all he does is to be caught and run! High-quality television film - if, like me, you are passionate about death metal, you will like it!
