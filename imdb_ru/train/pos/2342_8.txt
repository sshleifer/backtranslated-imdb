I watched Pie-lette last night, and the word that comes to mind is "original." This word is little used in television, since all of them, as a rule, copy what the other network is doing, and in the end you will get seven nights of criminal shows, unfunny comedies and reality crap. <br /> <br /> First I was struck, like a brick, the presence of Jim Dale. Those who are not familiar with the British series “Carry On ...” or those who have not listened to the Harry Potter book may not be familiar with Dale. I am not sure that his presence as a narrator adds or distracts. I will have to tune in to more, but this gives the show the atmosphere of Harry Potter. Maybe this is good. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace (Infamous, The White Countess) has a gift. It never explains where he got it from, but he can return someone from the dead for a minute. He teams up with Chi McBride (Boston Public, Roll Bounce) to solve the killings with this talent. Everything is good and funny, until he encounters the love of childhood, Anna Friel (Goal! The dream begins, the timeline), and everything becomes really complicated. He cannot send her back, and he can never touch her. God, does that complicate the relationship? <br /> <br /> I’ll tune in to see where this show goes, waiting for him to continue to have fun.
