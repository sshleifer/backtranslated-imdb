I recently watched this movie on a lazy Sunday afternoon with a friend of mine, and we have a lot of fun! This film is a masterpiece of garbage. Try to watch it for this purpose! Of course, this was not expected, but acting (and Alberto Tomba is absolutely the best), a weak script and a cheap budget created an amazing mixture of nonsense. Timba had just retired from skiing, where he was the dominant technical skier in the late 1980s and 1990s. Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two world championships and nine world championship season titles. Serious about the director: no one knows why Damiano Damiani signed this film. All other areas of Damiani are significant.
