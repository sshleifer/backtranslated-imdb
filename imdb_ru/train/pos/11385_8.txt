The musical numbers are also well made, and this is not a big surprise when people like you work Vincent Minnelli and Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> But wasn’t it possible to do everything that was said but in this film, half an hour or less? I mean, we already know where the film is going, but he still manages to stretch it as long as possible. Not that the film stretches in any parts, it just too long. The film could also be made with several less musical numbers. <br /> <br /> One of the best MGM musicals, although not without flaws. <br /> <br /> 8/10
