Even in the 21st century, fertility is dangerous: women have miscarriages, and they give birth prematurely. Seventy-five years ago, women often died during childbirth. This is the topic “Begins life”: a look at the “difficult cases” of the maternity ward. Loretta Young plays the main role, the woman brought here from prison (what crime she committed does not belong to the conspiracy) to give birth; she contradicts the fact that she will have to abandon her baby after birth. She is in a ward with several other women who share their joys and pains with each other. <br /> <br /> Although Loretta Young plays a leading role, Glenda Farrell puts out the outstanding work, as usual. Farrell was one of Warner's "B" women in the 1930s. He often played minor roles, and sometimes was a leader in the “B” films (Farrell played Blaine’s Torch in several episodes of the Torch B-film). Here Farrell plays the future mother, who does not want her children, because they will only interfere. She is doing everything possible to prevent nurses, including smuggling alcohol into the ward (this is, of course, on the ban days) and drinking like fish - obviously, they never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in the 30s. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, unlike most films in the early 1930s, clumsy women are not heroes who interfere with heroic men - the situation is reversed, and fathers shaking mounds of jelly. (Watch out for veteran actor Frank McHugh as one of the future fathers.) “Life begins,” being an early radio station, certainly treats this topic with a melodic melody, but this is a rather charming little film. Turner Classic shows this, albeit infrequently; I saw him only a few days after Loretta Young. But it is strongly recommended to see when it appears.
