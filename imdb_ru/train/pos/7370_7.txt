Some compare this film with Liberation. I believe that mice and men are more suitable. Our host, Heaton, definitely loves Spike. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a sexual love. For this reason, Heaton does not leave Spike. He needs him. They need each other. As brothers, as family, as their only connection with humanity. The decor, the script, the minimum cast - all of this as a whole gives a wonderful film. Honestly, I didn’t care what happened to the characters. But I didn’t care what the director did to them. He coped well with them. I spent some time thinking about what the final “Mice and Men” would look like. The soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and intriguing.
