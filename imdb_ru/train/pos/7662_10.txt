As for films B, it was well above average (I warn the reader that I can reveal some key elements of the plot or other parts of the film, although I try to minimize any such tendency). As usual, the sequels continue, it was absolutely fantastic (despite the cookie cutter approach to trying to copy certain elements from the original film). Despite this sometimes tedious trend, it worked in this particular film, as long as the viewer could divert his attention from comparisons with the original "Scanners"). <br /> <br /> The film was similar to the TV series "Superman" in terms of describing the main character of his early childhood and relations with his parents. (which seemed modeled on the same principles as the Kents in the stories about Superman) and the theme of a morally pure hero with extraordinary abilities from an early age, etc. Image of a deep sense of alienation surprising or otherwise "Matching children, teenagers and / or an adult ”was a topic that reminded me of films such as“ Real Genius ”and (to a more superficial degree)“ Dr. Mordrid ”, and received a particularly strong response. <br /> <br /> There was a positive confusion in the film and it was fun to watch. I found some ideas and accuracy (in terms of describing certain aspects of paranormal experiences) fascinating and even deeply touching at times. These moments from time to time appeared among all the great persecutions based on the formula, and unreasonable sex (in this case, in fact, because the sexual elements were made with taste) and violence that makes movies B (or Shakespeare's plays, for that matter !) It is so interesting to watch! <br /> <br /> This is a must-see for all comics, fiction, “remote viewing” enthusiasts and horror fans! With the right exposure in the right circles, the film could develop a rather cult following along with the original “Scanners.”
