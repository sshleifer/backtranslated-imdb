“Twelve Monkeys” is a crazy time-travel film made in action films in which Bruce Willis plays the main role, played by James Cole, a man sent back in time to gather information about the devastating plague that will happen in November 1996 of the year. Unfortunately, he was also sent back far before 1990, when everyone believes that he is insane. <br /> <br /> This film is exciting and has excellent acting qualities from Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. The Twelve Monkeys is one of the greatest time travel movies that I think anyone can enjoy. Terry Gilliam created a real masterpiece <br /> <br /> 10/10
