I caught a movie night with a friend. The evening is a throw of chickens without any apologies for being so, but I can say with some relief that he is not so full of estrogen that it is painful to look at a male with red blood. Except for one occasion at the very end of the film, I watched with interest, and I did not have to turn away or roll my eyes at some condescending melodrama. Ladies, in turn, will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Anne Lord is elderly, bedridden and spends her last few days on Earth as comfortable as possible in her own home with her two adult daughters to her side. Puzzled by the memory of her past, Ann suddenly calls the name of a man her daughter had never heard before: Harris. While both her daughters silently reflect on the meaning of their mother's strong desire to remember and correct her ill-fated romance with this mysterious man for all times, Ann again recalls the fateful day when she met Harris - and in the process, so lost her youthful optimism in respect of the future, with which we all inevitably break up. <br /> <br /> Both Ann and her two daughters - one married to children, the other - the serial “commitophobe” - struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists, and perhaps more importantly, if true love can stand the test of time. We are all destined once to realize that love never lasts forever? Will we understand all that content with imperfect is the only realistic result? The subtle fact that the elderly Ann is still struggling with the answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughters. <br /> <br /> Cinematography for “Evening” is interesting - most of the film is held in “Ann”. do not forget that she recalls the past, and for this reason I think that the film was shot as if it were intentionally overexposed to give everyone an ethereal radiance (and thus make it completely obvious that all this is not real, but happened in the past). Claire Danes is beautiful (it seems, really, very high, although in fact only 5 '5 ") and absolutely charming in one climatic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test. <br /> <br /> You cannot talking about the cast that leaves Claire Danes and not leaving: Vanessa Redgrave, Patrick Wilson, Meryl Streep and Glenn Close perform other major and minor roles in the film. br / <br /> I can't say anything bad about it at all film, although Hugh Dancy’s fight to get his character out of the absolute one-dimensional STI, ultimately - total loss. The game is a spoiled, sweet, drunken descendant of those who are indecently rich, who put out the front of great bravado, but secretly afraid to never mean anything, probably not so much to study the character - he had his orders and he molested them. <br /> <br /> In the end, gentlemen, your girlfriend will surely cry, and while you probably won't feel almost as affected as, the evening will definitely not a waste of time spent watching the evening. Catch him in cinemas or rent them to exchange points for moments when you want to be accompanied by watching Die Hard 4 or the upcoming Rambo movie. It will be your little secret that this viewing did not cost you much at all.
