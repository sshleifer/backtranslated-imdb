One of the best movies in history! Why he got only 7.6 rating remains a mystery. This film is a window into the world of black experience in America. Must be a must-see for all white people and all children over 10 years old. I recommend watching it with The Long Walk Home as a companion piece. If you think that Whoopi Goldberg’s work about “Homer and Eddy” or “Hollywood Squares”, think again. Do not miss this film, which was supposed to win an Oscar. (And read the book too!)
