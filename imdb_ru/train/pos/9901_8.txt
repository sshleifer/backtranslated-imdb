This film looked like a classic in the raw 80s slasher genre, which is my favorite genre of all, so when I saw that it was Free on Demand, I had to watch it! It starred Caroline Munro from both Dr. Fibes films (she was his wife who died!), Dracula 1972 AD, Golden Journey of Sinbad, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, Spy Who Loved Me, Maniac and Faceless. /> <br /> Bring you people do not open until Christmas and plays, here are my thoughts on this ... <br /> <br /> It opens on the day of April Fools' Day, when a group of children make fun of the school nerd - promise him sex in the shower, public humiliation and face in the toilet (all while he is naked!). The coach stops it, but both sides swear revenge. But in the end, cool kids burn a live nerd. <br /> <br /> Perspective and reunion of high school, or do they think so (bahahah?). The only ones who received invitations were the gang that burned the child and her April Fools Day (or indeed, the day before the April Fools, but the fun begins at midnight), but they don’t see the coincidence and hang out before school before dark. Then they finally break into the school, and the assault begins. <br /> <br /> Inside, they find food / drink and a small shrine for each of them, each of their lockers and things, as well as Marty’s locker (nerds). and yearbook. They also find an old black janitor / caretaker who spends his time saying, “Oh, yes, yes! Yes! I don't want any problems, sir! ”And then he is killed instantly. Pretty pointless character, but he is still my favorite. <br /> <br /> The film removes the page from the Alien book, it’s amazing and awful, that you just have to see! That's when everyone realizes that they are here to die, and they start to get worried, except for Shirley, who decides that it would be better to take a bath in the souls of the old school at a time like this. Of course, he pours out blood and acid, and her face melts (very cool, notice). The rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs, and Marty kill everyone wearing a jester's mask. What is their plan? “All we have to do is not sleep and wait until noon. Marty won't kill us at noon! ” Seriously, that's what he said. Apparently, you can kill only at night. But will they survive all night? Who will live and who will die? And why all the bodies disappear? Rent, buy or steal this wonderful movie to find out! The film is actually very good, filled with cliché (the car won't start, DAMM!) And just a fun kill. Not to mention the fact that they all have names like Carol, Nanny, Frank, Joe and Susan. I recommend this to all of you! And not to mention the fact that he has Spin Off! The cutting class of 1989 is the result of this pearl, and this film begins the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene: two people have sex, the guy wants to finish, but the girl does not. "Talk to me is dirty, Frank !!" she screams "Uh ... boobs!" "Dirty!" "Mm ... boobs. F * ck. Boobs. Boobs. F * ck.". It seems to work for her, and at her climax the killer kills both of them with an electric shock!
