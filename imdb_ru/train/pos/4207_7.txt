Skip the McCoy (Richard Widmark) Candy (Jean Peters) pocket sneakers, which contains an important microfiche for communist affairs. She is followed by 2 federal agents who are waiting to lash out as soon as she passes the microfiche to her contact. However, Skip steals a purse on the subway under everyone's nose and therefore begins to hunt him by both the police and Joe (Richard Kili) and Candy, who want to return the microfiche. A pass can only be tracked through Mo (Thelma Ritter), who sells information about criminals. Skipping is clear that what he stole is important, and both sides want the film, but he intends to hold out at a high price. This leads to the fact that Joey is hunting him and the conflict between Joey and Jean, who fell in love with Skip. Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss. <br /> <br /> This is a well-played film, and it has a good start, which immediately involves you. It is a little unreal how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this moment is necessary, because otherwise she will keep from Joey later. This is a good movie.
