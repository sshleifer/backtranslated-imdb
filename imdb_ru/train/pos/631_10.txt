In this film there is everything that should be in a fantasy film, romance, clever wit, a great play of actors and a fair amount of magic. <br /> <br /> I really liked this film, and I was drawn to its original plot (based on the novel by Neil Guyman, which I now want to read) and colorful characters. <br /> <br /> One of the most striking to me was how closed this story was. Unlike many science fiction fantasy films, which are now open, and it was a pure fairy tale, satisfying itself without the need to continue. <br /> <br /> Original. Fun. Good fantasy.
