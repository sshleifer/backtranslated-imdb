I did not like Chandni Bar from the same director. <br /> <br /> I have not watched his other films. They came and went. <br /> <br /> But page 3 is well done. It seems real Like Satya from the RGV. <br /> <br /> Mental illness of the so-called high society - a summary of the film. In the midst of illness, it is difficult to lead a normal life, as does the main character of Konkan Sen. A serious film that cannot be watched with children or expecting wives. Page 3 of newspapers is the usual place to cover the events taking place in lots of the rich and the elite who do much more filth than they say. How this Page-3 is also a business perspective is shown in the film. Firms involved in organizing events are paid for organizing parties and in one night they make rich, but not famous people famous by clicking photos of celebrities invited to the party. <br /> <br /> Western culture has deeply penetrated into the high society of Mumbi, the film shows it boldly, without delay. <br /> <br /> Madhur Bhandarkar begins a new journey from here.
