I don’t know ... Maybe it’s just because it’s an impressive tribute to some Muslim religious action (hajj), but I just felt that the film was so underestimated. I just can not believe that only 223 people voted for this film, considering that the film was shot in 2004 and has since won many awards. About the film ... this is one of those well-played sweets movies. Reda, a French teenager who must sit in Baccalauréat, his pious elderly father asks to take him to Mecca. Oddly enough (if you don’t know much about Islam), the father wants his son to take them from their home in France to Saudi Arabia during a religious pilgrimage once in a lifetime. The gap between father and son is based on fairly simple terms (“you may know how to read and write, but you know nothing”). about life - an unnamed father to his son), but avoid some bromide literature about the generation gap. Many of them are very affectionate in their disappointments. The father never speaks French, although Reda understands Arabic, but can only answer in French. Although they encounter many people on the road: “On the way to Belgrade on the Bosnian border, they meet a terrible old woman and talkative Mustafa (Jackie Nercessian) who helps them on the Turkish border, secretive and Shy women wearing burqas on the way to Damascus" The spotlight is always the inappropriate father and son. There are not many conversations in the film that make it pleasing to your eyes. You see great views in every city. The director shows you even the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, although the film is not about It's very long. <br /> <br /> As a rule, I don’t like movies that don’t do it, I’ve got enough dialogues that come from the intricacies of the camera, but this one was really great. Despite some unanswered details (for example, Reda's invisible French girlfriend), the film draws attention to itself. A magnificent work of art and remember that this film is the debut of Ismail Ferruha.
