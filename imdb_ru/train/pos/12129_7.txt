This is a well-made film by John Cromwell, who was not a great director, but made some good films, including the 1937 version of The Prize Winner. Located in London, which could only endure Hollywood, atmospheric, but not like real, this is a story of obsession and a torn love from the novel by Somerset Mohan. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to seeing him on a DVD, which I had never seen before, and, being a great admirer of Bette Davis, I wanted to see her in a role that is considered one of her early greats. So, I bought it. Well, she looked good, but I'm sorry to say that her London Cockney with an accent made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest movie actors, make no mistake, but here she made one. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It wasn’t as bad as a Mary Poppins Cockney with Dick Van Dyck’s accent, but close. <br /> <br /> In another title role, Leslie Howard was, and he did it great. He was a subtle and intelligent actor. Actors actors have proven themselves. Worth seeing, despite Miss Davis's vocal gymnastics.
