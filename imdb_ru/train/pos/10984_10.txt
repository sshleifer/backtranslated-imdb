One question that needs to be asked right away: “Would this film have been made if it had not included women and aunt and cousin Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis?” <br /> <br /> Answer: “Probably not.” /> <br /> But fortunately, they (or were) a cousin and Aunt Jackie. <br /> <br /> This documentary about the existence of the Myles brothers (this can hardly be called life) Edith B. Beale Jr. and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (Edie) have the same appeal as a train wreck - you are not want to watch, but you have to. <br /> <br /> Big Edit Little Edie lives in the once magnificent mansion in East Hampton, New York, which slowly decomposes around them. Once beautiful gardens turned into a jungle. <br /> <br /> A magnificent oil painting leaning against a wall (with cat excrement on the floor) and their beautiful portraits when young women fight for a place on the walls next to the covers of old magazines. <br /> <br /> Living alone for many years has destroyed many barriers between two women, but erected others. <br /> <br /> It seems that clothing is not required. Edie's favorite costume is a pair of shorts with tights on them and cloth pieces wrapped around her torso and head. <br /> <br /> As Edith says, “Eddie is still beautiful at 56”. And indeed, it is. There are moments when it almost glows, and both women demonstrate the beauty that was once there. <br /> <br /> The constant current of sexual tension is constant. <br /> <br /> Their eating habits be polite) weird. Spread ice cream on crackers. Edith's birthday party with Wonder Bread sandwiches served on porcelain with plastic utensils. <br /> <br /> Time does not matter in their world; as Edie says, "I don't have a watch." <br /> <br /> Their relationship with men is so weird. <br /> <br /> Edie feels that Edith has sabotaged any attempts at happiness. She says: "If you can not make a man make you an offer, you can be dead." To which Edith replies: "I will take a dog any day." <br /> <br /> Obviously, Edith does not see his role in Edie’s lack of male communication. At the beginning of the film, she states that “France has fallen, but Edie is not. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's hard to hear exactly what is being said. Both women talk simultaneously and constantly contradict each other. <Br /> <br /> In the film, a strange relationship with animals: Eddie feeds the raccoons in the attic with Wonderful bread and cat food. Cats (and there are many) everywhere. <br /> <br /> At some point, Edie states: “The hallmark of the aristocracy is responsibility.” But they do not seem to be able to take responsibility for themselves. <br /> <br /> This is a tough movie, but worth spending.
