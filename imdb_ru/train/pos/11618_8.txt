Rachel McAdams. Killian Murphy. Wes Craven. Dream Team. This is one of the best thrillers in 2005. Great storyline. Great twist. Great eye candy. This is one of the greatest films of Wes Craven, except for "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street." This may be the best. The plot is one of the best things about the film, and it's very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams), who runs the hotel with all her might, sits down in the late Red Eye back to Los Angeles. Little did she know that Jackson Ripner, also known as Jack the Ripper (Murphy), followed her. They have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane. He later tells her that he is the murderer, who was sent to kill the Minister of National Security, who is in the hotel of Lisa. And what does this have to do with Lisa. Well, she will have to move his room to the upper room so that they can bomb it, if she doesn't, Ripner will kill her father (Brian Cox). The highlight and introduction of the story really give it an extra touch, and the side characters and side jokes really add to it. In general, of course, one of the best thrillers in 2005. Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 of 4 stars
