In this truly funny movie there are a lot of funny characters, almost every voluptuous middle-aged woman in Hollywood, and a touching, funny love story. Capomezza and Malacici are rival providers in the Italian district of New York. They are also at the opposite - extreme - ends of the scale of taste. Their children play major roles in Romeo and Juliet church productions. Naturally, they fall in love. On the stage! The chaos and disarray that this causes, as parents quarrel with each other and their children, is played out for us against the backdrop of the magnificently tasteless Kapometsi house and their magnificently furnished tastelessly served weddings. <br /> <br /> In addition, four excellent parents and charming young lovers, the heroes include a vaguely wise priest, a simple grandmother, a lady who waves her wand and passes the spiritual advice she receives from a host called “Blessed Roscoe” with beds in the form of the rear seat of the car and two pigeons. In this fast-paced film, there is no spectacle or raisin that would not work. <br /> <br /> Even the names of two families are part of the fun. “Capomezza” can be interpreted as “low eyebrows”, and “Malacici” can mean “stuck snobs”. <br /> <br /> If you don’t like Italian stereotypes, you may not like this movie. If Bette Midler confuses you, you may not like it, because all the women in this film make Bette Midler look like Martha Stewart. The rest of us must love this!
