The acting in this film was excellent, but mixed with the truth about the situation of many Africans in South Africa made it heartbreaking. It was good that the writer isolated Besman and Lena from others who had fled from their homes, so that we could completely separate their victories and defeats; the conflicts that they shared when they grew up together and apart. It is worth seeing when you put the movie in the appropriate context.
