“Simple rules” is a fun show, but he also has some lessons from life, especially one mature lesson on how to move on after losing. It was the episode when Paul died, it was the first episode that I ever watched the show on ABC. Clan Hennessy - mother Kate (Katie Sagal), daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson) and son Rory (Martin Spangers) - turn to each other for guidance and support after the death of Paul (John Ritter), the family patriarch. Parents Kate (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshet) extend a helping hand. I'm glad that in the second season of this show they decided to include David Spade on this show, since he finished the NBC series, just shoot me! But all and all this show is pretty good. This show reminds me of a lot of classic family sitcoms from the 80s and 90s that used to be on ABC.
