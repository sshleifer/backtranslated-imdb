I just finished watching “California” on Showtime for the fourth time since I first saw it in July 2001. One would think that with the recent wave of serial killer films, “California” will be among some of the earlier films worthy of mention, but not. Perhaps, if this film were released somewhere between 1996-1999, it might have been more successful. In my opinion, “California” is very different from most of the serial killer films released in the late 1990s. He has an almost completely different atmosphere from most modern serial killer films such as Seven or Bone Collector. Many serial killer films show a killer, but this man is always behind the mask, or we never see enough of them to find out anything about them. “California” is a film that actually tries to overcome this barrier and understand the criminal mind. He tries to answer questions like “why do they do what they do? Is it because of what happened in their past? Does it make them feel better or stronger? Or do they do it because they like the thrill of killing? “These are some of the questions that“ California ”is trying to answer, but also leave us a place to try to sort ourselves out. Brad Pitt makes a lasting impression on Early Grace. When we first meet at the beginning of the film, we see that obviously one of the worried people. When we first see him, it is late at night. Early, perhaps, drunk. Then we see him picking up a stone, dropping it from the bridge, and later he lands on the windshield of a passing car. this film is always nice to see nd when he plays loonies or really bad people. It's funny that it later would cause him to play this Eider, as in "12 Monkeys," and that he was at the other end of the spectrum in the "Seven" by David Fincher.
