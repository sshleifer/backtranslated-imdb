This film should be my favorite for all times. This should not be a conspiracy, because its creators wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think) to believe that it was a real snuff film. It was an exercise with visual effects, and it is not interrupted when the action takes place, like in any other movie. Nowadays, movies are about sound effects, and the visual effects created by computers make it easier to work with CGI blood. There are still filmmakers who still can't make fake blood look like the real thing. There is no rape scene because it was not the purpose of making the film. Have you seen the hills have eyes of 2? The rape scene was funny, not shocking. Although I'm sure there are some Gonzo porn filmmakers who tried to marry porn with horror. But since they probably suck at making movies, they probably won't be able to handle it. The movie "Fuck Me" has an alarming rape scene, because actress is actually a porn star, and they show everything, despite the fact that the film as a whole sucks. <br /> <br /> Its too bad that a film cannot be made without thinking of the monetary aspect of all of this, especially when it comes to rating AO or NC-17. I’m sure that Eli Roth has the ability / talent to do a lot of his Hostel films much better, but he too tamed him to get an R rating ... or at least I hope his films sucked because of these limitations . <br /> <br /> See “Death tracks” or “More than broken pumpkins” if you don’t want real shots (incidents and crime scenes / shots) to be in the frame. Do not forget that this film was made in 1985. The fact that this film can still stand up to most of the crap that has been made these days says a lot about this film. It’s as if someone said that the 8-bit Super Mario Brothers sucks because the PS3 has better graphics.
