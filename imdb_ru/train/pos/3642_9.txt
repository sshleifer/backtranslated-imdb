I first watched this film 3 years ago, and it was then represented by the head of Disney Eisner and the real Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> About a month ago he came back on TV, and this time I recorded it on tape. Since then, I must have watched it at least three times. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, inspiring well-being film that is written with intelligence and believable by all interested parties. He opposes every sentimental ploy in the book, as well as the rest of the cliché. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see a movie in which children are not crazy and have a lot of behavioral problems. and athletes are not depicted as testosterone-driven muscles. <br /> <br /> These are just normal people who dream the same dreams as you and me. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Hollywood is a thing of the past. the other extreme is what they call “sand realism” when they make films in which everyone curses and has problems with aggression. <br /> <br /> This film is about a person who has a dream and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue this dream. The people at Big Lake TX seem so personable that I want to move there. <br /> <br /> As I said b4, the film does not try to outweigh sentimentality. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never disappoints. I have been watching him since the late 1970s, and he is so undervalued. <br /> <br /> But in this film there are great performances from EVERYONE interested and praise the authors. <br /> <br /> The jewel in the film is near the end when Jim trains in the dugout before the big game, and his wife calls him from the stands. He rushes and reaches for his family. A look at the faces of three other pitchers sitting on a bench in a dugout is priceless. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a tempo change, select this movie.
