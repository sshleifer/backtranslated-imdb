Oh, the sixties. There were some interesting films. Then I was more of a movie buff. Now I love making films and relaxing at home, not going to the theater. I also saw this short film The Legend of a Boy and the Eagle. I have been looking for this film for many years. It was really inspiring. Surprisingly, I was finally able to collect more information from your site. Thank you ........ I am surprised to learn that this short film was a discovery for a picture of Disney. I don't remember the Disney movie either. I did not even remember that it was the debut film for Disney. I sincerely wish that they would ever show it on TV. Interestingly, Dizay owns the rights to this film? Is it available on DVD? This is a must see for all generations !!!
