I always liked movies that portray life as it is. In life, sometimes there are boring spots, there is no real plot and not necessarily a happy ending. “The River Runs Through It” is the perfect title for this film (and the novel by Norman Maclean). Life is fading away and flowing like a river, and it has its irregularities, but this is a wonderful journey. <br /> <br /> Robert Redford brings a lot to the film. His story has a friendly feeling that fits perfectly into the picture. As a director, he is restrained and calm, and shoots incredibly beautiful scenes. As for acting, Craig Schaeffer and Brad Pitt work amazingly well, like brothers. I don’t know how to describe the performances of Tom Skerrit and Brenda Bletin, except that they really feel real. “The river flows through it” is a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> 8.6 out of 10
