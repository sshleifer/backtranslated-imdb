I have to admit that Purple rain is one of my deepest pleasures. Purple rain not only broke the boundaries, he set a decade, costumes, music, behavior and dancing! To this day, my friends and I still play the Purple Rain soundtrack and pretend to be Prince and Revolution. <br /> <br /> Now about the film itself, I just meant what I said in the title, because Most of this film is in itself made by music. Actions? Please do not let me judge this, as this is one of my favorite pleasures, because I know that it was not a worthy Oscar. But I think the duet that made this film was Morris and Jar, their speech about passwords was incredible. I just want to rate this movie by live episode, because I felt that it was he who made the movie. <br /> <br /> Prince - a musical genius and created wonderful music. Although the film and acting are pretty bad, this film is still interesting to watch at night and even for dancing. This movie defined the 80s, so just have fun with it. The prince would like that just to have fun! Oh boy, it sounded unconvincing. <br /> <br /> 9/10
