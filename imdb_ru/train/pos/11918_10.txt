"Angels in the Outfield" was originally a 1951 film from the Ted Turner Library; Disney redid it in 1994, this time using the California Angels (now Los Angeles Angels) as a team (Disney used to own it and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks hockey team, also, good use of words, yes ???? ?) <br /> <br /> This film was about a couple of orphans who wanted to start a family. The man promised the boys a family only if the Angels won the pennant. So, one night he called on God about it. The boy who prayed could see the help approaching on the way (and ONLY that boy); for example, when the first angel fell, the player hit the ball so hard that not only the bat, but the ball broke !!!!! For most of the 1994 season, after all the stars, the Angels were at the top of Al West (of which my own Rangers team is one, and so is still there). However, they lost the game because the boy was on the court instead of the White Sox / Angels game (then there was no Central Division in Baseball, therefore Chicago was in the West), and the angels could not help there. Thus, a new rule was created: no angel can help in the championship games. But wait! In the final championship game, the angels won !!!!! It was really a miracle! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: This is a good movie. I mean, I prayed every night for the past few years, asking for help with the school and things; look at me now! My job was good !!!!! For example, this shows that if you believe, God can send His angels down to help you with any troubles you may have in life. And secondly, this is a family baseball movie that always excites. This is also an old Disney movie; I saw it recently on the channel "New Disney" (damn !!!!!). <br /> <br /> “Angels in the outfield” will forever change your life as soon as you see it !!!! ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
