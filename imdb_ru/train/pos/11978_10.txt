I love so much a full house that I can't live without a full house. Why is this over? It upsets many fans of this. Can we have a sold-out II? Oh, come on! But it is better if we have these DVDs to help us. But I need these real ones to come up with another new episode. Love, Warmly filled the house! All characters are very cute and beautiful! Candace Cameron, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Jodi Sweeten, Bob Saghet, Dave Kulier and John Stamos DJ, Michelle, Stephanie, Danny, Joe and Jessie, please go back to the screen, please! How did Michelle fall from a horse? How are Nicky and Alex? Is Joey alone or has a wife or at least a girlfriend? Do they still live in the same house? I want to continue life sold out! and please don't upset me!
