I read several reviews of this film, and I have to say: “What's wrong with you, people?!?!” It was a great movie! I thought this film was excellent from start to finish, and the story was very well told. I am convinced that the people who did not like this film did not pay much attention to it. There are a number of very important scenes that, if you don’t pay attention, will be confused, and the following scenes may not make sense. I urge everyone who doesn’t like this film to watch it again and watch it alone so you can really pay attention. The story made sense to me and, as I said, was very well told. Each scene in the film has its own point of view, and at the end of the film, everything converges. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a fantastic job! Sean Connery, as always, was very good in his role. Laurence Fishburn was great in the role of Tanny Brown, playing a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was also a nice touch and looks fantastic. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise, I did not expect anything good from him, but he did an excellent job with his work. Ed Harris was a real gem in the film. He plays a really sick person and really makes you see how concerned his character is. Watch his eyes in his scenes, just great !!! In addition, in one of her first roles there is a very young Scarlett Johansson (as Kate) ... not a bad place to start. Great cast in this movie! <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this film to anyone who loves any of the actors or simply loves thrillers. This is a great movie and you need to watch it. Do not listen to the opinions of all these people, watch the film and draw your own conclusions. I hope that you will see the film, and I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> - Chris
