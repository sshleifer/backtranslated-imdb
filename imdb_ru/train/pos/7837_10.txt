After listening to the CD's soundtrack many times, I realized that I wanted this film, got it for Christmas and was amazed. Mark Bolan had such charisma, I can't describe it. I heard about him this way, but did not understand what people were talking about until I was in the company of this shooting. He was incredible. Clips from the Wembley concert are interspersed with surrealistic sketches, such as nuns at a garden party, when Marc Bolan performs several acoustic versions of Get It On, etc. (I am still learning the names of the songs). George Claydon, a miniature photographer from the Magical Mystery Tour, plays the chauffeur, who jumps out of the car and eats one of the side mirrors.

It evades description. <br /> <br /> Yes, I like the Beatles, and I was curious that Ringo made a documentary about rock music - it was 35 years ago - now I finally found out that he had been on DVD for 2 years but finally he is at my house.
