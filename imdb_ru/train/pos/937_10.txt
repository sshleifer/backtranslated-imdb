When it was first shown in 1984, my wife and I recorded it on our very first VHS VCR. I still have that aging tape that I try to watch every year. It was the year when my first child was born, and watching a Christmas song in this incarnation brings back pleasant memories of happy times, many of which were spent for this film to play in the background. I finally broke this year and ordered a DVD that prompted me to take a minute to write this brief reaction to the film. The story of Charles Dickens is captured here in an outstanding manner. George S. Scott is absolutely amazing and absolutely believable, like Scrooge. The supporting cast is equally spectacular. This, in my opinion, flawless production. Little details add a lot of fun. The game "compares", as Scrooge's nephew and wife play with their guests at a party, is an excellent element. (Since then, I have recreated it with my schoolchildren in English as a short respite from class work!) Honestly, I can think of several ways to have fun during the holidays, which I like more than doing this CBS performance, which was originally sponsored by IBM. (By the way, itâ€™s interesting to watch an old tape with an original IBM advertisement ... which shows how many computers have evolved in 21 years. It's amazing how everything has changed!) The result: a Christmas carol is an eternal story, and this performance is an eternal classic. Enjoy ... and God bless us all!
