One thing I can say about this film is very long, VERY LONG! I actually recently bought this movie a couple of months ago, after seeing that a new version is coming out. I was happy to find that it was done in 1978, because the 70s (although I never lived in them) are in fact one of my favorite decades, especially for music! When I watched this film, the story was really very good at the beginning, but then, after about 50 minutes, it became very boring and repetitive. I admit that the animation impressed me! it was nothing i had ever seen before, and it was pretty cool to see. but to be honest, the film could have been a little better, it could have much more conversations and stories than scenes from 15 to 20 minutes in which strange fights had just occurred. then in the last 5 or 10 minutes the film rose and recovered again, but ended unexpectedly. in my opinion, I thought it was a very long time. I know that it’s 13 minutes in 2 hours, and it’s still a long time for the cartoon, but since it was boring for most of the movie, it seemed like it was 4 hours !!!! but overall it's a good movie, I think, and I will watch it again on one of those “days without work”. I will see a new one, and I hope it is better!
