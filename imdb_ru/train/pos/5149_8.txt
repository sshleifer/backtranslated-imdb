This is a cool documentary drama that doesn’t touch on new themes, recycles all the clichés and is not true. For example, Munich is a very flat city. So why in the movie hilly terrain? For example, the end of the Great War in 1918 was not a surrender, but a truce. Yet it is declared as surrender. For example, European news providers did not shout (and did not) shout headlines, as they advertised their newspapers. Yet this strictly American custom is used in the film. For example, the Nazis did not adopt the German eagle until they came to power, but there he is in the department, when Hitler delivers one of his stalks. Indeed, much of this disappointing production consists of little more than Hitler's oratory. The film also perpetuates the myth that the beer putsch was hatched in the Munich Hoffbrauhaus. Did not have. Robert Carlisle draws his theme well. But his supporting cast is at best adequate and very often not even the same. These comments are based only on the first episode. One can only hope that the second will be better, but one should not count on it.
