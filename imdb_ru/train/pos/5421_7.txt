"Now in the sunny Indian region, where I spend time as a soldier in the service of Her Majesty the Queen ..." - this is the famous poem by Rudyard Kipling. This is the literal basis on which the Gung Dean film is based. If you are lucky to see this legendary Classic, you will love movies the way they do; for pure pleasure. Taken from the script of a famous novelist and poet, this is the story of a humble Indian native named Gung Dean (Sam Jaffe) who works as a “regimental monster” during the British occupation of India in the 18th century. His greatest desire is to become a soldier. The water boy is part of the contingent of the British Golgotha, who faces death as a result of the infamous Kali blood cult, called "The Bandit." In this company there are three soldiers, who are known for their courage and friendship. First, handsome and naughty, Cary Grant plays a sergeant. Archibald Cutter. The next is Victor McLaglen as a brave sergeant. McChesney and finally bright Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as a sergeant. Thomas Ballantyne. All three and their colleagues are surrounded by a treasure trove of mountain stranglers led by their fanatical leader named Guru (Eduardo Channelneli). Amid the chaos of war, a brave water boy who hopes to earn a place in the army by playing in the forge, which he found. Reliable history for an old black and white film that does not need fanfare for those who want to enjoy the classics. ****
