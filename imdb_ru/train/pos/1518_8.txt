THE HOUSE WHO HAS REDUCED THE BLOOD is the third in a series of seven antics of the horrors of Amicus. If MONSTER CLUB is included in the series, you get eight movies. Although this film is very different from others. <br /> <br /> I look at Amicus collections with wonderful memories, since I loved them when I was a teenager. My feelings for them today are just as strong. <br /> <br /> I spent many years trying to track down this film. The synopses of the stories were so attractive that I even paid a significant amount for them when I finally found a copy. No matter how good the film, I felt frustrated when I finally saw it. It was not as good as it seemed to me. Although he is better than his two predecessors, he is nowhere near as good as his four successors, as I will demonstrate. <br /> <br /> In a connecting story, John Bennett sees a police inspector stalking a missing person who lives in a mysterious old age. House. His journey begins at the local police station, where he learns the stories of previous residents. A related story later sees him visiting a real estate agent who sold the house. Although this binding story seems tempting on paper, in practice it is flat and lifeless and is easily the weakest of all Amicus anthologies. I could not help but feel that John Bennett is the version of Donald Pleasant for the poor or Ian Hendry. I would prefer to see one of the two above-mentioned actors in his role. We could even have both here, one as a police inspector and the other as a real estate agent. They could, and I suppose, could revive this weak element of the film. <br /> <br /> The film contains four stories, each dedicated to a resident of the house. <br /> <br /> The first story views Denholm the Elliot as the author of crime stories. He was fascinated by the exciting story about the strangler, he even went so far as to draw a sketch to help him write. Soon he begins to see the visions of his own creation. Some excellent leadership of Peter Duffella, especially with the choice of angles, helps to divert attention from the low-key scenario. Elliott's performance is superb as an agonizing writer, and he also helps bring up the story. The story ends with a slight twist, but I could not help but understand the meaning of the script, which did not allow him to realize his potential. <br /> <br /> In the second story, Peter Cushing moves into a residential building. He is a lonely man who still longs for a beautiful young woman who once attacked him and whom he keeps in himself. Cushing's performance really enlivens this emotionally exciting story. He is assisted by a director who decides to constantly pay attention to Cushing's loneliness. This happens with a large hallucination scene that helps us see in Cushing's mind. One way or another, Cushing sees a figure in a nearby wax museum that looks like his girlfriend. Naturally, his obsession is growing, but this seemingly romantic story has an alarming twist at the end. Joss Ackland plays rival Cushing, but his performance is largely overshadowed by the late great Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> The third story, and undoubtedly the best that Christopher Lee sees - my favorite horror actor of all time - enters the house with his daughter. Mr. Lee gives his beautiful ice speeches here. He does not show love or attention to his daughter at all. He even led a school governess to teach her. The governess, played by Nairi Dawn Porter in another gorgeous performance, is trying to figure out what is wrong. Without giving away too much, I can show that witchcraft plays a role. The presence of Christopher Lee truly excites every scene he is in. Chloe Franks deserves special recognition for her underrated performance in the role of a little girl, who is undoubtedly the creepiest character in the entire film. The film is worth seeing even in order to see only this one story. <br /> <br /> The final story is played out almost entirely for laughter, but it definitely entertains, and that's what's important. John Pertwee plays an actor from a horror movie who moves into a house. He is very unhappy with the approach of his producers to the cinema, seeing in it everything cheap and fake, especially costumes. Therefore, he decides to buy a real cape for his last vampire role. Jeffrey Baldon has a great cameo as a dealer who sells Pertwee an ancient cloak. When Pertwee wears a cloak, he begins to develop fangs and basically turns into a vampire. Pertwee performance needs to be seen to be believed. This is really fun. Ingrid Pitt is also involved in this story, but her talent is wasted on a role that should have been much larger. <br /> <br /> The linking story ends with a weak link to the final story. This is particularly appropriate, since the inspector was looking for Pertwee and, of course, decides to visit the house. The rest you can work for yourself. No matter how weak the connecting story is, it does have a decent, albeit somewhat unintentionally comical ending. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m convinced that the flaws in what was supposed to be a really great movie does not lie with Peter Duffell, the director who really does his best with what he has. I think the script was too low-key and lacked ambition, which can be found in four later films. <br /> <br /> In general, THE HOUSE THAT HAS BROUGHTED WITH BLOOD, despite its shortcomings, which must be seen by Amicus Anthology fans, fans of other Amicus films or horror films fans portmanteau. If my resume gives the film enough appeal in your eyes, watch it. You'll like it!
