If I watch a movie and never look at my watch or watch to see how long it will work, or when I hope that the last scene was not the end of the movie, it should be pretty good. I am not a cinematographer or a cinematographer. I watch movies, and if they don’t give me interest, they’re pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films tire me to death (“The English Patient”, “Shakespeare in Love”, “The Atonement”, “The Accident” the beginning ends.
