One evening I came home late at night and turned on the TV to see how Siskel and Ebert sum up their week. I haven't heard anything about Red Rock West, except for two thumbs and I see him before he left. He will not stay in cinemas for a very long time due to problems with the distributorâ€™s money and the lack of advertising, but they said it deserves better. <br /> <br /> The next day I followed their advice. They were right, it was one of the funniest movie events. As some readers point out, there are several holes in the plot, and the last 10 minutes never end. But it is worth it, for the fine crafts that went in the first hour. This is the best role I've ever seen for Nicolas Cage, but almost everyone seems to have played well. Dennis Hopper goes almost to the top, which becomes stupid, but emphasizes how well everything else works. The sets and music make a great contribution to almost every scene. <br /> <br /> When I later rented it for my family, it did not work. The long scenes that created the tension in the theater were difficult to gauge, with distractions at home. It deserves your full attention; turn off the phone, make sure that you are not disturbed, watch and listen to every scene, especially at the beginning.
