One evening, I filmed the second half of this movie on cable and was amazed at how painful it was. Even when one of the two victims is in the most disfigured state, the camera continues to work. the lingering shots of his corpse were uncovered, and his figure from the concentration camp was buttoned in a bag with the body and moved, and oppressed do not watch this film if you are already depressed. then again do not look if your state of health is really good.
