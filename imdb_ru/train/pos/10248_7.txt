I first heard about this movie after buying the 1976 Snuff film. I was told that Devil's Experiment was much better, so naturally, I went further and ordered the Guinea Pig box set. I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen came out trying to ban either this film or the second one, so my interest peaked. <br /> <br /> Devil's Experiment is a short film without a story, without character development. , Only 3 men torture a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture her in various ways, for example, beat her, twist her again and again in circles, then force her to drink alcohol, force her to listen to a loud noise for 24 hours, break her hand with a hammer, burn and put on larva burns ultimately pushing a sharp needle into her eyes. <br /> <br /> I have to say that many of these films were fake, like beating scenes. But then, some of this was actually well done, how difficult it was. The scenes in which the woman was spinning in circles made me dizzy when I watched. Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to a sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think. The worst is the eye scene. I never looked down when I watched it, but I just thought: “Damn, this looks good for such a low-budget film.” I really liked the movie, but I don’t know if I can really recommend it if you haven’t seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 7/10
