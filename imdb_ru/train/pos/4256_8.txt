Such a delightful movie! Very warm heart. It is impossible not to fall in love with the character of Gigi. He is charming in childhood and becomes a sensitive artist. The whole film revolves around it. Does he live in a wonderful world ?? live all my life ?? curiosity, desire and expectation. There is an older brother who tries to steal his glory, but really remains in the shadow of his whole life. Father is very stereotypically Italian, like mother. I wanted my father to come and reunite with his mother in the last scene ?? and let them cry and laugh. I would also like to have something expiatory in the big brother. It seems his identity is completely destroyed. Passion and ardor ?? this is the key to life. And looking at the camera ?? focusing on the fine details and enjoying the subtle details of life.
