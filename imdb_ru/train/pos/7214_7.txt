The death trap of Ira Levin is one of those mysterious films in the tradition of Essence, which would be very easy to spoil with any real exploration of the plot of the film. Therefore, I will be brief in saying that this concerns a play, one person who is a famous mysterious playwright, another person who is a promising writer, the playwright's wife who is much younger and sexier than the role should have been, and one German psychic. for a ride. Directed by Sydie Lumet, not foreign to the film, is pretty good for the most part in creating the tension in which the film is moving. The dialogue is quick, fresh and witty. Michael Caine stands out in such roles. Christopher Reeve is serviceable and actually grows on you, the more you see his actions. Irene Worth stands out as a funny psychic. What about Dayan Cannon? I love the way Lumet packed her back into these real tight pants and wore her, perhaps, the thickest tops around, but she is terribly mistaken in this role - the role that the older actress should have been given, and, of course, less seductive. But why scold with an obvious attempt to bribe the male audience, if now nothing changes? Deadly trap funny, sophisticated, witty and stylish. There are some obvious flaws in the mystery that diminish somewhat, and I was not completely satisfied with the final, but watching Kane and Riva under Lumet with Levinâ€™s verbiage was enough to capture my interest and keep him captive throughout the film.
