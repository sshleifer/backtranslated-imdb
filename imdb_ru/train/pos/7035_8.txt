Cusack tries his best David Niven in this, although I don’t know if anyone except me noticed this. <br /> <br /> If you look at it wisely, it’s a delightfully oversaturated “wants to be taken more seriously” than Austin’s forces, but still be a pretty funny reworking of the underrated comedy classics. <br /> <br /> Hillary Duff performs a version of Mata Bond with a British spear dancing on his knees. Script writers have built in the plot a small reverse turn of Oedipus - an interesting choice. <br /> <br /> I never knew how calm Montel's voice was, before this film ... I think he found a new vocation by making voice cadres of the navigation system. !
