well, I said all this in the resume, I just adore the film and the actors ... I would give every actor an Oscar ... a great, great film ... I'm 25 now, and I watched it 4 times at different periods, and I always think that I will not cry, and I always cry, about 2 or 3 times ...;) Meryl with. was absolutely gorgeous, Jeremy Irons also ... just gorgeous ... I want the film to receive more awards ... I really don't know anyone who watched it and didn't like it ... also, Glenn Close was fantastic. ... the story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... I liked the fact that despite everything, Clara and Esteban loved each other so much, and how Blanca was close to her parents ...
