Always enjoy the great game of Drew Barrymore and her great game in this film, where she plays a very difficult young girl (Holly Gooding), “Skipped Parts”, 2000, who leaves New York and travels to California and lives in the same apartment as a budding writer , George Newburn, (Patrick Highsmith), "Far Harbor", '96. Many strange things start to happen to Holly, and she tries to find her brother in a mental hospital after he killed her father. If you look close enough, you will see that Drew Barrymore's mother in real life looks like her mother in this photo. If it wasn't for the good play of Drew Barrymore and George Newburn, this film should only be shown on Halloween night! However, this, of course, has its surprises at the end !!!!
