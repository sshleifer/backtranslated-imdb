Cat soup at first glance seems like a very random animated film. The best way I could explain this is that it is rather sour. Although it is not entirely coincidental. The story of Nyatta, a young cat and his sister Nyaako. Nyako is very sick and dies, however, Nyatta sees death take her soul, and is able to take half of it. The story of their desire to fully revitalize Nyaako. <br /> <br /> Although most of the content in this film seems completely random, it is not. Basically it is a symbol of life, death and rebirth. You can also see links from other tales such as Hansel and Gretal. This strangely sweet short film has an interesting story, filled with a deeper meaning than what you see on the surface of the screen.
