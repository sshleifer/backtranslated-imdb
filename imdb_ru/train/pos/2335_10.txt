That's what tv. should be. And Pushing Daisies meets these expectations. The beautifully crafted and well-thought-out Pushing Daisies show is one of the few prime-time shows that has integrity, is useful for the whole family and awakens your imagination. It's not about normal action, sex, money, or the killing angles of any other show on television. This is a show that makes you think and laugh, but although the main plot may seem impossible, these concepts are real for all of us. Wanting something that you cannot have, hoping that someone wants us to run away from your past and look for a family, even in the most unexpected places, etc. D. <br /> <br /> I understand that ABC has basically canceled this wonderful show at the moment, and will most likely replace it with some kind of show beyond integrity. I believe that everything returns to money ... It is a pity that there are no other shows on ABC that would make you feel good after watching.
