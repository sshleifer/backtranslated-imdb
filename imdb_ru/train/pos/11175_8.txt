So often with the adaptations of Stephen King, you just get a collection of characters reading dialogs from books. It really captures the heart of the book. Maybe because they do NOT use large chunks of text directly from the book, but this is a bit more than improvisation of events in history. Much of his success is Miko Hughes as the kid Gage. Dale Midkiff and Denise "Tasha Yar" Crosby really behave like his parents. There is a scene where Louis hugs Gage, and they are very natural together. Fred Gwynn is wonderful. He perfectly nails the Maine accent, without falling into a parody, and is wise and warm, as Jude should be. (8 out of 10)
