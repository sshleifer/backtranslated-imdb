“The Invisible Ray” is a great demonstration of the acting talents of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Charles removes impeccable work as a gloomy and controversial scientist who seems to put his scientific achievements above his relations with others, even with his wife. His already lonely person becomes unbearable because he becomes paranoid. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays an unsurpassed professional who is passionate about his work, but still finds time to maintain good relations with everyone, but still seems to have no real close friends. It was one of his few roles as a good guy, and he plays her very well. It is difficult, however, to hear his accent and to believe that he is French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the film was that it was all based on “junk science”, but, in a sense, even unnecessary science makes it work well. Since the ideas and theories are absolutely idiotic, they are just as “relevant” today as at the time of the film. And they also strive forward - and always will be. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing movie that can be watched over and over. I saw it maybe 5 times this weekend, and I could easily go through it five more times. The game is beautiful, but science is fun. I highly recommend it.
