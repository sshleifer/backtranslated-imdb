So, the neighbor killed the neighbor. Reminds me of Iraq. Watching the American flag being dragged behind a horse (50 stars in 1864?), I understood why burning this piece of red, white and blue colors does not upset me as much as our destruction / indifference to the Bill of Rights. I am a southerner, and I must have a historical memory. <br /> <br /> Watching how the character Toby McGuire learns to respect the dignity of a former slave by looking at the scalps of blacks and Germans (his ethnic background). ) playing poker ..... was interesting. A lot of turns in this film. A wife forced into marriage demonstrates both lust and strong will, characteristic features that we are not used to seeing in “respectable Victorian southern beauties”. <br /> <br /> A crazy southerner-renegade gave me some insight into why my cousin, the head of the horse-thief gang Copeland, Inc. in Mississippi, was hanged at the time. Groups of homeless people roamed the village, armed. Remind you of Iraq? And how similar are we under the facade of religion and ethnicity? And why are southerners still fighting today in this civil war. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that we cannot use this knowledge in our work with the country that we have just occupied and occupy, stirring up civil war everywhere. This is Mesopotamia, now called Iraq, which has the misfortune of sitting on oil. Wild-eyed assassins in Missouri who raided Lawrence, Kansas, might as well have been rebels we are now fighting with, but without success. <br /> <br /> Another anomaly was a tribute to the father of the Yankees, who moved to Lawrence and erected a school "before they build a church. And for this reason they will win." Yes ????? I was taught stories in Birmingham, Al, and we were taught that the North was much more industrialized and richer ... that's why they won. Of course, they also literally had God on their side. As you see here, when a freed slave indicates that he is about to free his mother, sold into slavery in Texas. God, what a terrible heritage-slavery has given us. <br /> <br /> Acting quite well, a lot of blood and blood when warriors joyfully enter the battle (but did not hear the cries of the rebels, so reminiscent of football games in Alabama). You also get a real sense of how stupid the war was, as bushwaks and pans gather their strength for the next raid. They lost sight of why they fight, and so do we. Just another meaningless slaughter. <br /> <br /> You were also aware of how homeless children are returning home from Iraq, as the gangster (aah, what's the connotation) first closes his hand, trying to save her, then he is amputated and then dies. So much suffering for such a stupid reason. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is fantastic. Now I need to go back to the DVD and get the production notes, one of my favorite parts of any movie. I suspect that this film was written by Gore Vidal, since the spoken language is of the type you would associate with that era if you knew the story. The dialogue definitely makes you wonder. In any case, not an ordinary film about war and blood. You see the wounded, but still active, soldiers still fighting, because they have nothing else to do. You see southern raiders living outside the land stealing indiscriminately. However, in the beginning you saw that the battle stopped, therefore women could be evacuated from danger. When I read the growing number of women and children dying in Iraq, I think: “Where did we lose our sense of honor as a people?” I forgot why I was looking for this film and bought it 20 years later, but some books praised it somewhere . For good reason. Toby at his best, pre-Spideyman. Buy a DVD or rent it. And tell me why others praise it, and not just the liberals who attack me.
