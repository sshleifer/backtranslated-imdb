I bought this game on eBay, having learned that it is similar to Elite. The gameplay is really very similar and very addictive. As soon as I played it a couple of times, I immediately went back to eBay and bought copies for all of my children, so that they too could join in the fun .... I played the game through, and the storyline makes it feel like you are actually at the movies, this is great. If you have problems with research due to the limited nature of the plot in a single-player game, just install the Freelancer server on your PC (this is easy to do and the software is included) and play as you please. There are still a huge number of Freelancer servers on the Internet, so multiplayer games are not a problem and are not threatening, because you don’t often mean other players if you don’t want to. So, get a copy of this game, study it, play a single-player campaign, and then establish an online presence and enjoy. The depth of this game is staggering, with huge systems to investigate and find ruins, as well as many other discoveries - hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is almost endless. A fantastic game and more so that you can get it for a couple of pounds on eBay. Get one with a complete written manual, if you can (blue box, not red Xplosiv box), it loads better!
