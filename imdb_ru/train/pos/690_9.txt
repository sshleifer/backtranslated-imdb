I had no idea what this film was about, and I didn’t even know that it existed until about 1 month ago, when I came across when I was looking for other films that Dominic Monaghan was in. I thought that this film was a strange understanding of who was awake, and what his / her mind could survive in the hours they spend without sleeping when the rest of the world is sleeping around them, it was an interesting film and Home played a good role. ....... I think that although you can’t buy this film anywhere (well, I haven’t seen it anywhere), you should see it if you ever get a chance, because it really makes you Think of those people who surround us, who cannot sleep and have to suffer night after night because they cannot sleep or sleep in all about 1 o'clock every night, so overall it was an interesting film with good content.
