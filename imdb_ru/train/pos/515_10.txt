I remember seeing this film for the first time - I was working in the office at the weekend, and the TV turned on the background noise. But gradually I became more and more interested in this film, which I had never seen or heard until I was completely absorbed. Matter of Life & Death (British name - “Stairway to Heaven in the USA”) is a delightful, irresistible, quaint and touching, all in one beautifully written, well-functioning, perfectly directed package. This is a classic that really ranks with Casablanca, “This is a wonderful life, Gone with the Wind”, “Citizen Kane” and “Chariots of Fire”. WHY he never received the same public notice and fame in the video store? Fortunately, SOME knowledgeable critics have included him in their lists of the "100 best for all time." There is hope - Fantasy of the 1940s was not a hit until the 60s, and “The Wizard of Oz” was a loser at the box office, but made a hit on television. Buy it - rent it - watch it - demand it! You will not be disappointed!
