Although he is not as famous as some of their other colleagues (for example, “Black Cat” and “Body Thief”), he is an elegant little horror film, although the casting decisions were a bit strange. Boris Karloff plays Dr. János Rukh, a strange scientist who lives in the Carpathians, not far from Dracula’s character’s hometown. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Beneta - whose nationality has never been discussed, although the name certainly sounds French. I really think it would make sense to have two interchangeable roles, since the Carpathian role seems specially made for Lugosi - especially with his accent. However, despite this unusual twist, these two still did an excellent job. Karlova, of course, was the main role, but Lugosi justified himself as a relatively normal person - that he did not often play in films !! It seems that Dr. Ruch is in a way a pariah, since other scientists (especially Benet) consider his theories strange and meaningless. However, during the film, Ruch turns out to be right, and Benet is especially generous in his new praise for Ruch. But, unfortunately, the amazing new element that Rukh discovered has an unpleasant side effect of turning it into a crazy killing machine (don't you hate when this happens?). While it could be just a good good scientist who turned the insane story, the plot was well constructed, the characters are well developed, and the insane Rukh was NOT a one-dimensional killer, but complex and interesting. <br /> <br /> This film is sure to please everyone except people who hate old horror films. You can really say that Universal Pictures did everything possible and made a budget film instead of cheap jokes, both Lugosi and Karloff, unfortunately, in recent years. A good thing.
