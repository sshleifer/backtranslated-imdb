Probably the best picture manufacturers have ever made, producing Corp, this little piece of horror draws attention from first to last. Director Frank Wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one, and, more importantly, he knows how to fully realize her potential for shock on the screen. Not only does the plot involve the characters fascinatingly drawn, but the setting is absolutely out of this world! Almost all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a clinging, spreading fog. This chilling atmosphere is complemented by the inventive direction of Wisbar and the completely convincing performances that he gathered from all his players. Beautiful Rosemary La Planche makes an ideal heroine, beautiful, energetic, but vulnerable. Robert Barrath presents his usual, no-nonsense, straight-line portrait of a local big wig, although it is hard to believe that the personable, handsome guy playing his son is none other than the later writer / director of Doolsville Blake Edwards.
