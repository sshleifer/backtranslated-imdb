One of those beautiful films that so deeply draw us in, it will end soon! Then they looked at the screen like “No, they did not!”, Laughs. Good performances around! Emily Blunt's game is simply amazing! I knew that she would give a solid, convincing performance that captures Victoria’s youth, her character and vulnerability throughout the film. In addition, the products are outstanding in all respects: style, content and sensitivity. An amazing look at a remarkable time in the history of Britain, told through a very personal and touching biography of a princess of school age before her reign in the queen, later marrying Prince Albert, which resulted in the birth of their first of nine children. He had a well-written script and flawless editing. Rupert Friend as a very patient and compassionate young prince Albert, eager to attract the attention of the young queen than won her love, before Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) was fascinated by observation. The relationship between the teenager Victoria and her mother, who was at times furious, as with her mother and King William (who also did not like her mother), was just as exciting. The performances and scenes were exciting, very emotional. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the historical and political situation that existed in that era, and to those who love an exciting, truthful romantic story.
