DOCTEUR PETIOT starring Michel Cerro is a cruel story about a cruel man. A doctor who treats patients in occupied France, even if their ability to compensate is not the case. However, he hunts the weakest among the population. Images and cinematography are excellent, and give an extra eerie feeling to this complex story. He is the perfect psychopath. Seductive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, calculating and deadly. The film probably will not soon be forgotten by the viewer. Kudos to Mr. Cerro, for his frightening image.
