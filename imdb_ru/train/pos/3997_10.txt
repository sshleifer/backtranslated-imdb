What a touching movie. I have a dear friend who is over sixty, and in the past 15 years she told me that people no longer see her, and she longs for communication. When I am over forty, I begin to understand what she was complaining about. You are no longer young, beautiful, or tangible. When May says "... this piece of body ..." wow. How our bodies change and how we are told is no longer beautiful. I love it when she starts to change what she is wearing ... a colorful scarf ... no longer a wild wife. <br /> <br /> This is both a sad and wonderful picture. It's sad that May betrays the trust of her daughter ... the beautiful thing is that she is experiencing the difficulties of this business, and wants to go on and finally have a life of her own. I like it when a character dares to even start a love affair. <br /> <br /> I mainly love the film because, finally, this is a picture that shows the complex nature of the relationship, whether they are family or not. We see Paula's vulnerability, but she will have what she wants at any cost ... (when she tells her mother that she will have a child for Darren, whether she wants one or not after her mother asks if she wants Darren baby). The film shows how relationships can change, and at the same time reveals what was there all the time, inactive. Mei suppressed her creativity to create a family. A family in which she really did not want, but was "something that you just did when she was small." I like the scene when Darren calls her old cake, and she smiles and says: "I have never been called that before." It was a real gem of the film. <br /> <br /> And Daniel Craig. Well, I just love him. I was pleasantly surprised. He is not only pleasant in his eyes, he is a real talent. What an elegant role. He is much more than any 007, and I look forward to his appearance in other posts of this kind. The scene where he pleases May, and the look that he looks at her, looks like a surprise that he controls this woman so much, as well as the pleasure of being able to give her that. He really likes to give her pleasure. Wonderful scene. Contrast is a love scene with Bruce. Bruce is completely absorbed in his own pleasure ... by two completely different men. <br /> <br /> Alas ... I wonder where my Darren is?
