As in Amelie, the latest French films seem to demonstrate stereotypical relationships between a man and a woman, focused on finding a womanâ€™s only true love. In this case, despair leads to a convict, which leads to its transformation into a prototype mafia. A clever and amazing story in many ways, except that a woman must support a man. <br /> <br /> For those of us who do not speak French, the subtitles are a little fast, but not without meaning. br /> <br /> The soundtrack, as more and more often found in European films, is magnificent and perfectly synchronized with the variations of the film. Nothing seems forced. Visually, it reminds me of various urban horror films. In Chicago, felt Wes Craven.
