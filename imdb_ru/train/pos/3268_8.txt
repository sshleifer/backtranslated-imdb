Charming romantic comedy. The plot is a bit complicated - I tried to summarize it three times, but I can't. Suffice to say it is worth seeing. The film is funny, beautiful - the plot is completely unreal, but it works. Everything in the film is so cute, and everything looks so cool - it creates a pleasant, romantic feeling throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Great game - Robert Downey Jr. and Sibill Shepard are in great shape and enjoy every second. Ryan O'Neill and Mary Stuart Masterson are fine, but fine. If you like good, cute sentimental films (like me), catch this one. Also, Downey looks great in underwear! <br /> <br /> Additional bonuses - the title song performed by Johnny Mathis and another great song “After all” performed by Cher and Peter Cheter.
