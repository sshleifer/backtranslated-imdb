If you are a T-Rex / Marc Bolan fan, I recommend you check it out. This shows the bizarre side of Marc Bolan, as well as Ringo Starr, who apparently does some good shots of some scenes that are not part of the concert, but interesting to watch, leaving you with the feeling of getting to know them as simple people, and when the concert shows a talented musician playful and professional, this is awesome and seems to impress flashy girls. Watching him at a concert, you would never know that being a rock star is a job, but just having a great time playing some good songs with good friends such as Elton John and Ringo Starr, performing in some live shows. True, I miss a few songs that I would like to see there, but, like any album, there can not be everything in it. I bought it in 2006, but if I knew that it was released in 1972, I would definitely buy it many years ago. It is sad and strange that a person with so many songs about his love for cars will never learn how to drive a car and die in a car accident!
