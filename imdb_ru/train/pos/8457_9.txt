Gundam Wing for me is a good anime. A little slow movement (especially in the middle of the series), but generally pleasant. Now, before someone jumps into my case and calls me a "winger", I admit that I looked at all the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, The 08th MS Team and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> I admit that there were several problems with storytelling, and some characters may seem like “springboards” (for example, Zechs Marquise for Gundam’s original character Char), but this is an alternate universe show based like seed. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this series, make sure that you first watch the original Gundam, and then know that you are watching the AU series.
