After hearing very positive reviews and seeing the trailer, I had to watch this movie. With William H. Macy, Louis Guzman, Michael Jeter, and Sam Rockwell, everything should be fine. And it is delivered. In general, the film is not funny, but there is one scene that really stands out and, in my opinion, a classic. SPOILER In the end, when they break through the wall to get to the safe, and we see Rockwell and Washington looking at Jeter, this is just fantastic. This is as good as a scene in Greater Lebowski, where the Dude uses a chair to barricade his door, but forgets that the door is turning out! END SPOILER Just watch this movie, you won't be disappointed.
