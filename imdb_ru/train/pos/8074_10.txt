Hypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as poor as everyone on Earth. Living in Ireland in the 1920s, Hypo and his fellow Irish are part of an underground uprising against the oppressive British. One particular rebel, whom the British are looking for murder, is secretly returning to the city. He thinks he can trust his friend Hypo, but the reward of 20 pounds is too tempting. Hypo kills his friend and plunges into a pit of despair and drunkenness. Meanwhile, other Irish rebels are looking for an informant. Immediately, Hypo, who has a hole in his money in his pocket, is their main suspect, but his friends do not want to believe it. The story of Informer is simple in plot, but complex in moral and emotional matters. This is easily one of the most emotional films of John Ford. What Gypo did was wrong, but we can certainly understand its motives. We also understand his sad nature, and he has many sympathies. The script is also very stressful. This is a kind of wait, when we are almost sure that we know how it will end, so we need to bite the bullet and endure them. The game is wonderful. Viktor McLaglen, who has played in many Ford films, probably showed his best results here (and won an Oscar for that). Any other performer in the film deserves his or her praise. In addition to the amazing scenario and action, Informer is one of the most expressive films of John Ford. I love the darker side of Ford. In its mood, as well as on the themes, “Informer” reminds me of my two other favorite Ford films: “The Long Journey House” (1940) and “The Fugitive” (1948); in this respect, it is also a bit like the Grapes of Wrath (1940). 10/10
