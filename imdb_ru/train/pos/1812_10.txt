This is one of the greatest films ever, perhaps even the best. I forgot about the movie for about 12 years. Until I saw an advertisement on television for ADGTH, and this brought back pleasant memories of how I watched it when I was a small child. And when I watched it a few nights ago, I became addicted to the film. I usually don’t like animated family films, but this one is special, it’s the perfect family movie. <br /> <br /> The end of the film always touches my heart and makes me very sad, but this is what makes this film amazingly better than all the rubbish that comes out today for children's films. I mean, the film is rated on the G scale, and there are about 2 dogs in it that are associated with gambling; in the film there is a lot of smoking, drinking, killing, death and hell. What I believe makes the film from good to great. I mean, today's films do not bring reality to children, and in this film they did it. <br /> <br /> RIP Judith Barcy and House Deluxe
