When I think “Women in Prison” I often recall dirty Italian / Spanish productions of such directors as Jesse Franco and Bruno Mattei; and although these films are often very messy, they are also very similar, and as soon as you see them; You might also see them all. I have to admit that these types of films are not my favorites at all; but in reality the idea of ​​women behind bars was implemented several times outside of Italy and Spain; and Roger Corman's New World Pictures are responsible for some of the best of them. Caged Heat is Oscar-winning directorial debut Jonathan Demme, and it's a well-made little movie with lots of fun! Naturally, the film tells about a girl who was caught committing a crime and sent to a women's prison, where she was introduced to many violent prisoners. This prison is managed by Senior Inspector McQueen; and she is offended by a play staged by girls; forcing them to plan their escape. <br /> <br /> This film is much easier for meanness than I used to in films about women in prison; but this is more than compensated for by some wonderful scenes and dialogs, and this is what Caged Heat guarantees everywhere. It must be said that the plot is not particularly original or ambitious and basically follows a structure similar to many other women in prison films that were before it; but this is not such a big problem. The film never gets boring and is replete with outstanding scenes; including an escape attempt while working in the field and a bank robbery. This film is assisted by a confident guide from a man who will lead the masterpiece “The Silence of the Lambs” and a great cast with many outstanding personalities; including the best of all the legendary Barbara Steele as a prison warden. In general, Caged Heat may not give the viewer much to think about the end; but this is a brilliantly interesting little film about children, and anyone who likes this type of film will surely want to track it.
