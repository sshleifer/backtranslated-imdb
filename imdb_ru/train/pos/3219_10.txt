This is a great movie. It has a fascinating story, an amazing main character, a very good actor game and a killer. This occurs mainly in 2036, but shows scenes that occur in past years to explain the story. <br /> <br /> The story is very well made, and there are no holes in it. Kurt Russell is a soldier named Todd, who has been trained to kill since birth, and, like all other soldiers, has never lived a normal life. In the end, the military represents new, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. Jason Scott Lee was one of them. As a result, they do not need old soldiers, such as Todd. They test new soldiers, forcing them to fight some of the old soldiers, in a battle Russell is wounded and is considered dead. The military dumped his body, as well as several others, believing that they were all dead, but they did not understand that Russell was alive. <br /> <br /> Todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military has thrown him further. For some time he lives there, but he cannot adapt to normal life. He rarely speaks words and is sometimes very aggressive towards other people. When they feel he is a danger to them, they send him into the wilderness. <br /> <br /> As soon as Russell leaves the planet, he is attacked by new soldiers. The military forgot to train soldiers to be smart, like Todd and other old soldiers. Thus, while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd easily replays them. The military is beginning to understand this, and Todd kills all of his people except one. This is Jason Scott Lee, and at the end you see the classic battle scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell clearly comes out on top. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. This is all you could ask for in a movie, including some great lines. The author also did not forget that Russell had never seen a woman before, because he even calls women "sir." There are no holes in this film, every minute has a goal, and it is very interesting. <br /> <br /> A stunning one-person action movie for Rambo fans, Commandos and Missing In Action. This is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and action / fiction fans.
