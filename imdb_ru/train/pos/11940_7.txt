As a baseball player, this film goes against what I’m expecting in a sports movie: authentic looking sporting action, believable characters, and an original storyline. While “Angels in the outfield” fail miserably in the first category, in the last two this is fine. The Angels are intertwined with the story of Roger and J.P., two Anaheim foster children who love baseball, but are looking for a family with the Weghegon Angels franchise, struggling to attract fans and win games. Driven by his dead father's promise that they will become a family only when the Angels win the pennant, Roger asks for some heavenly help and receives it in the form of diamond-spirits prone to reversing the downward spiral of the franchise. And when the short-lived manager George Knox (pictured by Danny Glover) begins to believe in what Roger sees, the team suddenly has a hope of turning his season around - both Roger and JP. find what to believe. In particular, Glover gives a good performance, and Tony Danza, who plays the washed jug, also succeeds, despite the fact that he had a zero idea about how to get out of the warm-up!
