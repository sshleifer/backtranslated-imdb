With a simplistic story and an attractive heroine, it was the horror movie that started it all. John Carpenter brings a horrible Halloween nightmare to life when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis in her debut defining career) and her naughty friends plan a night of vile fun - only to cross paths with an inexorable psychopath from hell, <br /> < br /> Michael Myers escaped from a nearby insane refuge ... killing his sister fifteen years earlier, he now returned to Haddonfield, in the sleepy city of Illinois, where he was killed. As soon as he looks at Laurie after she throws the package into an abandoned house where he lived, he begins to stalk and terrorize her, turning her fun night into horror when he pushes anyone on his way to get to her. <br /> Beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this naughty horror movie scary ... with long dark frames it constantly feels as if you are being pursued by a manic serial killer himself. Myers is tucked away well, until fully revealed in a fascinating conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although “Halloween” is definitely outdated, it is no less frightening. The idea alone makes goosebumps, and this little shocker is one of the most famous and memorable horror films ever made to this day ... it spawned seven sequels and eventually an equally scary remake of Rob Zombie, and he set The new standard for horror is still there today.
