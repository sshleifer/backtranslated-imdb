The best martial arts film. This film is better than Bruce Lee ever did. Classic with a very interesting and brutal climax. Jackie Chan - the king of martial arts films and the real king of kung fu. It is unfortunate that although Bruce Lee was so overrated, it took Jackie Chan an eternity to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie rules !!!!
