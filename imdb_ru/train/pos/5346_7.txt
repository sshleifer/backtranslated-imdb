Carol, a young girl in the middle of the story, moves to a foreign country, Spain, at the height of the civil war in the late 30s. For this girl everything is new, in her strangeness. War and her father are her constant concerns, while she has to immerse herself in the provincial culture, which lags behind what she has in New York. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe directs this film by numbers. Carol's family is clearly divided, while Carol's mother is married to someone who is an air force pilot with a left faction, the rest of the familyâ€™s sympathy is with Franco and the fascists who won the conflict. <br /> <br /> History adds nothing to what has already been said, much better, but watching a movie is easy. The magnificent landscape of northern Spain is revealed. Don't expect a lot of action, because most of what is happening revolves around Carol and the young guys she made friends with. <br /> <br /> Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence. Maria Barranko is the mother of Carol Aurora, who left for America. Rosa Maria Sarda - Maruya, a teacher who is friends with Carol. Carmelo Gomez plays Alfonso, the man Aurora left when she left for America. This actor, who usually stars in most Spanish films, has nothing in common, as he remains a mystery throughout the film.
