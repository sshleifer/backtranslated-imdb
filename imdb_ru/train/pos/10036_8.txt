The Titanic is a long but well-made tragic adventure love story that occurs during an ill-fated voyage on an unsinkable ship. Writer / director James Cameron did a great job creating this film about the fictional love story of two very different people and combined it with the real Titanic event that sank after an iceberg hit on April 15, 1912, killing thousands of people who died in the icy waters of the North Atlantic. The two main roles in the film are great in their roles, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good couple on the screen. DiKpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry that made romance, which ultimately flourishes between them, much more believable. They both showed real talent when this one came out, and both continued to show the same thing in their latest films. The rest of the supporting actors, including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Francis Fisher, Jonathan Hyde and Bill Paxton in a small role, are equally impressive, as their characters help bring them to life in this film. A love story, action, suspense and special effects are superbly made especially for this time. The horror of the situation in which the characters found themselves seemed so real because it really happened, causing you to want most of them to survive in this life and death situation. From time to time it was a little slow and a little long, but the rest of the film made up for its shortcomings. Titanic makes an excellent dating movie that will surely make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that it really happened definitely added to the film, making you regret all the lives lost when Titanic plunged into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. In general, “Titanic” is a tragic heart-rending story about two people who fall in love with the ill-fated ship, revived thanks to the exceptional performances of the actors, especially DiCaprio and Winslet, who definitely make this film worthy of time to watch.
