“Fido” is a nice comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially given the shit that should entertain us these days. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, this is hardly a real film about zombies, but rather a sweet satire that uses undead to point the finger. While there are sure to be some bloody scenes, almost no blood and the way in which this film is presented (50s style), I can’t imagine that someone was actually scared or was turned off by Fido and his fellow sufferers . <Br /> <br /> Although the cast is generally good, I felt that Moss and Nelson stand out. The humor is not in your face, but rather suppressed; there is a lot of attention to detail, and I caught myself smiling a little during the movie. This, of course, is not a masterpiece of cinema, but he does not seek - instead, Kerry manages to create a soulful black comedy.
