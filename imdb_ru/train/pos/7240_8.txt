When I found this film in my local video store, I expected it to be another funny American vampire film in the same vein as Lost Boys (1987). To my surprise, “Die for” is a really good movie. This is a little banal at times, but there are still quite stylish decorations and surprises to satisfy the vampire enthusiasts. It is the perfect combination of romance and horror, and sometimes it is surprisingly awful. Highly recommended.
