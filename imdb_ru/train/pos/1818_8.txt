I saw this film when I was about 8 years old, and I liked it, but only when I watched it at the age of 13 did I really understand it for what it is; a cartoon about a criminal dog with a real golden heart "adopts" a little girl to use for her talents in communicating with animals. The star of a dog, Charlie B. Barkin, is killed by his formal business partner, Carface (by the way, absolutely diabolical). Then his soul goes somewhere else besides heaven, only to find the golden watch, which is indeed the time of his life, and Charlie, being a cunning but attractive rogue, whom he steals and rewinds, sends him back to Earth. Returning to Earth, Charlie is trying to take revenge on the evil Curry. This is how he encounters young Anne-Marie, a lonely little orphan who can talk to animals that Charlie plans to deceive for her talents in order to take revenge on his enemy Carrill. But wicked Charlie actually comes to take care of young Anne-Marie, and his plans fail, because he must decide what to do immediately after Anne-Marie learns that her “best friend” Charlie really used to make money for a new and better casino for dogs. Now he must save her from the terrible Carriff. I still love this movie even at 22 years old. The idea and plot is really very different from the original animated films. I especially like the idea that the dog plays the role of a villain this time. Carface was even better than he was in the sequel to All Dogs to Heaven. In this picture, he seemed very doubtful for his role as a villain.
