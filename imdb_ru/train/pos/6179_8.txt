It’s nice to see that Vintage Film Buff properly classified their magnificent DVD release as a “musical” because this movie is clean and simple. Like his unofficial remake, Murder in the Mill (1949), the plot of the murder is just an excuse for the carefully thought-out show of girls with Kitty Carlile and Gertrude Michael, the leading cast of super-decorative girls, including Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace Gwennillian Jill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritsch, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Karl Brisson is also on hand to give his strong voice "Cocktails for Two." Undoubtedly, the most popular song of the film, it sounds at least four times. However, it is Gertrude Michael who steals the show not only because of her performance "Sweet Marijauna", but also because of her strong role as a rejected hero girl. As for the rest of the cast, we could do without Jack Okey and Victor McLaglen as a whole. The only good thing about Oka is his weak gag with cult icon Toby Wing. In fact, to give you an idea of ​​how overwhelmed and overwhelmed the rest of the comedy is, the super-blunt inspector McAglaine simply can't lay hands on the killer, even if you believe, in this case it happens, the person you most suspect. Director Mitch Leisen really tries his best to point out the killer even to the dumbest viewer in the movie, giving the interested player close-ups for close-ups.
