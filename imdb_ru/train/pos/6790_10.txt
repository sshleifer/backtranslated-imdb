This game is one of the best RPG. Fist, it's actually more fun than any other because of the combat system (you harm the enemy depending on how you aim the attack, you can turn into a dragoon, a special attack, magic ...). The script is very good. All characters are cute, and you donâ€™t have long dialogs to support, as was the case in several games in the Final Fintasy series. I'm tired of these dialogues about the past, when you just want to continue the story of the game. Ambientation is the jewel in this game, it combines the fantasy of middle age with futuristic science fiction. It is noteworthy that the animation effects are incredible, I like them more than in other modern games (we cannot remember that Legend of the Dragoon is already 8 years old). Then the map is huge, there are all sorts of places of enemies. Finally, Music is not the best muse of the game I have heard, but it is perfect for such a game.
