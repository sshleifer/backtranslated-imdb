From time to time a film appears that raises the bar for any other film in its genre. A film of this level will affect many films after its release over the years. The history of Chinese ghosts falls into this category. Perhaps this is one of the best horror films made in the 1980s; perhaps one of the best ever made. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have created a movie that will appeal to all horror fans. The story is exciting and original. Villains respectively threatening and frightening. The sets are creepy and atmospheric. There is even some blood and blood to satisfy a splash fan at home. But don't let the horror label scare you if you're not a fan of the genre. This film fits easily into many different categories. <br /> <br /> The screenwriter cleverly combined the genres of drama, comedy, horror, kung fu and romance into a delicious luxury cinematic pizza. "The story of Chinese ghosts" is a beautiful epic love story, told, fortunately, without excessive nudity and / or sexually explicit scenes that have destroyed many Hollywood "love stories." Those who are removed from the romantic elements of this story can relax and enjoy the stormy sword playing and wired fu. If this is not enough, the actors Leslie Cheung and Ma W create enough humorous situations to satisfy your appetite for comedy. This film offers something for every film fan. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Toon Ching and producer Tsui Hark put together a truly amazing cast for this film. Leslie Chung proves that he is not only a gifted actor, but also a talented singer and charming comedian. I can’t think of any other performer besides Cheng, who could portray Lin Choi Xing better (except maybe Chow Yun Fat). Joey Wang enchants as Lit Soo, seen enslaved by the spirit that steals the heart of the character Cheng. Her image of the title character is truly memorable and memorable. Ma is cheerful, like a poisonous Taoist who helps young lovers. <br /> <br /> At the technical level, this film is very impressive, even by today's standards. The direction is superb. I would like today's Hollywood executives to look for talented artists such as Siu-Tung Ching, and not just regular MTV videos or commercial "Pepsi directors." Cinematography is great. You have to praise any filmmaker who can make a movie look good when most of its main scenes occur in deep night. Makeup special effects first class. In fact, most of the creature effects in this film blow off the crap ghouls and CGI goblins that have become commonplace in modern horror films. <br /> <br /> Since its release, “The History of the Chinese Ghost” has given rise to two worthy. sequels, full-length animated film and countless imitations. None of the films that followed it or copied it were able to capture the magic of this classic, however. This film is necessary for watching any horror fan or anyone looking for a great way to spend 95 minutes of their time. 10 out of 10. <br /> <br />
