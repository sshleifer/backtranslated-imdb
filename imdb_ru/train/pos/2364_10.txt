I must confess that I did not read the original story of M. R. James, although I read many of his other supernatural stories. I also saw most of the previous BBC Christmas ghost stories, and this one, in my opinion, surpasses most of them, equaling only the signalman. <br /> <br /> I can't blame the view from the hill. - the direction and "mood" is ideal, as well as acting, lighting and, of course, history and writing. I thoroughly enjoyed it and can only hope for more of this quality from the same director and production team. I understand that the BBC is planning to do more (not necessarily based on the stories of M.R. James), so this is promising. <br /> <br /> 10/10
