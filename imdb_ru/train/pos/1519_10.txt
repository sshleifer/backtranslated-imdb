Considering how banal these films are, you have to understand that they must have had fun making them. The film tells about the house in which the one who lives there in a strange way lives. The inhabitants were: the author Charles Hillier (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), Who is haunted by one of his own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who comes too close to the wax statue; John Reed (Christopher Lee), whose pretty daughter appears to be the facade; and the actor Paul Henderson (John Pertwie), who is on the verge of plunging into the image. <br /> <br /> “The house from which blood was dripping,” is really worth seeing (well, yes, it starred Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). In addition to being careful, there may be some shades: this may call into question the problem of real horror versus supposed horror. As in Shining, we might ask if the house / hotel itself keeps track of past events. And if absolutely nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (as a colleague of Paul) is HOT HOT HOT! At about the same time that it came out, she also starred in the films "Countess Dracula" and "Vampire Lovers" (also with Peter Cushing). Maybe she, like Barbara Steele, will remain known only as the queen of screams, but remember my words: SHE IS A HOT QUEEN! I would like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele in one movie. <br /> <br /> I think the only strange scene (so to speak) is when Denholm Elliott is dressed in a pink shirt and a fluffy jacket. You read it right. What name is called Denholm anyway? Well. Very cool movie.
