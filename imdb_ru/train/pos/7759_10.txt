At first glance, “Written in the Wind” is a gloomy, glossy soap opera about sexual dysfunctions of a Texas oil family. But under all this is a deep social commentary on the life of the 1950s. Director Douglas Sirk scores again with another Univer Sudzer. Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that Stack's best friend, Rock Hudson, loves her too. When Stack finds out that he is sterile and Bacall becomes pregnant, the fireworks will fly. And too good Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for her portrait of the largest nympho Texans, which Hudson avoids. Good epic soap opera.
