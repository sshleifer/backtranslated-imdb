Listen, I don't care what anybody says, since Cypher is nothing more than a 5-star movie. Cypher is not, I repeat, not a film B. Cypher is an absolute masterpiece. Suffice it to say that I am an expert on the world's best spy movies, and this film is nothing but the best flight. I cannot overestimate how phenomenal this film is. Cypher is one of the best spy movies ever created and created. The technology in this film is beyond the horizon of space-time. In fact, I have to admit that Cypher completely surprised me. In fact, I recommended this film to my colleagues more than any other film. Other critics, some of whom underestimate the film, have no idea what the hell they are talking about. Do not listen to haters. And in fact, for the most part, the Cypher reviews were mostly positive. And it should be noted that Cyher is not only a good film, but also a fantastic film. “Cypher” is such an advanced and magnificent film, which was shot by most critics and all cynics. There is nothing bad or cheap in Cypher. Again, cinematography, backgrounds, technology, storyline and action are all 100% world-class. Naturally, I will not give anything. This is not a spoiler. And although some critics say that Cypher was supposed to be in cinemas, I think the opposite is true. Cypher is a film that seems to be just suitable for a DVD release, and not bad. Cypher should be the greatest underground spy ever to hit the shelves. Blade Runner, 1984, Brave New World, Remember Everything, Logan Run, Jason Bourne, The Pretender and Deja Wu ... look! Cypher equally deserves to get into the Hall of Fame movie stars 5 stars Eternal Spy. Cypher - counterintelligence at its best. Hands down and take off my hat. Nothing is what it seems, and truth is stranger than fiction. The future is today.
