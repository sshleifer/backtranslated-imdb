I watched this episode more often than any other episode of TFTC, it is so nice. And it's pretty scary, but all in good, disgusting fun. A woman kills her second husband, but faces a problem when the escaped maniac in tattered clothes of Santa Claus decides to visit her and her little girl at that very moment. Mary Traynor, whom I seem to remember from SNL or another television comedy series, is an evil wife, and Larry Drake plays a madman in a dirty Santa suit. I forgot that Santa has been playing with Drake for many years. His Santa is an irresistible force, and at times quite frightening. You can probably guess how Santa finally gets into the house. The episode plays out for a laugh, but sometimes it can be quite intense.
