This silent movie is better than average, and still worth seeing if you're a fan of silence. However, if you are not yet a fan of the genre, I suggest you try a few more films before watching this one. This is because the plot seems rather old-fashioned and hard to believe. But despite this, it is still a good film, and it interested me. <br /> <br /> A lovely woman, unfortunately, picked up the wrong man and ran off to marry him. The film begins five years after she realizes that he is a really cruel thief. Despite this, she tries to get the most out of it and not dwell on how good life was before this jerk entered her life. However, the rent is payable and there is no money, so the lady is forced to look for work. She becomes a personal seamstress for a rich woman whose husband is trying to make a business deal. Unfortunately, the lady with whom they were trying to associate a potential client for dinner cannot do this, and the seamstress pays nicely to be a man's date. Well, like Cinderella, she cleans pretty well, and the man is in love with her! What to do now - considering that she is actually married and the new boyfriend wants to marry her ?! Well, watch the movie yourself to see how everything is solved. I didn’t like the way they treated her husband, as it seemed terribly predictable and clichéd. However, as soon as he left the road, I admire the fact that the film also did not give up in the finals for the numbers and left the film with a few loose ends. <br /> <br /> a very good movie that is worth seeing, but certainly not a great one.
