YOUNG VICTORIA is an elegant, costumed and reproduced part of the story that benefits from some excellent conditions, clear instructions from Jean-Marc Vallee about the gallant version of a young girl Julian Fellows, who was to become England’s longest ruling monarch Victoria. Most of the early part of the film, the part where Victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is challenged by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong), seems to be pulling and being lost in numerous costumes and scenery variations. But when Victoria (Emily Blunt) comes of age and Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) takes care of her, the film flourishes. Blunt is a strong actress, and she finds a fine line between girlish passion and royal dignity, which makes her a great obstacle for those who are trying to control the “children's queen” at the court, including her secretary, Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). But as she becomes queen, her gaze stops on the dashing German prince Albert, and the love affair that lasts in the memories of all is combined with the concept of royal power and taking care of her subjects - largely due to the sensitivity of Albert . The film introduces us to the birth of their first of nine children, and then ends with some statements about the influence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on various royal families throughout Europe! This makes the evening a beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. Solid, if not transport epos. <br /> <br /> Grady Harp
