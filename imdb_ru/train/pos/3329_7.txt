The only reason I watched this movie was for Jimmy Fallon, whom I fell in love with in 9th grade, which was his first year in SNL. I'm a fan of the Yankees, and I donâ€™t find the film painful until the last 15 minutes, when they start to show clips from ALCS games. I had to close my ears and make small noises so that I would not have to hear what should not be heard, but otherwise it would be quite tolerable. <br /> <br /> I thought that Jimmy played this role very well, because the character had to be nervous and weird, and he was a nervous and weird guy. I know that this may not be an Oscar-winning, but the film is just a light, fun, romantic comedy that is really suitable for women and men. <br /> <br /> Jimmy and Drew worked well together, and they had a much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in this stupid film? What?) I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead, and thank God, because Taxi could have killed him. I think Fever Pitch will help him a lot. Everyone has to stop criticizing his acting skills like that, because he is just starting to act in films. I guess it must be difficult, and if you look at the other great actors of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.), you will see that they started with some failures. Busom Friends? Australian TV series? Here I wish Jimmy a successful career on the screen. I never wanted him to leave SNL, but what can you do?
