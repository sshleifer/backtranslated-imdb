Mr. Blandings is building his dream house, perhaps the best Frank Capra / Preston Sturges film that no one ever did! If you like Raising a Child, Philadelphia Story, Thin Man, I Was a Bride in War film. Life after World War II is portrayed simply and idyllically. <br /> <br /> Grant is at the peak of his form, playing on a city mouse, venturing on the life of a village squire. Loy is adorable as his wife until NOW. The composition of the supporting characters is compared to "You can not take it with you" and contains an early bit of the future Tarzan Lex Barker. Artistic guidance and editing are much higher pairs. <br /> <br /> The film never goes down to a low damn trifle in the latest release of The Money Pit.
