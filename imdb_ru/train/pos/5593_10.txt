This film could be a silent film; it is definitely a feeling of one. I am very, very lucky to see this very rare version of this film. Extase is a “symphony of love” that surpasses all language versions. French, which is the supreme romantic language, seems quite appropriate for this very sensual and lyrical version. Young Hedy Lamarr lights up the screen in this film, which, in a sense, is almost like sexual fantasy; but definitely far from pornographic. Tech quality can be a little raw; but this does not detract from the magic spell that this film exudes. Many fans of early cinema, of course, adore this film.
