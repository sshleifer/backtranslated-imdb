Dahl seems to have been influenced by Wanders' American friend. Innocent Nick Cage is recruited to strike. Dennis Hopper plays the real hitman. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The hero gets confused more and more, trying to get out. And the small town of America does not seem as safe as the Big City. Like its predecessor mentioned above, this film has many plot twists that seem incredible, but they all lead to cathartic self-knowledge.
