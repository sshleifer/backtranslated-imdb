I really liked the movie. I remember reading it several times when I was a child, and I was glad to see that a film was made about the book. <br /> <br /> I was sitting with a child for a boy and a girl aged 11 and 8, and I had to talk to a girl to watch a movie. But, fortunately, in the end she was glad that she saw it, and even said that she wanted to buy it on DVD as soon as it was released. <br /> <br /> There were wonderful funny moments and the film was not as “rough” as I expected, but it was actually high on a gross meter ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I can't understand, which is why they should have had a “stupid” line that Woody made with reference to his personal part ... this was for me the only shocking moment (and you could hear adults in the audience gasping loudly this moment in the film) ... I have no idea why this was included in the film; it added nothing to the real film except this shock / sigh factor ... other than this rather good movie. Nice to see how the Pepsi girl grew up.
