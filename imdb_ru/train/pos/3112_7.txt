I watched both the Bourne Identity and the Bourne Supremacy on a DVD before I saw it in the theater. I've been waiting for this since they started shooting. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Minor spoilers below - <br /> <br /> Overall, it was good, but there was also a lack of continuity in the first two. Identity and superiority flowed smoothly between the adrenaline rush to the introspective drama. This film at times seemed changeable. Downtime was too long. This led to the following action becoming too frantic. <br /> <br /> Camera: Speaking of insanity, the Greengrass camera shaky camera trademark was present and really annoyed me. I know that it was said / whined about nausea on the bulletin board, but that does not mean that it is irrelevant. All the martial arts training that the actors went through was completely wasted. Funny camera cuts and camera shake destroyed most of the fights in the film. This is a cheap stunt by a student director to make the film feel insecure. I expect that these methods will be used in some horror film made for schoolchildren, but not in this cool, adult action movie. Too many extreme closeups too. Framing Take some interesting shots. Standing close-up reminds me of a lazy director. <br /> <br /> History: At first the story was VERY confusing. They impose new names and faces on you from the very beginning. Give me the feeling that you get when you come to the movies late and you know that you missed some important information. Felt in a hurry or shrink for reasons of time. After you catch up, the story is pretty good. It's nice to follow the example along with Bourne. HOWEVER, I didn’t care that the entire last Supremacy scene (Landy / Bourne on the phone) is in the heart of Ultimatum events. This basically makes the movie a semi-well. I thought it was awkward. <br /> <br /> Cast / Characters: the star of the film is action. Obviously, there are only two originals left. Born and Nicky Parsons. Their union was strange to me. I think they just wanted to give Born someone who he could protect and trust. If I completely missed something, they will not even tell you why they are united. The other killers in the film were pretty quiet. It felt like Gilroy / Greengrass / one who wants not to leave open ends. It is clear, but disappointing. Seriously, Damon with Clive Owen in Identity and Marton Chokas in Excellence. These scenes were phenomenal. These killers are as uninteresting as Castel (the first guy Born fights in Identity). The cast generally deteriorated as the series continued. Clive Owen was almost an afterthought. This is a measure of strength for the first throw. Secondly, they basically exchange Chris Cooper for Joan Allen .... Not exactly equal. This one exchanges Brian Cox and Frank Potente for 3 actors who will be named later. Nothing against David Strathairn, Scott Glenn or Albert Finney, but these are not the first names that come to mind for this kind of TV series. In addition to the pause, which seemed long, the acting was correct. <br /> <br /> Overall, she was successful. It felt like they wanted to finish the series, though. If they cut or rearranged slower parts, completely excluded a part of Scott Glenn, reduced the scale and took the camera away from the victim of the capture, it would be fine. <br /> <br /> THE ENDING SPOILER <br /> <br /> I don’t understand why they leave Born alive at the end. It was my understanding, it was a conclusion. They clearly referred to the very beginning of the series with its fixed silhouette. I thought that would be so. Full circle end type. I liked Nikki to react to the news report. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPECIFICATION WARNING - quotation from the film below - <br /> <br /> Bourne’s last line is at the end "Look at this ... Look at what they make you give. quoting the first killer he killed, I liked it. The final scene was great. (Except that it was Voshen (Strathairn) who shot Born. Why would he do that? Just for revenge? If he was angry enough to kill, why not shoot Pamela Landy after she faxes his top secret file? Makes sense.)
