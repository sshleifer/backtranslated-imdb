The star of this movie is the script. Attention to detail during the period in dress, language, morals (we do not offend women) and politics are wonderful. This is a reminder of Kosovo today. The subtle fragments in the action scenes are intended for the attentive viewer, and the choreography of these sequences of actions is superb. Perhaps this film should come closer to reality in order to enlist the support it was supposed to receive. It looks like a ladder of growing violence with a good pace of peace and tranquility between each step. A great movie ....
