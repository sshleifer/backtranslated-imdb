My parents took me to this film when I was nine years old. I never forgot it. I have never before seen anything beautiful than Elizabeth Taylor. (She was twenty-two years old when she did the “Elephant Walk”). Remember, I'm nine, so the feelings are not sexy, I just could not see anything on the screen. I just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and look at her. She began to show her age (she is almost seventy-four), but I still believe that she is one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women who have ever lived. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie several times. since then, and this is a juicy melodrama. This saves, of course, the beauty of Miss Taylor, the magnificent landscapes, the very impressive crush of elephants and the well thought out view of the arrogance of man in the face of nature. <br /> <br /> In general, it's good - I spent a couple of hours watching a movie or rented video.
