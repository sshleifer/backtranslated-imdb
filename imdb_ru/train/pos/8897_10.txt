My sister and I rented this film because we were tuned in to something dirty and not so demanding to watch. However, the film greatly exceeded my very low expectations. <br /> <br /> This is much more than a representation of the century. It has very real character images, and most of the actors do an amazing job. Various stories are connected together with real shots of the time, which gives it a special touch. While watching, I really felt that I had forgotten what had happened to the characters. <br /> <br /> I would also like to endlessly praise Julia Stiles in her image of Katie, she was gorgeous in the sense that She stood out! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to everyone ..
