This film is one of my favorites, because it makes me think about all the choices I made and how my life would change if my choices were different. It plays a direct role in the “multiple universe” theory. <br /> <br /> The only thing that doesn’t sound true is that Larry Burroughs (James Belushi) is so hard to understand what is happening, that everything has been changed. <br /> <br />
