I was so glad that I came across this short film. Iâ€™m always so disappointed that short films are hard to come by, so when I saw this and saw that he was nominated for the Live Action short film at the Oscar, I was so glad that I really had the movie I was cheer for. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, the director, writer and star Nacho Vigalondo tried to think of a reason why people would suddenly flare up to a song and dance number, like in movies. The result is very interesting, and the song is really memorable. <br /> <br /> This is a well-made short film, well edited, and all the actors did a great job. And the last frame of the film is perfect. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
