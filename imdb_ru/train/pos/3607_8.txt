Therefore, one evening a couple of years ago I switched to digital subscriber channels and thought that I would spend half an hour watching “Girlfight”, waiting for the start of “Hart's War”. With that title, I thought it was some kind of film “B” about gangs of girls in the city center. <br /> <br /> To my great surprise, it was not about that at all. Instead, it's a well-played, well-written story about a young woman who almost accidentally ends up in women's boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his workouts and showing interest in watching his fights. Because he really does not want to be a boxer (just following their father’s wishes), she convinces his coach to take her instead. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in a smart and believable way when it passes various tests in its search. To begin with, her brother’s trainer does not want to fight a female boxer. After reluctance, she has a problem with the selection of matches. Then the confrontation with his father, when he finds out what is happening. Yes, love interest is developing, but it serves to enhance the plot, meeting a more interesting interpersonal reaction with its own consequences associated with the battle. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great little sleeper film that few seem to have heard of. Some time later, when I saw the widely advertised and widely known "Million Dollar Baby", I thought: "Wait a minute, it seems quite familiar." Needless to say, I did not watch "Hart's War" that night.
