How many of us want us to give up social and cultural obligations and be free? I suspect most of us. Should we dance? This is not a film about dancing. It is about learning about yourself, realizing what we are looking for in life, and having the courage to go in search. Mr. Sugiyama is a member of the Japanese Middle Age Society, where ballroom dancing is viewed as inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> One day, Mr. Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of a dancing academy window. He is fascinated by her and eventually enrolls in dance lessons. He is ashamed of his dancing and is afraid of ridicule. He hides the fact that he attends dance lessons from his colleagues and family. <br /> <br /> In the men's office in the office there is a funny scene when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a partner who also dances, breaks off, practicing some dance steps. There are many other funny and heartfelt scenes. <br /> <br /> The ending is not a fairy tale, but the viewer feels good. <br /> <br /> This movie helped me understand Japanese people a little better. This is a warm and very decent film.
