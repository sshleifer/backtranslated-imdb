Yes, I will say, before I start commenting, this film is incredibly undervalued. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is gorgeous in his role as Katherine Trammell, as is Morrissey as Dr. Glass. He is an analyst, sent to evaluate it after the death of a sports star. The glass is drawn into the seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind. <br /> <br /> The acting was good (except for Thelis) <br /> <br /> Kamen does have a talent for this role. She is clever, naughty and seductive and does not look a day older than the first time. She really impressed me (like in a casino). Morrisi was good too. He showed great vulnerability in the role that he needed. Thewlis however was lame. He destroyed his character and was over the whole way. He really sucks. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is not so good, but Stone is a scream for watching. Just ignore Thelis.
