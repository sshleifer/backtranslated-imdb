Harman and Isings 'Old Mill Pond' is a true masterpiece of the art of animation. The unsurpassed skill and craftsmanship that characterize this work of duets are nowhere more apparent than in this cartoon. It is a pity that so many people can only see an insult in what has always been conceived as frivolous entertainment, which in no way sought to blacken black people. In any case, it is a tribute to the contagious humor and musicality of the black race. For years, I have not been able to observe this confrontation, since the “racing commissioners” in England found it too offensive to show it in a multi-ethnic Britain. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, I would really like to see this masterpiece again. I think that those who usually look for messages and intentions that were never intended in these cartoons, which, after all, are sixty years old, should try to light up and remember that the world is completely different today, but that does not mean that everyone the right to censor what is visible from the past.
