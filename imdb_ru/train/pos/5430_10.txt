Of all the British imperial films, such as The Four Feathers, for example, The Light Brigade Brigade, this film stands out as the cream of the harvest. This reflects the time when "the sun never set on the British Empire." Overcome it. I will not go into details, because many others have expressed many reasons that make this film great. I visited the Alabama Hills and photographed the passage through which the British passed, and it remains unchanged in time and attempt on the part of the person and the Vandals. And although I know that this is happening, I see Dean lying dead on a stretcher, and when these lines are read <br /> <br /> "Yes, Dean! Dean! Dean! <br /> <br /> You, Lazarushskaya Gunga Din skin! <br /> <br /> Although I fastened you, <br /> <br /> By the living Goud that made you, <br /> <br /> You are better than me, Gunga Dean "<br /> <br /> I'm still 54 years old, and I have foggy eyes, and anyone who says no is a liar. The range of emotions in it is a sign of a great movie. As the end of another great movie, Mice and Men.
