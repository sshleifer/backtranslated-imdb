Besides the fact that this film exceeded all my expectations, this masterpiece of the history of cinema shows the excessive use of crappy filters at its best! Paul Johansson and Craig Schaeffer show fraternal conflict with all that is. As usual, the woman agrees with her true intentions. The end came as unexpectedly as failure, as the killing of Keith Scott by his elder brother. <br /> <br /> The viking scenes are the same as I remember from my early travels in time. - Honestly, my strong passion for junk films makes this film a must in my unfinished collection. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who is in love with the most wonderful brother of One Tree Hill. . <br /> <br /> -Odin-
