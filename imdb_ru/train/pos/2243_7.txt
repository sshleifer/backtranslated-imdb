I thought that the whole movie was played out beautifully with fresh images and interesting cinematography throughout the journey. The actors were on the back of their character almost at the perfect time and looked great. The music was lush and thoughtful. It even had a decent end turn. So with everyone who votes against? The story was not entirely fresh (felt like a relic of “The Running Man” with the whole idea of ​​a television show), but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism about how the public chooses their Messiah certainly sounded quite plausible. It made sense to follow this man, who was put in front of the modern crowd, and put him on a pedestal because of his ability. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Christians or other religious people will understand this because the film contains the word “God”, but this shows that the filmmakers tried to teach people who may never have seen such a world especially in the modern world, where Christianity is increasingly accepted and forgotten by some. <br /> <br /> I gave him 7/10 stars here on IMDb. I thought every ounce of the film was for the most part interesting and original. Check it out if you are not too offended to watch an entertainment film from Madrid, Spain, about the possibilities of the coming of the modern Messiah to the TV near you.
