John Voight plays a man named Joe. Joe is shocked at haunting childhood. He has a strong fear and hatred of religion because of his traumatic baptism. He leaves his work as a dishwasher and goes outside to become rich for wealthy people. He meets a loser named Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) and two for a relationship. They go out and work together, helping each other. They become thieves. They are remarkably close and soon can not live without each other. However, there is something very important that Ratso did not say to Joe, and this can destroy any hope that they will survive together in the city. This is one of the greatest films in history. This is a heartbreaking and crushing portrait of too lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other. Their story is terrible to watch, but ultimately important to people. This is one of those films where the characters are a lot like crazy people you sometimes meet on the street. The difference is that this film is from their point of view. Their lives are shown to us, and it’s terrible to see pedestrians in this film treat them like dirt, especially if we were once one of those people. However, the film is not trying to fool you. Instead, he shows you the rough side of the fuss lifestyle. This is not a pleasant and relaxed lifestyle, as many Hollywood films, such as "DAIRY MONEY" and "PLEASANT WOMAN" show. A masculine lifestyle is a dirty, gritty and ugly life, and it's sad that people humiliated themselves, as does Joe’s character in this film. What impressed me most about this film is that it was released in 1969 and it stood the test of time perfectly. Today's audience will still find great importance in this film, and will still love it and cherish it, just as critics and audiences everywhere in 1969. The film was rated X, but in this film I notice that sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest, realistic and effective way. Anyone who has had sex before will know how funny this can be, embarrassing and scary, and this film does not shy away from it all. Sex in this film may not be as graphic as before. Movies rated X, such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, CLOCKWORK ORANGE, GREETINGS, LAST TANGO in Paris and FRITZ THE CAT, seem surprisingly boring compared to the shocking things people can get with R rating today. Sex scenes in MIDNIGHT COWBOY seem pretty strong, but they are definitely not sexy. They are not graphic, but they are realistic, and this is what people should keep in mind when watching this movie. The language of the course used in the film, especially the word "fagot", is used effectively and is not free. Watching violence is very shocking even today, but again, you need a plot to portray the world of a hustler. I am really glad to see that MIDNIGHT COUBA is not dated and is still as impressive as in 1969, if not more. I can not recommend this classic enough, and I hope that it will continue to find an audience, because it is really a special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten. <br /> <br /> PROS: <br /> <br /> -John Voight and Dustin Hoffman look painfully and amazingly. They have never played such roles either before or after, and they are completely different from the usual ones. You will forget who plays them in a few minutes! <br /> <br /> -Beautiful assessment <br /> <br /> -Not all dated or pretentious, like many films of that decade like today <br /> <br /> -Fantastic and quick editing <br CONS: <br /> <br /> - Only for a mature audience. <br /> <br /> - The opening scenes are well made, but they can be a little stronger.
