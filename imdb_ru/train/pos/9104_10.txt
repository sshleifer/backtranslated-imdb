Well, I do not agree with another comment. Piedras is much better than Magnolia or any other film that was mentioned. <br /> <br /> Especially about the unreal characters, I think that someone wrote this just because he never lived in a Spanish society like me. (and I'm not Spanish), this is a very real movie with real characters, very well made by one of the best Spanish actresses Antonia San Juan. <br /> <br /> about the European film unlike the American film, well, we are different societies, I personally donâ€™t like American contemporary films (I like the classics and some American films of Andy, but very few of them). <br /> <br /> This is a film about the permanent Constitution of a person, whether we like it or not, we all make mistakes, but some may learn about mistakes.
