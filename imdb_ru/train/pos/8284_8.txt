This is one of those unique horror films that requires a more mature understanding of the word “horror” to be appreciated. The main thing is that people may not understand that this story is told from the point of view of a little boy, and, like most young children, it is easy to frighten him. Mostly because he simply does not understand anything, for example, why his father almost never exists for him. After watching a movie, you can see how a husband argues with his wife about the balance between working time and family time, and you can easily understand it, but the little boy does not understand. You can also imagine a boy who is afraid of the forest, since at the beginning of the film it was established that the family is from the city. In addition, at first, when the family goes to the house, they beat the deer, then it is detained, then they argue with the locals about it, and the little boy, of course, did not find this familiarity with the forest at all pleasant. <br /> <br /> “Wendigo” is ultimately what his young, innocent mind exposes to explain all this. There is a legend about American Indians, but looking at the scene where a young boy hears about it, this is explained to him as straightforward and simplistic. Not because this is what Wendigo really is, but because that is how he understands it. When you look at a film from this point of view, you really start to appreciate it. Obviously, it was a low-budget and cheap shot, but the jump montages, the use of light, and the general eeriness more than compensate for this. And the last question the film asks: is it all in your head, or is it really so? 8/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: profanity, violence and sex scene
