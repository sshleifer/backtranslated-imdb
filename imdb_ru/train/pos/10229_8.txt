YETI deserves an 8-star rating because it is one of the greatest bad movies ever made. I saw him at a midnight show in Los Angeles, and people roared and applauded insanity - this film is one of those cinematic train wrecks where you think he can't get some stranger, and IT DOES IT! The millionaire who finances the Yeti thawing project is like Chris Penn and John Goodman, who were poured into an inappropriate suit — the guy playing the scientist — one of the worst actors ever to appear on the screen — and yes, the dumb boy (who like a girl) and he's dumb since he survived the plane crash that killed both his parents (hmmm, maybe a therapy for a child ??). Then this pretty Italian will be seen by the Yeti (as soon as he thaws - which he takes forever) - and he immediately falls in love with her - that one of the most hysterical things in the film is that this giant Yeti does "bedroom eyes" on her - it's like big barry white trying to seduce a fan. In fact, as soon as the big Yeti picks up the beauty and presses it to her breast - she accidentally touches the Yeti's nipple, and yes, the film shows the time to show his big gray nipple GET HARD !!!! Yikes total YIKES! In addition, there is a collie in it, because the Italian producer must have heard that the American audience loves dogs, and he kind of tried to get Lassie - there is also a crazy scene where Yeti eats a giant fish - holds a big fish bone and uses it for combing the hair of an Italian girl "Gee, thank you Yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout. You are the best." This film is more bizarre than what Ed Wood could have dreamed of. If you're a fan of classic movie shit, look for this kid.
