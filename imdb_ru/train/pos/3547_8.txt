An entertaining musical in which Nathan Detroit needed $ 1,000 to get a game with swimming shit, so he encourages Sky Masterson to try to invite a girl from the Salvation Army, played by Gene Simmons, with Masterson to Havana. <br /> <br /> 5 years later, Simmons will again be in the missionary in the fabulous "Elmer Gantry." There she was sister Sharon, and here she is sister Sarah. The same temperament, another story. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is the devil Nathan of Detroit. He was engaged to Vivian Blaine for 14 years and she hates his gambling habit. <br /> <br /> Heavenly Masterson played Marlon Brando, who actually sang here! <Br /> <br /> The film is saved by excellent choreography. Those dancing and singing are incredible. They are particularly understandable by Stubby Kay as Nicely Nicely (Johnson). <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very good setting.
