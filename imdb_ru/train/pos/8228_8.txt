it's hard to tell you more about this movie without spoiling it. I enjoyed it because I didn’t expect what I saw, but the usual sex drama, so ... This is a psycho-sexy thriller in which nothing is what it seems. It depicts Emmanuel Seigneur, not alien to the genre (and nudity) in which she was led by her husband Polanski. And the creepy performance (I said creepy / yes, CREEPY) from Toreton (actor Bernard Tavernier). It seems that Pascal Bruckner meets Roman Polanski (better than “Bitter Moon”), like Chabrol, going astray or the thriller Kloso (I saw someone mentioning Les Diaboliques), but closer to God’s Wife without a Face father of Dr. Fibes and much more). Gemstone! I'm just afraid that they will turn it into a Hollywood remake, as they did with Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
