My score is 10/10 just for the fun factor and suggests that you decided that you liked "Slaughter High" before watching it. Yes, this is a typical story of revenge a few years after a dirty joke, but how do you dislike some of the things that they are pulling here ?! I could not predict this scene in the bathroom in a million years. <br /> <br /> Good, so we could be cynical and say that this film does not offer anything new. Well, it does not claim to. This is a kind of film that Screamâ€™s characters probably watched, and this contributed to their rules for surviving a horror movie. After all, who doesn't like to watch people suffer for these things? Obviously, this has a sort of reactionary tone, since people are being punished for defending in the 60s. But still, you must love this stuff! So, apologizing to Don McLean, this jester did not sing for the king and queen!
