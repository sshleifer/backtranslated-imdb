<br /> <br /> Artistically shot, the actors portray their role. You get real feeling by watching Lucien rise from poverty to the most beautiful girl around. A sense of tragedy to win again in tragedy. In general, I have seen this movie at least 10 times. And I can say VERY well that Prix De Beute '(Beauty Award, Miss Europe) is the main favorite in my silent film collection. Louise Brooks's expressiveness is beautiful, and I recommend this film to ANYONE who appreciates artistic beauty combined with a tragic storyline.
