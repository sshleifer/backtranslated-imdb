Many mysterious stories follow the standard way of the harlot: killing the most dirty, collecting evidence, a flock of possible criminals, sprinkling red herring, and the inevitable confrontation between a smart villain and an even smarter criminal. <br /> <br /> "Lost" refuses from valor and gives us complex characters who could or could not do terrible actions. The fact that at the end of three episodes we do not have simple answers and there is no neatly tied package can upset some, but for me it was a sign of a reasonably created story that explores, bothers and pursues the question: what does an evil person do? <br /> <br /> An excellent acting and staging game made the puzzle uneasy ... forgotten.
