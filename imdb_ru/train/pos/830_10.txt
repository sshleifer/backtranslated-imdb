I did not expect to enter the film, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan outstanding in a completely different role. He threw brilliant costumes from Armani for a ridiculous look and paid off, showing that he is a great actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear are great at playing with each other and for a long time they have become one of their best friends. The humor is grim, the performances of Brosnan, Kinnir and Hope Davis are great, mix it with a touching element of a friendship story, and you will have a great movie. This is probably one of the best comedic friends in a long time. This is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great success in the post-Bond era in Brosnanâ€™s career.
