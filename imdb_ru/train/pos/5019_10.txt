Hi. <br /> <br /> My name is Jessica, I am Italian! <br /> <br /> Some time ago I saw this film: “For the first time” with Corin Corky Nemec. It was the story of Michelle and Mary Margaret. I need to know the name of the song of the most important love scene in Michael's bedroom. <br /> <br /> In Italy, this film has not been programmed for many years, and I don’t know how to find this song. Thank you very much for who can help me! I love this film! Very romantic! The soundtrack is beautiful! I love Sheryl Pollack! Jessica
