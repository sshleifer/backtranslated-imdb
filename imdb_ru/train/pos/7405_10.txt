This movie is just great! Everything is here: laughter, sadness, beauty, poetry, truth. Everything in a simple, but rich history - like life! You will not be distracted for a second. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. Someone will say to Hollywood that a good story is needed to make a good movie, and there are a lot of good stories.
