This movie is shockingly underrated on IMDb. Like many other films, this is not the Shawshank. But this is a pretty good, but predictable, dance competition / personal growth film. If you want to spend an hour and a half to look at the 8-mile dancer, then I think you will like it. <br /> <br /> Judging by the IMDb rating, I believe that this film was approaching the best 250, and was “piled up with voices” with many 1, as it happens with many films that are not about the crowd, have no special effects , or include non-white or non-direct characters. <br /> This is an American film, but this is not an American film. The set is mainly in Toronto, the replicas are elusive, and some viewers may think that it is installed entirely in the USA only because the final competition is held in the border city of Detroit. <br /> <br /> I liked the music. I liked the dance (but not sure if it costs $ 50,000 ... but what I know). The heroes were light in appearance. <br /> <br /> I agree that the title sucks. I do not remember anyone in the film saying these words, and he must have an "s". (No, this is not a foreign language). <br /> <br /> I hate hating this film (and, frankly, 1 vote means you hated it), so I can only assume that it is an expression of hatred towards such people, and this is sad.
