Probably the two main meanings of “Rabbit Elmer” are that the stupid leper shown in “The Wild Hare” now has a name, and that he says his famous “Of course, you understand that this means war!” . Basically, the crowd of Termite Terraces was still trying to figure out exactly what to do with this eared rascal. This is definitely a must for evil fans of this genre, but others are likely to have few reasons for interest. <br /> <br /> But make no mistake, it's pretty funny that Bugs Bunny does with forever trusting Elmer Fadd. Throughout the cartoon will appear bright shades. I recommend it.
