I thought this movie was very enjoyable. I watched this movie with my wife BEFORE my first child was born. So I did not see it as just family entertainment, and I still fully enjoyed it. It seems that many of the reviews indicate that this film does not destroy the earth, there were no unexpected changes to the plot, and that the film was predictable and boring. If these people watch this film in anticipation of religious experience, then they will obviously be disappointed. This is just an animated film; nothing more. If you want to watch this movie just to relax and entertain yourself, you will not be disappointed. In conclusion, this is definitely not the best film made by Disney, but it is interesting, and I donâ€™t understand what a bad reputation it has received.
