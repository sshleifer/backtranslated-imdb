This movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to play his part in this film. Spiritual was top notch, like Forbes and Lewis. The four main characters set off on a scenic trip to historic murder sites in one of the coolest cars ever created, the 1960s Lincoln Continental model. “Early Grace” is a simpleton with a taste of dry toothbrushes and carnage. He loves his women not to curse and smoke, but to wear PWT dresses. Duchovny and Forbes are a couple of artists from the city, while Early and Lewis are valet parking from the countryside. Despite the fact that the main tone in the film is dark, there are many funny scenes that can be seen. The script, direction and acting is great. If you like road movies, killings, humor and narration, watch this movie. Everything is delivered and you will want more when the loans roll. One of my favorites for all time. "hey ... shave that dog and teach her how to hunt!"
