This is a touching story of two families in Israel and the relationships within each family. Every family has a gay son. At this stage, the stories are interconnected, but this film tells about all members of the family, and not just about two sons. The portraits of each family member in both families are well drawn, and the story is invariably interesting, if a bit dull.
