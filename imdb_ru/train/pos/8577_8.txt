I think Hollow Point is a fun movie with some good moments that I have never seen in action movies. Well, both Tia Carrere and Thomas Ian Griffith are not very good at acting, but Tia Carrere is a sweet and beautiful girl, isn't she? But Donald Sutherland is great in his role as an insane gangster.
