It is the French and the Belgians who do what they do best. This is a quirky, visually inventive, thrilling, and emotionally complex story. Director Jaco van Dormael leads us into the world of Georges, who suffers from Down syndrome and his desire for meaningful relationships with someone, just with anyone. This is done not patronizing, but with a sense of fun and honesty. In the interaction of Georges with the corporate management guru, Harry dazzling copes - with incredible ease moves from comedy to tragedy and returns to comedy. <br /> <br /> The eighth day sets the same Hollywood tariffs as Oscar, who won the Barry Levinson Award in Rain Man or Roberta. Forrest Gump Zemeckis is well and truly in the shadows. Sometimes it causes Milos Forman's humor "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" with hints of Dennis Potter for good measure. <br /> <br /> As emotionally blunted and desperately lonely yuppie, Harry, Daniel Otoy turns into another sublime performance. But it corresponds to the brilliant Pascal Dukenn as Georges. This is a film with equally strong performances and many memorable scenes - a shoe store, car dealership, George’s dance on “Jesus, whom he knows”, at the conference, fireworks. If you have not seen this, then there is only one. Just rent or watch a show at a retro cinema near you and see what you were missing. Better yet buy this movie. A clear genius .....
