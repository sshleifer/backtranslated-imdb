I first saw it as a child living in East London. Hitler’s scars from the Luftwaffe were all too obvious, and the film’s landscape resembled our street. I remember nightmares after seeing this. The strange thing is that it is not really dated, if we consider it as part of social history in fiction. <br /> <br /> In addition to the destructive war on a global scale, the scale of the machines was terribly wrong, now there are more nano-technologies, but overall this is an excellent and well-designed work. It was interesting to see how space travel was perceived. I think launching a spacecraft from a giant cannon will almost certainly kill astronauts. However, a lot was right. Man thirsts for war, man is inhuman towards man. Means of war as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
