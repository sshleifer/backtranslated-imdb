This is a short film made by fans and represents a preview of the new film, which combines Batman and Superman! This is a film that fans adore and watch in places like ComicCon, and it was made by the same person who made BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collor. <br /> <br /> As for this movie, I can easily select it separately. Of course, the effects of CGI are not perfect, and costumes are far from perfect. BUT, it was done on a limited budget, and for a fan-made film, it's incredible. I was particularly struck by the amateur Superman himself - he was not a stupid little guy! If only it was a preview for a real movie - they would have fans lined up from here to Omaha to see it. Great job.
