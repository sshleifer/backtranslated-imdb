In this semi-autobiographical film, a talented but narcissistic young musician, whose family life is less stellar, the prince plays the role of “Kid.” True, the acting skill leaves much to be desired (with the exception of Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams, who are both gorgeous in height), but the film is still great and is among the best films of the 1980s. He has the best soundtrack for ANY film over the past 50 years, at least, very quoted lines, and the dumpster scene is HUGE !! Plus Apollonia is just HUGE. On the other hand, when I saw the prince at a concert in 2004, he blew up the stadium. He is an experienced showman, and this was one of my best concerts. <br /> <br /> My rating: A <br /> <br /> Additional information on DVD: Disk 1) Comment by director Albert Magnoli, Producer Robert Cavallo and Director of Photography Donald Thorin; Theater trailer; Trailers for the film "Under the Cherry Moon" and "Grafitti Bridge" 2) 12-minute thematic presentation at the First Avenue Club; "Purple Rain: Bachstage Pass" (half an hour in the film, which I will discuss later on his page); “Riffs, Raffs and Revolution: Influence and Influence of Purple Rain”, 10 minutes, 30 minutes of MTV premiere Shots (when MTV did not suck donkey balls); 5 prince music videos ("Let's go crazy, take me with you" when the pigeons are crying, I'll die 4 U / Baby, I'm a star and purple rain); The Time (“Jungle Love and the Bird”) and Apollonia Sex Shooter music video 6 <br /> Eye Candy: Apollonia shows off her beautiful tits
