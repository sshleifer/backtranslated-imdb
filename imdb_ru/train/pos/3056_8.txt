I put it in my TIVO for a rainy day because of the actors, some really hardworking people in the industry, and when I finally looked, I was NOT disappointed. <br /> <br /> This film has some Altman taste (it is mentioned in the closing credits as a “thank you” person), using seemingly independent unrelated plot lines that intertwine when the film approaches its climax. Macy is clean, clean and honest, like a man who seems unable to escape his “fate”, Sutherland plays and portrays as few people can, Neve adds a splash into a deliberately relaxed atmosphere, add Tracy Ullman, Barbara Bane (remember the Mission Impossible on TV?), Not to mention the permanent John Ritter, and you have all the ingredients for a good movie. The script is not cluttered, the dialogue is free from cliches and thought out (especially between Macy and David Dorfman). Stop the faith and enjoy, it's a really good time.
