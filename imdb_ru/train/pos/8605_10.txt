Janette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy play a major role in this "modern" musical that demonstrates Macdonald's comic abilities. The surreal musical of the 40s seems to ridicule the fashion of the 40s, even when they were in fashion. Stunning costumes and decorations (yes, B & W) add the surreal, fabulous quality of the entire film. Several good songs enliven the film, with the number “Twinkle in Your Eye,” which includes a funny jitterbug number between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. Also in the HUGE cast are Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbril and Ann Jeffries. In the expanded role you can also see Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hale, Gertrude Hoffman, Raphael Ottiano, Odette Myrtil, Cecil Cunningham and many others. <br /> <br /> It is very fun and nice to see the wonderful Macdonald in her jitterbug / vamp routines. She could do it all.
