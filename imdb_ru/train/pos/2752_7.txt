Although the elements of the “Eighth Day” plot seem to have been made many times, the film still has a lot of spark, riddles and symbolism that were in the first film of Jaco Van Dormal. Although the film is not as good as Toto Hero, which will always remain on my list of favorites, the film still leaves us with a lot of emotions. Daniel O'Teil, of The Closet 2001, without prejudice, downplayed his role, fearing replaying (rightly, the role could have been easily destroyed if the actor was excessively dramatic). Nevertheless, I felt that the role needed a little more realism, to focus more on the character itself, and not just on his growth. <br /> <br /> Do not enter this film, expecting dark humor and unexpected turns, you received from Toto Hero, because you will be disappointed. Nevertheless, the film still serves as a worthy, if not erroneous, film.
