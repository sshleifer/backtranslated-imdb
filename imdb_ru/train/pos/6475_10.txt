These are just 2 episodes in a 5-part drama, but I can already say that this is one of the best things I've ever seen. This is on TV, movie screen or even in real life. <br /> <br /> As a writer, this is so good that it almost demoralizes! As a spectator, it's so exciting that I'm annoyed, the episodes lasted more than two weeks, and not from Monday to Friday. It is clear that all these negatives are in fact positive. <br /> <br /> I’m a modern guy who previously moved from television dramas. Compared to movies, television dramas have always seemed outdated, rather tame and, as a rule, boring! “Five Days” really brought a television drama into the 21st century, so at least that changed my mind for me. Go watch it.
