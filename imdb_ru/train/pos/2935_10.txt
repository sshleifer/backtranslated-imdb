Eddie Murphy Delirius is the funniest thing you have ever seen in your life. You can compare it with any film, and I am sure you decide that “Delirius” is the funniest film of all! This film is about 1 hour. 45 minutes, and during that time I almost laughed. After it's all over, you'll laugh for hours, replaying the blow lines over and over in your head. Eddie Murphy gave a lot of funny performances for his career (48 hours, Trading places, Beverly Hills Policeman, Raw, Arriving in America, Nutty Professor, Shrek, etc. I saw this movie so many times, and every time it’s funnier. never loses his edge. Starting from this day, every great performance will be repeated at Delirious. ***** and two thumbs up!
