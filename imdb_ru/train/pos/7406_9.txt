A completely different topic addressed in this film. A simple and simple description of local Chinese customs, if you look at the daily work of a public bath run by the old owner and his retarded son when the older son returns home, mistakenly believing that his father is dead. How every person in the city visits the chat daily, plays games, discusses personal issues and receives honest advice, in addition to the usual spa therapy. When the old man dies, strong and loyal family ties force the eldest son to take responsibility, so the public bath is not broken. And finally, the modernization came to put an end to this way of relaxing time and getting along. Public bath should be demolished, creating a place for the construction of a commercial complex.
