I don’t know whether to recommend this film to Tetsuo fans or not. Why Tetsuo? Because you can easily mark some things about this movie as a very obvious Tetsuo robbery. The concept is similar, editing is equally crazy and fast - and this is good, because, in addition to making the film more dynamic, it hides some of the flaws caused by low budget and other factors. <br /> <br /> There is much more blood than eroticism and, in the case of the “meatball machine,” the transformation of a person into a creature that is partially a machine (sounds familiar?) called “Necroborg” (very original) is caused small mucous aliens. <br /> These slimy little scum from outer space actually use people as vessels for their gladiator games that they play with each other. They flooded the body, somehow managed to put into it an insane amount of mechanical parts, which, it would seem, pulled them out of nowhere and turned them into a killing machine aimed at other necrobes. Their goal is to defeat another stranger who is in another Necroborg, to snatch him from the corpse and eat it. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot sounds somewhat silly, and I did not expect much, but in the end, I really liked this film. <br /> <br /> As I said before, this is a low-budget film, but it is still relatively decent. Do not expect much from the actors, they are mostly not very good, but it can be tolerated. I liked the atmosphere and the blood, some strange situations and how the film was directed and edited. Although the story is not very original, it has a certain charm - at least for me. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
