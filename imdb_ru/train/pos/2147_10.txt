I lived in Tokyo for 7 months. Knowing the reality of long train journeys, bike rides from the train station, soup canteens and other typical scenes portrayed so well undoubtedly added to my own appreciation for this film, which I really liked. There are aspects of Japanese life in this movie that are painted in bright colors, but you donâ€™t have to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie. The tricks of director Suo were mostly subtle; I found that he singles out a character named Tamako Tamura using a soft filter, making it sublime, a bit contrived, but most of the directors' tricks were so soft that I was completely embroiled and just danced with his characters. Or crying. Or laughed out loud. Wonderful. A +.
