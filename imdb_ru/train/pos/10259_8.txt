Many people shout unfairly in this series, but some of the guinea pig videos are quite interesting. In particular, Devil's Experiment has some really fantastic effects - not only the infamous scene of the eyeball, but also a very realistic piece of skin on the leg, as well as breaking the arm with a sledgehammer are very realistic - especially for vintage and low-budget videos. <br /> <br /> Let me start from the very beginning for those who do not know: this film is an “extreme” film about torture and fake taboos that appeared in Japan in the mid-80s. The plot in its current form is simple: a few young people are holding the young girl, and she is forced to undergo a series of brutal torture to see where her turning point is. This entails brutal violence — all effectively feasible effects, including the effects mentioned in the previous paragraph, as well as the painful looking application of hot oil to the girl’s captive hand and placing the larva in the subsequent flaky wound. <br /> <br /> The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap where three men take turns beating the hell out of a girl when her head falls, and the second one where three men take turns kicking a girl and pushed her to the ground. These two scenes are clearly set and distract from the realism of the rest of the process. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the victim of the “experiment” is pretty convincing that she is in pain, and she needs a lot of abuse and rude things on camera. Her reaction, when she has headphones on, and loud sounds for hours, scare. Some of the other abuses she encounters are strained on a net of wood during a single rest. There is also an alarming scene where the giggling kidnappers through the guts on her and another disgustingly sloppy scene where she is twisted in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until she vomits. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen this show, I hope that I helped you decide whether you want to give this episode a shot. 8.5 / 10 for the devil experiment.
