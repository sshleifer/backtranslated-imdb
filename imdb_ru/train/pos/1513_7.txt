This film is another anthology of horror. This is pretty good, but you could use a little more. I compare it with Dr. Terror's "House of Horrors", although this is where the title fits. It has four stories, all somewhat interconnected home. The first story is about the writer and his wife approaching. He creates the killer for his latest novel, and then begins to see the killer wandering around his house. It's kind of predictable, but in the end he throws a few turns. The next story is a little more unpredictable, and you really donâ€™t know what the hell it is. Peter Cushing is present in this film, and he was probably my favorite. This guy buys a house, but not the house is central, but rather a rather strange wax museum. The third story starts pretty well and shows Christopher Lee. This one has him as a rather strange dad who seems to be protecting his daughter badly. The problem is that as soon as you know what is happening, the story will not end soon enough. This is a bit addictive, which leads to a very predictable conclusion. Then the last story concerns an actor buying a cloak in a strange shop. The actor really gets what he paid for. Then there is a little story about an officer who can be seen trying to figure out what happened to this actor, and then explaining why these things happened. Although I was not very pleased with the explanation, as I do not think it really explained Cushing's story at all. I think they need a little more history for this. Overall, although it was an interesting set of stories.
