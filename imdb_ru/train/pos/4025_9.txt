Superb. At first, I thought that given the communist leanings of Amrita Pritam and Dr. Dwivedi’s nationalist film would be more outspoken than the novel, but when I read the novel, I was surprised to find that it was the opposite. because he is not a pseudo-reader, and so that Dr. Dwivedi is objective. This film covers a sensitive topic. The victims of any war are women, as the poet said, and this film personifies this. This is also a sad commentary on the Hindu psyche, since they cannot resist the kidnappers of their girls or the Hindu brother, who can only burn the fields of their tormentor. On the other hand, it also shows the economic aspects of separation or why girls were abducted in the first place. I think that the kidnappers thought that by abducting the girls, they would become the legitimate owners of the houses and, therefore, the new government. will not be able to ask them to return home. In addition, we must pay tribute to the courage of the characters Puro and her Bhabhi, they are two simple village girls who don’t remember the outside world and risk everything, trying to return after shame. Because there are many documented cases where such women were not accepted by their families in India. <br /> <br /> No wonder that a woman was required to understand the sufferings of other women.
