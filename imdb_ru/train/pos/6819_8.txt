"Time At The Top" I found an interesting and challenging experience. The game, although generally not brilliant, was quite acceptable and sometimes very good. As a film that is clearly aimed at a younger demography, it is certainly one of the best works in the genre (Children's Fiction). As a rule, I would say that Canada, the UK and Australia produce the best films and TV shows for children, and Time At The Top does not do anything to devalue this theory! I do not think that continuity and a great game are important for young people. A good story and creative script is much more important for them. Both are abundant in this film. Special effects are good, not distracting from the story and not closing the audience from their own imagination. It would be very easy to introduce an overloaded SFX into this film, but this would completely destroy the entire Raison D'etre. <br /> <br /> The settings and camera experience in this film are very high standards and complement wonderful wardrobe and historical accuracy. In general, this film is very satisfactory, and I recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through the eyes of children, or those trying like me! Now I really should read the original book as soon as possible.
