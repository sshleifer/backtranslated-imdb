Well, the recent history of Star Trek was not good. The next generation has disappeared in the past few seasons, the DS9 has remained boldly where no one has stopped before, and Voyager has started very badly and has never fulfilled its promise. Therefore, when they announced the new Star Trek series, I didn’t have high expectations. And in the first episode "Broken Onions" there were some problems. But, overall, it was solid Trek stuff and a good romp. <br /> <br /> First, I will remove the nits. The opening topic is boring, and I'm not looking forward to a regular meeting, but for this we need remotes. What was really bad was the completely useless scene of rubbing lotion, which almost drove my wife out of the room. They need to get rid of this nonsense. <br /> <br /> But the plot was strong and well advanced. Characters, although still new, seem well rounded and not always as you expect. Vulcans are clearly not at all represented as before, with a slightly sinister topic. I especially liked the linguist, who is the first Star Trek character who cannot be proud in the face of death, but rather deals with her phobias and fears. They seem to have remained faithful to the knowledge of Trek, which was a serious problem in the past series, although they had enough time to bring us such things as shooting through shields, an instant invention of technologies that can fix everything, and an inevitable set of stories about of time. Does anyone want to create a pool for how long before the Borg? <br /> <br /> In general, the series has great potential. They see the universe with fresh eyes. We have a chance to find out how everything turned out in the next series. How did the Klingons go from simple insults to war? How did we meet the Romulans? How the Federation was formed and who exactly headed the Earth. Why is the main directive so important? If they tell about these things and not spit out episodes of time travel, it will be an interesting series. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: Zefram Cochran says: “Where no one went before” (and not “nobody”)
