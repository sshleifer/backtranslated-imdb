I see a lot of people on this site wanting AG to go on DVD. Well, I bought it on DVD. (From Borders, no less!) Although this amazing show in the form of a boxed DVD is great, Iâ€™m saddened by the fact that they added very little "extra" (comment by director Shawn Cassidy on the pilot episode) and the episodes are shown in the same order in which they were shown on television. Missing episodes that were never shown before the launch on the Sci Fi channel are in the set, but added to the final DVD. If you buy a DVD set, get an actual order, which they should review and you will be happy. (You will need to swap DVD players to see them in order, but you'll be glad you did.) <br /> <br /> S
