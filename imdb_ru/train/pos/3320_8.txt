I liked this movie, cute and funny. I found this movie a good family movie. The dirtiest part of this film was when it mentioned the New York Yankees. You must be in the Red Sox nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word. Sorry to say this to the Yankee fans. I recommend this picture for the whole family. moment in the film, with I'm in love and what should I do, but the film compensates for this with all the moments of the farce. The film shows some moments like the Red Sox Nation (in Fenway Park). Fans felt that for about 86 years the Sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the Sox and the love of another person go hand in hand.
