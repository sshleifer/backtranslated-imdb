Back in the forties, when films touched upon questions that had not yet been accepted in a "polite" society, they resorted to codes that allegedly surfaced over the heads of a large part of the audience, at the same time warning those who were aware of what had happened. Probably not a single film of the decade was so overloaded with understatement as the strangely obscure Desert Rage set in a small oasis of gambling called Chukavalla somewhere in the California desert. The owner of the salon and casino Purple Sage - amazing Mary Astor, in pants and with a cigarette; her handful of daughters, Lizabeth Scott, looking like a $ 20 million Technicolor, drives into town. But listen to the dialogue between them, which refers to the older lesbian and her young restless companion (one can only be surprised if this connection was obvious in the original script by A. I. Bezzerida). Even more glaring is John Gododak as a gangster and Wendell Corey as his insanely jealous torpedo. Add Bert Lancaster as a city sheriff, mix and pull back. Both Lancaster and (surprisingly) Hodiak fall in love with Scott. However, it seems that Hodiak has not only the past with Astor, but also his wife, who died under suspicious circumstances. The sun in the desert heats these ingredients to a strong boil, with copious slaps and exchanges. Do not miss this greenhouse melodrama, filled with terribly exotic flowers, if it suits you; this is a wonderful movie
