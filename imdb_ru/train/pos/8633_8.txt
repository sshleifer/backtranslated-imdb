Nicholas Mallet is a loser. The cashier in the bank, all go on it. Then his friend, a writer whose books nobody likes, plans to change his life. Our hero tells his boss that he is leaving. He intends to spend the rest of his life, earning a lot of money and sleeping with so many women. And he manages to do it. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the number of deaths (murder / suicide / natural causes) in the film, this would be a farce. There are many injections in marriage, politics, journalism and ... life. <br /> <br /> Jean-Louis Trintignat is a pleasant immoral swindler. Romy Schneider at her most attractive. Definitely worth a look.
