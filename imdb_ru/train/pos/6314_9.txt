I went to the cinema with my two friends and chose this movie from the cap, completely without knowing what to expect. And it turns into a very pleasant, mind-blowing experience! This is a great movie with a very unexpected story, very good dialogues and crazy humor. All the characters are clearly made in the style of "Italian satirical comedian" "Alan Ford", but this did not bother me for a second. In fact, this kind of group of losers made the film quite unique and interesting. Sam Rockwell gave a very good and convincing role, Willian Macy, too, Clooney is hardly recognizable and ingenious. But the real star is actually Guzman. He made the role of his life in this film! The scene when his character Cosimo dies in the film is so funny that it made me suffocate and almost die with him! Highly recommended for all Alan Ford fans!
