Intelligent, twisted and exhilarating, Invisible Man stood out in 2000 from the usual Sci-Fi line, balancing the fantastic artistic direction of Farscape and sometimes the melodramatic script with rough, cynical scenes and modern noir dialogue. The show was held between “Law and Order” and “Doctor Who” on the likelihood indicator, but it was impossible to deny the fact that the characters of “I-Man” went beyond the caricature. Even characters that were on the verge of predictability, such as the Guardian, the Official, and the Eberts, were delayed by the formula. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventreski had chemistry that evolved and delicately changed, made even more remarkable by the team of revolving doors of scriptwriters and directors. Effects will never allow you to crush the plot, and science only sometimes borders on the absolutely incredible. The low points of the show are still interesting, and I have never seen such tough pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi are commendable, and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive DVD version of the show. Every time I encounter the Hercules: The Legendary Journey marathon on science fiction, I roll my eyes and sigh, mourning the excitement and the possibility of science fiction television, which the Invisible Man represented, and the like.
