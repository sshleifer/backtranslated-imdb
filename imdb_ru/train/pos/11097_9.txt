Spoilers! <br /> <br /> From the moment I saw that the local film critic spoiled this movie in the 10:00 news review, I wanted to watch it. I don’t remember who it was, or what local news Omaha carried the review, but the critic was very insistent that this film was too messy for the average Nebrascan going to church. They showed a fragment of the scene where John Glover is going to kidnap Ann-Margret when she swims in a pool. Glover's character highly appreciates her beautiful body, etc., using many words that the local station considered necessary to edit. I was connected. Although there was one problem. At that time I was only 13 years old, and I had to wait a year until he came out on a telegram. Let's just say it was worth the wait! <br /> <br /> If ever it was my fault, this is a movie. Calling this film sloppy would be a huge understatement. The film tells about a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three little scum after a romance with a young woman. Roy Shader, who is just as effective as ever, is playing a poor guy who just wanted to chat for a while, and now he is dominated by three amazing villains. The character of John Glover is one of the most memorable scum of all time. He is sloppy, sometimes funny, and always on the verge of insanity. In addition, there is the character of Robert Trebor (by the way, a good name), Leo, who is clearly confused in this blackmail scheme. He is whimpering, sweaty, cowardly, who leads a spectacular show with live nude models. Then you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shea, a brooding sociopath everyone fears with a good reason. Who could forget the wake-up call that he gives to Vanity with a giant teddy bear? <br /> <br /> After the first shock of knowing what he was facing, Scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation until Glover follows his wife! The conflict is played out cruelly, almost the entire cast is shot, raped or blown up. <br /> <br /> I don’t know why I love this movie so much. It really should scare me, but it is not. Maybe this is because all these characters are interesting, and the story has many chances that most films would never have tried today. It is terrible to think that in the adult film industry there are probably several characters, such as Glover, running around Los Angeles in search of trouble. Just thinking about his voice is enough to make me laugh. “Hey, sport, have a nice day!” <br /> <br /> There are a lot of shootouts, cool cars, great dialogue (as in my opening remarks) and decent game in this film. A lot of cameos for real life porn stars. Look for Ron Jeremy, frolicking in a hot tub with two chicks at a party at Glover. <br /> <br /> Another thing I have to add: how hot are the women in this movie ??? Blimey! Travolta did the right thing by marrying Kelly Preston. Yum! We also see that Vanity is exposed just before it became a reborn Christian. And Ann-Margret. What else could you say about her, except that she is a typical American beauty. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Dog, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Posted on February 14, 2008: RIP Roy Shader!
