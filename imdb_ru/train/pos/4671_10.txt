Glory to the authors of this film for creating an extremely attractive drama. The development of curious characters suggests a fine and well-trained writing team. Member of the audience can not help but feels that he (and) must make painful emotional decisions, contrasting the brain and the libidinal. The viewer has the opportunity to develop the character himself, although her predictions are rarely confirmed. <br /> <br /> The authors of the film are also grateful to the directors for breathing life into the atmosphere. The wood shop turns into a unique person as the film unfolds, with its own traits, flaws, many tensions and, of course, a fate inexorably linked to the fate of other directors. > Be sure to catch it in your local art house.
