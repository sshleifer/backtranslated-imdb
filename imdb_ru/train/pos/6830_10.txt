Many reviews here explain the history and characters of the "Opening Night" in some detail, so I will not do that. I just want to add my comment that I believe that the film is an excellent confirmation of life. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Myrtle Gordon recalls how “easy” it was to play when she was 17, when she was young and energetic, and felt that she knew the truth. The experience left her emotionally fragile, wondering what her life was for and, indeed, can she even continue to live. The tragic accident causes a personal crisis, which almost overwhelms her. <br /> <br /> Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour, she reopens the power of her art and reasserts herself (“I'm going to bury this bastard,” she says of another actor, Maurice, who steps onto the stage) It seems almost sadistic when Director Myrtle makes it difficult for people to help her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance. He knows, however, that she must have the courage to do it herself, if she wants to do it at all. <br /> <br /> Some critics are wondering if this triumph is just a temporary pause on the way down the myrtle. I believe that this is really her “premiere” - she, like a flower, opens up new possibilities for life and action, she sees the way forward. This is incredibly touching. <br /> <br /> Gene Rowlands is great. The film is great. Thank you, Mr. Cassavetes, wherever you are.
