This is a very beautiful and almost meditative film - there is almost no dialogue in it, except for the narration; and the scenery and music complement each other perfectly. At first, I did not tie up the girlâ€™s red hair and foxes until a friend pointed them out to me (who also has red hair!). This is an almost old-fashioned type of children's film, which says that children currently prefer animations such as Shrek, Toy Story, etc., but I feel that young people need to become more familiar with the beauty and wonders of nature. which this movie definitely makes. Perhaps not the best movie of this type, but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages, and not just for children.
