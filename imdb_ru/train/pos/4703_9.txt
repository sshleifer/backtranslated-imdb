This film is very funny. His cast immediately clicks from the first frame and sends us on a wonderful trip through fake gangster films. The conflict between brother and brother occurs when brother Johnny becomes a benefactor D.A. Nevertheless, the best character is a rival to Johnny Crimonord, and Moroni is too accented. Johnny says: "This person should be arrested for killing English." <br /> <br /> Check it out on video. It is worth seeing.
