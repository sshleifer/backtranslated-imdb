Rarely a film can literally make the whole audience laugh, and after five minutes tears fill their eyes. Many films try to do this, but few can have the emotional impact this film has made. Adam Sandler practically draws you in with his hot and often violent flashes, but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past does not pull him down. I'm not going to spoil anything, but there is one special scene in which your eyes should water and shake. Even the most macho men had to be heartless bastards, so as not to feel something while watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another great performance, but Sandler avoided it. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith give solid performances, but nothing in the line of the two main roles. Sandler's humor is still present, which actually saved this film from being overwhelming the boundaries. There are some laughter, but do not think that you will stay there for a long time, because it becomes serious again without much warning. <br /> <br /> I could go on and talk about how well this film sounded just about every emotion that the human body contains, but I will cut this one off. I feel that there is no need to tell you anything else. Do yourself a favor and take the time to watch this movie. Even if you have to wait until it is released on DVD, itâ€™s 100% worth the time. A deeply touching film that will surely cause tears in your eyes and a smile on your face ... unless, of course, you are not a heartless soul.
