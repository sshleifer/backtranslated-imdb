Terry Gilliam gives a terrific movie that I really liked. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt and even a small exterior of Christover Plummer make the movie absolutely brilliant! This is the only Terry Gilliam film I've ever seen, and Twelve Monkeys definitely included in my top 10. and brad pitt is the best. Brad Pitt delivers excellent performance. Probably one of the top ten actor performances I've ever seen. He played his part (Jeffrey) very convincingly. The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was also quite convincing. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt acted extraordinarily well. With a brilliant story to support great performances; and to support this, the excellent director Terry Gilliam.
