Adam Jones film "Cross Eyed" encourages the viewer to the journey of redemption, as the protagonist regains the steering wheel and adjusts his life. Adam Jones found a creative and refreshing way to strengthen his character and realize what matters most. These truths become obvious both to the characters and to the audience when you laugh and envy the credits with them. Simple but attractive settings / costumes make you think about what you see next. You can not help but smile and laugh at the antics that occur in this film. I can't wait for his sophomore. It's only a matter of time before Jones strikes again. Bravo!
