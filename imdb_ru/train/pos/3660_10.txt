This unclear de Sica delivers the goods. And it is said: "the meek shall inherit the earth." This is a story about activities on the surface, but in fact an allegory for all the homeless who inhabited Europe after the great war. They are homeless, but funny, in societies too poor and selfish to care for them or to recognize them as supports for Italian cowboys. de Sica prefers to tell it like a fairy tale, a story about Cinderella. I have not read the book on which it is based, so I cannot foresee whether deus ex machina is the construction of the writer or Vittorio. It begins with the words “Once upon a time ...” to illustrate the timelessness of its history, because history can be everywhere. The caricature sketches of the aristocracy, which is to the bone marrow, the bizarre nature of the homeless, especially when they begin to fulfill their desires, and the ending right from the Spielberg painting makes this bulan an admiration for everyone. De Sica's most accessible painting is also one of his best. Rejecting neorealism, he was always keen on this and the good old good filmmaking, he creates a film that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with anguish of hope, which must continue to be left in this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
