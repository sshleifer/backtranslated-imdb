This is an honest attempt to make a charmingly sweet love story. The obvious inspiration for the successful Bewitched series, this sweet, sweet rom-com, is an eternal treasure. Comparisons are obvious. Jimmy Stewart plays an unfortunate, but passionless "straight." Kim Novak plays a voluptuous blond witch who captures him with a love spell. but when this spell is destroyed by a stronger witch, she is content with the responsibilities of managing her own shop and is comforted by the fact that her favorite piano player (her feline friend) takes care of her favorite aunt. You will learn an aunt from Murder by Death. This film is cheerful and touchingly sweet, with an incredible wit and a pleasant feeling. worth seeing.
