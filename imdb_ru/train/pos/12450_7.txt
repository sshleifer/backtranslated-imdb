I rented and looked at this short (<90 minutes) job. To date, this is the best treatment that Modesty received in the cinema - and its creator Peter O'Donnell agrees, participating as a “Creative Consultant” Character and we, who love her, are treated with respect. Spiegel's direction is the best he has done to date, and the casting was very well done. Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect in comparison with Jim Holdaway's original illustrations on Modesty. Awesome find, whoever dumped it! Raymond Cruz, like the young Raphael Garcia, was also excellent. I hope that Tarantino and Co. I will continue to do more in the series - I am particularly interested to see who they will choose as the incomparable Willy Garvin!
