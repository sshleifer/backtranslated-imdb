Why this type of compact, entertaining mystery can not be removed in the new century? It makes the viewer think and guess to the end. The cast is a great ensemble. William Powell demonstrates the true stellar quality. Who knows - maybe he rehearsed for his future as Nick Charles. It's nice to look at him. You can also understand why Eugene Pallett shot more than 200 films. He is a great supporting actor, and his great chemistry with Powell is fun to watch. Mary Astor performs above-average work in a not very greasy role. All other hands make it a very pleasant way to spend 73 minutes. I suspect that Michael Curtis had the ball directing it. Bravo!
