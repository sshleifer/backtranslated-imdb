Noni Hazlehurst, Colin Friels, Alice Garner, Chrissy Amflett and Michael Caton - what more can you ask for? The Monkey Clutch, based on the award-winning novel of the same name, explores Nora (Hazlehurst, a single mother in love with the heroin addict Joba (Frila). A simple story becomes truly unusual thanks to a great acting game (in particular, Noni Hazlehurst) and good use a small budget. The only drawback (if you can pick it up) is that the plot unfolds in Melbourne, although for budgetary reasons the film was shot mostly in Sydney, therefore in several scenes. You see a tram and (scenes in Melbourne), and then the post office in Carlton (scenes in Sydney). In addition, “Monkey Grip” is a must-see (sorry, but it is), at least for the award-winning performance from the former “ Games "Leading Schools" and "Best Homes and Gardens" by Noni Hazlehurst. <br /> <br /> 10/10
