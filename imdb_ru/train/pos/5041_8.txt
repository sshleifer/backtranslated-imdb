Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Bute) in his FBI office. He claims to have information about a serial killer pursued by the FBI. When Agent Doyle arrives at the office, he tells him that the serial killer is really his dead brother. Agent Doyle asks for some evidence, and this person tells the story of his life since childhood. It was a simple family of three: his widow, Father Makes (Bill Paxton), his brother, and himself. One night, his father gathers two brothers and tells them that an angel of God had just visited him and instructed his family to destroy the demons. What's next is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie four months ago on VHS, and yesterday I looked again, now on DVD. Although it is a low-budget film, the script is sharp, flawless. The cast is outstanding, but I would like to mention the performance of Matt O'Leary as the young Felton. This is a very difficult and difficult role for a young teenager. The direction of Bill Paxton is wonderful. There is no apparent violence in this horror movie. Great debut for the camera. I regret the Brazilian title of this film: “Mão do Diabo” (“Devil's Hand”). If at least it was the “Hand of God”, it could be acceptable. But to call this film "the hand of the devil" is really funny. Screenwriter Brent Hanley does not deserve such disrespect from the Brazilian distributor. This film is highly recommended. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Mão do Diabo” (“The Devil's Hand”).
