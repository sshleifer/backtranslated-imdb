And I absolutely adore Isabel Blaise !!! She was so sweet in this film and very different from her role in Quebec-Montreal, where she looked more like a cannibal. I think she should have been nominated for Yutru. I mean, Seawee Moreau was good, but Isabel was much better, IMO. Pelletier did a great job the first time, and I noticed that he sneaked into a couple of his buddies from Rock et Belles Oreilles, Guy A. Lepag and Andre Ducharm. It was fun to see them in it, I did not know that they were going to appear. <br /> <br /> I don’t think I’ve seen a romantic comedy from Quebec, which I didn’t like, and it’s as good as all I had the pleasure of seeing. And if you're in the states and you wonder how you can get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca delivered it to me in less than a week.
