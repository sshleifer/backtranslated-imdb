It’s always sad when most moviegoers ignore such films. “Panic” is an amazingly convincing and piercing study of a character who feels caught in the meaninglessness of his own life. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy, like Alex, is as convincing as ever. This wonderful actor seems to have a special talent for pulling the strings of the heart, no matter how wicked his characters; we can not always indulge the lifestyles of the main characters, which he plays, but the emotions of fear and confusion, which he causes in us, are often too painfully familiar. The name "Panic" at first glance seems paradoxical, given the lack of obvious emotions. At some point, Alex tells his doctor that he is rarely angry. However, as this story progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that rage and despair, and not indifference, are the driving forces behind the existence of this person. <br /> <br /> More than once they reminded me of his performance in Fargo, another strongly character-driven movie. In both Fargo and Panic, we see a middle-aged man who somehow seems to be out of balance with the rest of his life. He has gone astray, and the only way back is deceptive, it seems darkness. He knows what makes the wrong choice, but despair overcomes composure and common sense. <br /> <br /> Alex contacts Sarah, a 23-year-old woman (with the horror of playing Neva Campbell), with whom he meets at the doctor. office. Thematically, this union is not an accident, but the work of fate. Alex finds a certain consolation, being with Sarah, feeling that, perhaps, she is a tramp as he is, lost and wandering aimlessly for the rest of her life, powerlessly waiting for her inevitable end. <br /> <The choice of such films is an insightful and convincing way for Neva Campbell to respond to those critics who question her acting ability. Too often, the characters she played are weakness, offering Campbell no depth to bend her acting muscles. This view, however, can be a revelation to many. <br /> <br /> In the ideal world of cinema, not only would many other films appear, such as Panic, but they would also be appreciated and appreciated by a much wider audience. If you watch movies on the subject of wealth and depth characteristics, and not just on the most modern special effects, then for you, "Panic" will not miss. A +.
