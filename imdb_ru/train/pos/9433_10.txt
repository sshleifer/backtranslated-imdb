The spectacular film about the four city dudes in the face of the Appalachian crisis has become synonymous with rural depravity. Each of the four businessmen are faced with their darkest fears when they embark on a difficult trip to Whitewater, on the river, which will be replaced by a dam. When local residents on this path decide to “orient” with violators, this leads to several deaths and many injuries for the survivors. Each of the travelers is outstanding, although Voight gives leadership and the most powerful performances. Rural landscapes and cultures are well covered, including an exciting banjo duel sequence. I saw it on a date when it came out, not quite a perfect date movie (although we both enjoyed it). I kind of remember this as a dramatic performance for Bert, Voight has already been created. Not the movie that you could watch every week, but it has a strong impact and is beautifully shot.
