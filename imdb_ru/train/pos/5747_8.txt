If you have at least some heart and compassion for people, this film is difficult to watch, at least in the second half. <br /> <br /> It is in this segment that we see a pretty young child being beaten, and then a retarded (mentally retarded) man goes into a deep end after he witnesses this cruel act against a child. This is not pleasant stuff. <br /> <br /> However, this is a good film, and acting is also good. The story will sit with you for a while. <br /> <br /> Dominic is a mentally retarded guy played by Tom Hulse. I think this might be the best Khalsa role. He is looked after by medical student "Eugene" performed by Ray Liotta, who next year became a star with Kevin Costner's "Field of Dreams". <br /> <br /> Dominic is a kind-hearted garbage man who reads "The Hulk" loves comics and fights. He's the type of "slow" guy you can't help but love and cheer for a happy life. When he goes crazy, it happens for several good reasons and ... well, watch the movie entirely. Itâ€™s worth your time, but be prepared to go on real emotional roller coasters and maybe be very upset about some of the things you see.
