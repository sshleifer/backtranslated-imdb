Vaguely reminiscent of the great westerns of the 1940s, such as The Treasures of the Sierra Madre (1948), The Red Stone in the West is a story about conscience, greed, and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is an unhappy but honest young man from Texas who goes west looking for work and money. He finds both, but not in the way he expected. <br /> <br /> The film script contains many surprises and plot twists. Excellent cinematography, deft editing of films and sullen western music add tension and tension. The expansiveness of the country of large skies provides a wonderful setting. And acting ranges from good to excellent, with great performances by Dennis Hopper and J. T. Walsh. Dwight Joacam's specially recorded country / western song gives the film a strong final. <br /> <br /> Properly labeled as neo-noir, Red Rock West also strikes me as something else. The plot is full of amazing coincidences and incredible timing, so much so that others may regard the script as erroneous. I would usually agree. In this case, however, in combination with the capricious atmosphere and the fact that the small town of Red Rock seems almost empty of ordinary daily life, coincidences and unlikely periods suggest that, in addition to "noir", this ... unreal. As if fate intentionally intervenes in unbelievable events in order to force Michael to fight with himself. From this point of view, coincidences are not at all disadvantages of the scenario. They are necessary plot points in a nightmarish story of a young man who must confront his own demons ... disguised as other characters. <br /> <br /> All we need here is Rod Serling in a postscript explaining in his always clearly pronounced voice that ... a young man looking for himself stops in a small, almost deserted town a thousand miles from from nowhere. This is his last move to the ... twilight zone.
