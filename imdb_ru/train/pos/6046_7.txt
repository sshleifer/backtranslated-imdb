I was pleasantly surprised by the film. Let's face it; the premise does not seem particularly attractive when you have to donate money for a night movie, but she had a calm character that wins alone. There were no moments that I found outrageous, and I doubt that I will remember the next day, but this is not a good diversion. What seemed ridiculous to me was to watch here in Beijing with my Chinese girl who never understood what I liked. I told her that there was a plot - three guys have to bring some grass to London. It hardly gives her pleasure. There is no camera robbery here, which I expected after reading a number of comments. However, I make an exception to compare with Withnail and I; not in the same league, and I doubt it was intended. www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
