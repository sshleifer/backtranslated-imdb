I think the thing with this film is that it has about 2 minutes of really, really funny moments, and it makes a very good trailer, and many people came up with expectations from the trailer, and this time the film did not justify the trailer. It's a bit sluggish and slowly stretches for such an exciting premise, and I think I see from the comments of people having a love / hate relationship with this film. <br /> <br /> However, if you look in this film, what it is, and not what it could count on, given the talent of the actors, I think it is still pretty good. Julia Stiles is definitely a star, she is so frivolous and carefree that she questions all the others, she just glows, and the entire public falls in love with her along with Lee. The rest of the cast, of course, colleagues Lee, filled with testosterone, his elegant mother-in-law, his brotherly friend Jim and his future bride - all do an excellent job with the stereotypes of conformity and dullness that make Stiles stand out first. <br /> <br /> Lee doesn’t justify his colleagues, I don’t think, but you could consider it as something more than it’s hard to live. Maybe this is one of the sources of frustration. <br /> <br /> The film itself, despite its slight sluggishness and a few jokes that don’t seem as funny as the author intended, is still quite funny, and I found a rather clever movie. The themes of conformity and “taking the safe path” seemed to be cleverly aligned on several levels. For example, there was a whole motive of how he presented scenarios, but never acted on them until the last scene, or how he listened to a radio program on the highway, telling how everyone obeys, or just how everything works. The characters of Julia Stiles said and did that they repeated topics in which one person was a safe choice, and the other a risky one. <br /> <br /> Another good thing about the film was that it was a kind of comedy comedy. in which Jason Lee must continue to lie in the film, and to whom - because of stupid luck (example: the guy from the pharmacy turns out to be a good chef) and some ingenuity on his part it gets away with for the most part. <br /> <br /> Although it was not as funny as I expected, and there was a bit of wasted talent, but overall it’s still a good movie.
