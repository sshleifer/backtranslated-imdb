I can’t say that this film was disappointing because I read some reviews before watching it and it didn’t work out the way I thought it would be. The bar was not set so high, so the fact that my expectations were met did not say much. <br /> <br /> Good: the city of New York. If you live in the same city as me, you will recognize certain places and understand that the city should be not just an setting, but one of the main characters. There are truly tender moments, humorous conversations and plot twists left and right, which all make things interesting. <br /> <br /> The bad: the first thing I thought after leaving the theater was that I wanted more, but not in a positive fashion “leave them wanting more.” Of course, the good parodies / scenes outweigh the bad ones, but there are a lot of parodies that fall into the category of "intermediate", in fact there are too many of them, which ultimately leads to a crash. In addition, the diversity of New York, although it alludes to many distant panoramas of the city and is mentioned in the conversation throughout the film, is in fact never realized and not analyzed to such an extent as to justify the city. For example, many parodies attract good to whites of middle age. I mean, I know that the city is home to many of the demographic data mentioned, but come on, the plot and the variety of Paris Zhetyma characters make New York look like Lancaster, Pennsylvania, or somewhere really white. It is just annoying to see that the city is deprived of its heritage. <br /> <br /> However, even after I said that, I would recommend giving New York, I love you, kind. Who knows, maybe you do not agree with my opinion, but maybe not. You will never know until you see it yourself. This review is not intended to keep anyone from watching this film, as each person’s opinion about art is different. I just give you a very vague idea of ​​what to expect.
