HOLES is not an ordinary Disney material, it is very, very fun, even for adults who usually cringe in a relaxed, “focus group” family entertainment that Uncle Walt’s studio gives off as live action. Perhaps the secret of the success of this film lies in its loyalty to the original book, which is slightly darker than that of an ordinary child. The action begins when Stanley Yelnatz is sent to a prison camp for boys, where all prisoners are forced to dig holes in the desert sun as a form of rehabilitation. But as the story progresses, Stanley is intertwined with the legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any Disney movie about the boys' camp to which he is entitled. John Voight is especially disgusting and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.
