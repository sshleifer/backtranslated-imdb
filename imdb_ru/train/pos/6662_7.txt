Gandhi, my father, is a well-made film. It beautifully depicts the life of the eldest son of Gandgi Harilal. His character, his disagreements with his father, his love for his family, his desire to stand up for himself, his failure, his ego. Akshay Khanna fully justifies the role of Harilal. Only not he, everyone succeeded in the roles that have played. Darshan Jariwala is the best Gandhi I ever saw. But I will cut down three points, since there were few flaws. <br /> <br /> First, the film lasted fifteen to twenty minutes more than it should. Secondly, the film needed more research into the character of Harilal. Somewhere the character looked unfinished. In addition, his relationship with his brothers was not shown. There was no mention of any other child of Gandhi throughout the film. I believe that a character like Harilal should have at least some differences from his brothers, given the egoistic nature of Harilal. <br /> <br /> In any case, despite some flaws, I liked the movie.
