The "first night" of John Cassavetes is fantastic and exciting; fantastic, because he plays with the deepest fears that we have in our imagination, exciting, because he never ceases to amaze us. With a very long duration of two hours and twenty minutes, anyone who values ​​characters cannot take their eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> The story of the unstable actress Myrtle Gordon (Gene Rowlands)) is trying to get together for the game, fighting with demons; "Opening Night" tells not only about a woman on the verge of collapse, but also about the complexities of the life of theater actors and theatrical world. All the heroes of Cassavetis here are experienced people who know about the world of theater; therefore, half of the film takes place on the stage where the performers do their work, or behind the scenes where producers, writers and directors do their work. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes is so stern with its characters that this malevolence turns to the audience, and the audience in the cinema. Because in the movie theater there is another audience that does not know what is really going on and laughs, because they think that everything is a performance. And this is essentially what it is; Just the audience in the theater can not see "behind the scenes" as we are. They do not experience the abundance of Gena Rowlands before she reaches this stage, but most importantly; they do not know the reasons why she behaves the way she does. <br /> <br /> I always thought it would be difficult to be friends with an actor. Myrtle (Rowland) says that she is an actress, and that is the only thing she can do; and I think that if I had a friend who was a professional performer, it would be very difficult to tell when he was telling the truth, because I would know that he is an actor and he can fake anything at any time. Does a lot of what Myrtle does during the horrible experiences of the film make her worry? We suspect she is real; the other characters are also suspected. <br /> <br /> There is a writer Sarah (Joan Blondel) who cannot understand why Myrtle does not understand the character she wrote for her. There is a director Manny (Ben Gazzar) who cannot accept the fact that his best actress can lose him; producer David (Paul Stewart), who does not know where to stand, and colleague Myrtle Maurice (Cassavetis himself), who cannot deal with the love they have for each other. <br /> <br /> When she witnesses the death of a teenager, a fan; All this unites and affects Myrtle, but no one knows whether its illusions are real. They do not say anything because they do not want to upset her, but the film enters the state of the subconscious, which only Myrtle accepts. Sometimes we can say that it was at all. In these moments, Cassavetes's brilliant screenplay depicts terrible brutal honesty in the words that the characters utter during the discussion behind the scenes; and not only what everyone says Myrtle, but also what she tells them. <br /> <br /> There are people here who are not afraid to express their opinions and constantly change what they think, just like Cassavetis makes a movie, and in this aspect, the actions here are more important than in “Shadows”, because that the characters are involved in the big picture; big story that comes out of the trivial. <br /> <br /> But in another aspect, the real way to create a movie, this film is no different from Shadow. The fact that Al Ruban’s camera shoots characters is a wonderful thing. When someone speaks, the camera does not focus on him, but takes a picture of the person who is listening; so that we can see how he or she responds to what the other is saying. Sometimes they do not care, sometimes they are happy, sometimes devastated. <br /> <br /> Improvisation can still be there, among all these wonderful performances. Towards the end, an unexpected scene, when Cassavetes and Rowlands begin to talk non-stop. Whether it was improvised or not, we should not be wondering. We just have to look; and observe how they exchange life experiences, and see how words come to life in conversation, which means much more than what it shows? It does not become more natural than this.
