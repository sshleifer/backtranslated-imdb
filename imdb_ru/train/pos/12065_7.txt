"Insignificance" is far from a great film, from the stage play, staged by Nick Rugom. In the film scheme, Horn is above the level of most of his work after Do Not Look Now, characterized by the sensible use of Theresa Russell as lead actress. She is in fact very good here, and she is far from the problems in other Roag films, such as Bad Time and Cold Sky. Like “The Actress”, which is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective, portraying her as a completely depressed, but pretty siren. She plays well with Michael Emil in the role of Einstein, who is superb if not more. It looks great, and although Teresa Russell does not quite look like Monroe, she is certainly attractive enough to make the detail sound believable. Other players are adequate if not as arrested as Emil and Russell. Quite a workable, intelligent script well posed by Rogue, but certainly not brilliantly like “Walk” or “Performance”. As in other later films of Roag, he tends to rely too much on vague, irrelevant memories that add very little to the film. In many ways, a movie would work better as a shorter (say, 60 minutes), more modest part. However, it is an acceptable, tolerable film. At times quite excellent, but somewhat lacking overall. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
