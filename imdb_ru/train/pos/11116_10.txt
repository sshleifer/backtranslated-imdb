“The Godfather”, “Citizen Kane”, “Star Wars”, “Goodfell”. None of the above compares to the complex brilliance of the Soprano Clan. Each character has layers on layers of absolute truth, fully and fully three-dimensional. We sincerely care about Tony Soprano, despite the fact that in the simplest model of good and evil, he is evil. The soprano is the most provocative, intricate and exciting main character ever created at this point in history. If you are in the mood to be an open viewer and forever change your feelings about entertainment, see The Soprano Clan. I can not sit down to anyone and watch the very first episode of the first season, and I do not want to continue the series. Each season is brilliant in its own way.
