This is an obsessive, powerful Italian adaptation of James M. Cain's novel “The Postman Always Rings Twice,” shot by the great Lucino Visconti. What is so interesting about the film is that it goes beyond its original material in all respects, becoming something more daring and more original (which is interesting, Camus also considers Cain's novel a key inspiration for his sign novel Stranger) . The film has more power and intensity than the novel, because Visconti is capable of creating the cinematic equivalent of Cain's narrative structure, but offers a more complex study of gender. Cain's very American novel is also uncritically fascinated by the whiteness construction (the main character Cora obsessively fears recognizing her as Mexican, and is embarrassed that she married a Greek immigrant), which has nothing to do with the Italian rural context, which is to work with Visconti. This allows class antagonism to take center stage and dance among the coals of the passionate, doomed love affair of the two main characters. This film is a complex, stressful, rewarding experience.
