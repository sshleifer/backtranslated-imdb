Verhoeven's film was complete and complete trash. He is a disgusting director hack and should be ashamed. By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, he became bored, and he decided to do it all from scratch. <br /> <br /> Heinlein would NEVER support this rubbish if he were alive to see it. He basically steals the title, mocks the policy of the book (which is a good part of it) and adds some T & A so that the ordinary American moviegoer does not get bored. <br /> <br /> This anime isnâ€™t perfect, but at least basically it's exactly as far as I can tell.
