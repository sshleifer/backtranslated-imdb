In New York, family dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) accidentally meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) on the street. Charlie became a lonely and deranged man after losing his wife and three daughters in the tragic 9/11, while Alan has problems to discuss his innermost feelings with his wife. Alan makes friends with Charlie, and they come closer. Alan is trying to fix Charlie’s life by sending him to psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie takes an aggressive reaction to treatment and goes to court. <br /> <br /> “Reign over me” is a good drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11 is irrelevant to the plot; it could be a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as sexual harassment to Donna Remar, played by the magnificent Saffron Burrows, in front of Alan. But family drama works are supported by the great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is completely impossible to know, I don’t know if she uses excessive makeup to look older, but her face is strange. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Reine Sobre Mim” (“Reign over me”)
