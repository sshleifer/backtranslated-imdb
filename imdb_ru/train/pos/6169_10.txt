Rohinton Mistry's multi-layered novel seemed impossible to adapt to the screen, but the resulting film is full of passion, emotion, humor and pathos. The story is a bit slow, but there is always something on the screen that might be of interest to the public. The film perfectly captures a specific time and place with high accuracy. All the actors - Indians - few people known to the "western" audience - but this is a joy, especially a little girl, who acts very convincingly. Do not start from the title and plot - this is a film that can be seen on the big screen. We have a lot to learn.
