and what a combo. The two great singers of the century are shot together in this underrated musical. He writes music, she writes lyrics, and they both work for Basil Rathbone, who also cannot write, because his wife is dead (in fact, she was just plumper!). The best scene is the pawnshop number where Bing sings an improvised number while the swing group pulls out their tools. Just great. And this is a rare major role for the Broadway legend Mary Martin, and she is pretty good. Charlie Grapevine, John Scott Trotter, William Fowley, Oscar Levant (again a manic pianist), Charles Lane and Helen Bertram, one of the stars. And who knew that Rathbone could be funny?
