I'm glad that users (for this date), who liked this film, are now coming forward. I don’t understand people who didn’t like this film - it looks like they expected a serious (?!?!?) Appeal! C'mon, how the hell can you take seriously the premise of a snowman killer? The filmmakers knew that this was a stupid premise, and they did not try to deny it. The rectilinear scene delivery actually makes it FUN! Yes, there are moments when a show with a low budget (for example, an explosion scene), but I think that an expensive look would deprive the pleasure of the film! So, if you like B-movies and you like a stupid premise, then you will surely like Jack Frost.
