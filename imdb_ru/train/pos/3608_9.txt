Sports films have never been my business, but a small part of them work for me. The best are those that focus less on sports and more on character, such as Raging Bull, Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great directorial debut for Karin Kusama and an outstanding first performance for Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight seems realistic and exciting, enough to make it an unforgettable film. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly straightforward. Diana Guzman, studying in fourth year of high school, but due to the fact that she chooses fights in the corridor, she is close to exile. As a possible means of revealing her anger, she signs up for boxing lessons at a club where her brother is training (at the request of her father). <br /> <br /> For ninety minutes we, the spectators, see something unusual. Diana almost literally turns from a girl into a woman. We see it both in her body and in her behavior, especially when one of the boys in the club is attracted to her, and she interferes with it. There is no bad scene or unconvincing / contrived moment in the film. The only mistake I would say can be corrected in that one of the plots ends in what looks like an unfinished note. In addition, Girlfight is a great movie.
