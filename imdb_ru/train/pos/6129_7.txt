Please note that I did not say it is better ... just more enjoyable. Lack of social commentary and realism helps keep things going. <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised that it was not a film about Tromy, because it contains all of Troma's trademarks, including spewing acidic liquids, wise cracks from a villain after each murder, a ridiculous rape scene a bathroom (it is difficult to get upset about something, as the rapist is a snowman) and stupid deputies. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to love: <br /> <br /> 1. A snowman, who is said to have no legs or feet, is driven by a police cruiser through the city. <br /> <br /> 2. Even though it should be close to (or below) freezing, no one shows breath, and there are no signs of car exhaust when the cars are running. <br /> <br /> 3. Snow is more like peanuts made from flakes or expanded polystyrene than real snow. <br /> <br /> 4. A teenage girl is looking for a guy a few hours after the terrible murder of her brother. She persuades him to break into the sheriff's house, from all places, to put him on. But first she tells him that he must make a good fire in the fireplace and discover some wine. <br /> <br /> 5. After the teenager Jake’s head is cut off by sled runners, his father argues with the sheriff about whether Tommy, the son of the sheriff, has anything to do with it. The sheriff claims that Tommy would not fight with Jake, because Jake is "at least two feet taller than Tommy." At this moment, someone in the background says: “There is no more!” <br /> <br /> 6. When the evil snowman finally begins to thaw, the sheriff fights with a flat snowman, made of some kind of cloth, for a long period. This is much better than Tarzan’s fight with rubber crocodiles or gladiators with stuffed lions. If I were an actor, I would not be able to keep a deadpan character. <br /> <br /> In general, a funny movie. There really is not even much blood.
