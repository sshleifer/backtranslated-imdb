I just love this movie. This is a great example of all-round amazing stories that come out of Asian cinema. There was a recent Hollywood remake of this film with Richard Gere and simply terrible Jennifer Lopez. Please do not confuse two films. The original Japanese film is touching, subtle and beautifully played. The Hollywood version is the exact opposite. I was terrified when I first saw the trailer of a converted version for the United States, and who filmed it. This is typical Hollywood unoriginal rudeness at worst. The remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved. The ONLY reason why the original film has not become more popular is the disgust of the American audience for subtitles. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why this film will never work in an American report is that the restrained, ultra socially conservative nature of the public, the Japanese person is discussed in this film. Of course, the main character wakes up to a fuller understanding of how to live a living life with the help of dance, but half of the film’s tension comes from stereotypes and ridicule experienced by ballroom dancers in Japan. <br /> <br /> Please try to watch this movie in its original form, not a terrible full screen. And please DO NOT DELIVER an American remake .... this is a minor parody compared to the original Japanese film. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that the “original” movie is much older, and it’s just a Japanese movie. continue the story, but in the near future only two people are likely to see: this and the new remake in the USA. <br /> <br /> Speaking of foreign films, I will give some quick recommendations: 1. Monsoon's Wedding - I list this first for a reason, an outstanding film! 2. Johnny Stechino - Very Funny Italian Mistaken Flick! 3.Shiri is a Korean action movie that combines both an Asian flash and an American-style plot. 4.Run Lola Run is a German film in which his techno points are originally combined. <br /> <br /> Well, anyway, just a quick list: -)
