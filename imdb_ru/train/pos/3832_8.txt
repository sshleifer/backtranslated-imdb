One day late in the evening on a deserted road, in an empty saloon, Martin Sheen spins the yarn for Robert Carradine of Hopalong Cassidy and his friends, tracking down a group of cattle killers who killed several men and kidnapped the girl Cassidy. <br /> Writer / director Christopher Coppola Perhaps he was angry with the purists of William Boyd, who decided to make a modern low-budget film featuring their beloved Hoppy, but I'm glad he did it! No character should be so attached to the actor, so that no one else is allowed to play him or her again! <br /> <br /> I thought it would be fun and interesting to upgrade the classic programmers of the thirties and forties. Although he is guilty of a bad game, he is quite serious and unassuming, and I find it difficult not to like him. <br /> <br /> Although the whole performance is a bit strange, I really liked the scenes between Sheen and Carridin. The fact that we see the story inside the story makes weird and exaggeration more acceptable.
