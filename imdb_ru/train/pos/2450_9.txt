I have been watching this show since I was 14 years old and since then I have loved it. I love this show, because it is just ridiculous! You will love this show, because it shows something new and more fun every day, and my favorite part is when Benny always has the latest comments on George after each highlight about his fat giant head. with my friends at home it would be as if we were watching a funny movie, but short. Love George Lopez. Cheerful, talented, fun, entertaining. This is a cool, funny family comedy series that everyone will like and you will definitely like - I did! And if you haven't watched it yet, I suggest you start looking, because you don't want to stop watching it. Despite the fact that there are no more new series, I still enjoy the repetitions. Still funny. Never erased. <br /> <br /> 9/10
