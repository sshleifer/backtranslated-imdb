This film never received the attention it deserved, although it is one of the best parts of the ensemble game and one of the most realistic stories I have seen on the screen. Clearly shot on a small budget in real V.A. The hospital, the center of the story - Joel, very well played by Eric Stolz. Joel was paralyzed in a motorcycle accident and goes to hospital in the ward with other men who have spinal injuries. Joel is in love with Anna, his married mistress, played by Helen Hunt, who is showing the early signs of his later work, the Academy Award. <br /> <br /> Although the Joel-Anna relationship is the main goal, there are many other well-developed characters in the ward. Wesley Snipes does a tremendous job like the evil Raymond. Even more impressive is William Forsyth as a bitter and racist Bloss. I think that the two best scenes of Forsyth, when he gets upset and angry at the dancers, and then when he feels sympathy for the young Korean, who was shot in a wine shop, is delayed. My favorite scene with Snipes is a discussion of round tables about sexual opportunities after injury. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Stolz and Hunt is very strong, and they have two very intimate, but not free sex scenes. Orgasm in the chamber is sexy and fun. There is another memorable scene in which Joel, Bloss and a Korean guy deliver a specially equipped van to a strip bar. This is really a comedy with mistakes, as they make their weak attempts to make the van see "naked ladies." <br /> <br /> This story becomes even more acute because director Neil Jimenez is paralyzed in real life. This is mainly his story. This film is real, not glossy or flashy. Having so many talents in a film with such a small budget is amazing. I recommend this film to anyone I see, because this is one of those films that even improve the look. It's a shame that such a wonderful work is overlooked, but with the help of the video, perhaps it can attract the attention that it deservedly deserves.
