If you could drive away the soul and the sport - no, a clean lifestyle - from surfing to perfect form, this documentary would do it. This documentary shows that life is not only about waves, but also about people, pioneers and the modern avant-garde, who are driving a greater wave further than ever. <br /> <br /> Stacy Peralta, a virtual legend from my early 80s, when I was a teenager in SoCal, edited a lot of amazing materials and interview materials and created something that is not just a documentary, but a masterpiece of the genre. When his heart and soul are in the subject - and clearly this is here - his genius is fraught with pure vision, which is not glamorous, does not deceive, or sentimentalizes his subject. He respects the surfers and the surfing / beach lifestyle, but also does not bleach him. In this sport there is a harsh reality. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that can be said about this documentary film about surfers, the early history of sports and the wild surfers of the big wave that it describes. Greg Knoll, the first big wave personality who may have become a pioneer in sports; Jeff Carter, an amazing guy who, for 15 years, rode practically alone on the great surf of the extremely dangerous Maverick in Northern California; and the centerpiece of the Laird Hamliton documentary, the current messiah surfing on a big wave. <br /> <br /> Among these guys there is a huge heart and warmth, as well as several girls who appear on camera - and a deep and strong love for surfing and the ocean, which permeates every word. I found a story about how Hamilton’s adoptive father met him and how Hamilton, being a small 4–5-year-old boy, practically forced him to become his father, especially warming (and again devoid of syrup-like sentimentality). <br /> <br /> If you like surfing - or even if you don’t do it - this is a wonderful documentary to watch, if only because you are a student of the form or someone who just appreciates incredibly well done art work.
