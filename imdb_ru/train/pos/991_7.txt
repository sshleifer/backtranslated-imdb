I am really shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this film. This film was not conceived as a film of “deep thought,” as most reviewers apparently believe. In fact, it may seem that if ANY film does not give life-changing insight and a deep, perverted, stunning plot, they would rate it as 1 or 2. Do not throw the film away because you don’t like the genre, people. <br /> <br /> This film was an action / comedy film, and that's all it was supposed to be. And for the action movie / comedy it was very well done. In fact, I was rather surprised that I liked it the same way I did, I was never a fan of Jamie Foxx and had an overly used story that he had. <br /> <br /> The plot was not spectacular, using a typical criminal out of jail and conspiring with a bad guy, trying to bring order to their actions (see Blue Lane, Hudson Hawk, 48 hours, etc. ., etc., etc.), but it was heated with a slight technological turn. Now the “bad guys” are actually the “good guys”, and the REAL “bad boy” is just a fan. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx actually plays convincingly with a sense of humor, but at the same time is quite a smart and serious main character, and did not try to overdo the humorous side of the film. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a deep plot such as The Matrix, or a drama such as From Mouse and Man, then this film is not for you. But if you enjoy the raw fighter, excellent high-speed shooting and random twist of humor, this movie will not disappoint you. Normally, I would rate it at about 8 (on the same level as in the Die Hard trilogy), but instead gave 10 to try to bring the score to the point that MUST be. <br /> <br />
