I really like this movie. Bozz is a cool, not shy soldier who doesn't want to go to war. His character is similar to Yossarian in Trick-22, a classic Joseph Heller novel about people and war. This film, however, unfolds not in a combat zone, but in pre-war combat training. This wonderful film tells you that the Vietnam War was a mistake, and the people who were sacrificed for the loss. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell is great, like Bozz, a soldier who showed great sincere love and compassion for his fellow soldier because he really despised disrespect for the establishment who tried to kill him. Bozz is absolutely cool and not without pluses, he tests and adjusts his military bosses, getting a goat at every opportunity. He is a figure of Jesus Christ with a degree of psychology that “rescues” his fellow soldiers and shows those who really need, the withdrawal from the man’s army. <br /> <br /> Actions and actions are clear, believable and as “Sleeping”, Tigerland comes down from Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as one of the three best films about Vietnam, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> FIVE STARS, the best choice.
