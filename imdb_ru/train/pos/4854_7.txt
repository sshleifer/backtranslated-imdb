Roll up with it in a dark and stormy night and get ready to take turns to have fun, get annoyed and scared. The raspy old story about a ghostly train, which, as they say, runs through a lonely English countryside in the deep of the night, may be implausible, but it is very fun. There are some wonderful old stamps, such as “TROUBLE”, which the locals can remember, but will not talk about them. But first and foremost, the film is a medium for the comedian Arthur Asuka, in order to demonstrate his special vaudeville style of humor between scary beats. Asuka’s vicious humor is not very fashionable these days, but if you just let him take a shower, it can be fun. This is probably the best movie of Asuka.
