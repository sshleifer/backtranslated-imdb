Often, only years later, we can look back and see those stars that really are stars. As the French film critic said, whose name eludes me: “No, Garbo. No Dietrich. There is only Louise Brooks "; and there, thank god! Louise Brooks! This is the third of its European masterpieces. But it’s also an exceptional film to become one, if not the first French speaker, to follow the script written by the famous Rene Claire, to finish (i.e., the direction) George Pabst, and to include Edith Piaf before she was known! So many talents over the film and above it, can it not be a masterpiece ?! And that's what this movie is. It is a pity that Louise Brooks came to Hollywood when she returned to the States - so many talents were so arrogantly relegated to the background! In the film, besides the fact that I am watching Louise Brooks in action, it's great to see photos of Paris at approx. 1930 and hear the young voice of Piaf. I never get tired of this movie!
