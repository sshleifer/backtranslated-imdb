In this film, â€œJen is sexy, as always, and Polly, wow, we really were so young that this film can still touch the hearts of many teenagers, it will soon need to be recorded on DVD, or it will become a classic. In this film, I was always in love with Jen, now I'm too old, but this film was made for all people> you know, I am from the early 80s, where I had to watch everyone live the life I wanted, but through films that I can do it again and again, I think, in short, I hope and want this film not to be lost in time, but revived for young people so that they can enjoy the warmth of the heart, which you get by learning about hormones and dating problems and how to get it done with things that seem so important at that time, but have nothing to do with it, so this film is a dating tool.
