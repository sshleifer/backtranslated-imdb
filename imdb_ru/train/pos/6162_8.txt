I liked this masterpiece, and, frankly, I also found Mary Poppins (although I love Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyk) silly and sacredly sweet. Angela Lansbury to perfection plays its character, and I do not know why people consider this film distorted. It was magical and it was a lot of fun to watch. Each scene carried a certain charm, since you knew the characters better. You truly see how this small, discarded family learns to communicate with each other, despite age and differences. I thought the characters were well developed, especially Charles, who was in the Age of Unbelief. Mary Poppins may be more popular and loved by others, but this little gem will be one that I will always love and cherish.
