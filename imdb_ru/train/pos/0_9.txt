Bromwell High is a comedy. It ran at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as "Teacher". My 35 years in the teaching profession led me to believe that the satire of Bromwell Hai is much closer to reality than the “Teacher”. The struggle for financial survival, astute students who can see through the panic of their wretched teachers, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of schools that I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which the student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately remembered ......... in .......... Highly. Classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to fire one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect many adults of my age to think that Bromwell High is contrived. What a pity that it is not so!
