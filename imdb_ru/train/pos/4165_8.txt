No, this horribly horrible horror clinker, created for 70s television, is not about a deadly obsessed dessert. Nevertheless, it is extremely awful, but undoubtedly amusing and such a pleasant cathode ray of scum reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute, relentless stupidity and ferocity, that it is rather tasty in such a disgusting way â€” this is a straight-surprising way. Richard Krenna, looking haggard and possibly drunk, and Yvette Mimier, who behaves as if she had never experienced violent rape, which she endured in Jackson County Jail, sluggishly portraying the disgustingly sweet and respectable suburban couple whose strange a dull, sleepy little town of existence is torn apart when a cute German shepherd, which they adopt as a pet, turns out to be an ancient deadly evil spirit. Pretty soon, Mime and her two repulsive cute kids Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (extrasensory aliens from Disney's "Mountain of Witches") worship a rough pencil drawing of a nasty, ugly canine essence in a den. Boy, doesn't it really sound scary and disturbing? Well, scary and anxious this ridiculous, absurd slam, of course not, but it's certainly funny, thanks to Curtis' hopelessly weak direction (Harriston's Nighttime Tide), cartoony (not-so) special effects, almost painfully risky and ridiculous plot and acting the composition, which bravely fights against the absurd history (besides the main characters, Martin Besvik and RG Armstrong briefly appear as members of the satanic cult, and Victor Jory has an excellent cameo as a useful shaman of Native Americans). Favorite scene: the angry fool Mefestofelion strikes Krenne, practically forcing him to put his hand in the wildly rotating blade of the lawn mower. While fans of shy snobish horror films can hold their noses on the completely putrid stench of this admittedly smelly goofy lover, TV trash lovers should consider this strikingly hideous by-product the equivalent of Alpo.
