I would like children's films to still be made this way; dark and deep. It was (understand this) character development (and Charlie is the epitome of a dynamic character), plot development, excellent animation, emotional involvement and a rational, comparable and consistent theme. If it were not for a handful of songs and dances, you would never think that this is a children's film, and that is why I appreciate it so highly. This film is a great movie, not to mention a children's film. This brings me to the second point: it must be the darkest “childish” film that I saw for a long time, it is from a 22-year-old. I would be shocked to see any child under the age of 8 who was not completely scared for most of the second half and part of the first half of the film, and it all ends with one of the saddest ends you've ever come across (ala Jurassic Bark, for those of you who are Futurama fans), and this is what makes this film so good. The fact that a film everywhere causes emotions that we usually do not like to feel and be considered bad does not make the film itself bad; in fact it means that it succeeded. Good funny movies should make us laugh; good horror movies should scare us; Good sad movies should upset us. The bottom line is that good movies should move you, not just entertain; this film touched me. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film is incredibly brutal by today's standards for children's films and contains a plot that, by today's standards, may not be suitable for some children. Parents, I would say, first look. I am usually not one of those who say something about it, but I saw it yesterday, and it came as a surprise even to me.
