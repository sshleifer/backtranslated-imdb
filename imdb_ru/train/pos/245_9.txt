The only reason I wanted to see this was because of Orlando Bloom. Simply put, the movie was amazing average. This is not bad, but in reality is not very good. Editing is good; the film is going well. Direction competent and confident. The story is bad. The film mainly starred Ledger Bloom and usually the great Watts and Rush. The accents are impenetrable if you are from the USA, so just relax and enjoy the scenery (or, as I like to call it, Orlando Bloom). By the end of the film, I did not miss and did not move. Some people ask what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the film. I must say that I did not care. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the only reason I can recommend it is because Orlando Bloom seems to show some hints of the range, this “I'm pretty and confused” looks are very noticeable), so fans can find that is worth the price of the matinee. Other than that, I just don't see it. It is not good enough and not bad to entertain.
