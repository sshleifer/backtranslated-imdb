Have you ever wondered where the ideas for novels and other back editions come from? According to Jake Speed, they are based on real people living in adventures, about which they write and publish. This film is a high-quality family entertainment, moderate amount of violence and poor clothing in the worst case. Language is also not a problem, but jokes are funny at all levels. This is the look of “Austin Powers” ​​on “Indian Jones”, without the excessive tricks of Michael Myers. I highly recommend this film for children aged 10 to 15 years.
