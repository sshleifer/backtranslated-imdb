Booth adds a completely new twist to your typical J-horror movie. This film puts you in the place of the main character of the story. The director wants you to see what the main character sees and thinks. <br /> <br /> A story about the perception of people who work, live and love our main character, and how he perceives the people who surround him. Outdated radio station DJ Booth. The story exfoliates the layers of the main character, like a bow in memories, when the film is moving under its own power, and from it we learned that not always everything is as it seems. The film basically took place in a small outdated radio station studio with a very bad story, where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show, because the radio station was in the process of moving. It is from this closed space that this film thrives and makes you feel claustrophobic and paranoid. From time to time, our main character cannot determine which strange events in the old studio were caused by a ghost or some kind of conspiracy by his colleagues, or it was all in his mind. What I like about this film is that the filmmakers make you look through the eyes of the main character and make you as paranoid as the main character. This film is a very smart, rather short 76-minute film.
