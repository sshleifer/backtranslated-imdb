I want to warn you that there is a very bitter-sweet quality in this comment. In addition, this comment will be much more meaningful to you after you watched the movie. <br /> <br /> Although tragically sad to say that this film is like my life, so astounding that it is really scary. The rest will never know how accurately this film shows how people who find themselves in such situations act and react in their later life. <br /> <br /> This could not be a fantastic piece; it should have been based on personal experience. <br /> <br /> My proof of how good the film was is shown by the fact that, although it was one of the best films I have ever seen, I see my life. On the silver screen such a terribly painful experience that I can never see him again. <br /> <br /> But I wholeheartedly approve of him as an opportunity to look into the soul of another person. to such an extent that you probably never experienced before or ever again. I know this for sure, because this is my soul that you will observe.
