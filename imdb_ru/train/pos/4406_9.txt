Oddly enough, this film never showed up on a big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the video to come out. My expectations are high, but they are in no way disappointed. As always with Ang Lee, there is a fantastic acting game, an intelligent and exciting plot that makes you guess to the very end and superb shooting. Along with Unforgiven, this is easily one of the two best westerns of the 90s. <br /> <br /> People who are expecting something along the lines of Mel Gibson in “Patriot” (trite) or “Braveheart” (acceptable) will be sourly disappointed, everyone else who appreciates the above-mentioned qualities will look great him. 9 out of 10
