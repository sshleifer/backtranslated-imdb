"Bell Book and Candle" was recently shown on cable. Not seeing this for a while, we decided to take another look at this comedy. Based on the Broadway hit of James Van Druten, who was the vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilly Palmer in the early fifties, the film was adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash. The film's director is Richard Quine, who turned the play into a delightful comedy. <br /> <br /> Obviously, judging by some comments submitted by IMDb, a big problem seems to be the combination of two stars, who collaborated on "Vertigo", released in the same year. Moviegoers did not think about the difference in age when this film was released. In fact, most aging male stars of that period were always associated with much younger women. <br /> <br /> The Manhattan film set during Christmas is a delightful comedy that captivated the audience. Kim Novak was at the peak of her beauty, as it is clear that the camera loved her, no matter what she played. Like a witch who becomes a man, her Gillian is charming. James Stewart, who plays the publisher Shep Henderson, is also seen at his best. Mr. Stuart was a great comedian who shows here why he was at the top. <br /> <br /> In the background role, the wonderful Elsa Lanchester playing Quinnie is a welcome addition to any movie, as she proves here, Nicky Holroyd from Jack Lemmon, Gillian's brother, is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also known as the writer Sidney Radlich. <br /> <br /> This is a great way to spend a winter night at home, watching the Bell Tower and the Candle.
