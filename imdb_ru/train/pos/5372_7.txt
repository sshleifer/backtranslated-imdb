Of the first five episodes of the Hummer’s short film Hummer House of Horror, this fifth episode with the wonderful title Bleeding House is perhaps the most terrible. For years, being a big fan of Hammer’s Gothic Horror films, I’m surprised that it took me so long to start watching a TV show just recently. So far I have only seen the first five episodes, and I have a strong feeling that the best is still to come, but even if the series remains as interesting as the first five episodes, I will be satisfied. While the second and third episodes were great to watch their painful and brilliantly somber sense of humor, this fifth entry is certainly one of the first five that brings the real Horror. The episode begins when an elderly man kills his wife for unknown reasons. Years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davis) moved into the house with her little daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley). However, shortly after the move, the family must find out that something terribly bad is not good with the house, which seems to be haunting ... The second episode, filmed by Francis Megahi, is much better than his mediocre previous record “Growing Pains (Episode 4), and rather unknown actors show good performances. The film is also well made in terms of effects, cinematography and evaluation. “The house that has bled out” is a serious episode in which the elements that my fellow Hammer fans would like to see in the short horror story are presented. The film creates a terrible atmosphere, authentic moments of intimidation and intelligent turns, as well as intense and very interesting from the very beginning to the end. Overall, this is highly recommended for Hammer fans.
