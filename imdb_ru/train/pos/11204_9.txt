The symbolic use of objects, the editing of forms, the position of the characters on the stage ... they were all used with such joyful rejection from Hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had. The way a wife moves from one corner of the ring to another as the battle progresses, editing when a wedding ring is placed on her finger ... although by today's standards this may seem a little obvious in the silent era that they talked about in history without one the words. Even the name has at least four meanings that I see; a boxing ring, a wedding ring, a bracelet that a lover buys, and a love triangle at the heart of the story.
