I just saw this movie in the preview, and all I can say is ... "What did I just watch ????" And I mean it is good and bad. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple. Stiller and Black play friends / neighbors. Stiller - focused, hardworking, and black - dreamers. Black invent this idea to create a spray that washes poop. The idea is becoming very popular, and blacks are becoming very rich. The extravagant lifestyle that blacks lead, and the fact that he is still trying to become best friends with Stiller, makes Stiller go crazy with envy. <br /> <br /> As I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is just weird. The direction is strange, with a strange rotating opening shot to speed up the sequence from nowhere. The dialogue and the game is very strange; strangely disjointed. And the soundtrack is the strangest thing in the film, starting with the strange song “Envy”, which constantly appears on the stage, where you think you will hear the classic song of the 80s, but suddenly it is in Japanese. <br /> So, the true question is, is this ... weird funny? It depends solely on the person. I puzzled over the unshakable strangeness of the film. After the show, I heard people call it terribly unfunny and glad it was free. Strange, I understood their point of view. There are no jokes, so if you don’t get hooked on the uniqueness of all this, you will hate this movie. Absolutely hate it. <br /> <br /> This film is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a classic cult DVD. If you can laugh at a film without real jokes, like “The Cable Guy” or “Kick With A Drunk Love,” then I suggest you watch it. If not, run away from this movie. It will only piss you off.
