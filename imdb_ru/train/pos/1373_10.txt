This film should be viewed for all librarians or potential librarians. All the best features are directly related to librarianship. The argument against the public library and the academic library is a classic argument among librarians and library school students. It also breaks many library stereotypes. Librarians may even be able to have fun - even if they do not * usually * have sex in the Romance languages ​​section! (The best film about librarians? Desk set, with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, of course.)
