This film is excellent and I would recommend renting it to anyone who owns a local video store. Or, even better, you can buy it, because there is a chance that you will watch it again and again. I remember watching this movie as a child, and then it was great. But after watching yesterday, I found it to be awesome. <br /> <br /> A good combination of comedy (although not as wonderful as “Mr. Magu” is another one of my favorites) and action movie. It deserves a 10/10, and I hope that they will soon make a sequel (fingers crossed). If you are looking after children or you have to look after small children, I would recommend making this film, as it will entertain them for hours :).
