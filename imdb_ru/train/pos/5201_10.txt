“Human Tornado” is a film from the film “Blaxploitation”, filmed in the 70s, with a comedian at a nightclub, Rudy Ray Moore, possibly in his most charming role to date. The film tells the story of Dolemit, a loser who fucks the wrong side of a white racist sheriff while sleeping with his wife. Dolemita barely manages to escape, and he goes to sunny California to visit an old friend, the owner of a nightclub (and Madame “ladies” Dolemite) named Queen Bee. Nevertheless, it seems that the owner of a rival nightclub who has connections with the mob is trying to pump up his racket, so Dolemite takes matters into his own hands. In this landmark film, Rudy Ray Moore demonstrates many different talents, including strong dramatic skills, kung fu skills, an impressive singing voice (he offers two songs on the soundtrack), a touching, compassionate side with the ladies and an overall compelling charisma and a keen sense of comic timing . In this film there is everything, people: a deep plot, a thrilling action, a comedy laughing at the minute, beautiful women in distress, the end of slamming ... what else can you ask from the movie?
