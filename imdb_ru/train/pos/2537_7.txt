Boris and Bela succeed together in this film, whether they are against each other or are sailing in the same boat. I saw this in 1972 and just bought it from Borders this year. This time, watching it with my children, I took note of 2 things: it attracted the attention of children 3, 4 and 5 years old; and I caught a few things that I didn't have when I first looked at it. Very fast story with an unpredictable ending. A must for movie lovers !!!
