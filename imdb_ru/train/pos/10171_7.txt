Once, when I was in college and we had an international fair, there was a Soviet-era poster in the Russian section with the words “Do not talk!”, Which means “Do not gossip!” Gladys Kravitz! ”(Regarding a curious neighbor on“ Bewitched ”). <br /> <br /> However, when you see the result of gossip in Pvt. Snaf short "Rumors", you know, this is not quite funny. In this case, the senselessly senseless soldier overhears something about the bombing and immediately assumes that the Axis powers attacked the United States. So he says it to someone, who speaks to someone else, who speaks to someone else, and it goes on. As in “Russians go, Russians go”, the story each time becomes more and more disproportionate, so when she returns to Snaf ... well, you know what I mean! Yes, this is basically World War II propaganda - complete with a derogatory term for the Japanese - but I must say that Pvt. Shnaf shorts were pretty funny. Of course, since they had Dr. Suze, who wrote, and Mel Blank provided the voices, it is not surprising that they sounded pretty cool. Worth seeing.
