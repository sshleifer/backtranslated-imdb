This is another grand and convincing film shot by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist and fast-working director has something unusual for his earlier films - the cast with some stars. Richard Widmark, Gene Peters and Richard Kylie star in this film are about a group of communist agents who are trying to steal secrets from America - and they will stop at nothing to succeed. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Peters in a subway car, which is monitored by federal agents. They know that she is a link in a long spy chain. An unknown for all symbol of substitution in the equation - there is also a small pickpocket on the train (Widmark), and he manages to steal the secrets that Peters carries. Widmark thinks that this is another wallet that he ransacked - only later does he realize the seriousness of what he stole. Now this is Widmark by himself - with the Commi and the FBI on his way. <br /> <br /> Widmark and the others are exceptional, and the film captures from beginning to end. Although she did not receive maximum bills, the Thelma Ritter should be specifically mentioned. This fellow actress may have had an idea of ​​her life as a stool pigeon. Rarely she was given such a great opportunity to act, and I was impressed by her ability to play a broken and sad old woman. <br /> <br /> As for the script and the direction, they are very good - but with one small exception. At first I liked the way Widmark and Peters communicated. This is one of the few times when you see a woman punching a square in her mouth on tape! Now it is difficult. Later, inexplicably, they become surprisingly close — too close to be believable. However, with so much great drama and such an effective film like noir, it can be overlooked. Watch this movie.
