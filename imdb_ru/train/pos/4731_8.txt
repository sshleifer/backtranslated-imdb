This is definitely one of the best works of Jet. Few actors can play the stoic just like Jet Li. The action is quick-fire, and the special effects are enhanced for intensity purposes. As a result, Americans may take a little by surprise. A slight suspension of disbelief is important in the movie Jet Li. I feel that this is a great introduction to the work of Jet and I look forward to new masterpieces (especially Fist of Legend) that will appear on the US market. A pleasant mixture of shootout and physical conflict will satisfy the majority of action lovers.
