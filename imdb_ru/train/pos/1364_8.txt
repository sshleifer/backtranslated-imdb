I remember Parker Posey in the film How the World Turns Out before she became the queen of independent films. In this film, Posey demonstrates her potential as a top actress. In this film with the cast, in which Omar Townsend participates in the role of Mustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel merchant on the street, who seeks to become a teacher. The supporting actress is a wonderful actress who plays her godmother and only relative, like Judy, a librarian who is old-fashioned, devoted and menopausal. Posey, as Mary learns that she must grow up and grow up. The loss of her position as a librarian makes her realize how much she misses this place in her life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the village of Lower East Side in New York, before she became a nice yuppie. This film is very good for an independent, and I came to enjoy Parker Posey as Mary, as well as other characters in other films.
