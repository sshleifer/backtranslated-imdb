So, Mary and Rhoda have grown old, and who is not? I was a teenager when Mary made his debut, and a “young man” when he went on the air. Yes, it was great to see Mary and Roh together, and yes, the film could not stand the comedy of the original series, but there were enough moments that reminded the spirit of the series to make it a suitable tribute. Example: a producer who hires Mary and then dictates an idea for a new series about “old men”. Isn't that typical of the mentality of modern Hollywood television and cinema "bean counters"? This may not be the best show of MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW, but this is a damn good look at one of the best shows we grew up in in the 70s.
