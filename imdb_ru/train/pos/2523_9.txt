When I first heard of Moon Child, I thought it was a joke. After a few months, I decided that it really was. The few reviews I read that were not made by the shrieking of female fans were not very promising. <br /> <br /> When I was given the opportunity to see this, I was completely ready to moan, make a face, and otherwise I had to close my eyes to avoid stupidity. <br /> <br /> I was more than a little surprised, and in a good way. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Lunar Child has moments of cheese, camps and general nonsense - I think this is partly impossible to avoid when it comes to Gackt Kamui, a man not known for his sanity - but in general quite nice. <br /> <br /> No, this is not the work of a brilliant movie, but it is very, very emotional, funny, with cheerful choreography, a touching score and a cheerful cast. I know little about Japanese cinema, so I can't judge about acting, but given the fact that the actors spoke some foreign or dialect dialect for them at one time or another, and that some of them have almost no acting experience, i was quite impressed. <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy a good fighter, good drama, good comedy, watch this movie. At the very least, rent it because it arrives in region 1. <br /> <br /> By the way, there is no homosexual / homoerotic content in this film. I have not even seen a lot of subtext. Don't let people who read too much ruin it for you.
