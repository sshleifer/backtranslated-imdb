A Chinese scientist who sharply criticizes an arrogant nationalist, fomenting the policy of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war Japan, is accused of being a “communist” and sentenced to life imprisonment. His loving wife, who fully supports her husband and his ideas, was left alone to save his family from starvation. This film is a huge statue, erected in honor of the role of mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is no less exalted in the title role, and it was a monumental scandal that she won the Asian Oscar for Best Actress in 2009. She went to a young girl with very limited acting ability. <br /> This deeply touching and most “human” feature is what all “true children” on earth need to see.
