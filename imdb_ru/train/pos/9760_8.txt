I have very fond memories of this film, since I saw him with my two younger sisters when he was first shown theatrically in 1977, and I was eight years old. Obviously, this was recognized as a failure - and now almost forgotten (video cassette with panning and scanning), which never gives due to the picture, or its ambitious compositions Panavision are now out of print.) uneven. Some of the characters and episodes are elegant, while others are somewhat juvenile and unremarkable. A sad, discarded blue camel (shades of Ea) and his blue song are truly touching. The songs of Joe Raposo are for the most part simply beautiful. Definitely worthwhile curiosity, which is likely (unfortunately) to fall into complete obscurity.
