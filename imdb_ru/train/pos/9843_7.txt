It brought together some characters who normally would not have been seen together (not to mention trying to save a human child and return it to his father). They begin as enemies and end as best friends. If this sounds like a Disney movie, it is (made only through 20th Century Fox). The trailer for the film was one of the best I've ever seen, but the film does not live up to expectations from the trailer. The problem is that the filmmakers have not decided who the target audience of the film is. Yes, there are a few jokes in the film that only adults will understand, but the film is mainly aimed at children. Parents will like what is within 90 min. their children's attention is focused on something other than them. The backgrounds are great and the voice is good, but itâ€™s nothing but a good movie. Children will like this film, adults will like it.
