No award can please all people. Obviously, if your favorite movies did not win, you say that the show was not very good. It's clear. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the 74th Annual Academy Award will be remembered for one magical moment in the history of Hollywood: <br /> <br /> Woody Allen’s first appearance at the Oscars. <Br /> <br /> Allen often avoided the awards as self-reinforcing and meaningless, and never visited them, even though he received several coveted awards. <br /> <br /> When the 74th Academy Award was the Nation was still mourning the loss of life as a result of the collapse of the World Trade Centers in New York. When it came time to pay tribute to the city of New York, they decided to show a video about the great moments of cinema from the city of cities. Then the announcer simply said: <br /> <br /> “Dear ladies and gentlemen, director, Oscar winner, Woody Allen.” <br /> <br /> The venue burst out with extremely long applause. The entertainment industry finally gave its applause to the Man from New York, who usually avoids the Hollywood scene. When the applause subsided, Woody applied some of his legendary minds to his situation. <br /> <br /> SOME BASIC FEATURES: <br /> <br /> “Thank you very much - this compensates for searches in the strip. “<br /> <br />“ I thought they wanted to get their Oscar back, ”he joked.“ I panicked because there had been no business at the pawnshop for ages, and I hadn’t been able to find anything . <br /> <br /> "But this was not the case. I could not figure it out because my film was not nominated for anything this year. Then it struck me - perhaps they called to apologize." <br /> <br /> Allen also explained why he missed his rejection of Oscar throughout this special night. <br /> <br /> “For New York, I would do everything. So I put on a tuxedo and came here, ”said Allen. <br /> <br /> “This is a great cinema city. It was a great, exciting, and exciting background for films, and it remains a great, great city.
