This film could well be one of those ordinary "soap" films, which tells about the everyday events of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwined ... relationships are broken, new friendships are built, a street fight, dreams and even the opening of a child thrown under the bushes! What a mixture of events! <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the filmmaker goes beyond these daily events and asks questions to look for, although there are no satisfactory answers. He asks: “In this chaotic world, things happen, does it just happen when things get right, or, assuming a fatalistic point of view, is a person predestined to be in a certain place at a certain time and thus participate in this event?” Does its future acquire a new perspective? Most of us had this supernatural experience. <br /> <br /> Is our super-ego making us believe that we are so important? How does one character say ?? One day he sat down on the edge facing the Grand Canyon and realized how infinitely small he was. <br /> <br /> This is not one of my favorite films, but it is a good study of human relationships. Danny Glover plays a prominent role.
