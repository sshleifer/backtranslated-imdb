I never trust the opinion of anyone regarding the film. This also applies to critics. Of course, if he receives positive reviews, this is normal and a plus, but most of the films that receive critical rave reviews, I hate. I liked this movie for being an entertaining movie. It takes you out of your life for a couple of hours and turns you into a fictional character ... Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is great in this role, as in the first. Anyone who says that she is terrible in this film should have felt the same thing in the first film, because she again behaves the same way as in Basic Instinct 1. Catherine is hers and she plays her to perfection. Her one liner is great, very similar to the first. Who can forget in the first movie when she tells the cops: “If you are going to arrest me, do it ... otherwise get out of here!” Great scene, and believe me, she does it again in this. I was fascinated by her. Believe me, her outfits, the way she smoked her cigarettes, is worth it just to watch the performance of Stone. I can't wait for this film to be released on DVD, uncut, because I can only imagine how much better it will be. And yes, there are a lot of turns, as in the first, including the final!
