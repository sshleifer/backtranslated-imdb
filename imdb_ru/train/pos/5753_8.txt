*** 1/2 of ***** Although Iâ€™m not worried about the fact that this is a duplicate English version, as some reviewers mentioned, it should be noted that it seems to live in the many hearts of the indigenous people of Quebec. However, it was a movie as a child that I was an ardent fan; Considering that this was done for children, I rate it on a relative basis. The story of how children in the winter holidays build an amazing snow fort and push back and forth to control with weapons, such as snowballs and other mixtures, as idle hands and free time on equal lessons of the winter holidays. If I had children, it would definitely be a movie in which I would try to interest them, as the snow fort struck me when I was small, and I think that even children will agree today, although with Pixar and all computer animation maybe I am outdated and just do not realize it. In addition, the message of the film is perfectly allegorical and at the same time positive, both for children (and for adults).
