Oath to cherish this wonderful film. This is based on a novel with the same title, which was equally good, although different from the film. Really made you think about how you would react if you were in the shoes of the characters. Recommended for those who have ever loved parents, spouses or family members - in other words, ALL! <br /> <br /> Although the production is not of a Hollywood quality - there are no big special effects - yet, values ​​and ideals are depicted more than make up for it. And the actors did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members and the destruction that occurs when one of them falls ill. <br /> <br /> You do not want to miss it!
