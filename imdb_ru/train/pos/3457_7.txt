This is Colombo, directed by Steven Spielberg early in his career. There is nothing sensational in this, but in this film you can see a small hint of the beautiful things that Spielberg is expecting. The film is mainly in the same style as most of the movies and television shows of the 70s of Spirlberg. So this means that some characters tend to show fads, and no, I'm not just talking about one character from Colombo. A type of character quirk that may be best seen in the 1975 Spielberg film Jaws. But aside from some small hints of Spielberg’s typical early elements, you cannot call this film a work or a perfect example of a rising director’s star. Not that it was bad, of course, it is not, but, as I said earlier, it is not so sensational. <br /> <br /> This film started really well and very promising, but after its wonderful discovery, in which the murder happened as always, the film became slower and more boring to watch. It's boring, because it's basically a Colombo film from a book that doesn't really have memorable moments, it's not boring, because it's a boring film. <br /> <br /> The murder itself was quite brilliant, and the concept of the author of a criminal story, who killed his partner in writing, showed great and interesting potential. However, the story did not really explore all its possibilities. At least that feeling that this film left me. <br /> <br /> However, the film was still good to watch him thanks to the character Jack Cassidy, who thinks he is smarter than Colombo, because of his secrets / crime Write experience and try to give him all sorts of hints, leading away from myself. But, of course, Colombo knows better, and from the first moment he is his number one suspect, but he, as usual, plays this game. <br /> <br /> The film has a good overall style and uses excellent camera position and editing. It's funny to see that all this basically corresponded to Spielberg's later works, especially some of the camera angles. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and well-watched Colombo movie, but don't let Spielberg’s name attach it increases your expectations too much. <br /> <br /> 7/10
