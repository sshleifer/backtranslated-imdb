Many years ago, many large studios advertised serial films that were shown in cinemas, between actual clips, along with newsreels of current events, plus cartoons, especially on Saturday afternoon. (Parents liked it the most) “Return to Chandu” is a 12-part series in which Chandu (Bela Lugosi), “Mysterious Mr. Wong”, 34, is a wizard with super natural abilities and travels to the island of Lemuria to save the kidnapped Egyptian princess , (Naji) Maria Alba, "The House of Horrors of Doctor Terror", 43. Princess Naji is in the thrall of the cult of black magic Ubasta, who believes that she is the reincarnation of their long-dead goddess Ossana. These 12-series serials take you back in time and are very well produced, given that this is about 1934!
