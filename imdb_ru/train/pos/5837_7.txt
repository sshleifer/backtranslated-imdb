With Oliver Hardy, struck by the sounds of horns, bells, telephones and trombones, his doctor Finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk. Partner Stan Laurel offers an excellent solution - to live on a docked boat, so that the salty sea air can help Ollie get everything you need to relax. This is a great prerequisite for all the crazy jokes when a hungry goat goes into the boat, and the escaped convict (Richard Kramer) goes on the road. <br /> <br /> I received a blow from all the jokes in the film, starting with that sign at the horns testing factory - “Silence while people work”. An early story in the boys' apartment shows a lot of confused plumbing and appliance problems, with Stan making a banana in a banana piece. There are a couple of great lines in Laurel's picture, for example: “We must have been divided,” but the one that made me move was his answer to the criminal aboard the ship - “Self-preservation - the last law of averages” - exactly! <br /> <br /> I’m not as good at learning Laurel and Hardy films as many are on this board. All I know is that I enjoyed them as a child and found them as interesting today as they were in their youth. From this point of view, Saps At Sea provides a decent hour of rustle-phobic fun on the road to horomanomia.
