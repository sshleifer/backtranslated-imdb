Marlene Gorris has established herself as one of the world's great directors. This sensitive, visually beautiful film is based on the story of Vladimir Nabokov and well reflects the dark irony of the author. John Turturro gives what I consider to be my best performance (I am not usually a fan of him); and Emily Watson is also gorgeous. Worth seeing.
