This film is usually classified as the worst film production. Ever But, in my opinion, this is perhaps the most ridiculous. The horrific direction and the script make this film invaluable. I bought a movie by sifting off DVDs at a local pound store. I and some friends then watched it, admittedly, although rather drunk. It soon became clear that it was not an ordinary film. Instead, it is a priceless relic of what is likely to be the last James Cahill film. At first we were confused and shouted that the DVD player was turned off, but fortunately, in our abnormal condition, nobody was worried. Instead, we watched the movie to the end. In the end, we soon realized that we had found some kind of dream about trivia, on which you can laugh for a long time, laughing for all the wrong reasons. Soon we showed all our other friends, and they also agreed that this was not the work of a terrible film. It was a movie you can really laugh at. It was a movie that everyone can enjoy. It was a genius.
