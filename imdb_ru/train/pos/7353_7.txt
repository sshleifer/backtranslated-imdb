This film may be one of the most underrated films in Bollywood history. This 1994 blockbuster had all the good performances, music and direction. People there played her song "Ooe Amma" in their loudspeakers with maximum volume. If someone who likes to watch the movie Like Like It Hot and is drooling because of Marilyn Monroe, you should watch this movie. Thumbs Up to Govinda. As many of you know, this film was shot in the south of India and after Sholay may be one of the few blockbusters to hit the Silver Screen. With films like this Indian comedy could never be dead.
