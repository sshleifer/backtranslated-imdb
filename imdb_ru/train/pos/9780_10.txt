I saw this film at the BIFFF festival in Brussels in spring 2004. What a surprise! This German production, stylish and creative shocker, is one of the scariest films I've ever seen. Be careful: this is not a joke! This terrorist has a large selection of good actors (for example, Peter Martel, as a European guru, strong presence), excellent direction, good production design, a very good soundtrack and many heavy sounds, like Italian horror films in the eighties. The flesh is torn to the bone ... and the blood turns red ... this wild Heart Stopper will grab you ... and give you some dark dreams ... Be sure to take a look !!
