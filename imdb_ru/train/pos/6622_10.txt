I just went to the screening of the film during Expresion en Corto, a short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction. The film rolled through, and from the first frame I was amazed: one long continuous shot of futuristic Paris in gorgeous black and white. <br /> <br /> I don't have to go into details, because I think this movie is worth seeing. A science fiction story may seem average to many ... for me it was really good. The action is great, the camera is free to fly everywhere, and I mean everywhere. What you could not do or see is done beautifully. The performance of the actors is good, in my opinion, no one hits the wrong note. <br /> <br /> Now what I found awesome is the animation. 3D graphics looks 2D. BW comics brought to life. Details in the background give more texture, as if it was done by hand (I'm sure that was the case, but when you change the angles you see the depth). <br /> <br /> The producer at the show spoke about the hard work on the film: 7 years! The director, she says, is great, but perhaps he was completely inexperienced, since he had only one short film in his resume. Thus, many people believed in them. They started their own studio from scratch and since then they have faced a problem they have encountered. <br /> <br /> Don't miss. I think you will not regret it ... maybe Richard Linklater in the final form of this film surpasses it, I think.
