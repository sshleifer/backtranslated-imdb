When I first saw it, I didn’t laugh too much. At that time I was only about fifteen years old, and I thought that maybe some of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at that time. I had the same reaction when I watched it a second time a few months ago, and this time, it was because Felix’s failed attempt to commit suicide at the beginning of the film darkened the movie a little. This scene made some of the things Oscar said and made to Felix later in the film seem overly cruel, and their encounters with the person were not as funny as they could be. If I hadn’t known this story yet, I would have been concerned that some of the tricks of Oscar Felix might push him over the edge. As it was, it didn't make me laugh or smile, like a television show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. However, in general, a pretty good movie, and it spawned one of the greatest sitcoms on television. 7 out of 10.
