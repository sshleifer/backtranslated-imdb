This film about the three puppets is connected with my other favorite film “Disorder in court”. This is the sound of laughter, which will appeal to any fan of Three Stooges. <br /> <br /> The cleaning boys at the recording studio when they hear beautiful Christine McIntyre sing an excellent version of Voice of Spring. She will be offered a record deal, but she is afraid of being honest with her father in choosing a career and showing herself as a real singer. When she and the others leave the studio, the puppets decide to have some fun, play her record and dress Curly like Christine. The contract lady who can make Christine's career sees Curly and takes him for Christina and invites Curly to sing for her party. Of course, there is a person they upset, who is at a party, and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd, so he will find a way to take revenge on them. <br /> <br /> What a great stack of flick, this is not to be missed! <br /> <br /> 10/10
