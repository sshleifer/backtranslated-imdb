A great film about Broadway music. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) loves to throw bones and organize illegal games. The blonde lover of Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him, IF he rolls the dice. He decides to hold the last game when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), Who makes a big bet, is in the city. He tells Sky that he cannot force missionary Sarah Brown (Gene Simmons) to go with him to Havana. This may sound like a strange summary of the plot, but the film too! <br /> <br /> This is really a mixed bag - there is something wonderful here. The songs are all good, and the dances are incredible. This show limiter at the end of the game. In addition, Brando is really very good here - it may seem strange to think that he sings and dances, but he copes with it. I have to admit that seeing how big, bulky Brando was filming some difficult dance moves was a lot of fun! In addition, Sinatra is pretty good, and Blaine is great as his long-suffering girlfriend. Her song and dance numbers here clearly stand out. <br /> <br /> Now about the bad roles - Gene Simmons is a wonderful actress, but she is stuck with a monotonous colorless role and can't do anything with her. The film is too long, 150 minutes - the scenes between Brando and Simmons really drag out and should have been cut. Also, most characters speak very precise English - abbreviations are never used. Maybe it was fun to get out of the mouth of the gangsters, but I found it to rattle and it kept throwing me out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is worth catching songs and dances, but this is too much. comes to you after a while. I give him 7.
