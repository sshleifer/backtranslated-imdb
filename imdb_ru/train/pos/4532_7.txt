It was the first feature of Keaton and, in fact, three shorts, installed in different periods (Stone Age, Roman Age, Modernity) in the eternal triangle of romance. The stories are parallel to each other, as in Griffith's Intolerance, which he had to make fun of. The strengths of jokes and jokes are almost all based on anachronisms that bring modern business to ancient conditions. <br /> <br /> **** WARNING - SPOILERS FOLLOWING TO DEVELOP THE BEST DOTS ****** <br /> <br /> Here are the classic moments: <br /> <br /> Using the tortoise as a tiny boards (stone age); Wristwatches with a solar dial (Roman era); Chariot with spare wheel (Roman century); Using a helmet as a lock for tires (Roman century); Early golf with clubs and stones (stone age); Dictating the will, carved into the rock (stone age); Changing weather forecast (roman age); Chariot Race in the Snow - Booster using skis and huskies with a spare dog in a chariot boot (Roman age). <br /> <br /> All of the above are jokes that make us laugh. However, there are unforgettable moments: <br /> <br /> Buster pulls out the shaving equipment to match the makeup; A fantastic double double when drunk Baster looks at his plate to find a crab staring at him (within one second he jumped to get up on a chair from a sitting position, and again jumped into the hands of a waiter - one of the funniest moments I ever seen). And this lion - a manicure - is simply brilliant. <br /> <br /> There is also a bit of racism, when four African Americans who carry rubbish leave their mistress for the Roman game. <br /> <br /> The Kino's thumbprint is a bit blurred and contains numerous sequences of nitrate wear and film damage â€” most likely at the ends of the drums. The subway is performed on the piano and flute and borrowed from Grieg. <br /> <br /> Lots of fun and laughter.
