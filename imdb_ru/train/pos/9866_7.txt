Just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and especially beautiful film. The story is simple but effective, the characters are cute and well thought out, but what really shines is the design of digital scenery. <br /> <br /> More inspired by traditional animated films than reality, designs give you a really, really good looking world in a striking use of color. Sometimes the touches of reality shine through (especially the water was impressive), but, nevertheless, this is a fantastic world based on reality. The inclusion of many vast landscapes especially helps to minimize the cost of rendering. <br /> <br /> Pixar films shine with a technical brilliance, and this effect is an effective use of technical know-how. <br /> <br /> Rather technical chatter, the film is interesting, family-friendly and sometimes just funny.
