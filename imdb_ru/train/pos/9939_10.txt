This is a cartoon series, where most of the action takes place in the human body, where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells, etc. I will not try to explain this in more detail, you just have to see it for yourself: you I will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I remember watching it in the 80s like a child (with Swedish voices). I talked to several people who were also children in the 80s, and they liked it too! I have to admit that the educational part of the episodes did not reach me on a conscious level, but the very idea of ​​educating children while they are having fun is wonderful. I recently saw several episodes; It has a sense of humor and heart, which is nowadays difficult to find in other children's programs. <br /> <br /> 5/5
