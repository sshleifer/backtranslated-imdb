I contend that the one who is ultimately responsible for creating / approving the trailer for this film was completely wrong. None of those whom I know, did not want to watch this movie in previews, and EVERYONE who actually saw him (which I know) loved him very much ... The advertising campaign is a disgrace / catastrophe / blunder. <br /> <br /> Opened at # 4 behind ... <br /> <br /> # 1 is a rush hour I haven’t seen, the average score on IMDb is 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2 - The Bourne Ultimatum, which I watched, is a terrific movie, but in the third week, the average score on IMDb is 8.7 (deserves, I would say). <br /> <br /> # 3 - the film “The Simpsons”, which I saw, is good, but in the fourth week, on average, IMDb is 8.1 points (in my opinion, a little higher). <br /> <br /> # 4 - Stardust, the average score of IMDb is 8.4 (lower than that of Bourne, but this is already 3 weeks). <br /> <Whether it was a bad schedule or a bad advertisement, I think that the forces behind this film have screwed up! It was supposed to be advertised as an amazing film that turns out to be a fantasy / fairy tale, and not advertised as just another fairy tale ?? It’s a pity :( In any case, now that I’ve missed out on the evening very senselessly ... Awesome movie, go and see!
