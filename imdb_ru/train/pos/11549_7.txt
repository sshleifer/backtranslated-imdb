There is nothing in The Strange Couple that you might not like, and it’s not surprising that Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau form an extremely winning comedy team. But there is something so underdeveloped in the adaptation of Neil Simon to his stage performance that it looks more like a scene in a comedy series than a full-fledged film. I did not see the play, but I must assume that the on-screen version is quite correct, since Simon wrote it, so you cannot blame the defects in adapting the scene to the screen. There are several interesting ideas in this story — two recently divorced men who immediately fall into traditional family roles when they become roommates, because none of them knows otherwise — that Simon never fully revealed. However, there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours.
