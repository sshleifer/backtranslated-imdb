Being a fan of genre films, a child of the 80s and a fan of hard rock, this film has a special place in my heart. It has everything you could wish for in a supernatural film: an action movie, great special effects (for 1986) and a glam rock soundtrack with a guitar. It was, of course, a film for all heavy metal fans of the time. I did not see it in the cinema because it was never released theatrically here ... but its popularity on video in the mid to late eighties ensured its cult status and eventually led to a (unfortunately mediocre) DVD release in 2002. If you are not a fan of creepy movies or rock music, then probably this is not your cup of tea ... but, believe me, there are the worst films of this type ... and, despite the usual acting, and some Extremely ridiculous situations, " Trick or Treat ”- this is certainly a cry, surpassing the usual horror films. You will never look at the stereo again. Or should I say MP3 player? <br /> <br /> TRICK OR TREAT TRIVIA - Mark Price (Eddie) played the hideous Skippy Handelman in the popular comedy "Family Ties". After a series of live video flops, including “Little Devils,” “Killer Tomatoes Eating France,” and “Salvation,” he gave up his acting career to continue his comedy career. Recently, he was thinking about the return of television. <br /> <br /> Glen Morgan (Roger) is now a major Hollywood producer / screenwriter. He has written and produced several major films and TV shows, including: "Space: Above and Beyond", "The X-Files", "Destination", Jet Li, "One", "Willard" and more recently "End Point 3 ". br /> <br /> Tony Fields (Sammy) began his performing career as a dancer in the TV series "Solid Gold". He starred in several low-budget films and television shows, before he got the role of a breakthrough in the role of the devil Sammy Kerr in Trick or Treat. Unfortunately, Tony died on February 27, 1995 from AIDS-related cancer. <br /> <br /> Doug Sawanta (Tim) is probably best remembered for his pioneering role as the gay twenty-year-old Matt Fielding in the popular Melrose Place sitcom. Since then, he has had a long and diverse acting career, appearing in such films and TV shows as: “The One”, “Godzilla”, “Criminal Investigation” and the short sci-fi TV series Joss Whedon “Firefly”. Currently, he can be seen in the role of Tom Scavo in the popular TV series “Desperate Housewives”.
