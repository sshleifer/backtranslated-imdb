Cat Tom, Jerry Mouse and Dog Spike (here his name is Butch, his third name, his middle name "Killer") decided to sign a peace treaty so that everyone loved each other. It is strange and a little unnatural to see how they are all friends, like this one, and their friends seem to think so too. But by the end of the controversy over the steak, everything returns to normal and everything is as it should be. This short text is the second of three on the new Spotlight DVD to be edited, and I have no idea why this one was. This cartoon can be found on one of the Spotlight "Tom & Jerry" DVDs. <br /> <br /> My rating: B
