When it comes to movies, I can be pretty picky, and I will complain about everything and everything that has been done wrong. While each film has its flaws, the Night Listener had an exceptionally low score. <br /> <br /> If you read the latest review (it was difficult, since half of them were written in capital letters and did not contain any real information about the film), you may have been inclined to believe that this film was not too well done. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines in the same review, you found the author’s disdain: he / she does not like the fact that the director is gay (or that the film crew smokes crack ... obviously). br /> <br /> So, despite the fact that I have never written a review before, I thought that this film deserves one based on its merits, and not on the sexual orientation of its director. Let's first go through the quick checklist: 1. Great storyline? Absolutely. I will not give it to shreds, but the plot is very convincing and definitely not the one that could be expected on the basis of commercials. This is a thriller, not a horror, and it should be approached as such. The story really amazes you, especially since it is true (and the plot really remained true to real events). <br /> <br /> 2. Great game? Oh yeah. Robin Williams long ago broke free from the chains of comedians, and since then he has succeeded in serious roles for which many people would have written him off just ten years ago. He again reaches a high form in his role in The Night Listener, playing the radio host, who is becoming more and more worried and confused in the case ... well, I will let you see for yourself. <br /> <br /> 3. Great direction? Of course. Now, unlike the other poster I referred to, I really know something about the direction. I have been doing art directing at school for 3 years. Of course, I really don’t think it matters a lot (the only thing that matters is if you like the direction), but I thought that I should just confirm once again that I base my opinion on something substantial and relevant here. .. for example: not the sexual orientation of the director (or the alleged drug habits of the production team, LOL). <br /> <br /> Patrick Stettner’s direction was sullen and gloomy, and he allowed angles and lighting to help create such in-demand feelings of “stress and release” rather than the foul, rapidly changing camera work and quick cuts often exposed today. Some people can really show you the story through their camera, while others feel that they need to make history with the camera. I really appreciate it when someone today has the courage to just use the camera as it should be used, that is, as an eyeball through which we all see. <br /> <br /> 4. Lighting, cinematography and editing? Great all around. I have already written so much, and I could continue on these three last things for another ten paragraphs, so I’ll just wrap it up. <br /> <br /> In short, go watch this movie. Do not listen to people who have side motives to destroy it, especially if they are so stupid that they unknowingly reveal this motive at 1/4 of their post. Enjoy the show! -Ben
