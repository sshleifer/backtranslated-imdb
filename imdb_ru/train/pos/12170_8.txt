You know, romantic comedies can really go in any direction. You will see really juicy and think that you want something more realistic. Then you will see a realistic, but it may be too boring to interest you. Or maybe you will see one that does everything right, but cannot make you smile. Romantic comedies are tough movies. You enter them with high expectations, and usually, whether you like it, just a question of whether the filmmakers expected your expectations or the expectations of the guy or girl next to you. <br /> <br /> Of course. If there is a girl next to you, and you are a guy like me, then it probably doesn’t matter if the film is good, you have other thoughts. For you I say: "Go, take her, tiger!" For the rest of us, I say: "Look, Guy Thing_." It's very funny. <br /> <br /> Because _A Guy Thing_ knows that you are going to this movie with expectations, so he does not pretend that his “Boyfriend, who is going to get married, meets the woman of his dreams” and this is not his wife! The plot is going to make everyone happy. Of course, maybe you like it, but maybe it doesn't ring true, or you think it's cruel. _Gy Thing_ covers this. _A Guy Thing_ does this, filling the screen with the best support actor I've ever seen, so if you don't have a storyline, you still have something to make you smile. <br /> <br /> Are we talking about hardened large and small screen veterans such as Larry Miller (Pretty Woman, Best in Show), James Brolin (Traffic), Julie Hagerty (Airplane!), David Kohner (Saturday Night Live and Conan O'Brien, “Dirty Work,” Austin Powers II), or Thomas Lennon (“Staff and Viva”), or new faces, such as Sean Hatosi (“Faculty”) or Colin Foo (“Silverman Rescue”), we talking about a bunch of very talented and experienced actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the inspirational characteristics of the film, steal the show, time after time, and still create cad ry with energy and joy, rarely found in romantic comedies these days. <br /> And this should not divert attention from real romantic advertising and the stars that carry it, because it is very cute and terrible. Well done. Jason Lee (Malrats, Chase Amy, Dogma, etc.) is touching as a young professional whose life can get out of control, and Selma Blair demonstrates discreet brilliance in the image of a beginning socialite and sophisticated woman for whom every guy wants except for the guy who really is. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the great success of the film falls on Julia Stiles, the right girl in the right place at the wrong time, and she wears her well. Since then, damn it, I do not know when I saw an actress in a romantic comedy that fell in love with her so easily. Of course, all this is in close-ups, voices and subtle smiles, but this is magical, and this is one of the main reasons why we go to the movies in the first place. <br /> <br /> But Julie Stiles slightly original refinement would be lost if it were not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead in its classic simplicity. This is a film that draws a broken world of irreconcilable types of shares, makes them fall on each other, makes you laugh, and then penetrates with a big heart. <br /> <br /> The movie “Guy Thing” is a movie you definitely saw before, and the filmmakers clearly knew this when they decided to do it. We really haven't seen any new romantic comedies since the days of Shakespeare; The relative success of one or the other completely depends on the fulfillment of the classic story of the meeting of a boy with a girl. Guy Thing really takes it with a slight meta-kinematic bias, often turning the scenes into absurd, to give viewers the opportunity to appreciate powerful emotions and ancient plot techniques. <br /> <br /> In addition, she even manages to play a trick on the rather traditional structural concepts of gender and gender that make up the center of each romantic comedy, so even feminists can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> And guys, I think we can all agree that we want our friends to be as good as Jason Lee’s friends in this film. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why a pharmacist and a clothing retailer are some of the coolest guys in the movie, I suggest you just say "This is a guy's thing" and leave with it.
