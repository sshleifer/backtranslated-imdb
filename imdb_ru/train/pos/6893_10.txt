Gerard Philip in this film is absolutely perfect, cheerful, gentle, brave and loving. It gives an excellent dimension to the film, which is even a masterpiece, like other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!), as well as narrative rhythm. Never boring, always creating new emotions: for me the best French film of all time.
