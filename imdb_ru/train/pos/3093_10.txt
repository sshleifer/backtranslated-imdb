Why did the producers not give this show a chance Of all the junk on TV, why did the producers not give Six Degrees a chance? Will the series go on video? I would like to see how this ends. Put the first season on video and sell it. I was a devoted fan of Six Degrees and waited for his return. I set my recorder to record all shows. Thank God for that. I just found out that the show was canceled and my heart was broken. I would like to know that it will be canceled, why did not they tell us? I thought the show only develops some depth in the characters. The letter was pretty good also. Stephen (Campbell Scott) - my favorite. I'm so sorry to see that!
