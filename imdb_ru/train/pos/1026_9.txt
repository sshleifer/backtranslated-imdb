I liked this show for two reasons: 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two performers led the show with the skillful support of permanent and permanent actors. Replacing the RDA in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the soul out of the show. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between all the main characters is simply amazing. You feel that the actors love to caress after the camera stops rotating. These relationships are transferred to the program that we see. <br /> <br /> RDA lends credibility to its O'Neill character. He never knows when to give a sage his rest. You watch as others roll their eyes anxiously from some of his statements. However, they know that he is a man who should be there when the situation is dangerous. <br /> <br /> A lot of things happen under the surface between Carter and O'Neill. They manage to hold the lid, but often barely. In the episode "Loneliness" in the first season, there was one of the best dramas ever seen on television. The love between them made the prospect of death unbearable because they faced this together. <br /> <br /> “Carter” and “Jackson” often have to smooth out the turbulence created by “O'Neill”. Yet O'Neill’s tactical instincts always seem sensible. He understands what to do without thinking about it. Several times the team was in danger due to the fact that others did not listen to his orders. <br /> <br /> Quality has deteriorated noticeably in season 9 and 10. The original storyline arch was mostly consumed, and the new villains were never really caught my interest. Ben Browder was much lower than the RDA in conducting the show. He had rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all. Amanda Tapping called her performances during these two seasons. You could see her very changed appearance after giving birth. She probably thought more about the child than about the show. <br /> <br /> Stargate Atlantis has a few moments, but basically it is a weaker effort. The main characters lack the original cast chemistry. Villains (Ghosts) are so unlikely to be ridiculous. Perhaps Amanda Tapping can breathe life into the program, or it will last no longer than the fourth season. <br /> <br /> I always had problems with special effects for the show. Having pyramid-shaped spaceships is a design monster rarely found in Sci-Fi. Using torches for lighting on these ships is just as bad. It is equally difficult to accept the obscene use of decor from ancient Egypt, which hides cutting-edge technology. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised that the series will continue. In the second season, “Daniel Jackson” was shot, and in his form there is a hole where he was wounded. He crawls into the sarcophagus, and he heals his body and regains its shape, as if she had just left the counter in the dressing room. In the episode Hathor, the sarcophagus fell into the hands of the SGC, but is never mentioned again. This device could be used in several later episodes of Daniel, O'Neill and The Doctor. Fraser.
