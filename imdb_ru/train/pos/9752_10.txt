I boldly remember how I saw it when I was 3 years old, then my parents accidentally recorded everything, except for a few seconds, with some other cartoon. Then I was 8 or 9 years old when I discovered this again, and since I could understand things better, I thought it was a good film then. Fast forward to the past A few weeks ago (June 2006), when I opened it again thanks to some articles / video clips on the Internet, and this is simply not the same movie. I am sure that it is still good with children, but we are definitely written “Cult Status” for 20-30 years old. It's a shame that the original production went through a painful process; if Fox had given it enough time, today he would probably have become more recognizable. Perhaps if they redid it with a completely different story and the voice of all the stars, it could have been, but Fox had to decide. I wander here, I know. I still think this is a great movie, but it can be better than a great one.
