I don’t think that most of us are inclined to use the term “must-see” to militants, but I was very impressed with how good this film is, and he deservedly receives a “must-see” stamp from me. /> <br /> Mandy, played by Shannon Lee (daughter of the late and great Bruce Lee and sister of the late Brandon Lee), is recruited by Martin, a professional thief, to help carry out a diamond heist in the museum for a crime syndicate and receive a generous reward for it. Little did they know that another pair of thieves (Lucy and Tommy, a pair of lovers) who were previously rejected by Mandy and Martin to make a deal, also plan to steal the diamond. <br /> <br /> As each pair of thieves planning a robbery is a thrill to watch. Everything goes wrong, because Martin and Mandy unconsciously find themselves one step behind Lucy and Tommy. <br /> <br /> You will end up rooting for these thieves, as they will find that they need each other to stay alive from the criminal syndicate. who are not at all pleased that the diamond is not in his hands. <br /> <br /> Action fans will not be disappointed, as there is a healthy dose of skirmishes, martial arts and hand-to-hand combat. Sequences. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is that this film has not only action, but also romance and laughter (and I don’t mean your typical storylines prevailing in action movies) that sneak in. <br /> <br /> It’s not easy to root for the bad guys, but we see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop. <br /> <br /> Great movie and one NOT to miss! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
