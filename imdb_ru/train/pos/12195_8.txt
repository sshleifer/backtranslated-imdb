Any film in the early days of Orson Welles is a triumph right up to The Third Man with Joseph Cotton. He is also beautiful in the touch of evil. Please watch them all! He tends to become pompous and self-serving in films like F for Fake, a really stupid waste of film. Do not waste your time watching it. it is really ignorant. Orson Welles is a movie icon, and anyone who studies film should see everything he has shot. All his leading ladies are awesome, but in the end, Wells got drunk, like his character in “Touch of Evil”! For some reason, Orson Welles had relationships with women, I see how he could be considered attractive in his youth, not that Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton, or Cary Grant, John Wayne, I could go on and on, but I distracted ... and because I am a woman, I see an attraction to him. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last true cinematographers, and if not to take today's cinematographers: Tarantino, Scorsese, Spike Lee, most cinematographers simply do not correspond to filmmakers of the forties! I know that there are still many great directors today, but in such a short time I cannot name them all. No offense to any of the great directors of this millennium! August 21, 2006. Please remind me of current and future directors, I don’t want to be stuck in the past! I like some movies, but rarely are there any that I would include in the list of "100 best". “Hustle and Flow” - it was great, as was “Fargo” and “Oh, Brother, where are you” from Sullivan's travel story; another great film from the forties! Anyone can give me the best list for 90 before 2006? I would like to know who to watch! Thank you! Also Props to this site! Where else can you connect a movie or a boo! I love ranting and nonsense from ordinary people like me who can say that I want, and I promise not to spoil a single film for someone who has not seen it yet!
