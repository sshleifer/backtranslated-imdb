Gung Ho is one of those movies that you want to watch again and again. Michael Keaton is responsible for convincing the Japanese car company to come to his city, creating jobs for the residents of Headville. What happens after that is one happy moment after another. These two cultures clash, and Keaton will have to join forces. Look for great performances from Keaton, Hedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, So Yamamura and Sub Shimomo Don't be fooled by low rated numbers. This is 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the name of the city of Headville was also used at noon. Yes, there is a real Headville, but in Oregon.
