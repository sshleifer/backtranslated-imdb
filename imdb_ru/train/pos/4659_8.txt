Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith it could be just a turkey. But they are great. Ustinov is at his best, and for Maggie’s fans, it’s nice to see her in her early years, picking Ustinov to every step of the way and time. For the British, who are over fifty (and I am in this bracket), it is always interesting to see glimpses and hear the sounds of the swinging sixties, and although this film spends a lot of time in offices, there is a lot of nostalgia for the sixties, including red buses, Carnaby Street, Lulu song and a delightful snapshot of a waitress's micro-skirt, like England has never seen in public places since then. How I.T. Engineer, I know that computer hacker tricks are ridiculous, but they cannot be taken seriously. Not surprising are the stereotypes of Italians, French and Germans.
