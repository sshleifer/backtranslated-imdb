Chocolat Claire Denis is a beautiful but disappointing film. The film presents a very interesting look at the household of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an informative look at the lives of many characters and their interaction. However, the development of these characters is often insane enough. For example, the central theme of this story is the inability of young France to establish strong relationships with others. Although this image is flawless, especially in the way Denis creates a plot with scenes from France’s return to her childhood home, the girl’s lack of closeness with other film characters prevents the viewer from investing much in her development (or lack thereof) as the main character. The general stagnation of the character's development of the film makes it difficult to participate in a poorly organized plot. The film causes great tension between the characters, especially between Aimee and the men in her life, but never fully solves this social problem, leaving the viewer unsatisfied. The last few scenes are powerful but depressing. The work of Denis is certainly interesting from the intellectual and historical points of view, but if you are looking for a movie with adventure or drama, “Chocolat” is definitely not the best choice.
