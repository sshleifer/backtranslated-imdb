Two adventurous teenagers, best friends, go to Thailand to get the latest experience before parting and going to college. It’s like a fun time traveling around an exotic country until they meet an attractive stranger who seduces them on a trip to Hong Kong and puts drugs in their luggage. They are picked up by local police, and they discover that justice in Asia is very different from justice in the United States. <br /> <br /> This is the main storyline of the Brokedown Palace, and it was good. The film does a decent job portraying the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of third world countries. In fact, the image was rather mild, since prison conditions are often much worse than depicted. This serves as a reminder that no matter how badly we think about our justice system, it is unparalleled compared to most of the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film had too many contrived situations that interfered with the story. The whole escape attempt was a sham fantasy. To think that friends will be able to send money for a bribe to a prison in a soft bra and not be discovered by guards, who systematically check everything that comes from visitors, suggests that either guards or viewers are absolute boobies. <br /> <br /> The story also fails to close the question of how drugs got into Alice’s backpack (Claire Danes). Did she really agree to transport drugs? We have to guess. It was intriguing to continue wondering about the innocence of girls throughout the entire film, but we are finishing the film without ever knowing whether one or both girls are guilty. With the exception of this significant drawback, the final was excellent, and the results were unexpected. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale's game was very solid and well made. The Danes, who were resold and over-promoted, actually arrived as an actor in this film. Although her image was often immature (as was her character), she improved as the film progressed, and circumstances became more terrible. Beckinsale, on the contrary, flies his entire short career under the radar and shines like good-natured boots that suddenly end up in prison. Her best performance in the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman was mistaken for a lawyer. His ironic and insecure style is an advantage in films such as While You Slept, but as a lawyer in a third world country in a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice, he had the wrong person. <br /> <br /> The tourist’s gaze on Thailand was interesting, but it didn’t force me to go there. <br /> <br /> In general, an entertaining film made implausible in parts thanks to the insertion of some ridiculous scenes. I gave him 7/10.
