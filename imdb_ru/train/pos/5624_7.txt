I have never been a fan of Farrah Fawcett ... Until now. She was really amazing in this movie. The emotions that she must have gone through a re-take after a re-take don't make you think. It was very hard to watch this film, the theme is obviously unpleasant, and you feel so helpless just sitting and watching how it is mocked at the woman, it seems, an eternity. I actually felt that it was all blown away when her friends returned to the house, and I did not find the conclusion at all plausible. The director seemed very keen on using heights in his frames and liked to use specular reflections, I suppose he should have paid more attention to the tempo in the second half of this part. I am sure that this is a damn powerful theater, this film for me, although I had my merits, simply did not succeed.
