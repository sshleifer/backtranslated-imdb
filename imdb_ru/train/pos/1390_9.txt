If you like the cult science fiction of the 70s just like me, or if you like films like “Repo” or “Bacaru Bonzai”, then you will like this film. This is a fantastic stream of consciousness of the 70s, including a dump of the 22nd century and the Earth in a million years. This film is pure 70s. Put on "Like Like Eagle" or Pink Floyd "Dark Side Of The Moon" on Steve Miller and you are ready to go!
