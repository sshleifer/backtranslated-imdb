I just realized that I have been using IMDb for many years, and I have never watched my favorite movie. By love, I do not mean what I like at the moment, I mean that this film is so supernaturally perfect that there will never again be a touch to it. This is obvious because I will never be a child again; I saw this movie on ITV in the early nineties. I was 12 years old, this is the age group for which this film is directed, I am also the man for whom this film is intended (the overwhelming majority of Miyazaki's main characters are women). Consequently, this film indelibly inspired my childhood psychology, and I am forever indebted to Karl Macek (sp?) For producing the English dub of this film, which is far superior to the production of De Déni, which is not even funny - I never even had the opportunity to see it - of course With subtitles is the only way, but the version of Macek is SO good (voices almost exactly correspond to the original Japanese actors) that this version is available on a Japanese DVD! It is not available in any distribution in the English-speaking country. Go figure it out. <br /> <br /> There are hundreds of competent reviews, so I'm going to present here some little things, and not that I am an exhaustive archive of information for this film. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to agree with the reviewer, who said that you need 20 of 10 to watch Miyazaki films - they are so much in their own league that they make almost the entire IMDb catalog as a whole pale and insignificant. <br /> <br /> A fascinating story with this film: Miyazaki founded the countryside around the Slag Gulch (near Pazu) in Welsh mining communities. He visited Wales for several months in the early 80s (maybe in the late 70s) right after one of the great strikes. Being an avid supporter of student socialist movements in the sixties, he felt their plight. The struggle between citizens and pirates at the beginning illustrates this empathy for the worker. The countryside and the clouds, especially in this film, remind me of where I grew up, because his film depicts a fantastic version of the rolling hills in the Midwest of the British Isles. <br /> <br /> The island, of course, from the brilliant satirical Swift. The eighteenth-century novel - the story in Swift’s book is intentionally ridiculous. In Castle in the Sky, Miyazaki weaves together myths such as Atlantis and the Tower of Babel — I think the architecture is based on the ruins of Peru, although I’m not sure if anyone told me that. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to read this review and who likes this movie REALLY wants to see the Miyazaki epic series Mirai Shawenen Conan - Future Boy Conan - based on Alexander Neid’s short science fiction novel Incredible Wave ”(the novel is available online). Conan is basically a prototype for Pazu and Shita Laputy. In addition, you may not be familiar with his earlier work for the Masterpiece Theater — some of his key animation frames. He also made a keyframe for Sherlock Hound - he has some of the best backgrounds I've ever seen. Also check out Miyazaki and Takahata's first feature film, The Prince of the Sun of Horus (1968), which is truly astounding. What else ... Cut the cellist and The Flying Ghost Ship - although they are quite rare. <br /> <br /> This film is such a gift, I don’t know what we would do without it with everyone is another crappy story, it's like an oasis. Arigatu Miyazaki-sensei!
