Maybe this is only because I have a strong fear of hospitals and medical staff, but this one was under my skin (sorry for the pun). This piece is bold, not afraid to go beyond the edge and as satisfactory as they come in terms of revenge films. I not only felt a strong hatred for the joker and sympathy for the "screwee", I felt how I cringe and suffer the pain of disgust in certain situations, which really is a rare and delightful thing for a little exhausted horror viewer such as myself. Some parts are very reminiscent of Hellraiser, but pay tribute, not imitation. This is hard work that does not offer the viewer a lot of attention, but I like it when the film is attacked once and for a while. This part brings it and does not apologize. I really liked it. DO NOT look while eating pudding.
