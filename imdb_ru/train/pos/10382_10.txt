As with all the other reviewers, this film was permanent in my head after 30 years. I remember going to the library, exploring everything I could for this story. I even wrote to the PBS station for more information. Despite all this, all I could find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early 1900s. <br /> <br /> After 2002, after several years of searching the weekly on eBay, the basis and there it was, a VHS copy of the film. There was another participant, but I decided to win this film. The losing party wrote me a letter asking for a copy. Despite the fact that I had a copy, I was still searching and, finally, searching for a site that was selling a copy of a DVD movie.
