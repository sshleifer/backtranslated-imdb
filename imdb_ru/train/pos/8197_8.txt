**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Good <br /> <br /> ** Excellent <br /> <br /> * Bad <br /> <br /> Forward, done my day!' <br /> <br /> The fourth film in the series was shot by Eastwood himself (who is rumored to direct most of the Magnum Force), and he returns the violence society from the first two films. Nonetheless, the film still lacks impact and believability. This film was released in the early 80s, in the days of Regan and the young Republicans. The assumption that a raped woman takes revenge on her rapist does not correspond to this time frame. This story would be better for the Enforcer, which would actually make it a good movie. A sudden blow was needed like on Wall Street, but with Dirty Harry in the middle. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3 STARS
