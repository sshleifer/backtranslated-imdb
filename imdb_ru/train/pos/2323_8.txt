Man on the Moon is a pretty good movie. Sometimes it is very touching and very well done in all respects. I would not say that the film was terribly original, but what about these days? <br /> <br /> All the actors coped well with their roles. I really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon at such a young age, and I am doing quite well. Jason London does a great job too. And the only other person I recognized was Sam Waterston, who did an excellent job with his role. I really liked Sam's character (Matthew Trent). At times he seemed like the father you fear, but in the end you really like his character. The rest of the cast was also very good. <br /> <br /> If you like touching films about growing up and about what life throws at you, then you should watch this movie. I would advise you to read the plot summary, and if it sounds like something that interests you, then do it. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> - Chris
