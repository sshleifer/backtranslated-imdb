Another Australian masterpiece, he plunges into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and this is very good. He does not resort to great special effects, like American films, he focuses more on the emotional impact. A relatively simple plot that Rebecca Gibney & Co. brings to life. It follows the story of a couple who buys an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went out and whose husband disappeared under mysterious circumstances a century ago. Strange things start to happen in the house, and John Adam begins to turn into a man who disappeared, who actually was a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 8/10
