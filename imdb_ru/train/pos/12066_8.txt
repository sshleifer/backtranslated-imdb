It is not known whether Marilyn Monroe has ever met and whether she has communicated with Albert Einstein (and since the mysterious disappearance of her diary after her equally mysterious death, we may never know), but during their lifetime there was such an opportunity. <br /> <br /> Terry Johnson’s script from Nicholas Horn’s own play, The Minor, is a meeting in one of the night York hotel rooms in one night in 1953 between two icons plus Joe DiMaggio (Buzie) and Senator Joseph McCarthy ( Curtis) - but only on one level. At another level, he elevates - or reduces - these “personalities” (and what a lousy phrase) to simple avatars (characters that are purposely unnamed), which at the same time have a greater and lesser status. <br /> <br /> The name “Minor” is appropriate and deeply ironic; Here, the net value of DiMaggio has been reduced to slightly more than the image on the chewing gum card. Monroe also comes down to its component parts of dress, hair, lipstick, wiggle and voice. Revealing their self-doubt and changing roles, the film focuses on celebrities who explode the personality cult. <br /> <br /> Continuing the theme, another explosion will occur at the climax of the film: Hiroshima in a hotel room in which the “Actress” burns to ashes in a matter of seconds; literal deconstruction of glory. Goodbye, Norma Jean. The story tells the script, which, in turn, shakes the story upside down. Rugh pondered, seeing Johnson’s play for the first time: “These characters were mythical, not one person invented them, not the public, not the press, probably even the characters themselves.” Theresa Russell Marilyn (intelligent wardrobe in real life) lectures childishly to Einstein (“Professor” played by Emil) on the theory of relativity using balloons and a flashlight, while the professor shows off his legs in a conscious parody of his his own role in "Seven Years Itch", the film "Actress" is working on the opening of the film. <br /> <br /> The story records that the then husband of Monroe, the fading baseball star DiMaggio (played by Busey as a gentle psychotic), was unhappy with her cult scene in the film, which provoked their breakup. Right at the signal, we find in the bar a jealous "baseball player" mourning the fact that if "I want to see her underwear, I just go to the corner, like all the other guys." <br /> <br /> Unlike the professor, The Ballplayer believes that the universe is round - discord shared by Native Americans. But the Big Leader (Sampson, "One Flew Over the Glory of the Cuckoo's Nest"), who runs the elevator of the Roosevelt Hotel, is almost deprived of his right to vote in his own culture: "I am no longer Cherokee - I watch TV." In the meantime, the Senator is investigating a professor who, on the eve, gives a pacifist speech at the United Nations, but which the senator suspects is red. In fact, in disclosing Monroe, Einstein is seized with a sense of guilt for Hiroshima and for what lies ahead in the future. Yet in the seemingly godless universe, all such worries and aspirations turn out to be insignificant in the light of higher (atomic) power. <br /> <br /> Roeg really is the perfect director who brings Johnson's stage play to the screen. Everywhere, painful childhood memories and pessimistic forward attacks (ka-boom!) Create unexpected connections between time, place and circumstances, with a repetitive visual motif of a wristwatch used to mark the time that passes — but perhaps also to suggest that all the time - once; every moment coexists. As can be seen from his back catalog, this is something like an amateur horse for a director who is passionate about the notion of synchronicity - see. In particular, “Do not look now.” Here the 1920s are transformed into the 1945s, and the drip channels into the 1980s, a period when another “actor” assumed its main role as president of the United States. <br /> <br /> If it all sounds pretty hard going on (quantum physics is involved, of course), doing it is anything, but because of Johnson’s witty, witty script, Rogue’s playful direction revealing essentially a stage setting - and the actors themselves, who are in stellar form. Tony Curtis especially leaves traces of dentures on wooden panels as a paranoid impotent senator, who is believed to be trying to go with the copycat Monroe (real, unlike Russell), before his exhausted member let him down. <br /> <br /> Of course, Curtis once starred in the real Marilyn Monroe in the film Some Like It Hot, and whose arms he unforgettably described as "a Hitler kissing." As Rug commented: "Everything suddenly seemed connected ... when the film began to take shape, even the actors themselves seemed part of this endless connection." All this goes into the pot, so that it is cooked and served in a new and exciting way.
