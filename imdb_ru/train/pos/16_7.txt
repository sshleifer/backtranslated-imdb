I found it to be so-so romance / drama that has a pleasant ending and a generally pleasant appearance. This is not a family film like Hallmark Fame, in which dreaming before marriage is considered "normal" behavior, but considering that stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro were shot, I would expect a much more rough film, at least in terms of language. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the film is the image of how difficult it is to learn to read and write when you are already an adult. This is a big movie theme, and there are some touching scenes in it, but, honestly, the film is not so memorable. <br /> <br /> This is still a rather soft, pleasant story, which I would recommend with pleasure,
