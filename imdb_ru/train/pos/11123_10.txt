Hello from this Portuguese guy :) <br /> <br /> I think the Soprano is one of the best works in history, in which reality and fiction are mixed in such a way that it is difficult to see the difference. It has the same quality as GodFather! James Gandolfini fits into paper like a glove! I would like the Sopranos to never end at all. It's perfect! It should be a subject at school :) I saw Sopranos when I was a kid, but I was too young to stay awake until the end of the episode, so now I bought all the episodes in DVD format and watch all the episodes at home before and after dinner, and I'm getting addicted, like I did with Prison Break. In my opinion, Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best television series in history. The arguments of both are gorgeous, and the actors are beautiful. Congratulations on this job. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my english. Thanks for reading.
