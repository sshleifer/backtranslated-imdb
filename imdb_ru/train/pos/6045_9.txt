I was in the film too, but I don't know if they really included this scene. On the way back from the school trip (in 2005) we stopped at the service station at the same time as they were making the film, and we were asked (all of us) to run in and shout "Go!" Free Bird! We were only about 10 years old, could anyone who saw the movie tell me if this part was actually preserved in the film, it would be great to know! I remember, I thought the movie never came out, because two and a half years passed before it was released. All your comments seem good, so I guess it was a pretty successful film, I could buy it, but first I would like to know if I am in it! : D Thank you
