I saw The Big Bad Swim in 2006 at the Temecula Film Festival, and was completely taken aback by how much I was attracted to it. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the life of a group of people who take adults swimming lesson for various reasons. By itself, a humorous idea, the class serves as a catalyst for big changes in students' lives. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about the film was how realistic it was. Rarely in the ensemble of the play, the characters turn so well. I really liked the scenes in the classroom, and the drama that took place on the street was very sharp. Nothing seemed out of place or inappropriate, and ultimately it left a very strong feeling, very much like visiting a school or summer camp - where you find fast friends, make strong bonds and open yourself, but must leave too soon. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was that the character of Paula had a very strong and unusual introduction, because of which you wanted to know a little more about it than was finally revealed. I believe that you will not meet everyone in the class ... <br /> <br /> In addition, I found the film very successful and quite enjoyable. See if you have the opportunity.
