There are some bad reviews here, and I understand why, but treat him like a low-budget movie about a serial killer, and you can get more from him than most. <br /> <br /> I thought it worked, because then I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower, so this is some degree of success, isn't it? <br /> <br /> I would say that there is only the right level of meanness to penetrate your skin, although the acting game may be too uneven, David Hess is only in this nonsense, so do not expect much if you like Last House. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is worth seeing.
