The first episode immediately gave a good impression of what to expect from the series! Secrets to be solved, and a lot of good drama! I like the fact that they gradually reveal stories about characters! Explanation is enough to be delighted! Of course, this show has some drawbacks! In the first two series there are characters who for some reason do not appear in the third season! Many of the characters are worthily sent away, but some are simply not there! Like Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to them? Perhaps they will return in later episodes! But this is a bit contradictory! That said “Lost” manages to be exciting every episode (especially the first two seasons)! It is very difficult to do! I noticed that in the third season, the focus is on character development, not the mysterious aspects of the show! This is a good thing! It even saves some episodes from boredom! One of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are great characters! You will love these characters! Good or bad! But in the end I want to see some riddles that will be revealed and closed! The danger of canceling "Lost" due to a downgrade is close! And that would be devastating!
