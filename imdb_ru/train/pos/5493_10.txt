Very rarely can one see an internal notion of deceiving the media, which was so widely publicized as the official “truth” and which found so many “news” agencies behind it. This film, in my opinion, deserves any price in journalism - it is objective (yes!), Brave and real “scoop”. It can do without comments, fake scenes or leading questions - everyone, including Chavez, is equally able to fool himself with his words. The creators of the “only” movie were supposed to follow the events and keep their cameras on. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan elite teach us "How to overthrow the president and sell him as a victory for democracy." It's amazing that they lost in the end - for now. From what I know, the largest television station that received only a terrestrial license was withdrawn, they are still broadcasting via cable and satellite. I very much doubt that George W. or Barack Obama will be so tolerant after the attempted coup d'état. But then they have nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> The fact that fraud with “supporters of Chavez shoots civilians” so readily repeats around the world shows how prejudiced the so-called “free” (established) media really has become or has always been, only more Togo. An important lesson for anyone interested in what is “really” happening in the world. <br /> <br /> The famous problem of “objectivity” always arises when journalists dare to speak out against the main view or reveal undesirable facts that accuse “we” - this is true of the consequences of the atomic bomb, the secret US history of the spread of “democracy” around the world or the Iraq war, which, according to John Hopkins, has already killed 1.3 million Iraqis, not to mention 60,000 Afghans (in 2003) who are never mentioned. To be objective, Saddam Hussein was less harmful to his people than the United States. And the US is ready and willing to inflict even more damage on the Iranians than it was. <br /> <br /> I’m very curious to know about the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Tribunal in The Hague, whether there will be any mention of “our” participation in the support and training of the Pol Pot guerrillas in the 80s, when they were largely defeated by the Vietnamese. Most likely no. <br /> <br /> There are more and more reasons to turn to independent media for balance, if not exposing fraud.
