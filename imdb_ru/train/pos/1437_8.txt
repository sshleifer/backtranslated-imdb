We often see films about undesirable things happening in politics, but I still recommend City Hall. In the role he was born to play, Al Pacino plays the lead role of the mayor of New York, who deals with shooting a boy. But it turns out that nothing of what he does will have any effect. In this film, the characters are as sandy as we could expect from anyone involved in a political scandal. No matter how much you trust a politician, you may have doubts after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I understand that I cannot name any concrete example of what this film represents, but this is not the point. If we had idealistic impressions of those at the top, this film destroys such ideas. Of course, the one that I urge you to see. Also starring John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franzioz and David Peymer.
