After several extremely good SUPERB ratings, I was very pleased with the film. The film was dark, moving, angry, hurt, guilty and a very persuasive demon. <br /> <br /> I initially expected to see a lot of special effects, and, like the caress of a lover, he struck me with the subtlety and correctness of this. Brian, I'm amazed again by your mastery of telling a story and your concern for special effects. You will go a long way, my friend. I will definitely be the president of your fan club. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari, the best acting award, was number one choice. You made the younger Lopez look like a child compared to Casadey. :) <br /> <br /> In general, the acting, storyline, high-quality shooting and stunning effects - it was fantastic. I just want it to be longer. I look forward to The Dreamless with extremely high expectations.
