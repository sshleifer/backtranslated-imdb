Rarely do we see such short comments written by IMDb viewers. Perhaps this is because this light dark comedy entertains and pleases without depth, or have we missed something? I would watch it again if I had some kind of incentive. <br /> <br /> So what happened? For the French, is "Le Battement d'Ailes du Papillon" Serendipity? Fate? Perhaps this is an event that is the culmination of a series of random events. We all had this (this is called life), but if you look this way, you begin to feel that the "random" may be more like the "doomed." <br /> <br /> “Chance” in this film can be as insignificant as knocking down several lettuce leaves from a truck, or as important as making a life decision based on the accuracy of throwing a stranger at a pebble. All these incidents cause other events that ... well, you understand? Dominoes. Multiply them by 30 characters and an average of 6 each, and you’ll have to really strain your imagination to take the unlikely chance that this scenario can happen. And I think that there is a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like that. But then this is the magic world of cinema. <br /> <br /> We recognize that it is interesting to observe how the writer / director puts together these unrelated events in a story that captures the lives of these French citizens. If you have a couple of hours and you are looking for a fancy escape, here is the place to do it. Or, if you get better after the operation and in any case you are not going anywhere, it will interest you while your sutures are healing. <br /> <br /> “Happenstance” will not win, but must develop a cult of followers. Strange things have happened. <br /> <br /> The following is attributed to Soren Kierkegaard: "Life can only be understood backwards, but it must live forward." If you look at the details in many of your own life situations (meeting your first love, searching for the perfect gift, your last car accident), you will find a series of seemingly random events leading to it. > Here is the answer! I forgot to take the existentialist with me in order to explain to me the "accident".
