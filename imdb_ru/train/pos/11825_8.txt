Don't look for an over-developed storyline here ... just relax with popcorn and enjoy it. A gallery of stars appears as the villains of a classic cartoon character in this lively comedy that features incredible make-up and set design, not to mention Beatty, Madonna and Pacino knock-out. Great fun for kids and adults. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
