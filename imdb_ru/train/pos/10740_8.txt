Created by French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naude and told by Robert De Niro and fireman James Hanlon, this is a compelling and heartbreaking story of how the best New York rays shone on the darkest day. I first saw it when I was a young, naive 12-year-old, and at that age he still touched me. Knowing how serious September 11 was was, expanded the entire effect of September 11th. We figured out who the heroes are, how everyday lives are formed and how they put their lives at stake in a situation where most people just run and save themselves. These brave people are putting their lives at stake, and watching this only strengthens my admiration for them. See if you can, this is the best documentary I've ever seen in person.
