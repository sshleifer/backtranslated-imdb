I waited for ages before I saw this, since all the reviews I read about it said it was terrible! I rented it, expecting the worst, and, although it is hardly the best film about sand, it is much worse there! Sandler often talks to the camera, and the film does not take himself seriously, but this is all part of the fun! A great way to waste a day, and you might even laugh once or twice! Good movie, worth rolling!
