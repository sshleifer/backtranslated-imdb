I can really say that I felt the film in its correct essence, where mind games from dreamy reality are part of the surreal aspect of the future that Tom Cruise has encountered. I didn't really care about Tom Cruise's acting skills, but I have to say that he seems to make an impression at every point of the film ... not just because of the fascinating storyline, but also because his personality was conveyed to the mainstream. the hero ... .. They merge, and then they say, and it is beautiful. However, I have to say that this film does not fall under the "average click of the weekend", which you choose at random and watch joyfully; It carries strong feelings and character, so do not drink it with beer and pop roots. It definitely needs more than that.
