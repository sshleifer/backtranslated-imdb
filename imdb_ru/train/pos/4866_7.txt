First of all, in defense of Joan Fontaine, I must say that Ginger Rogers would have been terribly mistaken for Alice, the young British lady who plays the main role. Fontaine does the charming role of the heroine here, but her acting inexperience shows poorly, and her dance is best left without mention. Fortunately, she did the best things. <br /> <br /> But here Fred Estair, George Burns and Gracie Allen get the best bills - and they are excellent. Fans of Burns and Allen will be surprised at how easily they fit into Aster’s dance programs. Of particular interest is the large entertainment program, in which the choreographer Hermes Pans a Oscar won. They join Aster in what should be the most ingenious feature of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is little to be said about the slow pace of the story - not about some outdated situations that require a lot of patience from the viewer. It must be said that some of the humor is crumbling, and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any Fred Astaire film of this period get the usual attitude. Only musical breaks give the story of the recovery that it needs. <br /> <br /> Some pleasant Gershwin melodies come up from time to time, but not all of them receive the treatment they deserve. A good cast includes Reginald Gardiner, at his best in polished comic playing as a sly servant, Constance Collier and Montague Love (like Father Joan mistakenly took gardener because of Aster). <br /> <br /> This is a carefree prank whenever Burns and Allen are there, they reminded us of how funny they were in their days on radio and television. They are both amazingly skilled at keeping up with Aster's work. <br /> <br /> Director George Stevens will make sure that Joan Fontaine’s dance number is filmed at a short distance, but clever camera work cannot hide the fact that she’s not in her element as Aster’s dance partner, something that she seems painfully aware of.
