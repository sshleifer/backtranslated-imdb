I had the pleasure of seeing this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. Tess Nanawati is undoubtedly a great screenwriter, and I would like to see more of her films. If she could do what she did with the budget of this film, I would love to see what she can do with the main picture. Kudos to the actors for their amazing performances (this little girl was golden) and the one who composed the music. Distorted "Row Your Boat" blew me away. A very creative film ... I really hope to see it on video or DVD, because I would buy it in a second. If you have a chance, you should definitely see this movie.
