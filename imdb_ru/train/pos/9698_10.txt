I have seen this film many times, and for the rest of my life I cannot understand why some people compare it with BABE. This film is not about the secret life of ALL animals that can secretly talk. Instead, itâ€™s about Parrot, who learns to talk, to help her owner, a little girl with a serious stutter, to overcome her problems with speech, to be separated from her in a heart-rending scene at an early stage. Then the great journey begins. Paulie the Parrot goes in search of his wonderful friend, Marie. <br /> <br /> On the way, he meets several wonderful people and many unpleasant people. He falls in love with a parrot girl and loses her. He gets into a criminal life, and then gets captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him. <br /> <br /> He tells his story to a sympathetic janitor in the lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved Marie. <br /> <br /> Tony Shalub brilliantly shows himself as a kind janitor, who has an open mind and a big heart, and who decides to help little Paulie, despite the risks. Jay Mohr plays the voice of the Parrot And one of the squalid characters he encounters. <br /> <br /> There is a little impressive language, but this film is suitable for most children and even more if parents join in the fun and watch too. This is a witty, clever, epic story about the adventures of animals and, ultimately, a great love story about a bird and its little girl. Marie's search ends with an unexpected surprise for most people who know little about parrots. <br /> <br /> Children who have seen wild tribes of green parrots in Los Angeles and Pasadena will especially benefit from watching this film and understanding that birds, especially parrots, are not disposable pets. All children everywhere will see that pets themselves form a deep affection, and that the love and devotion of a dog or a parrot is a gift to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> So there is no CHILD here, rather an incredible journey with Twist. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and try not to tear during the sad moments.
