I love it when they really do sports history well. So much in the past was so strange that it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just a really good movie, an old-fashioned type of story based on a real guy who did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this movie. He plays a high school coach who, at the end of his life, is trying to try in a sports speech to become a pitcher in professional baseball. In the end, he reaches his goal - to get into the big leagues, even if it was a very short time. <br /> <br /> All the characters here are good people you support, from Quaid to the players on his school team, his little boy (Angus T. Jones, currently partly a TV star). <br /> <br /> Quaid is believable in a Jim Morris game, because, unlike actors in the past in sports, he knows how to throw films at baseball. He looks like a pitcher, a guy who can shoot at a speed of over 90 miles per hour. And much of this film is true, as evidenced by a real pitcher in one of the documentaries on DVD. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for a good, inspirational film about real sporting life, you canâ€™t be wrong with that.
