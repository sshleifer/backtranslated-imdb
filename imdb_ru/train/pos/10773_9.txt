I would recommend this film to everyone. Not only fans of the rocker Luciano Ligabue, but all movie lovers. Because it is sincere, touching, funny and truthful. Because Ligabue is a born narrator and film lover, and every frame of his film is made with love and care. Because his characters love and ask to be loved. Because most Italian debut films are lousy, and this one made by a stranger is a real joy to watch and listen to. Because Stefano Accorsi is great and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who, like Freccia, was beautiful, talented, good and lost his life because of the heroin that Ligaby demonstrates as he is, without glamor and disgrace, without indulging in easy moralisms . Because it is a film that speaks to our heart, our ears, our souls. And because I experienced the experience of FM radio, and it was just that. Thank you, Luciano!
