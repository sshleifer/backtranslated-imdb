All Kira Reed fans MUST see this. The film is based on the romance of Kira's novel, which is struggling with difficulties, unable to come up with any new ideas. She is also experiencing a divorce. However, she meets this guy in a restaurant, and he helps her get out of her sink (and clothes). They go to the corner room and do it. Fortunately, Kira gets a condom (now never tell me that these Playboy films are useless heaps of soft fluff. Remember children, safe sex). Later, she was surprised by her publicist, as it was great, but she did not get his name. Despite this, the guy finds her, and they continue their strange games. But in the end she gets tired of his meanness and wants to know more. When she does, all hell will break loose, and I will leave it at that. This is probably the best Playboys movie I've ever seen. Check it out and marvel at the greatness of Kira.
