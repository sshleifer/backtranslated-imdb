“Here is my Bush - this is, first of all, a very interesting show of Parker and Stone,” I thought. This is often very, very funny, and rather disruptive and insane. Fans of South Park will surely get something here. <br /> <br /> Another surprise is the cost of production. It must have been invested a lot of money, and it shows. Lots of expensive little details. This is not a small show. And Comedy Central is not an extremely rich channel, but they clearly invest a lot in this show. In a sense, I understand that it was the death of the show, although it was too expensive. Of course, this could be done cheaper, and they went free there. <br /> <br /> Critics liked it, and it had a small fan base, but it could not win a large audience. As we know, the show stopped after 8 episodes, which, I think, is almost 1 season. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the show, which has its drawbacks. The problem with the show is that he doesn't know who he really wants to be. As if he is trying to be a sitcom and a parody on the sitcom at the same time. The actors do a good job, and some of them are well-casted, but in my opinion, they don't always get the 100% weird humor that they have to represent. <br /> <br /> I personally think that the show needed more mundane characters. In South Park, you have Kyle and Stan, who are something like a realistic touch in a more insane universe. I think this is what makes South Park work. You need some sensible characters to whom you can be realistic, and this makes insane things much more interesting, because it makes you take them seriously at some level. If all these are archetypes and stereotypes, then it is emotionally difficult to include them in the show, which is actually the biggest problem of Thats My Bush. Kyle and Stan - characters in South Park, who understand the madness of the series. We have nothing like this here, and this show suffers from it. <br /> <br /> Another distinguishing feature is Parker and the Stones, flirting with Republicans. This is the only thing in them that I do not understand what they are trying to do. Doing to portray Bush as a stupid cute character of Homer Simpson is a kind of disruptive factor in a world where many people can't stand him and consider him the worst president since Nixon, and the parallel comedy world Letterman so it only makes fun of him every move ... but it's hard to know if Parker and Stone really mean something to that. It's like a joke on us, but for some reason it doesn’t hit the mark. It seems awkward because it doesn’t really remind you of the real Bush. <br /> <br /> Also, I really thought the show was very enjoyable. Some jokes are funny here. The anti-abortion proponent who was the surviving aborted fetus is probably one of my favorite jokes of them in any show. And the show is filled with great material, and sometimes it’s ridiculously funny if you use your head a little while watching.
