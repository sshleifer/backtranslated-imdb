/ The first episode of “The Lost”, which I saw, made me think, I thought, what kind of people who broke and were being chased by a giant monster. But this is not so, it is much more, because they are not monsters at all, and every episode of “Lost” that you see is good, every time it gets better. a deserted island with an underground bunker and especially the connection between people who intersected each other before they crashed. This is a real secret. <br /> <br /> This series of rules, and I can’t wait to find out what's really going on there. I hope that they do not broadcast the last 2 episodes in theaters, this series deserves 9 of 10
