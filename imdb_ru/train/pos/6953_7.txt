This is one of those films that make better trailers than full-length feature films. The concept was really cool and great, the humor was unique, I just felt that the opportunity to apply a “hit” in this film was missed. So many lines and gags remained hanging too long, without a definite end, and really did not make me laugh. Wilson, Wilson, Farris and Thurman were great. Wanda Sykes was underused in this film and needed more exposure and more opportunities to turn her character into more time on the screen. 7 out of 10 for me, more rolled DVD. In addition, I was looking for some nice music video during the final credits, something that became a kind of trademark for these romantic comedy films, “Something about Mary, meet the parents,” but again left a feeling deceived by the fact that this CAN be a much better movie with a bit more music and more highlights. It seemed to me that it was urgently sent to the theaters.
