"Roman Troy Moroni" - my commentary on the film. What more can be said? <br /> <br /> This character really reveals a moron in Moroni. A cool gangster with an inability to pronounce profanity, well, it would seem to be unpleasant to be tough and yet not be able to express himself intelligently. <br /> <br /> Roman Moroni will be included in the annals of film history as one of the greatest morons. <br /> <br /> Of course, among the other characters there is a great comedy. Michael Keaton - F.A.H. so does joe scripto. <br /> <br /> I just like the fact that Moroni kept the film from the “R” rating because he could not pronounce profanity.
