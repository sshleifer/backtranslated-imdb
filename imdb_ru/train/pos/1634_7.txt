I first caught the movie on its first launch on HBO in (probably) 1981, and when I was 15, I thought the movie was hilarious. I remember that I did NOT see the images of Alfred E. Neumann shown in theater trailers. When MAD Magazine fed the film and suddenly stopped halfway through with the apology of the “regular gang” for condescension to the satire of such a piece of shit, I just assumed that they were mocking themselves, which I was sure, but I was very surprised that seriously they (and Ron Liebman) embarrassed to remove their names from the lists. Of course, there are many worse films that can be linked. Watching a movie on video now (at the age of 32) with the MAD links restored, I still enjoy it. And, being a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, Where is Popp?), I think that this is his gem of performances (SAY IT AGAIN)
