I took part in a small mini-production of this when I was 8 years old at school, and my mother bought a video for me. I love it since then !! When I was younger, I liked the songs and the exciting dance episodes, but since I watched them when I got older, I appreciate the fantastic acting of the actors and the image. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were great. I can't imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Feigin. Nancy Shani Wallis, if the best character for me. She tolerates so much for those guys, I think she is such a strong character and her last scene when ... Well, you know ... Always makes me cry! The best musical in my opinion of all time. It lasted all this time, it will live for many more years! 11/10 !!
