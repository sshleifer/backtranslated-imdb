Just the best reality show ever created. The first two seasons (the only ones that matter) on Hula. I urge anyone to watch the first three episodes of season 1 and will not like it. I guarantee you finish watching the season. Then I guarantee that you will watch season 2. <br /> <br /> Other quick reasons to watch it: 1. Anderson Cooper jolly 2. Places in Europe are amazing 3. Games are mentally complicated 4. This is very interactive 5. In one From the episodes, the player responds to another player's desperate spell: “I try my best!” with the same desperate “Not necessarily.” <br /> <br /> Can you find out ... Who is the Mole?
