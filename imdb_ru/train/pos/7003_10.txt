The emotional impact of this film defies any words. It is elegant, sophisticated, beautiful and tragic - all in two hours. This is Will Smith as he develops in his acting skills, in their entirety. Who knew? I looked at “The Pursuit of Happyness” and thought that this must be an accident for the blockbuster, the actor “Smith.” His actions in both films show Smith a completely different dimension, refinement of talent, selectivity of scenarios, I'm not sure, but now I look at him differently. “Seven Pounds” is one of those films that, in order to fully enjoy its essence, must interrupt your faith. Do not look at the plot, look at the fragile state of the human heart, in the literal and figurative sense. This is the story of human guilt, redemption, love and sacrifice.
