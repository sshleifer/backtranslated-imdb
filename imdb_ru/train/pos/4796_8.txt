“A really good moral story about brotherly love,” describes this strange David Lynch film. It was especially "strange" because it was not the film that Lynch had produced in the last 15–20 years. These were dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, Mulholland Drive), and this is the other way around. I know it disappointed many of his fans. Others were delighted with this. Consider me one of the last, and I own all three of these “dark” films. <br /> <br /> It was another plausible life story, which details the journey of an elderly person on a lawnmower from West Iowa to Wisconsin to see his sick brother, with whom he had not communicated for years, but wants to see before he dies. Well, I guess the premise — the old man driving the 400-mile lawnmower — still makes this “weird” film of its own kind, so Lynch stays in character with it! <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays a major role. He is that type of guy, with a face, voice, restrained character that almost everyone likes. The wrinkles on his face tell a lot of stories. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after the release of this film. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes of this film are small and not always pleasant, as they show the main adult child and mentally retarded child of the character (Sissy Spacek) and her tragic past, but as soon as Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins his journey , the story begins to evolve. I played it for a few friends, and they thought that the film NEVER took, but I'm more generous with that. I think it is a hidden gem. For them, it was a sleeping pill. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me that his trip was quite exciting, but you have to understand in advance that this will NOT be a suspicious Lynch crime story. It's slow, and if you're okay, you might like it. Charm comes into the picture of some people who are met by Alvin along the way, such as a strayed, wayward young girl and some lovely city dwellers who help an old man when he gets in trouble. (Henry Cada, as “Daniel Riordan, is outstanding in this regard.) Harry Dean Stanton gets the third score, but this is a joke: he is only in the last few minutes of the film! <br /> <br /> The landscape of Iowa is nice. I lived there for several years and can witness hilly terrain and rich soil. It is a good condition with good people .... like this movie.
