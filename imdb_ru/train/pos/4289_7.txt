I must be 100% honest with you, other IMDb users. I wanted to watch this film for a long time only because of the poster. Doesn't Charlotte Gainsburg look so sexy and smiling charmingly? I'm in love with this woman! I got what I expected ... but only half. This film should meet the expectations of those who love all sorts of romantic comedies or stories associated with clever humor and light dramatic situations. <br /> <br /> Although I do not agree with another colleague from IMDb who claims that the film is overrated; I have to admit that Préte-moi ta main has many flaws. <br /> <br /> My main problem with the film is the lack of chemistry on the screen between the main characters. There is not a single scene preceding the climax, which shows the main characters sharing the moment of "romance" or even a hint to suggest that they are interested in each other. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only scene where the two share a moment with each other is incredibly awkward (when both are on the couch) and does not help the audience understand possible love interest. I have not bought a sequence of dinners. <br /> <br /> However, the film delivers very funny moments and has strong dialogues that support such an ingenious premise. I mean with ingenuity that these days it would be very difficult to fulfill this farce by a 43-year-old man. <br /> <br /> I understand that this is a film, and therefore I accept this as an amusing situation. Plus, humor is universal. There are moments related to S & M, funny lines with Chabat’s best friend, some lesbian references, funny situations involving family women, and much more. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Guynsburg plays at the highest level, and she certainly is the reason to watch a movie. She is funny, sexy, looks very skinny and graceful, and demonstrates that she is a versatile and talented actress who can play a comedy and dramatic role in sheer brilliance. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat is a great actor and gives a very decent performance. I think the cast does everything possible. <br /> <br /> Evaluation, artistic direction and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look at the film. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoy this type of movie should be after the final credits. This is a good example of a good movie.
