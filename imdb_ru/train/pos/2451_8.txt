George Lopez is a funny person even without a sitcom. The first episodes that I saw on this occasion, too often joked at the expense of his mother. As I watched it more, there was more and more variety. No one on the set is truly immune to their wit. <br /> <br /> This season, it seems to me that George is becoming more comfortable with the role of a family sitcom. At first he was not, but he gets more and more into the groove. It makes him and the show all the more funny. They added a couple of characters for George to play this year too. His wife's father is more and more involved in the conspiracy. <br /> <br /> His mom is still there, but not as important as in past seasons. I think it would be prudent to say with a sense of Georgeâ€™s comic time and the absence of good ABC comedies, George Lopez has good chances to be here on ABC much later than George Bush.
