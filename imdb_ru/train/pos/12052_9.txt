I saw it on TV so long ago that I can't remember when it was, but it still stands out as one of the scariest, most nervous films I've ever seen. There is at the same time a subtle but strong fear caused by a woman in black hiding on the edge of the frame, which is not clearly visible, so you feel (like the hero of a lawyer) unsure whether this is just an imagination or not. It is also one of the few films that made me afraid to keep watching. “Production values” are hung, good films are about the director’s ability to create an atmosphere using the film, actors, locations / scenery, music, attention to detail and ... imagination. A real gem.
