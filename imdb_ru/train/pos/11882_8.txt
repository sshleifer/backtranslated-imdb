This film has been in my collection for a while, but not before my friend reminded me of this ?? until I decided I should watch this. I did not know much about Close to Leo ?? just that it should have been a great coming of age film, and it deals with a very serious topic ?? AIDS. <br /> <br /> Although a person who has AIDS ?? The lion script unfolds how Marcel (Leo's younger brother) faces the illness of his relative. At first, everyone is trying to hide the truth from Marcel ?? is he considered too young to understand his brotherâ€™s illness ?? The fact that Lev is also a homosexual contributes to the reluctance of parents to discuss this issue with the young Marcel. From experience, I know that in many cases most older people do not want to admit the fact that sometimes, even if someone is young, this does not automatically mean that he will not be able to accept reality and act more adequately than even they themselves. Except for the fact that the family tried to hide the truth from Marseille, did they leave me enough impressions ?? how did they support their son ?? even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and his illness. The fact that they allowed young Marcel to go with Paris to meet his ex-boyfriend with Leo was a pretty gesture from their side ?? most families I know will be reluctant to do that. In the scenes where the brothers spend some time together, a lot of heat. You can see that they are true friends, they care about each other. <br /> <br /> Close to Leo is a great drama that I highly recommend
