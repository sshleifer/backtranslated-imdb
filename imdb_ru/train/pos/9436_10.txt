"Is it all up to you, Ed?" "Now you can play the game." On the day my father left my mother, he took me to see this film with his new girlfriend at the opening at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. I was only fourteen years old. I wasn't even completely sure what I saw, but I will never forget this, especially the scene with Ned Beattie. <br /> <br /> Watching this today, thirty-six years later, he still makes me shiver. <br /> <br /> My father was a big fan of Bert Reynolds, so I stood in line for almost an hour to watch a movie that was supposed to be a “warrior”. Before that, I had seen two films in the House: “Grand Prix” and “Song of Norway”. Well, it wasn't quite Mario Andretti or Brady Bunch. Coming out of the theater, I was stunned. <br /> <br /> But even at this tender age I appreciated artistry ... and seeing again today, I was surprised that I was still standing after witnessing this disturbing, but extremely well thought out film. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen-year-old who had not kissed his first girlfriend. I do not blame my father for taking me, but it was a little for the child to testify. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I still find it quite disturbing, yet I am still very impressed with the quality of the filming. <br /> <br /> Bert Reynolds is an absolute miracle, like all principles ... from Billy Redden as an inbred guitar miracle to Ronnie Cox as a scared insurance provider ... everyone does a wonderful job. The sound quality is unmatched, from the chirping of birds to the ticking clock. Photography, cinematography ... all the technical aspects of this wonderful film are first class. <br /> <br /> The moral issues raised from killing sexual assailants to the consequences of killing a person remain unchanged. deep today, as they did when this groundbreaking film was released. And the classic sequence of attempts to survive in the desert after fighting with such unforeseen cruelty change lives. These four, urban men, unexpectedly confronted with a situation they had never dreamed of, raise the bar from action to horror. <br /> <br /> This is a classic to be sure. And the phrase “you have a beautiful mouth” is quoted endlessly, starting from Saturday Night Live and ending with extraordinary comments about a water cooler at work, this film is without doubt a huge part of our social pop culture ... as much was "Make my day" or "I'll be back." <br /> <br /> And what would you do if you found that your friends are sexually abused at the sight of mountain men far from your life? Is there a cozy bed in the city, a wife and children? And if you had taken the measures taken by Bert Reynolds (and I would have done the same), would you have buried the body under the lake, which should be soon, or appeared before the court and took the risk? The essence is as follows: delivery delivers. You can take it to the bank. If this film is not under your skin, then you are not human. <br /> <br /> Even if you saw it before, rent it again and ask yourself the above question. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie remains the same: Ed can't kill a deer ... then changes. Life and its unpredictable circumstances can change a person. And I believe that it is in this film that John Voitte is told, in particular, how Ed gives the best performance here. And he remains one of the most gifted actors in Hollywood history, starting with Midnight Cowboy and ending with his extremely underrated performance in the role of Franklin Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor. His action takes the film to a new level. Climbing the cliffs at dusk, scared and determined to do it right. I guarantee that your pulse will be taken to a new level. <br /> <br /> Sharp, tense, tense and tense, like a banjo string, is a moral game that asks questions that remain today. Times change, but our choice, as people, is not. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten stars.
