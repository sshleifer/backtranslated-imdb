Yaitate !! Japan is a really fun show, and I like it very much! It was shown in our country quite recently in Hero TV and ABS-CBN every 5:30. We are talking about Azume Kazume, who is trying to fulfill his dream to make Japanese bread, which will represent his country. He works at Toyotâ€™s southern branch in Pantasia, and also helps his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) along with other bakers (such as Kawachi Kyusuke and Kanmuri Seeger) to defeat St. Pierre and take control of Pantasia. They fight with other skilled bakers from many other countries and not only learn how to cook different kinds of bread, but also learn how to cook other dishes. These are really funny and unique anime because they also mimic characters from other anime (such as Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and famous real-life people. This is one of the best works of Takashi Khashiguchi, and it is really indispensable for people of different ages.
