I grew up on this classic western TV series, and as a kid I always thought it was a pleasure that I was allowed to stay up late on Sunday evenings to watch it. Bonanza is still infinitely available for re-viewing. <br /> <br /> The series tells about the adventures of the Cartwright family who live on a ranch near the city of Virginia, Nevada, in the era of the civil war. Their ranch (called Ponderosa) is run and protected from the widowed father of Ben and his three unmarried sons, Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe. These three brothers have different mothers, and they all died years earlier. <br /> <br /> Cartwrights is a hardworking, prosperous and noble family that enjoys great respect in these parts. Ponderosa is large, so it takes a lot of riding to reach the limbs. In addition, travel is often necessary to buy or sell livestock and so on. Needless to say, few of these excursions take place without incident. Despite the hospitality, much of the energy of Cartwrighters should be spent on protecting their ranch from trespassers or on citizens who envy their prosperity and stellar reputation. Cartwright pretty shoot their weapons into the air and the like, but shoot to kill when absolutely necessary. They are involved in various city affairs, even in political life in Nevada. <br /> <br /> One of the main advantages of the series is the main warmth, which is always present (despite random disagreements) between Ben and his three sons, and (despite frequent disagreements) between three brothers. So, one brother can beat another from time to time, but usually he has good reasons for that, and his anger never lasts long! All characters are very well traced. Ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man with great honesty. The eldest son, Adam, the most intelligent and courteous of the brothers, left in the middle of the series. The middle brother, Hoss, is a gentle giant teddy bear who has an insatiable appetite for food and is a little shy about women. The younger, little Joe, charming, charming handsome, who, on the contrary, is well-versed in women. This trio of brothers enjoys various novels, but their love interests, as a rule, disappear by the end of the episode, otherwise marriage for any reason would be impossible. <br /> <br /> All the star actors are in their roles, including Pernell Roberts (Adam), Dan Blocker (Hoss), Michael Landon (Little Joe) and, of course, Lorne Green as the principal family patriarch Ben. I also like the ranch Hop Sing, played by Victor Sen Jung. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful action, captured in the Western style, with great values. Cartwrights are always noble heroes, and most bad guys are pretty villainous. If there were more similar programs on television these days!
