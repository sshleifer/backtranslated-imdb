It's funny. This is not Arthur Miller or TS. Elliot, but man is funny. Kline and Fields are great. (Her line "God, you're so disgusting" when she climbs through his window - great! Klein runs in the door after looking at Teri Hatcher - that's great too!) Robert Downey Jr. and Katie Moriarty work flawlessly - until he finds out who she really is ... the turn of the soap opera, if everyone was alone! <br /> <br /> In the scene at the end of the Chinese dining room there were my children, and I was rolling on the floor - this scene alone is worth the price. <br /> <br /> Does not solve world problems and does not demonstrate the apparent weakness of daytime television (hopefully). Just a lot of fun.
