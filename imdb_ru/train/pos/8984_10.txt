I first saw this movie when I watched TV channels on DirecTV's parents. It was on the Sundance channel and was just beginning. I love music, especially in the late 60s, and this is how BJM sounds (Dandy is fine). Everything about the assassination of Brian Johnstown intrigued me - from music to the personalities of Anton and Joel to illegal drug use. It was funny because when I watched the scene of the first party, when everyone sang the lines, my parents passed by and decided to watch (their faces were invaluable). Anyway, this is definitely one of my favorite films, because he introduced me to The Brian Jonestown Massacre, which is now my favorite band of all time. <br /> <br /> just look at it ... seriously
