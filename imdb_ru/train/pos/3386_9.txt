Is this the future that awaits us? An immigrant, non-forgiving wasteland with a hell of an undesirable existence? This film reminds of a problem that still torments us, doubly, since the film was released back in 1973. Let's hope that the world will not be like this ... <br /> <br /> Soylent Green is a wild film that I really liked. He had nice characters, a semi-apocalyptic setting, an exciting and thought-provoking storyline, and the coolest macho: Charlton Heston. Richard Fleisher gave the film a very unpleasant, dirty feeling. You almost suffocated from the stench in the city and its dirty inhabitants. <br /> <br /> The characters are wonderful. Charlton Heston, who became one of my favorite actors, I.S. Thorn. The man created this role as a tough, but nice tough guy. I can definitely put myself in Thorn's place. He sees that something is wrong, but everyone around him either does not listen (rather they pay to not listen), or they want him to die. Edward G. Robinson (in his latest film “RIP”) plays a pretty old Saul who has enough of this nasty place. Everyone else is great, especially Lee Taylor-Young as Shirle, the piece of "furniture" that enters the apartment where she lives. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic, even for 1973. Soylent Green Factory, futuristic apartments and especially "scoops" (bulldozers that spare people) were excellent. Polluted air from the outside looks disgusting and very nasty. Empty city streets filled with vile and rotten people are very disturbing. <br /> <br /> And the last remark - the ending, which even now still shocked me. It's terrible, but if you think about it, this is a very good idea. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: <br /> <br /> A great 70s fiction film that makes you think and leaves you. I feel very awkward.
