Old Mill Pond is a tribute to African-American artists of the 1930s, rather than any slander for the whole race (despite the caricature of Stepin Fetchita). In addition to those I have just mentioned, there are also versions of Cab Calloway, Fat Waller, Josephine Baker, Bill Bojangles Robinson, and Louis Armstrong. This cartoon "Happy Harmony" by Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising is very interesting musically and has excellent characteristics. All of them are so similar to the real ones that half of me thinks that this is possible. If not, they are definitely very flattering imitations. Even the lazy, unmistakable sign of Fetchit gets an exciting workout here when he is pursued by a tiger, when “Hold That Tiger” plays on the bill. Strongly recommended for fans of 30s animation and jazz music.
