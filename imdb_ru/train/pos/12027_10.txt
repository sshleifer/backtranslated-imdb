I saw it, and I like the fact that Melissa plays her part well. It was really believable. My brother-in-law saw it with my sister and I, and when I told my sister that I forgot that it was based on a true story (I saw it a few years ago.), He said only because in life you think it is true as both my sister and I, as if it was anyway, I wondered if anyone knew what it was for the murder, or how who was really involved, because I want to prove it to him. I love life-long films, especially those that are true, or only those that give a good lesson. I thought I saw something about it a week ago, but I can't remember where any help would be appreciated.
