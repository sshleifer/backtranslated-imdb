The film is not for everyone, but this film is in the top 10. I'm a fan of black comedy. With such actors as Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben “Brass Balls” in London), the lines cannot but be dry. The supporting cast is almost a dead center. Counting minor flaws in the film: Ellen Barkin's makeup gives her face a blurry look; Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor gave a few “Give me” cameos that didn’t make sense, and the time for Michael J. Pollard’s show was too short. Overall, the cast was just incredible without the ego to ruin a good script. If you saw the film Larry Bishop (screenwriter, director) "Underworld" (dark crime film), you will like it. His next walk (screenwriter, director, actor) - "A trip to hell" with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
