When I saw the dentist, I thought it was very cool. But this film is not for everyone, especially for people who donâ€™t like bloody scenes, as the Dentist has many bloody scenes. That is why it has an R18 rating. This is a Beverly Hills dentist, Dr. Alan Feynston, who found that his wife Brooke is cheating on him with a machine gun. It is best to go to your dentist "before you look at it." But if you do not already like going to the dentist, then it is better not to look at it, because you can postpone life. The dentist has the best blood feud I've ever seen. Has anyone ever seen a movie in which the dentist (Spoiler) pulls out all the teeth of his cheating wife and cuts out her tongue without anesthesia? Overall a terrific movie, but not for everyone.
