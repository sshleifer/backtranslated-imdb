For some reason I missed this film when it came out, and I discovered it last week thanks to a friendâ€™s recommendation. I can honestly say that I can not remember another intimate dramatic film that copes so well with many things. The letter is clear, realistic, nuanced and even restrained. Cinematography and editing are understated, but inspiring, allowing visual narration to dominate through amazing close-ups and framing images, capturing loneliness and alienation in the most memorable ways. The acting is also wonderful, all the characters become painfully real and vulnerable in the most compelling relationships that the film has to offer. They reveal their weakest sides with unprotected, gross vulnerabilities. A real triumph for Roger Michella, Hanif Kureishi and the whole team. Be sure to look for serious movie lovers.
