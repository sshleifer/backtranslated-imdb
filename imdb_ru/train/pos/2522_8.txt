I have to admit, at first I didnâ€™t expect anything good at all. I expected only a funny film promoting the image of Gackt and Hyde, but I am pleased to report that he has much more to offer. <br /> <br /> Yes, the acting is not so good, but it does not suck or all the actors are well disciplined, and they bring enough strength to their characters. The effects lack consistency, but the action scenes are reasonably satisfactory. <br /> <br /> What really hooked me was the essence of the storyline, although it combines fantastic elements, it also displays a rough reality. The development of the characters, their doubts and their feelings really came to me, and I think this is the key to the film. It makes you think and well conveys all the longing. <br /> <br /> He justifies any expectations of a good drama. I definitely recommend this to everyone.
