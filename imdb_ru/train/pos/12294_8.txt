I believe that I always felt that the Hotel du Nord was tied to the studio, the movement of people, cars and the camera was too smooth and easy for them to shoot on the spot. But there are no problems - this is still a very undervalued wonderful composition from Marcel Karn. The plot at times seems a bit choppy, as if they were inventing it along the way, but because it is unpredictable, it keeps attention to the bitter end. Cash shots, when two lovers are alone in their room, are burdened with some kind of rather unnatural dialogue, but everything is so great to fall into any madness. Are these two young men a symbol of cancer hopelessness in pre-war France, or just idiots? Suicide pacts are fairly common; if suicides were young and healthy with their lives before they were undisturbed, could you think of something other than the fact that they are simply deceived fools? <br /> <br /> Arletti played the role of a prostitute well â€” she kept that zipper on her dress busy anyway! I saw only a few films with Juve - he is the most impressive invention as a pimp in HDN - my problem is minor: every time I see his face, I think of Sonny Hale in Evergreen! <br /> <br /> A surprisingly atmospheric, well-made and photographed film with so many events that you need a few views to get it all in place. Annabella and Amont made up an exceptionally beautiful pair; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his second film played a small funny role in the role of gay. In general, great.
