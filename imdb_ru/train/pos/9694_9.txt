I was fascinated by this touching and funny movie, not to mention wonder. I was also surprised to find that Jay Mohr played Paulieâ€™s voice. The performance was so subtle, not wavering in Schmalz and not getting too harsh because of the swagger in New Jersey, so I thought it must be some unsung old professional, and not Mr. Moore with a childish face. Indeed, a very impressive performance, and it's nice to see that his talents are taken seriously in a series of strange, indie films.
