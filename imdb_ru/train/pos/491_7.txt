Take 4 couples whose relationship was already on the rocks and place them on an island paradise where 26 singles will seduce them. It was the premise of the show, simple but outrageous and ridiculous. Leave it to Fox to throw the moral out of the window and let debauchery flow. It was like a real version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that it was not about people indulging and manipulating with each other for a cash prize. It was about lust and temptation, pure and simple, and the ultimate test for relationships. <br /> <br /> People either loved the show or hated it. It was like a slowdown to look at a terrible road accident. You know that you should not look, but you cannot but look. Aside from the drama, there were a lot of eye candies.
