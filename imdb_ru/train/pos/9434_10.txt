I remember seeing this movie on TV a few years ago and did not pay full attention, perhaps even missed the first half, so I concluded that it was boring and overpriced. I decided to come back to him last night to see if I missed something the first time. I certainly did. This is one of the most exciting and amazing films of all time, and he clearly had a great influence on films today and probably forever. I can not believe I thought this movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Young John Voight and Burt Reynolds demonstrate their careers and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronnie Cox. This story will leave you with a feeling of disgust and fear long after you see it, it is really terrible. Oh, and I already said that this song is also great? Well, this is true, and this film should be seen by a film fan everywhere. <br /> <br /> Everyone should watch this movie for review. Just do not expect a picnic.
