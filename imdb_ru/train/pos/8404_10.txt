A simple, but good-natured film about a driver about a simple, but good-natured high school graduate who wants to have the coolest van in the world to use as his "ballroom". <br /> <br /> Bobby, our hero, spends all his savings on the purchase of his dream car. Collaboration and making love quickly begin with the girls Bobby picked up at a local pizzeria, but he learns that responsibility, danger, and heartache are related to the fact that he has such a mechanical miracle. <br /> <br /> The Van is my guilty pleasure. It reflects the calm mood of the mid-70s and has enough unintended humor to turn it into the category “so bad it is good.”
