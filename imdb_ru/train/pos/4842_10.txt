If the very thought of Arthur Asuka distorts your courage, don't worry, you can still watch and fall in love with the Ghost Train, just like the amazing “Boy from the Back Room,” this film is just damn good to be drowned by one person. performance, even the lead actor. Personally, I love Asuka, perhaps this is because I enter his world, and not unreasonably expect him to enter mine, which is a mistake that many people make. The ghost train is so intense in the atmosphere that you cannot see it without surprise in the deep, dark world that you are transferred to, it plunges into itself like a few cheap and cheerful flag vibrations were able to visit in a desperate early age. The 40s, and this is a film that I think very few people have ever watched once. The composition, without exception, is extremely good, perhaps, Linden Travers puts it on a bit thick, but against the background of a lonely train station in wartime, she could hardly play crazy and not stand out. The sad death of the beautiful Carol Lynn earlier this year broke the last connection we had with this incredible film, and now it’s really in the past, but patiently waiting for us to click on the game.
