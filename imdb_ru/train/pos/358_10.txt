Purple is a struggle of life and love that helps people who have suffered greatly from life. Each character had an element of purple. The film tells about love, lostness, hope, hatred and triumph. whether it was Sealy, who survived hell and lost her sister, and Shug, who came into her life to show her love again, Albert was not the person correcting his evil towards Seli, Shug avoided his father and finally confessed to him, Sophia and her stubbornness, good and bad, and even Nettie, they had their own voids and difficulties in the film, but in the end they were overcome, and this is a sign of a good film. Good job to all the cast and crew.
