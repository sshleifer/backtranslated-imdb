If you have ever been sad due to the fact that you could not make a film on DVD, you were probably looking for Mad. How often do you laugh when you watch comedies? I was too young to see Richard Pryor during his greatest time, and when I was old enough to see Mad and Raw Eddie Murphy (not so funny), I never knew where Eddie got most of his inspiration. Now that I’m older, and I’ve seen both Pryor and many comedians after Murphy, I understand two things: everyone steals from Eddie, and Eddie loves FROM Richard. This is a huge difference: Eddie was original, funny, provocative, thoughtful. and more. He was something they had never seen before. He was all we ever needed. Are these days Eddie Murphy is boring and old ?? but once he was the King, and the "Crazy" was the greatest castle ever built. Truly one of the funniest routines of all time.
