In this film, Muppet Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzy, Gonzo, Rawl, Scooter, Camilia, Dr. Titus, Floyd, The Beast, Janice and Zoute are college graduates who decide to bring their successful College Manhattan Melodies to Broadway. Unfortunately, no producer will ever meet the dolls. Having been rejected by too many manufacturers, Scooter proposes that the dolls decide to move on their own. However, Kermit still believes that he can get his Broadway show, but after he finally does it and lets everyone know that he sold the show, Kermit gets amnesia, while others do not know where he is. <br /> <br /> Here you will find many great scenes, including a live action episode featuring “Muppets Babies”, a wedding episode filled with dolls, including the cast of “Sesame Streets” and “Traveling Matt ”(from Fraggle Rock),“ Scooter ”as a filmmaker and the scene where Rizzo and other rats cook breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that no more characters were included. Of course, many of them appear at the wedding, but for Bunsen, Glass, Beauregard and Sweetums there should have been several significant roles, and Lips should have become part of The Electric Mayhem in this film, like last season of The Muppet Show. and The Great Muppet Caper, and Miss Piggies Fu Fu's dog, too, should have been with her (after all, Rizzo The Rat, also performed by Steve Whitmere, played a big role in this film, and he was not very famous at that time).
