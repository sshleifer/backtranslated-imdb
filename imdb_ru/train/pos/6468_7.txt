This is a pretty good film ... yes, some parts are unconvincing and exceptionally comfortable, and the film does not really justify a large star cast (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the actor who really impressed me here was Kay Kay Menon (not to be confused with singer KK). In the scene where he first meets Amitabha, I thought that the person who can just look at AB, keep looking and not say a word, and still look strong, is definitely a good actor. In fact, he proved himself again in Sarkar along with AB a second time. This guy should get more roles, he's great. <br /> <br /> If you read any other reviews on IMDb, you already know the story, and I agree that Akshay Hannah’s entry into Pakistan was too easy And that little love corner he shared with “ that-her-face ”was completely unnecessary. But he's a pretty good actor (as seen from DCH), it’s always a pleasure to watch Sanjay Datt. and AB ... what can I say. I don't know if I am his biggest fan in the world, but I know that I can definitely fight for a place. <br /> <br /> Interesting hours, considering that this is Bollywood, although a bit inspired by Hollywood old men as the “Great Escape” and “Bridge over the River Kwai”.
