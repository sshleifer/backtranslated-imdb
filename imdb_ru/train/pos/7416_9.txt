This film moves without being sentimental - meaningful, without being pretentious. He tells a simple story that the family may fall apart, as technological encroachment and a progressive society make the family business more and more untenable. <br /> <br /> It is wonderful to act - although none of us in the West probably heard of these actors, we would have long ago - they play their characters with honesty and respect - these are incorrect characters, each of whom has serious shortcomings, but with such full humanity and kindness that it is impossible not to engage in history. <br /> <br /> We need more such films - we need more western directors who create such films.
