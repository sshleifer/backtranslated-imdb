This film was quite unexpected. Honestly, I did not expect much. Greta Garbo's first Hollywood movie? So what? Perhaps something rude and with the usual exaggerated sweeps of hands and face, which so often show low-grade silent films. <br /> <br /> Well, I was wrong. Greta Garbo must have just shocked the studio people as much as me, because this film made her a star, and deservedly so. She instinctively understood the power to just stand still or just keep meaningful expression for a long, lasting moment, so that its influence could be felt, and not just seen. I kept thinking to myself, how did this modern actress get into a raspy silent film? She was many years ahead of her time. <br /> <br /> The story is not so interesting, it is a common love story that was found and lost. Only Garbo’s performance as Leonora, a poor country girl who does good in a big city, then returns to get the man who escaped, which gives him life. The co-star Ricardo Cortes is sound, but his character never develops, and the script humiliates him. At some point, he is forced to wear Garbo's clothes, to leave irritably, then shamefully to come back and return them. And let's not even talk about his terrible final scenes with Garbo, and then with his wife. Too ordinary, after that he had no particular career, and I understand why. But he is sufficient as a mysterious object of obsession with Leonora. <br /> <br /> In this film there is one absolutely fantastic line that just says everything. "Leonora, you become noticeable." Yes, really striking. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know what you are talking about without watching the whole movie, just look at the last 30 seconds or so - Garbo’s look when she sits completely alone in her luxury car says everything. “She must be so happy, she has everything she wants” - yes, Garbo’s face says everything about it. I have to see it again, Garbo is just awesome.
