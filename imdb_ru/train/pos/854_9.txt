“Margarita and the Rooster ...” <br /> <br /> This incredibly exciting movie captures you from the debut scene and never ceases to deliver laughter, surprises and unexpectedly touching moments. I watched "Matador" more fun than almost any other 2005 film. This is a stupid film with an unforgettable character, which was perfectly played by Pierce Brosnan. <br /> <br /> Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a moderator (bounty hunter) who specializes in high-end corporate concerts (kills rich guys). He is also experiencing something similar to a midlife crisis. Having come to realize that he has no real friends, no permanent home and no planned future, he once came across a Mexican bar in a hotel and ran into Danny Wright (Kinnear). <br /> <br /> a lucky family man who is on the verge of losing a large commercial transaction that may change his position. He loves his wife very much, especially because they had lost their little son several years earlier. <br /> <br /> Two men - chalk and cheese, you can hardly find a common language, except that they are in the same bar in the desert. night. And for some reason, a conversation begins, which triggers a chain of events that will forever change their lives. <br /> <br /> The friendship they put together reminded me a lot of Laurel and Hardy. One is a straightforward person, and the other is an insistent fool who gives them trouble. The interaction is superbly calculated and finely tuned, thanks in large part to the remarkable performances of Brosnan and Kinnear. <br /> <br /> But make no mistake ... This is Brosnan’s movie. He captured one of the most memorable and contemptuous characters of the decade. He can shoot your mother and immediately apologize, and you will probably forgive him. Brosnan may be the best movie caster, but this is his sweetest and most complete presentation to date. I wouldn't mind seeing an Oscar nod to that role. <br /> <br /> Consider one scene where he frankly excites a high school student with unclean thoughts and utters the phrase: “Everything is blush, blushing. .. No sucks. "He does this with Bond's familiar smirk and manages to get away with it. He manages to say to the little boy:" Tell your mother to lose 30 pounds and 20 years. Then come back to me "without looking like unpleasant. in fact, it makes us the same as he. <br /> <br /> Still, the film surprises us with really touching scenes, most of which come to an end when the film takes unpredictable turns. However, when Julian looks your little black book to find someone to call him for the day birthday, or when Danny and his wife (Davis) console each other in their bedroom one night, the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion. <br /> <br /> “Matador” is stylish and energetic. It's always interesting. And it contains a defining career Brosnan's role as a lonely assassin who seeks normality, friendship, and the means to do at least one good thing in his life.This is the gem of 2005, and you should make an effort to see this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> TC Candler of IndependentCritics.com
