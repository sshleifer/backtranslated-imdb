James Cagney is known for his tough characters and gangster roles, but in his career he also played fairly “soft” characters. This musical is one of them, and it was the first, but not the last musical film that Cagney starred in. <br /> <br /> Cagney even sings a little in this and also dances a lot. And I must say that he was not bad at it. He plays the role with great confidence. Obviously, he was engaged in dancing in his youth, before his acting career began to gain momentum, so in fact it is not strange that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career. He obviously also feels at ease in this completely different genre than most people are used to seeing him in. <br /> <br /> The director of the film is Lloyd Bacon, who was perhaps one of the best and most successful directors in this genre. , His early musicals of the 30s largely defined the musical genre, and he was also responsible for genre films such as 42nd Street. His musicals have always been light and fun to watch and more comedic than anything else. The musicals of the 30s were never really about singing, it was what was most mentioned in the musicals of the 40s and later, mostly from MGM studios. <br /> <br /> As usual, he has an easy and simple history of the musical world, which, of course, is also predictable and progresses in a formal form. However, this is a fun and simple story that also makes this movie interesting to watch. The same is done by the characters and actors who depict them. In some ways it is strange that the general plotline of the film becomes a kind of abandoned near the end of the film, when the film is just beginning to consist of musical sub-programs with numbers. <br /> <br /> Musical moments to the end of the film is also fun and well done, although I'm not too big a fan of the genre itself. Once again the musical numbers also show young Billy Barty. He often played little boys / babies / mice and anything else at the beginning of his career, including the musical “Golden Diggers of 1933,” a year earlier. <br /> <br /> Recommended early genre film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
