The most enjoyable element of “Dan in real life” is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) is meaningful and perfectly realistic. The choice of the winning Oscar, Juliette Binoche as Dan’s love interest, was an excellent decision; She is extremely talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank God, the right age for this role! If this film were shot with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, that would be a disaster. <br /> <br /> Another great aspect of Dan in real life is the perfect movie for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that excludes the three pillars of the fraternity formula: dull chicks, chauvinistic guys and dirty jokes. “Dan in real life” is witty and cheerful, laughing intelligently. Considering that other comedies include, or are based almost entirely on, jokes that shock the audience with laughter, the jokes from Dan in Real Life are more natural and intelligent, and require some thinking from the audience. <br /> <br /> My only problem with “Dan in real life” is that actress Brittany Robertson too excites a rebellious middle daughter. It is difficult to say whether it was a personal choice on her part or the choice of a director. In any case, her character is unrealistic and annoying. But this is only a minor flaw in the film, and it does not affect the story as a whole. <br /> <br /> In general, “Dan in real life” is an excellent film, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and stupid comedies. The quality of writing, directing, acting and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It's just a beautiful, carefree comedy.
