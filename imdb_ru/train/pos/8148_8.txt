I have no interest in rap, and in the ghetto culture I am white and I love classic rock, but this did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy. This is largely a continuation of This Is Spinal Tap in the sense that this is the same movie, just about rap or rock. Yet it is fun. There are a lot of funny jokes, but not without a few jokes that just fail. All characters are very funny and believable. I only watched because it made me laugh at 3 am, and any film that can do this requires at least a test run. One of the reasons why these films were so funny was because they laughed at rap from the other side. Rap today is associated with the wrong things and costs studio noise and a little talent. This film comes from a time when rappers deserved more respect. In general, this is a funny film, in which many jokes about racism, sex and musical culture are among the most obvious themes of humor. Highly recommended for any fan of This Spinal Tap. In fact, this is one and the same film, approximately in different worlds, and yes, the same jokes work in both films.
