Reed Hadley makes the best trashy Don Diego than his dashing and impudent Zorro, but it almost does not matter, because in this series there is the best song from all the series, which has no barriers, and the best version of the famous stage coach Yakima Kanutta stunt. There are other good tricks, a lot of action, and a lot of exciting finals of hangers chapters, but if for some other reason you have to watch this film to watch the stage trick, and then revise it in slow motion. This is unbelievable, and, despite the smaller budget for this play, the Yak looks better at the trick than in the much more famous film "Stagecoach". Indiana Jones, eat your heart: this is a real deal!
