I have not seen this 1958 film for a very long time, and he loved the fact that Kim Novak plays the role of Gil Holroyd, who is a real witch and has an aunt named Queenie Holroyd, who is also a witch, and Gillian also has a brother a sorcerer named Nick, played by Nick Jack Lemmon When Gillian looks at Shep Henderson (James Stewart), who is engaged to a girl, he is going to marry; Gillian performs some magic spells with the cat and changes his mind about her prospective bride, and then becomes very thirsty and falls in love with Gillian. The story tells that a real witch cannot fall in love, blush or cry, and this is starting to prove a big problem between Shep and Gillian, so Nick and Aunt Queenie decided they had to do something in this situation. Great movie to watch again and again and a great classic movie from 1958.
