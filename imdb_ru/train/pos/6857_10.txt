"Dressed To Kill" is one of the best thrillers ever created. His relationship with sex and violence makes this film for adults. Brian De Palma once again proves why no other director can compare with the way he uses the camera to tell a story. He directs many scenes without dialogue, and he tells most of his story, strictly using his visual effects and the brilliant score of Pino Donnadjo. A film shot in Panavision MUST be viewed in widescreen mode, as De Palma uses the full width of the film to tell his story. Cropped on the video "Dressed To Kill" is not the same movie. Unsurpassed performance in the cast, excellent direction, and perhaps the best film ever written, make Dressed To Kill a must-see.
