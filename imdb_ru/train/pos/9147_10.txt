As a big fan of the prince of the last three or four years, I really can't believe that I just got to see "Purple Rain". A new two-disc anniversary edition Special Edition made me buy it. Wow, I was really looking forward to it, but I wasn’t ready for how electrical it really is. Prince’s musical performances throughout the film are simply amazing - there are REALLY movements in it. I am very familiar (from repeated auditions) with the classic album "Purple Rain" and all his songs, but watching them in the context of the film completely changes your perception of melodies and lyrics - such as COMPUTER BLUE, THE BEAUTIFUL ONES, WHEN LOVE THE CRY AND PURPLE Rain Itself . There is something indescribably hypnotizing in the scenes where Prince and The Revolution perform. The final songs “BABY I'm A STAR” and “I would die for you” show how much energy and pure talent the prince filled in his 20 years (he is full!), It struck me. It even makes Michael Jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years. <br /> <br /> The prince shows you how to defeat the girl of your dreams - take her to the lake, make her jump, and then leave - absolutely fun in hindsight. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious, but this adds to the overall charm of the film. Morris Day is the coolest cat on the block (and fun), and when his band The Time performs THE BIRD, you will see how Morris Day and Jerome Benton illuminate the scene in the Minneapolis funk style - I like their dance in this episode, and how Benton provides Morris with a mirror performance. <br /> <br /> I can’t wait to see it again, I really can't! The additions are awesome - especially seeing how the young cop Eddie Murphy before Beverly Hills admits that he is a “prince-admirer”.
