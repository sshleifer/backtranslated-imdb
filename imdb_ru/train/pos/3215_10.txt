It was great. Touching, rich and perfect for Kurt Russell. I liked this movie, it deserves over 5.3 or so stars. This film is a story about an obsolete soldier who learns that there is more to life than a soldier, and people who learn that there is time to fight, the need to defend themselves. I cried, laughed and basically sat in delight at this story. Good written work for the action movie, and the plot was relevant and quite solid. The ending was not dodgy, but still great. If you like to flee from New York or cheer for the weak, this film is for you. Not an excessive amount of blood or violence, it was not difficult to observe in this regard. Something for everyone.
