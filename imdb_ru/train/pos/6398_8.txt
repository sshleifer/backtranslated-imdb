“Inspiring” stories about the “triumph of the human spirit” are usually disgusting to me. The most amazing thing in MEN OF HONOR is how I enjoyed it, despite myself. The film is as predictable and cliché as possible, but it works. Great merit in exciting performances of both performers. This is the perfect role for Cuba Gooding Jr., who is wonderfully restrained here. We expected a lot from De Niro, and he does not disappoint. He creates a dark funny portrait. Directed by George Tillman Jr. decided to make a film in the old style and comes up with a winner.
