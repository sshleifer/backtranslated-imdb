Channel 4 is a channel that allows more pranks than any other channel, this show was certainly playful. The presenter of this sometimes rude adult chat, the four-time BAFTA winner and the British comedy prize (also twice nominated) Graham Norton was just the perfect presenter for such a good show like this one. Among them was one or more celebrities. They basically had an adult idea that could either shit, humiliate or humiliate the guest, but some are not for the faint of heart. They had women playing their tape recorders in their games, men using their members to play the xylophone, women sobbing up in the bath, men with trousers under or without kilts, and many other rude but cheerful ideas. This is for adults only, but enjoy! She won BAFTA twice for the best entertainment program (program or series), won the British Comedy Awards for the best comedy entertainment program (also nominated), Best Comedy Talk Show, won an Emmy for episode No. 18 (?) And won the National Television Award twice for "The most popular talk show." It was number 52 for 100 of the greatest funniest moments. Fine!
