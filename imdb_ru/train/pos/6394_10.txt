Karl Brashear (Cuba Gooding Jr.) was born to share in the deep south. He joins the fleet, after which he tells his father that he will return. His father gives him an old radio, and Brashear leaves on a naval bus. The most valuable thing an unemotional father taught him was "Never give up." Following a recommendation from White Commander Powers Booth, who admires his drive and courage, he is sent to the Navy diving school in Bayonne, New Jersey. He is being harassed by his uniformed buddies and from his trainer, Chief Naval Master Diver, Billy Sander (Robert De Niro), and from a commander named Pappi (Hal Holbrooke, who has â€œalmost as many bolts as the old car ". They all want him to abandon him, and the prejudice is quite cruel. The dangers of diving prove further failure when he loses his leg due to an accident on board the ship. Despite this, he tells his wife that he will train and achieve your goals, and with the help of Billy Sand (now both sympathize with their suffering), they train, and he is able to become the first black diver of the navy with his prosthesis, despite the skepticism of the very mocking and dubious captain at the hearing of the naval department in Washington, DC to determine if it meets the criteria. An inspirational film showing that determination can overcome all odds.
