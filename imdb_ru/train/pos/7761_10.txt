*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Released in 1956 and considered rather strange at the time, Douglas Sirk on the top of a sweet colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing. The plot relates to events in the oil-rich dysfunctional Texas family, which includes the elder brother Kyle, unsafe, weak, wounded and very alcoholic, which Robert Stack plays in a very touching and vulnerable performance, and his slut sister Marily plays in an extreme condition. the manner of Dorothy Malone. Miss Malone’s speech is transmitted to us through her eyes, which she uses to show us her emotions, which mainly consist of lust (for Rock Hudson) and jealousy (for Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I've ever seen in a movie who first gets into a room. Now don't get me wrong, her performance, if not more, is an absolute cry and is one of the highest jobs in the camp of the 1950s. But it's also terrible, because, no matter how attractive and attractive Malone is, she is not a very good actress, and she is not capable of subtlety or shading. Her performance has one note. She really does the angry Mambo, and in a big installation, when the disliked dad, always played by good Robert Kate, falls to the stairs until his death, Sirk mixes this up with the almost insane Malone performing an orgasmic dance when she undresses. Stack (who should have won the Oscar) and Malone (who won the award, but should not) are real movie stars, those who set all hysteria, both sexual and other, into motion, while “real stars ”Of the film, Hudson and Bacall, turn into gray and brown, which are the colors in which they are mostly costumed. Hudson, who was the best actor, then won the title of childhood and Stack's best friend, and became persecuted. I love the interest of Malone, who moans and groans over Rock for most of the film. But Hudson does not want to participate in it, but instead falls in love with Bacall, who is married to Stack. No one is very happy, and no one is happy for very long. The marriage of Stack and Bacall falls apart after a big year later, and Stack almost completely forgets about himself, because he thinks he is barren and cannot give Bacol a child to prove that he is a man. Sirk, who was a very intelligent man and had a long and fascinating career in both the cinema and the theater in Germany, ended his Hollywood career at Universal in the mid-1950s with a series of bright, vivid "female films" or melodramas. Although they were mostly adapted from a medoker or a crappy source material, in Sirk’s hands they became masterpieces of the genre. Sirk had a wonderful sense of color and design, which he brought to these films, filling his wide screen spaces with characters who played their emotional life among strange color combinations and lighting, inventing shadows and a lot of mirror reflections. In The Written, the characters always look out of the windows, listen at the door, or sneak around. So finally, after a lot of violence, accidental killing, miscarriage, and more, Sirk finishes the film with the final and amazing scene of “reincarnation” and Malone’s reformation in a suit sewn under the person sitting at the table looking for a miniature oil well
