In his first role as a Hollywood director, Henry Brommell beats up exciting yarn that permeates all important family issues with melancholic authenticity, and connects them with the same exciting plot in the father-son movie. The film is insightful and consists of a wonderfully composed cast, as well as a quick, family-friendly script (also Brommell), which returns life to another weary genre. As a bonus, "Panic" provides a thin, biting humor ?? unexpected, undoubtedly, charming and very pleasant surprise ?? through his clumsy, insecure-in-itself, restrained star, which is ever tempting to cool, especially given its direction of work. <br /> <br /> Forever great William H. Macy again captures our hearts as Alex, a miserable, torn husband and father of middle-aged, who finds solace in the most dubious people: a young, attractive, equally spoiled 23-year-old boy named Sarah (Neveu Campbell), whom he meets at the reception at the psychologist's office, where he is awaiting Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter) therapy to discuss his growing desire to quit the family business that his father (Donald Sutherland) built. Alex, whose thirst to lead a new life is difficult because of the fear of disappointing his dictating father, amazes Sarah with the foolish imagination, which ultimately makes him understand the essence and irrefutable responsibility of being a husband to his wife and, more important, he, the good father of his six son Sammy (with the enthusiasm of playing charming David Dorfman). <br /> <br /> Henry Brommellâ€™s brilliant Panic is a rarity in Hollywood, rarely seen (with the exception of The Road to Perdition 2002) since its conception in 2000, it combines two conflicting genres (organized crime, family drama) in a fascinating, warm piece of watching movies that is equally strong in any direction - and this is the one that will retain its exceptional, infrequent caliber and shining sincerity for many years.
