If you want to watch a movie of another kind, if you feel Love in your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this film makes you wonder. Although Georges is mentally deficient, at the end you can see a higher mind when love directs you, not the brain. I'm not emotional, but this film makes you feel human. The film is as good as Forrest Gump, in my opinion. Foreign films are sometimes more interesting, but advertising is not enough to make them popular. Rang-e khoda (The Color of God) Majid Majidi is another example of such foreign films, with almost similar taste.
