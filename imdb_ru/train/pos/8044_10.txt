First of all, it's just the funniest movie I've ever seen. It includes a perfectly selected farce, sexual humor and ingenious performance. But it goes deeper than that. “The Opponent of Sowler” is an original love story (which we do not often see), which gave me hope that there is love, that two people who love each other can cope with their misfortune; and that such a comedic view of life (which, I believe, we all should have) can be accepted by people who really matter. Chris Meloni gives such a convincing performance as Barry Singer that he should have won an Oscar. The film is brilliantly written, and I hope that in the future we will see more films from all the participants.
