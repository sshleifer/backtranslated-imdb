Life Begins is a wonderful film with a preliminary code, in which the best of the era were shot. It is installed in the maternity ward of a hospital, especially in a room where there may be problems with women. There is an elderly woman, a tough unmarried mother (Glenda Farrell), a fragile young woman, an Italian and the main character (Loretta Young) who spends 20 years in prison for murder. Her husband (Eric Linden) hurts every second, knowing that everything will be fine. Aline McMahone plays an excellent nurse at her work. <br /> <br /> This film is very interesting and interesting. This is not very shocking, but on a silver screen it is interesting to see such a forgotten object. The game is gorgeous in everything. Loretta Young is gorgeous here in her prime. Eric Linden comes from nowhere and is sincere, as can be. His innocence is reminiscent of Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell, as always, is gorgeous, the main product of the preliminary codes and for good reason.
