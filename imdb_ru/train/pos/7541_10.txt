This Showtime movie really deserves a much better viewer rating than 4.5; I gave him 10, based on the story and action of two stars. After reading the comments of the audience, I was surprised at how many people expect this film to become a comedy. Yes, I see IMDb listing it as a comedy / drama in the genre. This is definitely misleading, isn't it? Fortunately, I watched the movie before entering this site, so I did not have this expectation. In fact, based on a brief summary of what I heard, I fully expected it to be just drama. I wonder if the fact that this film was not funny disappointed caused so many low voices. <br /> <br /> Another factor that could cause low voices is that this film is very “character-driven”. Driving Miss Daisy is an example of another movie driven by characters. Someone's previous comment complained about a boring ordeal. The working scenes of Tom (Danny Glover) seemed to distract from the real plot of the film. That is, how he designed the social rise of his family or his personal troops, if you will. Nevertheless, they served to confirm the veracity and justify his right to move to Greenwich and move “upwards” in the world. <br /> <br /> Tom’s obsession became coercion. He proved that he would stop at nothing to blend in with the white neighborhood. His chagrin when another black man moved in the neighborhood was not due to the color of his skin. It was because of everything that the "intruder" represented; all that Tom left. In fact, Tom became Oreo biscuits: black on the outside, and white on the inside. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of this film are some of the most powerful, written, controlled and played (Whoopi Goldberg) I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I realized that the climax of the film was not an obvious event that happened next door (I do not want to give it away). The culmination of the verbal, and Whoopi it gives. It is still not clear to me whether it is a question of when she informs Tom what college Tom is going to go to, or when she graduates, everything is in the middle of the night, and Tom wakes up. Nevertheless, the outcome is excellent. You know that life on this street will never be the same. <br /> <br /> My favorite kind of character-driven movie: people have problems, experience some pain, dance, grow, change, and live continues. As a member of the audience, I can learn or be inspired.
