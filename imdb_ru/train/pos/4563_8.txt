It is hard to imagine that this film is based on a true story, and how Christie managed to perform this miracle is so touching. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, it’s very hard to imagine how much effort he put into creating this disabled character. Watching him on the screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. <br /> <br /> The film is not as pessimistic as I thought before, the story is quite vivid and intriguing. Christie does not despise normal people, his life is also colorful and delightful, although we can be aware of the loneliness and painful bonds of his eyes. <br /> <br /> One of the important success factors for Christie is his mother’s support. which seems more touching, and the unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves an Oscar award for this role, this fat little middle-aged woman uses her all to fulfill Christie's dream. So lucky Christie! And Hugh O'Conor is also great, like young Christie, what a play for a child! Christy's love story is very well done, trusting. Christie wants love, and nothing can deprive him of his right to love, his love for the beautiful doctor Eileen Cole (surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw, I am deeply impressed by her role in the Harry Potter series, the disgusting Aunt Petunia, so her appearance in this role is not in my head, but in any case, every woman has her own youth ...) is paranoid and insulting, I have sympathy for him, love is a double-edged sword, happiness and agony just next to each Other. <br /> <br /> By the way, all the works of Jim Sheridan are good (In America, BOXER, etc.), except that UNDERSTAND MORE OR DIE. In fact, a dirty career for him, what a pity!
