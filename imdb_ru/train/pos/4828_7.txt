Rupert Friend plays the role of Prince Albert, who raises Young Victoria to an unexpected level. He's great. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into a dark deep depression after the death of Prince Albert and, looking into the eyes of Ruper Friend, I understood. The film does not lead us to his death, but to an incident that could well cost him his life. The act of love. I believed it or, I must say, to him. I believed in what he felt was real. Nothing or anyone can compare with the delicacy and depth characteristics of a Friend. Emily Blunt is good, but I did not believe for a minute that she was Victoria. There is no real meaning of the period. Perhaps it was not her fault, but her prince deserved the crown.
