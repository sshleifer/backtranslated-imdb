A very unique sci-fi animation film, and, frankly, I love uniqueness, whatever it is, better or worse. This French film is quite interesting to watch, its innovative technique, for example, “The Awakening of Life”, which I recently watched. <br /> <br /> It took me quite a long time to get used to the black and white style, but in the end I like it, the sketch images are really fantastic! The future contractual world is a symbol of the ultimate destination of the human race, and I adore it very much. <br /> <br /> The whole plot is good for Sci-Fi, not so intriguing, but everything is fine, like some Hollywood products, a giant plot about human eternity, a bit of cliches and perverse ending is not so convincing, some designs are too simple and tasteless, and the whole movie is too long. <br /> <br /> So I think that I’m just in love with the style that shows this film, others are not so good. <br /> <br /> About eternity of life, I think most people have come to the unanimous opinion that we don’t want eternity because it destroys the meaning of life, we value our lives because they are limited and meaningful if everyone can live forever, so the world will be a disaster and chaos. Leaving someone you love is hard and heartbreaking, but it is also a way to show that our life is authentic, and all emotions satisfy a person’s life and make the world vibrant and alive.
