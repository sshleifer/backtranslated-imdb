If Dick Tracy were in black and white, dad would not be religious. Giving a new meaning to the concept of color in the film, we are offered a unique experience throughout the world of comic books, and this is one of the few films that have succeeded thanks to a serious script, good direction, and magnificent action. (Al Pacino is amazing) and, most importantly, a powerful combination of cinematography, artistic direction and costume design. Using only primary colors, the experience is completely different from everything we have seen before. And there is also a fairly successful recognition of all genres of gangster films, virtually extinct from modern cinema. Overall, I view this film as a new attempt and a touch of originality to cinema, which increasingly relies on old and already seen formulas. 7 out of 10.
