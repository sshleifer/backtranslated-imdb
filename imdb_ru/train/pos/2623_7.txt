I really like the original, and this film has its ups and downs. Here are some of them: <br /> <br /> Versions: the majority of the original votes have returned. <br /> <br /> Downs: I didn’t like Timon’s voice. I know she made a voice in The Simpsons, but this show is just silly. <br /> <br /> Oops: we see Simba as a “teenager.” <br /> <br /> Downs: they spent it on a match with Timon and Simba. <br /> <br /> Oops: Rafiki told Timon about Hakuna Matat. <br /> <br /> Downs: How did Pumba find out about this? <br /> <br /> Oops: The songs again. (Some of the original songs were there, but they were just background music.) Downs: But silly songs. (a.k.a. Timon’s solo.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a pretty good movie. I would recommend this for lovers of the original. But if you do not like the original, most likely you will not like this. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10
