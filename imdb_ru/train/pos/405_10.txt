I have been a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years since high school. This film is the best fantasy film in recent years. I don't think that “action” is the right genre, although there are a lot of action and KongFu scenes. Wait, did I mention that this is an EAST fantasy motive? Please keep in mind that DO NOT use a Hollywood formula to evaluate this movie. And for a guy who “poops” around, I don’t blame you, because you are still young and need to know more about “culture”.
