I looked through the movie listings in my area on Yahoo and saw a movie that was not advertised. I looked closer and noticed that Peter Falk and Paul Reiser were in it. Having seen "Crazy over You", once I was not a fan of Paul Reiser. Nevertheless, I am a big fan of Peter Falk. So, my wife and I took the risk. We were both involved in this story. Beautiful landscapes, spiritual play and a sense of family and moral values, which are rarely seen in the cinema and in the modern world. Not this juicy emotional trash, but real life situations from real, similar to people. I even have to say that Paul Reiser was excellent, although I still would not watch "Lost in mind from you." I do not know where this film went. I heard that it was released in a limited edition. Need to share with the world. This is one of the best films I've seen. M.
