Neither the catastrophe claimed by British critics nor the misinterpreted masterpiece insisted on by a few fans, Revolver is at least a great attempt by Guy Ritchie to add some substance to his capers. But on the other hand, there is nothing more despicable than an ambitious film that bites more than it can chew, especially a film that uses a movie about a gangster / cheater. As expected on behalf of Luc Besson on the credits of the producer, there is a certain element of “Cinema de look”: he is in some realistic fantasy world where America and Great Britain intersect, looks great, has a couple of superbly edited and thought out the sequence of actions and style oozing, all of which mark it as a one-time entertainment. But Richie obviously wants to do more than just rephrase his own films for a quick dollar, and he spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. In any case, his problem is that he is trying to add too many influences (a little Machiavelli, Godard’s feature, many chess principles), motives and techniques, littering the screen with quotations: the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams on photos of the corpses of the victims of the mafia and sometimes it seems that he never read predictive cookies that he didn’t want to turn into a movie. Instead of promoting Kabbalism, it is really a mixture of the related principles of commerce, chess and trust fraud, which in most cases cope with the difficult trick of making theosophy accessible, while hiding the central (somewhat metaphysical) meaning of the film. br /> <br /> In the last third you can find most of the problems, because Jason Statham (literally) beats the enemy with many ambitious, but not always successful, cross-cutting actions in the frame to counter the external bravado of people with their inner fear and anger, but he does a lot for this. You shouldn’t start anew religion, but I’m surprised that it didn’t get an American distributor. Maybe they deliberately found Ray Ray Liotta’s fake tan too damn scary?
