“They all laughed” - one of those small films that I always recommend to friends who are looking for something unusual. It is firmly rooted in the romantic traditions of the past, but seems more modern. Even the atmosphere of the early 80s definitely doesn’t meet too much. Bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet that reality will never bring it down to the ground. But, nevertheless, this cute little film is completely dependent on the actors to continue it, and TAL is endowed with dream actors who understand the requirements of this story. This is a film that would not linger in memory for so long if it were not for the small moments provided by the excellent cast: Colleen Camp simultaneously shouted orders to John Ritter and her dog; Blaine Novak releases all this hair from under his hat; and especially at that moment when Dorothy Stratten falls in love with John Ritter and says: "How ... strange." It’s such a piece of fluff that you don’t want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it, but it certainly leaves a person with a light heart and a smile on his face.
