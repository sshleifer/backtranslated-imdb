The characters were lively and interesting, the plot was excellently developed, the pyro effects were skillfully executed, and it included the main story of a love triangle and an element of science fiction thrown into it. I could identify myself with many characters, and their motives had a logical rational sense within the framework of the story. <br /> <br /> The filming was superb, the sound was clear and precise, the background music was perfectly matched for effect, the singing of the firemen was a wonderful talented, memorable oddity, superbly designed scenery and special effects made with skilled talent. <br /> <br /> I'm a little puzzled, as the whole mini-carnival in the parking lot at the store party can be powered by a single lamppost outlet. It seems impossible to say the least. The fight between the brothers at the end of the film was brilliant though. Jim Varneyâ€™s involvement in the non-clown role was also a great touch, as the half-serious role of the karni played very well.
