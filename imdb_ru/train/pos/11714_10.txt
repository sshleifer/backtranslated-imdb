Then you have to see this film in order to understand the reality. Having read the book, Ms. Duke is now the advocate for those suffering from bipolar disorder; previously called manic-depressive disorder. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to believe that nowadays people still criticize others with emotional problems or those who seek psychiatric help. Regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists, and this is regrettable. <br /> <br /> In this film, viewers see the pain and suffering that Ms. Duke experienced, especially in childhood. Many of us may remember her from the teen Patty Duke Show. By age 15, she became a household word in America. <br /> <br /> You learn about its operation from Ross (well played by Howard Hesseman). When she grew up in the 1950s, the stigma was in full force. However, we see her progress in her career, but the disease is getting worse. She is experiencing bouts of substance abuse and debauchery; even marries someone she gets divorced next week; and she has several conflicts and tantrums with her children and elderly mother. All these problems arose before she received adequate therapy and medications. <br /> <br /> A recent survey published by the NAMI (National Mental Health Alliance) showed that most adults in the US do not recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder. It was also published that every fifth respondent believes that people can control their illness without medication if they want it. (bp magazine, winter 2006). If you watch this film, you will learn a true story about a talented woman who could not “pull herself up on her boots” and “recover” until she learned about her disorder and received proper treatment. Thank you, Miss Duke, for opposing ignorance and prejudice.
