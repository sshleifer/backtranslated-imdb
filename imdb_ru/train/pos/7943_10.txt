I love this show very much. It contains an animation that is interesting and beautiful. I cannot believe that they disconnected it from television, and also that I never learned whether cybersix and data7 would die, apparently they survived, but I'm not sure. Cybersix was by far the BEST TV show in history. I know it's too late to hope that they will start the series again, so I am very glad that I could watch it. I loved so much <3 </ b> about a woman named cybersix, she is not a man. She goes to Adrian Sildman, a male teacher in high school. Now Cybersix is ​​actually a woman, she is just disguised as a man that day. At night, Cybersix patrols the city. <br /> <br /> A guy named Von Reichter is the one who created Cybersix, and as soon as he finds that she is alive, he uses everything he can to capture her. > <br /> IF you have never watched it before, you should download it completely. It was the best TV show in the world. Why did they cut it off ???? Some people have problems. but I'm glad I managed to watch 13 episodes.
