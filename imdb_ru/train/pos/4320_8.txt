This highly underrated film is (for me) what you need to write about in the film. Kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and puts it on public display and surprise. The film tells about the gaps that people create in order to protect themselves from violence, hatred and fanaticism of everyday life. <br /> <br /> Along the way, we are asked a question for a question about life. Davis (Steve Martin with a big beard) asks himself: "Do I shoot a film about violence (and therefore our pleasure from it), violence in society?" Claire asks: "What world throws something as valuable as a human life? ”Mack is not insured when he asks:“ Is it possible to go beyond the race and (even more difficult step) of finance? This, of course, is not a quote from the film, but a community. Others also ask their questions and, honestly, this raises more than answers. <br /> <br /> But this is the nature of life. All our lives we strive to find answers to questions to which we will never give a complete answer, and in some cases we have to choose answers that correspond to our own needs and desires. As humans, we thrive on questions that we cannot answer. Some answers are real. Claire and Mack realize that, although they can go the easy way and allow the state to take the child, their discovery puts the responsibility for her life in their hands. There are no answers. Davis "sees the light" and decides not to make violent films, but the next day he turns around and rejects his insight as subject to his art. <br /> <br /> We are all looking for answers. This film does not respond to them, it just reminds you to keep looking for answers. <br /> <br />
