The Journey of Hope talks about a poor Turkish family and their odyssey of hope, which, as it approaches Switzerland in search of prosperity, turns into despair. Despite the fact that this film, which received an Oscar, is rather well thought out, it does not have enough content and a lot of implausible ones. Most of the film, which lasts 1.7 hours, is to get on the bus, get off it, take the boat, get off the boat, get into the van, get out of the van, etc .; time that could be better spent or completely eliminated. The story has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who know about the widespread crime of trafficking in illegal immigrants. Standing and quite interesting hours, but overpriced.
