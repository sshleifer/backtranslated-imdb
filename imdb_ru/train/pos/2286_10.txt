The people who produced this masterful film have done an excellent service to the novel, which is considered to be almost the best work of art based on human guilt and human responsibility ever published. Nolte assumes the role of Howard W. Campbell Jr. and makes him his own, remaining true to Vonnegutâ€™s image of a man who lost ALL (and for) for the sake of Love. <br /> <br /> There are no weaknesses in this beautiful adaptation.
