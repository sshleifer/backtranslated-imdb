This is a terrific action movie with great movies from Arnie! It is stylishly made, with lots of strenuous activities to satisfy one. The characters were amazing, and Richard Dawson is very formidable as the main villain. Yes, he has tons of holes in the plot, but he is very fascinating, with a great ending. He also had a great story, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had excellent chemistry together. Character development was also quite good, with some excellent performances. Direction is great! Paul Michael Glaser does an excellent job with this task: he makes great use of colors, keeps it stylish, stunning camera angles and generally keeps the film at a very fast pace! good job. Here is some blood. We get several bloody gunshot wounds, an exploding head, slit throat, bloody pieces of a chainsaw, corpses without skin, blood, and puncturing. Acting great! Arnold Schwarzenegger, as always, is AMAZING, he is great in the acting department, has a lot of fun liners, kicks that ass and, as always, a great physical presence! (Arnie Rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso, it's good here, she was very sweet, and Arnie had good chemistry! Japhet Cotto, decent here, with what he has to do, which is not so much. Marvin J. McIntyre, good as a geek guy, he was cool! Richard Dawson is stunning as the main villain, and he was very very formidable, and he was fun to watch. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland van Lird, Gus Retvish, and Professor Toru Tanaka, all do what they should, very well, like stalkers. In general, MUST see! **** 1/2 of 5
