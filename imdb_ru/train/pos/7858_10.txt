TESS OF THE STORM STUNTRY is probably the best movie of all Mary Pickford films. At two o'clock it was quite long for a silent film of 1922, but still continued to arouse your interest 80 years after it was shot. Mary gives one of her best performances, sometimes the role looks like the “greatest hits” with the bats of Maria Nevinnaya, Mary the little devil, Mary the little mother, Mary Spitfire, Mary the romantic heroine, etc., were used throughout one film in the past. The film surprisingly frankly tells about the illegitimate child of one of the supporting characters in 1922, and at some point our little Mary is considered an unmarried mother! If the Oscar was in 1922, undoubtedly, the best Oscar actress for the year would be Mary.
