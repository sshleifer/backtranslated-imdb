I waited a long time for someone to remove the correct version of H.G. Wellsâ€™s classic War of the Worlds. Timothy Hines finally did it! I just could not believe how good it was! I can't say enough from acting to costumed, unusual special effects! It was wonderful! Dramatic, intense, full of first-class performances of a first-class cast! Must see to believe. I'm sure not. And I read all these negative comments from others, and I cannot believe what they were saying. We must have watched another movie, huh? And these really bad comments from this Vepsai guy, guy, whoever he is, well, he just doesn't know what he is talking about. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work, mister. Hines.
