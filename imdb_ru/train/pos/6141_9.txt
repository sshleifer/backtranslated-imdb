Angela Lansbury plays Eglantine, an elderly woman in England torn apart by war, during World War I. She studied mail magic and secretly studied it in her home; she feels good until three children, who were separated from their parents during the last air raid, were sent to Angela Lansbury's huge house. She is not happy to have them because of her secret. They just want to go home. The oldest boy is very hard to get along, because he is a child. The other two - a boy and a girl - just want to know where they live, and the woman who is their mistress. Children learn about her secret, and here the fun begins. Fun and more. Family fun. Laugh, prank, adventure, something for everyone. The special effects are pretty good. This is a musical whose melodies are just as catchy to sing later as any other Disney movie. Add this to your family video library. You will not be disappointed.
