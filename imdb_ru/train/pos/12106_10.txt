"Danza Macabra" / "Castle of Blood" Antonio Margheriti is a creepy atmospheric chiller that succeeds on all fronts. It looks absolutely beautiful in black and white and has a surprisingly eerie gothic atmosphere. Alan Foster is an English journalist who interviews the American horror writer Edgar Allan Poe. The poet tells Foster that he cannot spend one night in the abandoned mansion of Pau's friend, Thomas Blackwood. Taking the bet, Foster is locked in a mansion, and the horror begins! The film is extremely Atmosphere, and it scared the hell out of me. The sequence of the crypt is really terrible, and the tension is almost unbearable. Barbara Steele looks incredibly beautiful, like the sinister ghost of Elizabeth Blackwood. "Castle of Blood" - one of the best Italian horror films made in the early 60s. Masterpiece!
