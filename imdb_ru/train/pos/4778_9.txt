Like his early masterpiece The Elephant Man, Lynch proves to his detractors that he can tell a straight, simple story without losing his artistic touch. This is a true story about an elderly retiree (experienced by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to drive a tractor through several states for the last time to visit his estranged brother, who now stands at the door of death. A wonderful score from Badalamenti, an exquisite photograph of rural life (I adore these aerial shots of the corn field) and a sly director's hand, revealing the basic humanity of a person, is a wonderful piece of a life movie. Its extremely slow pace can put some viewers to sleep, but those who stay close by will be well rewarded at the end.
