The last exit of William Powell in the role of Philo Vance occurs in the case of the killing of a kennel, where the killing of a dog serving in the championship leads to two more murders and one attempt of the human race. It all depends on how it leads to who and why. <br /> <br /> The murders of Phil Vance by SS Van Dyne was the most popular at the time, and clever Mr. Van Dyne found a way to sell his books for the single highest-priced substitute. That is why you see so many Philo Vances and so many studios producing them. If Bill Powell had not become more famous in MGM as Nick Charles from the Thin Man series, he would have been known as the greatest of Philo Vance. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Powell participated in the competitions of his little Captain Terrier in the same competition in which the killed dog participated, and then another rival became the first victim of the murder. As usual, Powell portrays Eugene Palitra as Sergeant Heath, whose biggest contribution to the trial was to use his community to break the locked inner door where the first murder victim was found. <br /> <br /> I really said it was locked from inside, and it was the top story, so it was figuring out how. Powell has an excellent group of suspects, as extensive as the one that usually is in the secret of the Subtle Man. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan, Mary Astor, do a good job with their acting roles. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers liked this version so much that they actually remade it again in the thirties with James Stevenson on his only walk as Phil Vance. He does not hold a candle on it. <br /> <br /> Since this is the only Powell Philo Vance that is on a VHS or DVD, by all means, watch it or purchase it if you can.
