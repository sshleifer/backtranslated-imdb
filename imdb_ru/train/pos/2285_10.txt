I did not read this book, but throughout the film I was struck by just one thought: it is so, Vonnegut. I have never seen the author, the whole intellect and life behind the work of the novel, so well translated into cinema. In this film there were the same difficulties as in Vonnegut's novels: the jokes were often significant and symbolic, and the dramatic events and symbols were often jokes. <br /> <br /> Campbell was also a very Vonenegut character, beautifully depicted by Nick Nolte. He had all the signs of the Vonnegut “hero”: a lack of concern for political boundaries, ironic dark humor, yielding to stupid inaction in response to stress, and unwillingness to push his version of reality to others. <Br /> <br /> In general, I was constantly amazed and impressed when I watched this movie. It was the same feeling that I felt when reading Cat's Cradle, my first novel by Vonnegut, as if the most perfect thing that could happen was that he thought about IT, and he made it real and important. Yes, he has nothing but army albums "White Christmas". Such are the cases!
