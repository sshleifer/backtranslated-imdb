For a long time I have not seen such a beautiful animation. Having a healthy respect for Pixar, I have to say that Ratatouille or any other film they shot cannot compare with that. Animators have created here an incredibly beautiful world. The graphics are amazing, the background is amazing, almost every object in each frame is perfectly drawn. Sometimes I felt a tingling sensation in the spine — I liked so much what I saw. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely romantic. As romantic as the plot of the animated film. The characters are cute, especially Hector, the blue rabbit, he owns pawns, stones and rules! Other characters are also very good. Humor at the highest level. <br /> <br /> In general, it seemed that the creators did not invest much effort in it. I mean, it looked like it didn’t make them too different from the people of Pixar & Dreamworks, who every time try to come up with something new. And I am very pleased that the product of the European animation studio was so cool. They made a great, touching film, candy for eyes and hearts. <br /> <br /> The only negative is a silly start, so 9:10 is not 10/10.
