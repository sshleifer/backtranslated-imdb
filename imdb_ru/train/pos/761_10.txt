I just want to say that among all the so-called classic hip-hop films that I've seen, like Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Style Wars, etc ... IMO BEAT STREET is the best among others. Whenever I ask other people about their favorite, it seems that BIT-STREET appears most often. But nevertheless, his lowest rating of all. 4.3 - just a punch “under the belt” (if, say, 5 points is a belt). I love musical performances, break dance makes me spin, RAMO makes me want to throw a piece ... come on, this is a classic !!!
