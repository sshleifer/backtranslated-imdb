Absolutely nice movie about singing and dancing with Frank Sinatra and General Kelly, as well as Catherine Grayson. <br /> <br /> The film won an Oscar at the expense of George E. Stoll, and he received nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly and Best Cinematography, and also a nomination for the role of best son in the play “I Fall in Love” too easy ”by Sinatra. <br /> <br /> It was a sweet story about how Kelly helps her boyfriend Sinatra get a girl and falls. in love with her myself. The beautiful Grayson (New Orleans Toast) struck us with his singing, and we had many great songs and dance programs from Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the artistry of pianist and conductor Jose Iturbi. <br /> <br /> Classical Hollywood music from a bygone era.
