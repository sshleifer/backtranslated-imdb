This show was absolutely amazing and I always look forward to watching it. All the characters were funny and amazing in their own way, each episode provoked nonstop laughter, and it was completely interesting and different from many other shows. Everyone was just insane and amazingly funny that you couldn't help but love this show. There were several episodes with dead weight, but the 70s show always managed to create some kind of pleasant atmosphere in which it simply did not work. Never mind. It was one of the best shows that ever went on the air, and I will watch this show any time I can, because it never gets old, it never becomes unfunny and never becomes uninteresting.
