Well, like many other such films, spawned from the SNL parody. But Tim Meadows does a pretty fantastic job of turning a 3-minute one-dimensional character into a moderately viable comedy hero. With a funny frequency, he throws funny, constantly-sounding one-line players, in them, Billy Dee Williams, although his days with Lando are long gone, and all this is pretty well filmed. True, this is not a great art, but if you went to Wayne's World in search of Gone with the Wind, you did something wrong. Nice for what it is .......
