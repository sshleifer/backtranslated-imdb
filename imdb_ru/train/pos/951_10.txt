I know that many have a special love for the version of Dickens written by Alistair Sim, but for me this version of 1984 is the best. My wife and I own a copy of this film on VHS, and we watch it together every Christmas Eve. I often point out that we could watch it on Halloween too, because this is a very creepy story about ghosts. <br /> <br /> Scott - Scrooge's type - is terribly mean and vile, which makes his transformation even more wonderful and moving. I think it's there with his performance in Patton. Spirits are all effective, each worse than the previous. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal form of the Spirit of Christmas, which is still ahead, makes me tremble on the back every year. And what a cast! In particular, David Warner is in great shape, like Bob Kratchit, just like Suzanne York as his wife. <br /> <br /> I seem to recall that this version is closer to the original story than most others, but I could be wrong, since it has been several years since I read it. Despite this, it is an amazing Christmas classic.
