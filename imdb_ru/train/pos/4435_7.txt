This is a neat little crime drama that fits into his 65-minute work time. It has all the right ingredients - the mysterious corpse, a weary middle-aged police officer Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and his assistant rookie Tobin (John Miles), a ghostly killer at large, and even the love of Tobin in the form of a female botanist Mary (Patricia Wright), who helps to solve a crime. There is also a stunning finale of skirmish that takes place in the courtyard of stonecutters. <br /> <br /> Watch out for the awesome stupidity around the beginning of this film, where Lieutenant Corrigan calls the dead woman "Tattooed Tilly." â€œBEFORE the coroner discovers that she had a tattoo (confusing, eh?). Also later, when Tobin pursues the murderer through the backyards, he is suddenly shown that he is moving in the wrong direction in one place - no wonder he did not catch him!
