The trip with the Devil, as well as later “Brokeback Mountain” by Ang Lee, is a film of aesthetic and historical significance. Film lovers should see it at least twice, since its artistic nuance is worthy of being overestimated. <br /> <br /> A wonderful work of art, an amazing depth of humanity. I really do not remember another film about the war, it will capture you, change your existing concept of history and politics, restore your faith in humanity. Having seen so much murder, so much suffering, you do not feel numb, instead you value more the connection between people. The performances of the actors pursue your heart, the music moves your mind. Some shoots are not just pictures, they go beyond themselves, becoming a vision of the soul. That is the true feeling of the film as a genre of art. <br /> <br /> Such a film does not need long comments or reviews, everything that it says by itself. An ovation to the cast that includes Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, a cinematographer and composer of beautiful and lyrical music, what an achievement!
