"The last tough man" - a typical Western 70s. Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Pekingpach. Also this one, but Director Andrew McLaglan is a student of John Ford, and this can obviously be shown in many scenes. Imo start is very good. In a sense, McLaughlan wanted to show viewers a journey from civilization to the desert. In the third part there are some illogical flaws, and I complain a little about Charlton Heston. He has to play the old ex-lawyer named Sam Burgadeh, but he is in fantastic physical shape. I have never had the feeling that he really has problems climbing on a horse or on a rock. For me, he did not look very motivated, as usual in most of his epic films. The same goes for the beautiful Barbara Hershey, who plays the sheriff's daughter. Perhaps both had problems with the director or they were unhappy with their roles. Hershey and Coburn do not show themselves better, but they are still good. If the screenwriter meant John Wayne as Sam Burgadeh? Also Michael Parks as a modern sheriff is a bit undervalued in his role. On the other hand, there is James Coburn as the criminal Zack Provo. Coburn is really a great villain in this. He portrays the bad guy between maniac hate and mind. His role and his acting is the best of the films. <br /> <br /> Landscapes and shootouts are awesome. Shooting the scene is bloody, and the violence looks realistic. Zach Provo and his gang had several bloody and violent scenes. I miss the typical western action movie in the middle of a movie. I would appreciate a bank robbery or something like that. In general, this is an entertaining western film. Not a very good movie, but above average due to a great Coburn, a very good start and some bloody and cruel scenes.
