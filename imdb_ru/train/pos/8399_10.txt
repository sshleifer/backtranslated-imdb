Love Trap is not a short, but a full-length feature film with a duration of 105 minutes. <br /> <br /> While I am writing this, I could talk a little more about Love Trap. I am often asked what distinguishes the "Love Trap" ... Here is how I answer this question: 1) It presents the characters - one of them - who have never been seen in the film before. <br /> <br /> 2) He reveals more truth about love and is more deeply immersed in the very concept of love than any other American film ever made, in my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> 3) Structurally, as in the way The story is told, it is not like any love story you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 4) It offers an extremely timely understanding of various cultural issues, both inside and outside. <br /> Over time, people will see Love Trap as a completely original work in this era, delightfully refreshing, genuine and honest. This is a rare moral game full of food for thought. <br /> <br /> Please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate information about this film.
