I'm not a writer or a critic ... I'm just a student who saw this film a few minutes ago .... And I want to thank the people who worked on this film! This is not the best or most ... but it touched my heart ... why ??? I would like to understand it myself ... it is easy and affordable .. this is a film that makes you feel good after a bad day without any regrets about the time spent watching it! It is about love and care, about our life, but we sometimes miss it because of material things ....... Look at all the time that we have, but we miss it. ... why the hell are we doing this ??? We need to live like we died ... take care of every second and remember: if we do good things, good things come back to us! Happiness is real ... and it has a special taste in New York ... I love this city and the world in which we live !!!! Many thanks for the film and I apologize for my mistakes (English is my second language) ...
