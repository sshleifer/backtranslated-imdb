Searching for Quo Vadis in my local video store, I found this version of 1985, which looked interesting. Blimey! It was wonderful! Very similar to Ken Russell's film - strange, stylized, very artistic and, of course, “different.” Nero was represented not so much as the embodiment of evil, but rather as a stupid, unrealized emperor who would prefer to have a circus career. He probably wondered why on earth he was put in the position of “leading” the empire - it was not very fun, and he longed for fun. Klaus Maria Bandaur had a great time with this role and played it, despite all its advantages. Yes, Nero persecuted Christians with a vengeance; one of many who did that. At one point, one of his minions muttered: "No one will ever understand that we are simply defending ourselves." He got it right.
