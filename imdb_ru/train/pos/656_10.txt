Of all the reviews I read, most people were very worried about Alexander. Neither Marie nor Veronica ever thought that they would be especially desperate to keep Alexander, he was only a little clever, though not at all intellectual, like most of us, however hard it is to admit. Alexander perfectly passes away, completely cares, receives and gives what he wants. the girls allow it, Veronica loves sex, Marie is his patron. is anything wrong with that? anyone in love really? I do not think so. Although the French cinema "New Wave" is prone to claims, and so on. D., It is amazing simply because it does not need a plot to create emotions. Lightness is absolutely beautiful, and anyone who is in Alexander's position in an urban area can ask. I'm looking for a patron who is interested?
