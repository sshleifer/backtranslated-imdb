This movie has no story. This is just a group of guys who have tortured an innocent young girl to death. <br /> <br /> !!! SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> This is what they do: they beat her, put her on the net, and let her hang inside, like food for birds, twist her on a chair until she tears, subjects her to loud noise pours boiling oil on her, puts worms on wounds, crushes her hand with a sledgehammer, and finally pokes a needle into her eyes. <br /> <br /> This film was so realistic that if I didnâ€™t know that it was a fake, I would have thought it was a snuff film. Although I was disgusted with this film, I really liked it. It scared me. I guess it fills in some kind of purpose. I put it on 10/10.
