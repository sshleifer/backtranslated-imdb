This movie is incredible! I was expecting something completely different from the film that I actually saw. Nonetheless, he is very perceptive because he demonstrates the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its connection to animal behavior. Let me warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by the content that is too sexy for the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a highbrow sort of pornography. It even has a scene that is very close to rape. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I highly recommend seeing this rare piece of "sexual art." By the way, every minute of the picture breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies. Do not forget how times have changed! <br /> <br /> Go and see! It is worth your money and time!
