Malefique largely has a viewer from start to finish with its sharp atmosphere. Almost the whole film takes place in a prison cell, revolving around 4 characters, of which transvestite Marcus and his little backward boy come out the strangest. Soon the prisoners find the diary of the previous prisoner behind the brick, which speaks of his obsession with the subjects of occultism and black magic, which led to his escape from the cell. From this point on, everything deals with the disclosure of the mystery of the book and its spells to escape from prison. This leads to some accidents at the exit of the camera in an unknown light. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think the story is rather scanty, and the last turn is good, but for me the ends are rather loosely connected. In any case, I was delighted until the last moment, because the atmosphere of the film is unique, with minimal settings and actors. The killings are rough and creepy ... no blood is needed to cool the spine, and the occult themes are also very well done and reminded me of the hellish themes in Hellraiser. Malefique has a feeling of claustrophobia and cold mud with a greenish tint. At times you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is more strange ... when a backward boy loses his fingers and is put to sleep by sucking on Marcus's chest, it seems normal, since there may be a glowing gate to freedom? Thanks to its budget, the film creates a unique atmosphere and cools the viewer in a completely different way than most shockers of the genre. I just want the story to lead to a more consistent finale. Some elements, such as a visitor with a camera, others obsessed with books and a toy doll, dimly pointing to the end, do not fit into the story. In any case, I will keep my eyes open to other films from director Valetta, although this is a trip to see what he is doing a Hollywood remake of “One Missed Call”, which has been erased and useless already in the Miike version.
