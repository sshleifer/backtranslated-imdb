Allen and Julie move to a cabin in the mountains after being killed one night. No one knows who killed the little girl, but that is why they moved to the mountains. Thus, the couple moves into this cabin, and people who have killed themselves there are following her, and no one in the neighboring town wants to talk about it. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of creepiness in this film, and there are many details in it that made me jump. Some parts are predictable, but from time to time there is a part that I did not expect. It was a pretty good movie that was not the scariest movie in the world, but it was still scary enough to make it pretty good. <br /> <br /> I also liked the final, because the viewer had to decide how it ends. It is also a kind of sad film, but a well-made horror movie.
