Nice movie, although I think it could be even better if it had more depth. Halfway to the film is a mystery to understand why Ally is such a recluse. Then, when we are finally given an explanation, returning to her childhood, there are still not many details. Perhaps if they showed memories or something like that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is still a good movie that I would watch again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
