First let me say that I am not from the south, but I am American. I don't like country music, but I can relive it. I will never wear a cowboy hat, but I wear hats. I don't live in a trailer, but I eat tuna salad and own a house. What does this have to do with this comment? A lot, if you are one of those people who say that only "village" people love this film. This film is loosely based on the premise of "They loved and lost." James Bridges runs an American love story as real as possible. In the era of Jerry Springer and the “Let's Lay It Out” mentality, this movie sounds truer than ever. <br /> <br /> Bud “comes of age” and begins his own life with a little help from his aunt and uncle, so he moves with them to the big city. Bad gets caught up in the local honky-tonkov world for the only way out that a blue collar can afford. He quickly meets Sissy, who is similar to the other, and they both have a turbulent romance filled with painful ups and downs. <br /> <br /> (* This plot takes so many twists and turns that you just need to sit for a few minutes before they get hooked. Marriage is a trick that is often missed. At the beginning of the movie, they get married and we watch the transition from singles to the married. The film talks about some of the current difficulties that a woman faces when she marries an old-fashioned man, and also talks about men's ego with women and competition.) <br /> <br /> Bud challenges and gets excited when Mickey puts up an electronic bull. Sissy also comes to mind to have fun, but she is quickly reminded that she is married and she needs to start “behaving like this.” The emotions between the two characters are harsh and expressive, and the plot continues from there, especially when they (NOTE, SOME SIRIN GIVES SOME), and Sissy falls in love with a former con artist with a penchant for violence and cruelty. She soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side. <br /> <br /> The way someone can compare Bud to Winnie Barbirino shocks me. John Travolta gave an exceptional performance that was worthy of recognition. He was believable and real. The scene where he shaves his beard and you see him for the first time at the bar ... still gives me goosebumps. Keep in mind, I'm not a big fan of Travolta, but come on, I understand why Sissy kicked her shoes so early in the film. Deb Winger was so real that you sympathized with her when she wrote a note of emotion to Bud when she got into the house during their separation. <br /> <br /> The cast was incredible. Wes, played by Scott Glenn, showed a great game that made you hate him and curse him when he insulted Sissy. Madolin Smith-Osborne, being the Lover / Buds Girlfriend, was so genuine that big titted girls across America prayed to wake up with a flat chest to wear the clothes she wore in the film. My biggest thanks are Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson as aunt and uncle Bud. They seemed like someone's aunt and uncle somewhere in Texas, and, despite the small role, they made the film much bigger and more realistic. Two unforgettable scenes were the competition of Dolly Parton and the unforgettable scene where Bad and his aunt are on the street after the death of one of the characters. The dialogue between them is touching. <br /> <br /> If you can see what it is, this is an American love story. Then I recommend you take it for what it is ... before the time came, which gave us voyeurism in a world different from ours, but real enough for our pleasure and entertainment. If this world sounds like yours, you will enjoy it a lot more. And finally, the music, although outdated, will definitely take you back to the past if you are over 30 years old.
