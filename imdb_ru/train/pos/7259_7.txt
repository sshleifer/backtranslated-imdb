How can the rating of viewers for this movie be only 5.4? Just a pretty young Alisan Porter will automatically start you at 6 years old when you decide your rating. James Belushi is also good at this, his first good serious role, I did not like him in anything except “Last Night” before. He was pretty good at the gang, also associated with Tupac. Kelly Lynch, you must love her. Well, I do. I just wonder what happened to Miss Porter? <br /> <br /> I gave Curly Sue 7
