Excellent storyline with the message. Joan Plowright is great in the role of "Phoebe", Mike Cops is hilarious in the role of "coach", and Richard de Klerk plays the role of "Carmina" superbly. Misha Barton in the role of "Frankie" shows good results, and Ingrid in the role of "Hazel" perfectly plays his first role. This film is superbly directed by Jo-Bet Williams. Editing is first class.
