This comedy, which is too long and comes to an end, is extremely delightful, never condescending and not making fun of the problems of the "powerful man" who likes to wear women's clothes at night. <br /> Julie Walters is beautiful as always, but Adrian Pasdar is very credible and steals the movie. He (she) is absolutely gorgeous in high heels and silk stockings.
