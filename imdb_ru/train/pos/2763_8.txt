People tend to complain about the number of films about mentally ill people. I do not consider this a serious criticism, nothing more than complaints about too many films about people of any type. Jaco van Dormael copes with the script and directing. Daniel Otey and Pascal Duken work great together, and Duken mostly plays himself. The film covers a surprisingly extensive history of events and does not just talk about what they saw in The Rain Man. The final is pretty depressing, but it does not destroy the beautiful story that was before. <br /> <br /> 7.8 out of 10
