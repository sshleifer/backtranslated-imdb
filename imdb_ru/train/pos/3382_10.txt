Not often I had the feeling of a movie, it could be a visionary. But it is clear that in this film there is a grain of foreboding. <br /> <br /> We should not strive to be alarmists and see something in Armageddon, because it seems that it corresponds to our emotions at the moment. But didn't we say that “1984”? Did James Orwell know that the Internet became a reality soon after 1984; Actually it was in 1994; he could rethink writing his story the way he did it. Backdated rewarded. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter. What matters is that we often consider ourselves above our environment, but in fact we become emotional about the “apple of love” when necessity knocks on our door. Take a picture of yourself in old age. <br /> <br /> Whatever the timetable for us, I know for sure that we have not yet seen its beginning. <br /> <br />
