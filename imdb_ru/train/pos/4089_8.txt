Strange erotic slok Gothic horror that Hammer House of Horror fans will love around the world. It turns out an interesting look at "Beauty and the Beast." It is definitely worth seeing and works amazingly well, taking into account the genre and the era. <br /> <br /> Corsets, locks, stray horses, rampaging monsters made of faux fur in the forest, proof that no one had a Brazilian in the 70s, and more body fluids than you can shake with a stick what more can you want ?! <br /> <br /> This definitely brightened my Sunday afternoon!
