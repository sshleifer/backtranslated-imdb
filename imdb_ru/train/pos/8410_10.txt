In this truly exciting dark movie, a young, impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money, and in return the devil removes his mirror reflection (this is brilliantly done in the film and is eerily anticipating when a student of Baldwin used to practice fencing in front of a mirror), a visual metaphor for "A man who is at war with himself," who foreshadows his near future. The student enjoys his money, but the woman he loves is unattainable (he made a deal with the devil, he is forever cut off from love and other soul riches), you can have love, or you can exchange your soul for money, you cannot have both. Balduin pursues his double (intertitles express it beautifully, as does the action. Some scenes are incredible, the sense of doom when the devil disappears with a mirror image of Balduin is amazing, as is the feeling that his pact forever cut him off from his twin and falls into the "wasteland" on the outskirts of the city, is not completely human (he lost his soul), he looks like a animal hunting animals outside of human society There are many other things that can be said about this incredible m film. Paul Wegener was an amazing actor and director, my cultural hero.This will help if you learn a little about the history of Germany during the creation of this film and about the German twin tradition (do not google, find the right book.) Just remember, this is a very early the film is sometimes a bit awkward, but considering what he says and this is a tragic ending, he is one of the best ever (yes, this Is!)
