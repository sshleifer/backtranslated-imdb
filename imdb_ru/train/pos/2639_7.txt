Being a fan of the first Lion King, I was definitely looking forward to this film, but I knew that in fact it could not be as good as the original. I know that many Disney fans are wary of direct-viewing movies, as I have mixed feelings about them. <br /> <br /> While watching the movie “The Lion King” 1½, I tried to find out what I have. point of view was about this film. Am I going to be so truthful about the Lion King that I will find fault with certain scenes, or will I just accept this film as another look at the story of the Lion King? Most of the time I found myself accepting the latter. <br /> <br /> Lion King 1½ certainly has its cute and funny moments. Timon and Pumba stole the show in the first film and definitely deserved a film centered around them. People just love these characters! My favorite parts of the film include a montage of Timon and Pumba, who cares for the young Simba, and an unexpected finale with several magnificent cameos. <br /> <br /> Although I could do without many jokes in the bathroom, as the real reason everyone worshiped Simba’s baby at the start of Lion King 1. I think these types of jokes are for the junior set (which, in After all, it’s the target audience. I don’t think that many children are really concerned about the size of Disney’s live video earnings.) <br /> <br /> However, I’ll say that I was somewhat annoyed when they were directly tied to scenes from the original movie to this movie. I am too familiar with the original, that these scenes just stuck to me like sore fingers. Something would be different with music or voices that would just distract me. <br /> <br /> As for the music, it wasn’t that bad, but don’t expect some classic to come out of this movie. At least LK2 had a wonderful ballad “Love will find a way”. As for the vocal work, it was well done in this film. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, as always, did a great job, and even the new actors, classic comedian Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (better known as Marge Simpson), also did a great job. You can even enjoy these wonderful voice talents even more by checking out Virtual Safari on DVD 2 disc. This feature definitely delivers a lot of fun !! <br /> <br /> In general, The Lion King 1½ is not a perfect movie, but it's cute and interesting. I think that many Lion King fans will like it and appreciate it for being a funny, carefree look at the Lion King masterpiece from the point of view of our funny friends. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating: 7/10. My Yahoo! Rating: B (good)
