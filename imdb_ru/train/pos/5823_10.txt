The Micro Phonies puppets are the best there. In this short presentation, the trios are the craftsmen working in the recording studio. In the end, they look at Alice Van Doren (Christine McIntyre), singing the voice of spring. The voice is amazing. Mrs. Bixby (Simone Boniface) hears a curly dredge. Mo is calling Curly the eldest Cucaracha. Three puppets end up going to a party where Curly is going to dress in drag. They play a recording of spring voices, and everything goes well until Moe destroys the recording on Curly's head. They end up using lucia sequlet until the baritone recognizes them and turns them off. Alice Van Doren catches the boy's cry and hides behind the curtain to help them. All is well, until the baritone wonders how Curley sings without the help of a phonograph and discovers Alice behind the curtain. Three puppets, as it turns out, are scammers, but Alice’s father discovers his daughter’s talent and agrees that she must become a singer. Puppets are thrown out of the room. Fine.
