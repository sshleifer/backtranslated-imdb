Although I was too young to remember the first show of the series (as a child), I later found out about it on television in the late 80s, just when I was interested in the war and all its aspects. It was my grandfather, who first showed me the series, and also gave me my first interests regarding stories about his time in the Royal Navy in Malta, and then in the Pacific. Since then, I have eaten a lot of books and watched a lot of television series about the era of the Second World War, with mixed opinions. British television stations, as a rule, produce them very well, which can be easily witnessed in “World at War” with many precious stones made by both the BBC and independent companies. I highly recommend titles such as “The Nazis - a warning from the story,” “Blitz,” and the BBC series about Dunkirk. "Britain in War in Color" with the accompanying series "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​have a very high standard. Peace in war is certainly the best and, despite its age, never ceases to deliver. There will always be new revelations about the war that will appear, which are obviously not included in the series, and, of course, World War II took place on such a large canvas that it would take more time and money to create a series with EVERY detail. then any other, even if such an undertaking was even possible. I feel that I have to say to those who condemn that it does not include everything that “World in War” physically cannot do this as a series, but, damn it, may prompt you to do further research - and make them enjoyable. It certainly worked for me: I now have an extensive library of books, videos, DVDs, tapes, and CDs. I recommend to anyone who has even a passing interest. The series was so well made that it would be difficult for them to disagree with the fact that it is quality programming and very informative.
