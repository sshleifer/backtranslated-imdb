I am amazed that such films can still be made. I watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends, and I can say that this is one of the best I've ever seen. I never thought that a 146 minute movie could make me think about it again and again. <br /> <br /> Washington, charismatic and tense, as always, is played by Chrisy, a washed-up former counter-terrorism agent, who was taken to a bottle. After he is assigned to protect young Pete (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, his emotional and redemptive arc is launched in the way only a charming little girl can provide. Inevitably, Pete is kidnapped by gangsters, and Christie decides that most of Mexico City should pay the price for courage to remove the catalyst clutching his character's teddy bear. Yes, he became ... Man on fire. <br /> <br /> You should watch this movie.
