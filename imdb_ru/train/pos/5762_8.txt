I have to admit that I enjoy bad movies. I love them, I watch them all. Horror especially. My friends and I gather after a hard week at school and at work, shoot crazy tapes, order pizza and enjoy. It had a big box, so I expected less than usual. <br /> <br /> A story about a housing project that is built above a nuclear installation, in which the above-ground layers are torn down, and the other underground layers are simply covered. Residents of this neighborhood find a sheltered structure when some children fall into a hole inside the cave. This awakens some zombies. <br /> <br /> From now on, it is a small town. The effects of blood and action never cease until the credits end. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is not great art, but this one, with its dialogue for fun and incredible horrible things, was our favorite evening. In fact, it was one of the best party tapes I've ever had the pleasure of watching. And you could say that it was done without money, with a bunch of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks like Brendan Fraser (he has a cameo), and this is just a wild trip.
