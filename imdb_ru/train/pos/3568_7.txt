This film promotes the story of Cinderella in the early 1950s and makes a good, though eccentric, use of the Isle of Man as a backdrop. Ugly Sisters became insanely glamorous English girls from the upper class, and together with Kathleen Turner as a stepmother, they roam in various remarkable historical costumes. The story has changed a bit compared to the traditional version: at the beginning it is strangely combined with the plot of “King Lear”, and at later stages Cinderella looks more assertive than usual. It looks great and works quite well overall, but sometimes it goes up.
