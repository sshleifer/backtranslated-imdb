First of all, I have to start this comment by saying that I am a big fan of the Nightmare on Elm Street. I think this is the greatest horror series. For me, Freddie is a boogie! Of course, Freddy's Dead, who was then trying to become the last chapter, is a strange film. There is no same atmosphere as in previous films. Freddie has a lot of screen time. Some people think that this makes it less scary, which I agree with. And this, in my opinion, is the point. This film exists, so we can learn a little better about Freddie, who he is, who he was, how he became a man who pursues our dreams. For some people, this is bad, it’s better if we never know, because it’s scary not to know why evil is evil. Obviously, these people will not like Rob Zombie’s remake on Halloween. To truly enjoy it, you must look at things differently. We are not talking about a strange guy who is hiding in the bushes of your dreamland and is waiting to scare the hell out of you. It was the first, and it was awesome. Years passed, Freddie killed more and more people, and no one could get rid of him forever. Now it's time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of the kingdom of terror of Freddie. Besides the story of Freddie’s past, I also really liked the film’s atmosphere. There are no more children in Springwood, only crazy adults. The nightmarish scenes are all gorgeous. The soundtrack is awesome, especially the first song titled “I'm Awake Now” performed by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, “The Last Nightmare” is a masterpiece of horror, and I cannot believe that it is so underestimated. Maybe it was misunderstood, or I have different tastes! Anyway, all Freddie fans should watch this. It has a lot of scary and funny moments, as well as a lot of cameos! Get ready for something else and you will not be disappointed.
