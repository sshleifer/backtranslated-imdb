in the west there should be a sub-genre called “Robert Mitchum Western”. Brilliant, unique, undervalued Mitchum westerns, which usually underestimate westerns, bring a noir person to his film to smash a few incredibly gloomy sketches of characters, and bring elegiac fatigue to a world more familiar from Sam Peckinp's films. "Man with a gun" - one of his best. Directed by Orson Welles, a protégé of Richard Wilson, is a harsh monochrome beauty full of frightening silhouettes and terrifying outbursts of wild violence when Mitchum tames a city terrorized by a monopolist with a private army. Mitchum's regression from a quiet stranger to a mad killer with a lot of dark emotions between them is a miracle of an expressive, physical game.
