The stars of Chris Rock in this remake of the film “Heaven Can Wait” by Warren Beatty (which is itself a remake of the 1941 film “Here is Mr. Jordan”), a comedy about a man who dies ahead of time before your adventures in your life. new (albeit temporary) body. In the Beatty version, the protagonist was the backup quarterback for the then Los Angeles Rams. In the hipper version of Rock, our main character is a young and undoubtedly talented comedian. <br /> <br /> It's very funny to see how razor-sharp Rock plays a bad comedian. This is similar to how Tom Hanks plays a bad actor. Lance Barton’s dream is to play in the legendary Apollo theater in a non-amateur evening. But every time he tries his stuff, he lustfully left the stage - so much so that his nickname becomes “Booie”. His jokes are lame, his delivery is painful. In short, Lance is all that the real Chris Rock is not. <br /> <br /> Lance is also a bike racer and rides through the streets to try even more stuff when BAM! He is hit by a truck. Well, maybe he was taken from his body one tenth of a second before by a slightly incompetent angel (Eugene Levy), but hey, he would still get hit. It seems that Lance should not be in Heaven until 2044. So what to do? Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri), the "manager" of Heaven, reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the not quite dead Mr. Burton. The trouble is that they found the body of a greedy old white man. It turns out that this guy (Mr. Wellington) owns different things - he is the 15th richest man in the country! What a luck! You can imagine how Lance will turn the situation around. <br /> <br /> But, of course, being in the body of the wealthy Mr. Wellington, Lance falls in love with a great hospital worker (Regina King). We men know how hard it is to find a woman with her own body, but try to defeat her while you are a dull old white guy! And even worse when she is not impressed with your money. <br /> <br /> This is the first shot of Doom in the title role, and, in my opinion, he plays excellently. He still has a lot of stand-up comedian - and, of course, if he ever wants to get different roles, he may have to stop including subroutines in the script - but this is not so bad. The personality of Rock - his drive, his delivery, his behavior and his passion - this is what feeds this film. He obviously has a lot of fun in this role, and he seems to want you to have fun watching him.
