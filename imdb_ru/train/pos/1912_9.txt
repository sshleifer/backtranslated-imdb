I will be brief and brief, the people who wrote the storylines for this show are brilliant, the actors are just perfect for the roles they play (CJ legendary character), and they have so much chemistry on the screen that makes it a very successful comedy . <br /> <br /> When I first saw the new episodes, which are likely to appear just over 6/7 months, I was surprised what happened to Paul. I was shocked to learn that he died when I was browsing Google. He was so funny and perfected his hero, overly protecting his father, who likes to keep his daughters in the spotlight and away from the boys. <br /> <br /> I think the comedy has gone out of its power even without Paul. <br /> <br /> Also, I think most people will like it.
