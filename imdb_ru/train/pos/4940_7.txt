This film is about human relationships. Charming, fun and well written, with meaningful text. It seems that Morgan Freeman will surely have fun on the set. Too good music. Paz Vega is a beautiful and intelligent woman. I really like her game. Such a woman is a good motivation for learning Spanish. From the moment Morgan Freeman meets the cute Paz Vega, he gets on an intimate journey when two strangers learn to care about where their lives are going. 10 items or less is the highlight of life. If you like this movie, see also “The Pursuit of Happyness” with Will Smith and his son. This is not a thriller or naked comedy. It's all about human relationships.
