Putting the "thing" UFO aside. It was the best documentary I've ever seen. Actual coverage of the Nile and Buzz ... Must see. Interviews and reports are a revelation, since most of the information was printed as confidential in 1969 and released only in 2006. No documentary film today contains details and accuracy in such a short 47 minutes ... THE FACTS will amaze you, and you will be delighted with the risks undertaken to become the first on the Moon ... Neil and Buzz are probably the biggest heroes of our time. Have you ever seen a man save his life? Bid no. Neal saves his life when only a few seconds separate him from death. Amazing to watch. This is a parody of the fact that people did not know all the details associated with landing on the moon, and the courage that these people possessed, when faced with certain death, from a faulty computer ... 10 stars!
