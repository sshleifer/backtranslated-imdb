It was just another wonderful film of the Berlin festival. But unlike “Yes” Sally Potter, which I saw a few days ago, when, after leaving the cinema, I felt a strong desire to want to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive, this time the opposite happened: something pulled me down , and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe. As if suddenly there was nothing left, all hope, the whole future was carried away to a dead place. <br /> <br /> Nina’s life seemed bleak and locked up, but then one Beautiful day, such a luminosity appears that opens the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams. Nobody was on her side, but suddenly she finds a companion, just out of nothing, someone who could share the most hidden feelings of her life. This man was Tony, a stray girl who seems to have no roots, like herself. <br /> <br /> But the name of the film is “Ghosts”, and the ghosts appear and disappear, as they want, there is no way to save them ?? Ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people, strange ideas that occupy your mind and are perceived only by you, hiding from all other people. Francoise, a Frenchwoman, is a victim of such ghosts. One day she lost her daughter in Berlin, which, apparently, was taken from her in a supermarket in just one moment of inattention. Time passed, and Francoise returned to Berlin, still searching for the missing child. <br /> <br /> Nina could have been that child, for she had the same scar on her ankle and a birthmark in the shape of a heart. between her shoulder blades, which seems to prove her true identity. <br /> <br /> And Nina accepts this idea, after all, not only does she desperately need a companion, she also craves for her mother. But in the end she was empty handed, Tony disappeared with a man, and her supposed mom was a sick woman. "Marie is dead," concludes Francoise's husband, and this statement can not be more disappointing. Nina is just a “Nina,” a girl without a name; there is no hope of any divine fulfillment. In this world there is no Marie who would accompany our lonely life. Therefore, in the end, we see Nina alone, walking along the road that opened before her, to a future that seems bleak and insecure.
