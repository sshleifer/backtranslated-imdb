This is a great movie visually. Images of the Mexican desert, the old mansion, the characters in their beautiful costumes ... all this is a true work of art. <br /> <br /> The story seems a bit useless, but that’s because it’s not intended to be realistic. It’s taken from a book called One Hundred Years of Solitude, and is supposed to be a reminder of the isolated, otherworldly atmosphere of Latin America “so far from God and so close to the United States” Herndira's huge debt to her grandmother symbolizes the debt burden of Latin America, although there are many meanings. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate a slow, richly textured film, this one is for you.
