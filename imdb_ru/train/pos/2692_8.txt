I really enjoyed watching this movie. It has a great guide, already famous Bigas Luna, born in Spain. And it is in Spain that the film takes place, more precisely, in Catalonia. <br /> <br /> The moon once again explores the topic of obsessive ideas, in this case the obsessive intentions of a young boy for women. milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story, such as the rejection complex that the eldest son feels with the birth of his brother. In the film, this is what leads to the obsession of a young boy who suddenly sees all the milk of his mother go to his newly born son. Therefore, he begins to try to find a breast that can feed him. He finds it in a newly arrived woman, and hence the film is all around it. <br /> <br /> This film lives more on images, more than on the plot itself, and the viewer captures certain moments (unforgettable moments) and certain characters (the film deserves a thorough analysis of almost everything that happens because it usually means something ...). The surroundings, landscapes typical of the region, as well as the surrealistic behavior of the characters, also a symbolic, and extraordinarily ambiguous soundtrack by Nicola Piovani, take us to another dimension, not parallel to the real world, but crossing it with time. see this film, although we may be momentarily tired and a little tired of excessive obsession, which perhaps goes beyond ... <br /> <I also liked the performance of the main character ... 8/10
