Anchors Aweigh, one of the first best musicals, contains several memorable musical episodes: Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse, Kelly dances with 7-year-old Sharon McManus, Sinatra sings with Jose Iturbi, plays the piano, Catherine Grayson sings with Iturbi and many more. Technicolor is perfect thanks to some innovative camera work, such as watching the piano playing through the transparent keys and Grayson's singing, visible through the other camera's finder. The plot is thin, but you are keen on the enthusiasm of Kelly and Sinatra. A sailor on vacation, they have to take the escaped boy home (Dina Stockwell) home, and Sinatra falls in love with his aunt. To nominate him as an aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra audition for her with Jose Iturbi. But Sinatra is young and naive about it, and in his own sung words falls in love too quickly. As long as they try to contact Iturbi, who is never available, he begins to fall in love with another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly is now falling in love with Grayson. Anchors Aweigh is most often remembered for the combination of live action / cartoon with Tom and Jerry, but there is something else worth watching. I give him nine stars because, although he is not as good as the best musicals - Singin 'In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - he is one of the first in its class big Technicolor productions (perhaps Meet Me In St. Louis was the first) and better than most others.
