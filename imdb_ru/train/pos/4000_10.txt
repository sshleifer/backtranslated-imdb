Wow. Saw it last night, and I still can't figure out how good it was. Each character felt so real (although most of them are small, selfish ** holes), and the strange story — the middle-aged widow begins to fuck her daughter's helpless boyfriend — felt completely convincing. The best performances are from all sides, but they take off their hat to Anna Reid and our friends in the North, Daniel Craig (the latter looks like the next David Thewlis). <br /> <br /> And director Roger Michell? This is as far from Notting Hill as possible. Thank God. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie !!!
