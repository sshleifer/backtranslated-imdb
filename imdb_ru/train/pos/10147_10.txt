Does anyone know the exact quotation about George Ede's “time and love,” who is Father Fitzpatrick on the move? Was it supposed to be you? Did he talk to Charlie and Anna in church when they left? If not, then I will have to rent a movie. It was a great movie. I also loved Serendipity! Great love story for the soul! <br /> <br /> I met my only true love (my half), and although I had the experience to meet him when I least expected it, I was not ready for such an emotional relationship. <br /> <br /> Although we were married, I was not mature enough to give as much as I thought. I calmed down and took his love for granted, and he endured it for 7 years. <br /> <br /> He finally left with resentment, but we are still offended and angry and do not believe how everything turned out. I had some very hard lessons and we have been apart for three years. <br /> <br /> This film meant a lot, because I'm still waiting to come to terms with my one true love. NOW I can appreciate this special feeling inside of me, and Father Fitzpatrick’s quote sounds believable to me. <br /> <br /> I know that when he is healed enough to trust me again, we will marry again. <br /> br /> NEVER GET SWEET AND GET REAL LOVE FOR DATA! It was the hardest lesson of my life. <br /> <br /> Also the music in this film is OUTSTANDING and SIGNIFICANT! This film is DEEP and spiritually inspiring. REAL LOVE is worth it to wait for it, if it should be, it will, in spite of everything, THIS WILL BE! Nothing is impossible, even when it is the second time! Thank!
