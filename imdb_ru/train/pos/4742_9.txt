This film contains more action before the opening credits than in all Hollywood films of this kind. This film is produced by Tsui Hark and the stars Jet Li. This team has brought you many decent Hong Kong films, including the series Once Upon a Time in China. The action was quick and furious with amazing wire work. I only saw the wires in two frames. In addition to the action, the story itself was strong and not just used as a filler. To find any other action films that can compete with this, you should look for a Hong Kong cinema in your area. They really deserve attention and, as a rule, never disappoint.
