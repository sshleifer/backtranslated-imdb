In the 70s, Charlton Heston starred in science fiction films of various qualities. Soylent Green is one of the best. He plays Robert Thorn, a detective in 2022 in New York. In this future, most foods are so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green. But when Thorn learns the dubious truth about this product, he finds himself on the run. <br /> <br /> I think itâ€™s quite natural that this film will seem outdated to us. But even in this case, he still raises interesting questions about what will happen to our agriculture. Also starring Lee Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Joseph Cotten and Edward J. Robinson (in his last role).
