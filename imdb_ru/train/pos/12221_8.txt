This is a good job. Very sexy and interesting enough plot to support my interest. Its main drawback is that it seems that it was made for television: on the whole screen, and although there were several sex scenes, there was absolutely no nudity (but the boy brought it closer!). It is also strange that Netflix shows that it has been rated R. <br /> <br /> However, itâ€™s very interesting, and I would like Alicia Silverstone to make more similar films. <br /> <br /> One of the Netflix reviewers stated that this was part of a series, but I could not figure out what the series was. I would like to know, though, because this film was very good. <br /> <br /> Walt D in LV. 8/23/2005
