The next 4th channel has been magnificently preserved long before its time. Irresistible acting by Phil Davies and the rest of the cast. Sexy, clever and fun. I remember watching it at that time, and even then, asking no one heard about it. But trying to find someone who could remember is even more difficult. Perhaps Channel 4 is not doing a good enough job to gain the necessary enthusiasm. Either that or the general public is too interested in television vomiting, which is Big Brother. I suspect the latter. The Dark Place Download by Garth Meringue prompted Channel 4 to release a DVD of this series. Let's hope the same thing can happen to North Square.
