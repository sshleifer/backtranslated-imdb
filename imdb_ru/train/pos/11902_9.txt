This film tells about the life and times of William Castle. In the 1950s and 1960s, he made a series of low-cost horror films, which he sold with tricks. In "13 ghosts" you need spectators to see ghosts (they were in color, the film was b / w). The "Tingler" were theater seats, equipped with a buzzer, which shook the audience when the monster runs into the cinema. Marabre issues a life insurance policy to all participants in case they are scared to death! The films themselves were pretty bad, but the tricks made people rush to watch them. This document contains interviews with directors inspired by Castle, the actors of his films and his daughter. It also affects his family life and the kind of person he was (by all accounts he was a great guy). The documentary is affectionate, very funny and absolutely exciting. It is very short (up to 90 minutes) and never boring. Be sure to look for Castle fans and horror movies fans. My only complaint was that there were very few episodes shown in his photos. This aside, it's just great.
