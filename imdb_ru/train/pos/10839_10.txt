I saw this movie in a video store a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I enjoyed it, so we bought VHS and since then we enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The plot was well discussed, so there is no need to repeat it again. The fact is that this film deserves repeated viewing. Americans, especially, are not going to joke the first time. I know not. <br /> <br /> This film is funny, touching, sad - all at the same time. When Ray offers a toast at his daughter's wedding, it causes horror. When Karen calls Tony "Brian" when he tries to kiss her, it's heartbreaking. When Beano is finally cornered by a woman in black, it is too funny for words. <br /> <br /> And the music: it's as good as any movie soundtrack I've heard over the years. I danced in the living room to "Around the World." <br /> <br /> Every performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Nyei was rightly praised for portraying Ray, a man who had too many failed trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, an attractive keyboard player who has been carrying a torch for Karen all these years. He has an attractive hangman look that makes women hug him. But all the actors are equally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to the panoramas that you read about this film, and watch it. This is a gem.
