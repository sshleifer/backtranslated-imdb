Meatball Machine is an amazing movie with splashes, in which there is an original story with young love, buckets of blood and strange alien creatures that turn people into fancy robot-fighting machines. <br /> <br /> Now this film is not for everyone. people who love splash movies or Tetsuo: Iron Man will applaud. <br /> <br /> In some places in a movie, special effects can be fun, but you donâ€™t quite think that you take the film very seriously. . <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, in general, it is very fun, good if you find promising romantics, mucous with a mucous tumor, similar to cobblestones, who seek to destroy each other in bloody battles with aliens.
