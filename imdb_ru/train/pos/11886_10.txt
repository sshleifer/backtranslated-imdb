I like this movie. First, because it is a family movie. Secondly, because it offers a refreshing look at the news about HIV in the family, with far less hysteria than what I used to see in movies. The brothers are very close, but not condemned. Their desire to protect their younger brother nobly, but in the end is not necessary. I understand that Leoâ€™s choice about how to deal with him might not have been the most popular among people, but I thought it was the right choice for him. I can not believe that it was a French television program. It had great production values. I gave this movie ten, and I think you too, as soon as you saw it.
