I was a fan of Pushing Daisies from the start. This is well thought out, and Brian Fuller has the most wonderful ideas for this show. <br /> <br /> It’s incredible how much television needed a creative, original show, such as Pushing Daisies. It’s great to see a show that doesn’t look like the others, because if you compared it with some newer shows, such as Scrubs and House, you would see similarities, and it becomes tedious when you see TV shows similar in nature. <br /> <br /> In each episode, with a great cast, a great script and cheerfulness, “Pushing Daisies” is one of the most wonderful shows on your television.
