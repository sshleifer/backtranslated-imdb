I saw this movie on TV late in the evening many years ago, but it was a disturbing experience that has stayed with me to this day. <br /> <br /> The premise may seem a bit non-original - due to an earthquake, a hidden underground reserve of a toxic nerve agent in the hills above a small town is broken, and a microscopic amount of the substance enters their food stores. Residents of the city are beginning to lose their ability to show restraint in relation to any whims and vile desires that occasionally permeate all our minds, and that, as we usually know, we simply should not act. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is slow, but for me it only aggravates the creeping anxiety, as the behavior of the citizens slowly begins to disintegrate. There are several surreal and very disturbing scenes that have been captured in my memory all this time. <br /> <br /> This raises interesting questions about what we could all be able to do if we could succumb to our wildest instincts. I like it? I'm not sure “enjoy” is the right word. Did it make me think? Definitely. I still think about it. Scary things.
