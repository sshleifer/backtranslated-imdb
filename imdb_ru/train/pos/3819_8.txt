I waited a long time to watch this film, and, finally, I managed to see it at the Istanbul Film Festival. Perhaps because I was expecting too much from this film, and therefore I was a little disappointed. I was not the best film from Korea, but still itâ€™s really worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The plot was enjoyable, and the film makes you look, not bored, although long. But there are gaps in the film, and you move from one point to another. Nevertheless, the acting game Jeon Do-Yeon is incredibly beautiful. It was one of the best performances in the early history of cinema, and I think that this film would not be so good if it were not in the lead role.
