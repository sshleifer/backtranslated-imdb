Tough, shockingly smart work from the talented British writer Hanif Kureishi, who wrote “My beautiful laundry” (this is the best thing he has done since then). We are talking about smart people whose life means little. They squandered what they were given, and mostly empty vessels. The only character on the screen who is alive is the mother of the leading role, but she feels dead inside, until the rude master shows some affection for her and wakes her up to the joys of sex. He has his own motives, but Kureishi treats him with great compassion. This is a movie in which people and places feel familiar, where characters exist outside the screen. In a sense, it looks like Sunday, Bloody Sunday, but this is quite a difficult job. Directed by Roger Michell allows you to instinctively build scenes. And it is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Like her mother of the same name, Ann Reed betrays her lost life in every gesture. In her unusually live performance, there is no false note, and this very good actor Daniel Craig shows shades to his character, which even Kureishi did not take advantage of. If a fake note sounds in the film, it is probably in the character of a mediocre daughter who turned out to be in a dirty affair with a man seduced by her mother (or it should be the other way around), and even in a dirty life, but she is so well-played that she still hooked you. The film is also extremely beautiful to watch (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and should without hesitation be considered the best British film of the year.
