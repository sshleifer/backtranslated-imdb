I'm too old to know for sure (or worry) what the difference between rap and hip-hop is. And being a Canadian, it’s likely that I’ve never seen MTV, but I’m not sure. <br /> <br /> But I thought that this film was very funny when I saw it, a bright little satyr. Nowadays, hip-hop culture is so common that it’s hard not to hear about it again and again. (If we could say the same about the bagpipe music.) I got the most pranks (at least I think I did). Undoubtedly, this comes from Spinal Tap, but there are many goals that can sustain the Tap procedure. Only not carpenters, they are sacred.
