“Life hits us in the face ........ we should try to stay beautiful” <br /> <br /> Debut film of one of the best Belgian performers (he sings songs) Tom Barman. The long-awaited film and - happy, happy, joyful joy for the Flemish film industry - really worth seeing, and promising work! It takes us in the life of 8 main characters, who live on Friday - and night. The name says a lot about how we spend time with them: we are going to a party on Friday night, where they seem to “meet”. <br /> <br /> This is a rhythmic style, very “thoughtful”. Excellent use of music. It sometimes takes over pictures, and then you feel its power. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! The party scene (20 minutes ???) is an exciting visual reason for how it was filmed. He really holds you in his hands while he is in a small place where many people have a big party ..... it's so hard to shoot. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Meniere Barman, for making this bold film of these, for several years now, the bad times of the Flemish film industry. You made my day!
