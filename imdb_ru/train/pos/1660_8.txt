I am a fan of art, I like something about art, I like paintings, sculptures, etc. This film shows it, so I really like it, it shows how a woman wants to draw something about art, especially nude bodies, but she cannot do it because of her strict family (father), at the beginning of the film she painted herself naked, but she wanted a man for her pictures, but her family did not allow her to paint naked men because it was against morality. However, Artemisia could paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked. She falls in love with her art teacher, and it seems that the art teacher is also absolutely in love with her, so at the end he sacrifices his freedom for his lies. He said he raped her, but that was not true. Artemisia fell in love with him, but if she says that she will suffer a lot, because during the trial in which Artemisia participated, her father and art teacher, someone harmed her, trying to tell the truth. I think this is a great movie about art and artistic love, worth seeing. Valentina Worms is great in the role of Artemisia, she plays very well, I also like her performance in “The Portrait of a Woman” in the role of Pansy Osmond. 8.5 / 10
