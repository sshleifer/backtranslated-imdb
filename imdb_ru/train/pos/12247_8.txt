I really liked this version of Emma. Kate Beckinsale was great, like Emma, ​​and Mark the Strong was very good as a knight. the only complaint I had was on Mr. Woodhouse ... I can't believe that a man could whine so much or be so selfish in his daughter's life ... although in the end she was a smart girl. As always, I like the places where these Jane Austen films were made. The settings are so impressive. it makes me want to go to England, as well as to Ireland and Scotland), I think the actors chosen for this film were also a good choice, and all the other story lines intertwined with Emma perfectly! I'm glad I managed to see that too.
