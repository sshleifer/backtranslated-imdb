An old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat. He wanders through the woods to witness a murder, but has he seen the murder or is he going crazy? Is he just aging? The film is so good because the viewer must decide what is going on. There are very few dialogues in this film, but he doesn’t need words; the whole film speaks for itself. You knew what was going on, and I liked it. <br /> <br /> Another part I liked was shooting the forest in late autumn and winter. It was beautiful, but the only thing I didn’t like was the old man’s look in his underwear. He could tie the clothes a little tighter, but other than that, it was a pretty deep film.
