The clever script of the late Sebastian Japrisot and the intelligent performances of the two main characters - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or vice versa) lead to an exciting and exciting thriller. <br /> <br /> Add to the above competent guide from veteran GINA HERMAN and a rare but effective assessment by FRANKOUS DE RUBUX, it becomes easy, why this film has a strange timeless quality. <br /> <br /> This is a friend or a friendly story with two loners, disappointed and tired of the whole world, returning, presumably, from Algeria. Like other colonial powers of this time (after the Second World War, leading to the 1960s), France struggled to maintain visibility abroad. The loss of Algeria was a heavy blow. <br /> <br /> ADIEU L'AMI (original title) chronicles the actions of our two (anti) heroes, when they struggle to cope with it, after their dismissal. <Br /> <br /> One thing happens after another, and the viewer should really pay attention, because JAPRISOT with its script is poor and economical: if there is one, then there must be a reason. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that these two people fight physically and psychologically on one long weekend. Their motivation is completely different, their goals are different - their survival is completely dependent on each other. The fact that ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are outwardly so different - the first, possibly cute boy, and the second ugly gangster, adds chemistry. <br /> <br /> This quest makes a great story, which, in turn, makes for a great movie. <br /> <br /> So that I do not forget that there are women in this film, and, faithful to the method of Japrizo, they are also remembered, although not as much as they are. to say much more is to spoil the pleasure of revealing their true nature. <br /> <br /> FAREWELL, FRIEND, RELEASED IN GREAT BRITAIN; ANAMORPHIC IMAGE, 16.9 IMPROVED; ONLY in English (even subtitles for the hearing impaired); TIME OF WORK 110 MINUTES; MONO SOUNDTRACK, but there is a lot of push in DE ROUBAIX music! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
