La Teta i la Luna (Chest and Moon) describes the life of a 9-10 year old boy named Tete, who is obsessed with a chest growing in Catalonia. I like this film because the characters are very honest and very humane, like all the characters in Bigas Moon films (also directed by Jamon, Jamon). Aunt reminded me of how interesting and exciting life can be at this age. Also, being from Catalonia (northeastern Spain), I remembered a lot of memories. This film shows how beautiful the Catalans are, good people, good life and especially a lot of imprudent people.
