Watching before the Devil is considered one of my best movie experiences. I was intrigued by my mixed response to the film - and for me the extremes of opinion indicate that the film touched on something either approved or disavowed by a wide audience. This is one of those films that have stayed with me, and I keep thinking and thinking about it. <br /> <br /> Of course, some more themes and elements of film making will be covered on the DVD? These include: the return of the film by Sidney Lumet, the time shift technique used in storytelling, the excellent combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works so well, a virtuoso guide, a relatively rare trick that Hollywood films give to male characters and they are largely doomed. Itâ€™s not enough to present an open checkbook for their women, but, nevertheless, a resonant performance by Marisa Tomei and, of course, an excellent Hoffman with this central monologue about his roles - for me the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> Phew! Of course, a master film. So imagine my disappointment when I watch the expected DVD - just to find no comments, no backstage events, no interviews, no additions. <br /> <br /> Hey, distributors, figure it out!
