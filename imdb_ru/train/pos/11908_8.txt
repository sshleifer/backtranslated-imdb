This film plays very well with the audience. Especially after the chase begins. Plus, Trevor Howard with his intelligent, intelligent spells and Gene Simmons with her innocent behavior and piercing eyes are amazing together. <br /> <br /> The film begins as a psychological drama, but after the murder it turns into a thriller of the persecution as the two lead to the border. Some might think that the chase is unnecessary, but in fact the chase is necessary because it helps to clear the characterâ€™s character, Gene Simmons, by pulling her out of a despotic house, plus it helps to reveal the real killer who was suddenly put in such a position that finish the job. The killer rightly believed that as soon as Simmons's character was arrested, she would be removed. And it is true that her lack of control in the household - as well as the evidence pointing to her - there is no way she could get rid of the murder charge. The subsequent chase helps uncover the truth. <br /> <br /> This is an entertaining movie. Search if you can find.
