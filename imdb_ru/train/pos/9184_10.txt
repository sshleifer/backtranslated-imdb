Yes, this performance is long (good news for Bronte fans!), And it is somewhat outdated, but both the actors and the actors are so great that you don’t want to watch other versions! <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton - this is Edward Rochester ... it's that simple. I don't care that other reviewers claim that he is too handsome. Dalton, of course, is attractive, but not handsome. In fact, he has a rocky, angular, dark charm, which, in my opinion, is fully consistent with the mysterious, very masculine Mr. R. And he with such acuity perceives the sad, haggard personality of Rochester. He portrays ferocity when the scene demands it, but also shows the tender, passionate, emotional side of Rochester. (IMO, the new A & E production suffers from the fact that Kiran Hinds - whom I usually adore - seems to be cursing and intimidating his way everywhere. I read the book many times, and I never felt that Rochester should have been perceived as nonstop roaring beast.) <br /> <br /> When I reread a novel, I always see Zelu Clark in the role of Jane. Miss Clark, for me, looks like Jane because she describes herself (and is described by others). Little, childish, fairy ... although it is true that the actress does not look 18 years old, she portrays Jane's qualities so well. While other reviews claimed that her game was wooden or unemotional, you need to remember that the character spent 8 years in Lovewood, learning to restrain her emotions and “passionate nature”. Her main inspiration was her childhood friend Elena, who was a picture of humble submission. Although her true nature was different, Jane learned to cope with her character and to show obedience, in accordance with the goals of the school for her charity students who would go into "service." Jane becomes a governess in the house of rich Mr. Rochester. She, of course, would * not * speak to him as an equal. Even later, when she gave as well as received, she will always remember that her position is much lower than that of her employer. However, if you read the book to which this production remains surprisingly close, you can clearly see how Sella-like-Jane is going through a little struggle when she suppresses her emotions in order to remain soft and balanced. <br /> <br I think the chemistry between Dalton and Clark is just right. No, this is not at all like Hollywood (thank God! This is not a Hollywood book), but their novel is true, faithful and loyal. And for a woman like Jane, who never imagined that * any * love would appear on her path, this is a small miracle. <br /> <br /> The rest of the casting is awesome, and I like the fact that almost every character in the book is here. The same applies to the rich poetic dialogue. This version is the only one I know about, which includes the beautiful, shameful “gypsy scene” and, in general, contains more humor than the other versions I have seen. In particular, mutual teasing between the leading characters comes straight from the book and is so adorable! <br /> <br /> In many ways, Jane Eyre was one of the first romanized feminists. She finally accepted love on her own terms and independently, and finally, as a true equal to Rochester. Just great!
