I had no problems with the film, which seemed to me quite good. This is the actual LAPD crime scene video that bothered me. I wonder if it was REALLY thought that Lion's Gate thinks that viewers who want to see everyone will want to see people who have been beaten to death and blood all over. Sorry Lion's Gate, it was an INCREDIBLE BAD IDEA !!! <br /> <br /> Returning to the film: the cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer, like the late John Holmes. John Holmes was a scoundrel, mistreated women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his friend), and he is hopelessly addicted to drugs. His relationship with Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosyan) creates a spiral that led to the notorious killings in Wonderland. How exactly was Holmes involved in the killings? We may never know the whole truth of this story (Nash is still alive and free), but the film, however, does a good job.
