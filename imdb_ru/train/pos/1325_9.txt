I saw this film at the Adelaide Film Festival '07 and was completely intrigued for 106 minutes. I like documentaries, but I often find them protracted in 25 minutes. However, the "Forbidden Lie" is included, without losing my interest. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is Jordanian woman Norma Khoury, who gained fame and fortune in 2001 thanks to the publication of her book Forbidden Love, a biographical story about something like her Muslim friend who was murdered by her family for a relationship with a Christian. A few years later, however, several journalists began to punch holes in history, forcing the public to believe that this was a fraud. At first, the film talks about it quickly, but carefully, and from there we spend most of our time in Norma’s company when she tries to convince us that her novel is more than fiction. <br /> <br /> Directed by Anna Brunowski found a truly fascinating woman to study, and she conducts endless interviews with Khuri when she is looking for the truth. As always in life, the truth is not so easy to find. Norma fears for her life, experiencing a violent reaction about the dubious portrait of her novel, written by Jordanian Muslims. She refuses to return to Jordan and show us the facts. Broynovsky, however, does not hold back and slowly collects pieces in front of us. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredible look of a fraudster. Naturally, what we find there does not make any sense, and it is extremely difficult to follow him, and ultimately we do not know whether to believe Norma or not. She is either a rather unfairly dressed woman trying to survive, or a fantastic maiden. The web of lies, truth, and half-truths that she twists in the film is brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film uses a lot of interviews and drama to tell its story, and Broynovsky uses these dramas to show us why people like Norma can exist: we want to be deceived. We go to the cinema every day and allow ourselves to believe in what is happening on the screen. Maybe I just read too much, it didn’t pop up in Brionovsky in Questions and Answers after the film, but this is what I took from him. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent Australian film, and should receive an international release, as well as an award if you ask me. Of course, the best movie I've ever seen on AFF07. <br /> <br /> See it if there is a chance.
