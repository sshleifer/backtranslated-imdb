The poor quality of the DVD video is the only reason I gave this movie 9 instead of 10. It could be much better, this film deserves it. <br /> <br /> This is really a film that covers several topics at once. If you don’t like movies about serial killers, but you are fascinated by the amazing bureaucratic culture in the former Soviet Union, this movie is definitely a must-see. <br /> <br /> I can't compare it with “Silence”. lambs ”for several reasons. The way the serial killer is portrayed has been done much better in Citizen X. You see some details of his personal life, because you “travel” with the killer, which gives you some idea of ​​the source of his constant anger and sexual disorder. <br /> <br /> The only other film that I saw, as realistic as this one, was “Henry - a portrait of a serial killer”. If you were fascinated by this movie, you definitely need to take a look at Citizen X.
