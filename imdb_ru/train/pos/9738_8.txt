Oh, dear, we don't like it when our love interest for a superhero develops the brain, isn't it? <br /> <br /> Something happened to people, they lost the ability to enjoy, just feel good, love history / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real. I laughed out loud at least five times, and I'm not ashamed to say that I, too, had tears in my eyes a couple of times. The cast, acting and script are great, I watch a lot of films in all directions, and I have not seen one in this genre that would be so successful. Those who disagree, please tell me where I can find some! I am sure that the book is also good, but I think that you should judge it on the merits.
