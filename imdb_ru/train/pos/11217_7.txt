Being an otaku since Robotech, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite anime of all time. Considering when this was done, the animation is top notch. There are no loops and sequences in which art deteriorates in quality. Although the last episode is in black and white, it does not detract from the pleasure of watching the movie. Although it has been described as “juicy,” it should be remembered that women do not react in the same way as men. Since the main character is a woman, it should be obvious that she does not have to resort to the macho tactic to win the respect of her peers. Incidentally, Akane in Ranma 1/2 also plays saira for Noriko. Noriko is a 3-dimensional cartoon; her personality reflects the essence of an energetic girl who at first seems completely helpless, but ultimately succeeds thanks to the strength of her will. The only complaint I have is that the fur looked like teddy bears. Even in Gunbuster, the rather dubious technique of “Homing Laser” and “Buster Shield” is used (which is nothing more than the fact that the machine reels around itself a giant velvet cloak in true Dracula style). I doubt that this scene was supposed to be funny, but it infuriated me. However, I would put Gunbuster in the top 20 anime of all time.
