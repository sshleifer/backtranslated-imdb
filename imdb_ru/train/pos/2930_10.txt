The film is cracking from the very beginning, Eddie seems to simply bring this uniqueness to the scene and makes the simplest fun - from ice cream in childhood to a long-standing old family tradition. The film is very rare in this country, but I am not sure about its availability in other countries. I searched a lot of websites, but I was not lucky, I called companies looking for rare videos, and there are one-year waiting lists for him. THESE TIPS ARE VERY GOOD TO WELCOME. If someone likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and he sees that the video will get it, it's worth it and can't go wrong.
