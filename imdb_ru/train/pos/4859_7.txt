I read that Jesse Matthews was approached and refused to act with Fred Astaire in the film “The Girl in Distress”. Jesse Matthews, in her prime, never left her side of the pond to make any American musical films. If they were united for this film, it would be a once in a lifetime event. <br /> <br /> Sorry, because Damsel in Distress makes everything else go for it. Fred Aster, short story and screen author by PG Woodhouse, Burns and Allen for the comedy and song of the Gershwin brothers. In response to the question posed by “Good work, if you can get it,” you could not ask for more about this film. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the leading lady. Although Ginger Rogers made several films from Fred Astaire, Damsel in Distress is the only movie made by Astaire without Roger when they were a team. Young Joan Fontaine was filmed in this opposite Aster. <br /> <br /> Her character has nothing to do with the roles of Ginger Rogers in these films. All she basically has to do is behave nicely and modestly. She also brings nothing musical. And if I had to evaluate all of Fred Astaire’s dance partners, Joan Fontaine would come out below. The poor woman is simply terrible in the number of things. <br /> <br /> When she later starred in the musical Imperial Waltz with Bing Crosby, it was not by chance that Fontaine was not given anything musical. <br /> <br /> I have a version that is colorized, and in this case I think it really has benefited. Idyllic lush green English countryside P.G. Woodhouse is indeed represented in this copy of VHS. Especially including the one I mentioned earlier with Aster and Fontaine, which takes place in the garden. <br /> <br /> Burns and Allen, on the other hand, like a pair of old Vaudeville soldiers, complement Aster with a magnificent style in Stiff Upper Lip, a surreal entertainment sequence surprisingly organized. <br /> <br /> P.G. Woodhouse's aristocracy defeated Constance Collier in its most arrogant and this time Montague Love, like Fontaine's father, like a good man in the film. <br /> <br /> The greatest success of the maiden in distress is a foggy day the most famous song about the British capital since the time of the London bridge falls. It is written by Fred Astaire in the most simple and elegant manner. This is one of those songs that will exist as long as London lives and even after. <br /> <br /> Overlooking the young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine, the girl in distress, is assessed as a classic, classical score, classical dances, classical comedy. Who could ask for more?
