This second Burlesk Kid is short to be released, and probably one of the most popular, is the 1926 silent film parody of Whats The Price Glory. <br /> <br /> I watched this, and I do not understand the kiddie-porn it is stated. This is just a cute little movie. I saw family shows that I grew up watching in the 80s and 90s, when little girls dressed more defiantly, acting in a “mature manner”. It was more provocative because they weren't wearing diapers. In the diaper there is nothing provocative, if you do not have one of these fetishes. (just a joke) I read this description of the film where it says that only a pedophile would like to watch it. It hurts. For me, if you watch it and worry about it, then perhaps you need to examine your psyche and try to figure out why it bothers you. This is an innocent movie that was made as a parody of another movie. All films B. were parodies, nothing more. Parodies / practical jokes today are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and rather vile language. Shouldn't that be worse? I can watch them without problems, but they sometimes take children's stories and turn them into mud in these parodies. This is what should get under your skin. Not that they are babified (not a word, I know) adult cinema since 1926, because we know how pornographic these silent films were, yes? Not to mention those "Forbidden Hollywood films of the pre-coding era", so vile and dirty. Would they NEVER make such an abomination today? (pay attention to sarcasm)
