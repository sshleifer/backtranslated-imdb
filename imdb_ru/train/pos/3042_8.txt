The film moved everyone back to October 20, 1944, where we seemed to be part of the great Philippine landing scene "I'll be back." It was on the other side of Leyte, where General MacArthur got his fame ?? <br /> <br /> First of all, did Grigory Peck win his image of the great general ?? Is it a step, a set of shoulders, an intensity ?? Is this what unites both: intensity, total absorption, devotion ?? With MacArthur it was for the military ?? With Peck, was it for acting? Winner of the Oscar for Kill a Mockingbird, nominee for the Oscar for Keys of the Kingdom, One Year Old, Gentleman's Agreement and Twelve Hours - he played everything from killing amnesia to a crusader journalist from the problem shooter to the obsessed lawyer; from biblical David to captain Horatio Hornblower ?? He brought them all his unique understanding, his character, his sincerity, warmth and love, and especially his humor ?? <br /> <br /> There is a scene where the "MacArthur" stands on the deck with the "President of the Philippines." We hear the dialogue: “General, I hope that the water is not too deep,” says the “president”, “because my people will find out that I do not know how to swim.” Then Peck’s clear voice will be heard: “And my people will find that I cannot walk on water!” <br /> <br /> Like “MacArthur”, did Peck once again justify his reputation as a giant in the film industry ?? Through him, we felt MacArthur's emotions: did we know his anger, his happiness, and understand the relationship with his whole family ??
