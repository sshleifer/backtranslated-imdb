Now this is what I would call a good horror. This pleasant low budget French film with occult / supernatural hues drew my attention from the very first scene. This proves that you do not need a wild FX or a lot of blood to make an effective horror movie. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around 4 inmates in prison, and each of these characters (and their motives) gradually becomes more interesting as the film creates tension to the final. Most of the action we see through the eyes of Carrera, who has just entered the prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other prisoners. <br /> <br /> I wonâ€™t talk much, because this film really deserves to be seen more widely. Although there are several drawbacks: FX is not so good, but they are used effectively; the plot leaves some riddles open; and everything becomes very confusing by the end, but Malefic is buying himself back by the time he is finished. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good movie, 8/10
