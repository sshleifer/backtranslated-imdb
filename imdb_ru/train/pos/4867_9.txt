Do not pay attention to the plot and enjoy the way Fred Aster performs “Foggy Day” and several other dances, one of which is a duet with the unfortunate Joan Fontaine. Here we see that Aster is doing what is essentially “stage” dance in a more pure form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he learned how to fully exploit the potential of the film. Best of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their husband and wife radio and television comedy, we perform the dance that they must have done in vaudeville, and they had no chance to play first-class films college of the 30s, (George was once a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred - the main points of the film, and they are worth the wait. The first trio of soft shoes is a warm-up for the exciting carnival number "Chin up", in which three of them sing and dance in amusement rides and other attractions. It almost seems spontaneous. A fan of Fred Astaire and Burns and Allen will find this standing under the “plot.” I saw it 4 or 5 times, and the fast forward button is useful.
