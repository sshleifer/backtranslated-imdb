Okay, so the Oscars seem to swell a little more each year. And I rooted for Gosford Park to win (come on, Robert Altman deserves an Oscar for many years now!). However, I think the time has come for an African American to win the best actress. Unlike the previous reviewer, the role of Halle Berry in Monster's Ball was much more original than the role of Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge; I would never have thought to nominate the latter for anything, especially in the year when he saw "Dr. Mulholland." <br /> <br /> Among the things I predicted were materials about the attacks of September 11; I knew they were going to say something about freedom. Sure sure. Robert Redford should know better. But contrary to the previous reviewer, Whoopi Goldberg is not the worst boss (among past owners was Bob Hope, to whom I have no respect); I really liked her punch at John Ashcroft. <br /> <br /> So, although I wouldn’t give the best picture “Beautiful Mind”, the 74th Annual Academy Award still pleased me (I have to admit, I enjoy Oscar more than my own birthday). And the next day, when my parents and I walked around the dwellings in Bandalera, New Mexico — it was spring break — I thought to myself that when Jim Broadbent received his Oscar, most people who watched asked : “Jim, who ?! "I wonder if Woody Allen will ever visit Oscar again?"
