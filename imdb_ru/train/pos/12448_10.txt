First of all; I am a devoted fan of Modesty, and I’ve been reading comics since childhood, and I found earlier films about our heroine unsatisfactory, but where they fail, this is rock! <br /> <br /> Well, let's go: Ms. Blaise works in a casino, a gang of robbers arrives, and she starts playing for the money of her friends. If the robber wins one round, she will have to tell him about herself. If she wins twice in a row, one of the employees goes free. (It sounds silly, yes, well, I also do not explain very well ..);) <br /> <br /> She tells him about how she grew up in a war zone, without parents or friends, about how she helps the old man in the refugee camp and how they escape, living by their own rules of nature. They hunt for food, and he teaches her to read and fight. As they get closer to civilization, they become embroiled in a war, and when they are taken for insurrection, they are shot at and the old man dies, which is why she meets the city herself. <br /> <br /> Then she meets the person in whose casino she currently works, and this is where the story ends. <br /> <br /> What should be done is that there is a terrific fight there, and the lines are absolutely awesome. Alexandra Staden - terrible modesty, Blaze! The same modest and strong, graceful and intelligent as comics. <br /> <br /> Although he feels awkward and hears Modesty speaking with a slightly broken accent, but this is not relevant, as comics cannot speak out loud, but certainly should have a slightly existing accent (Not to mention that it’s strange in the Balkans that everyone speaks English.) <br /> <br /> The game is really good, even the child who personifies young Blaise should applaud! <br /> <br /> My favorite part should be where she tears her dress to kick ass to the stupid burglar! Just amazing! : D I can't wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie! <br /> <br /> Look it up, you will not be disappointed!
