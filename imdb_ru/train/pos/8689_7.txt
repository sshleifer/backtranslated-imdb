The perfect cast for drama for several people. Simon is dead, but somehow he is resurrected outside. What he saw there is presented in the form of empty spots, organized under the magnificent score of German avant-garde composer Werner Henze. Simone is haunted by his death, comforted by the support of the people he saw on the other side. His girlfriend is trying to keep him alive, but is unable to, decides to follow him after his finally death. Very touchy and touching, deeply psychological, but a little slow and somewhere even boring.
