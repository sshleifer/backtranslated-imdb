This series adds new information and reference information to the book and includes personal appearances of the author and archaeologists and other anthropologists. It enlivens the book and makes it even more understandable the subsequent collapse of the author "Collapse." <br /> <br /> Diamond himself looks like a personable and caring, and not just a disinterested or upset scientist. This series explains that his book was not just an answer to the need to “publish or perish,” as the academy says, but a deeply thoughtful answer to the question of someone he respects: “Why did you white people get it? a lot of cargo, and we have so little? Because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community, Diamond was looking for an answer that would not offend this intelligence or this community. I like to think of his answer very simply, in the same spirit as South Park, Blame Canada: Blame Wheat!
