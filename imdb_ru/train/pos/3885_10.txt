For the first time I was introduced to “Eddie” by friends from the “through pond” who know that I like intellectual humor. I prefer comedians that can be thought provoking, such as George Carlin and Dennis Miller. In Dress Up to Kill, Eddie provides the same type of social observation humor that stimulates your thoughts about the subject, while at the same time causing your side to split at the same time. There is a wide range of subjects in this standoff, and they are just hysterical. The piece on how to choose Engbert's stage name will leave you in a quandary! <br /> <br /> Thank you, Andrew and Catherine! ... and "Do you have a flag?"
