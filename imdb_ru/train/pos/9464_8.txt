Family widower Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes “Dan in Real Life” column, which gives advice to families in the New Jersey Standard, and raises his three daughters. Jane (Allison Pill), the eldest, has just received a driver's license, but Dan does not allow her to drive; Kara (Brittany Robertson) is in love with her school friend Marty; and young Lily (Marlene Lowstone) misses her mother. When Dan and his daughters go to Rhode Island for family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) at a bookstore, and they talk for hours with each other. They feel attracted to each other, but Marie gets a phone call and leaves Dan, first giving her phone number. Dan immediately falls in love with Marie, but when he returns to his parents' home, he discovers that Marie is the friend of his wolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. On weekends, between the awkward Dan and Maria, the attractiveness increases, and they have to make a decision. <br /> <br /> “Dan in real life” is a great surprise and a delightful film with comedy, romance and drama. The chemistry of gorgeous Juliette Binoche and Steve Carella is awesome, and it's very easy to understand why everyone loves Marie. The trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lowston are fantastic, and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments of this story. The script is wonderful, and the performances of talented actors and actresses are amazing, with realistic behavior of a family meeting. Follow Dan’s column advice and plan on wondering about the family reunion of the Burns family.
