Usually it was the advice of producer Alexander Korda about filming for many of his subordinates; Three directors are involved in the film, but in truth Alex, Zoltan Korda and William Cameron Menzies helped bring the film to six. <br /> <br /> For the 1987 book of John Cobal, “The 100 Best Films”, his review of 81 film critics saw that Thief of Baghdad reached 55th place. Upon closer examination, it turns out that only Jose Louis Guarner, John Russell Taylor and Cobal himself actually voted for the picture, but their high places were enough to bring it closer to the middle. <br /> <br /> Flash The Second World War saw film production move around England and America, eventually seeing the end in 1940 and receiving three technical Oscars. Like Citizen Kane, this is in a sense a film that you could love, not love. <br /> <br /> Special effects, outstanding at that time, are still reasonable and actually persist if you are squinting. But the point is not so much in their effectiveness as in the courage of inventions. Among them is a funny horse, built from a set model, which, when the key is inserted into its back, begins to fly. There is also the murderous toy of the six-handed goddess Kali (perhaps it’s obvious that a single woman with two women is sitting behind her) and a rather awful looking giant spider. Also impressive is the climax with its beautiful flying carpet. But the most memorable is to be Rex Ingram, who looks like a genie (genie) almost a thousand feet tall in an excellent moment of cinematic vanity! Ingram depicts a gin as a rather formidable creature and adds an element of danger to the process. And beware of the moment when he was deceived back into his bottle! <br /> <br /> John Justin copes well with the role of the Arab king, who for some strange reason has an English accent and a hard upper lip. Sabu, a wonderfully muscular 15-year-old, almost Abu's namesake, perhaps a daring thief. After they cross paths with the evil Jaffer (Konrad Wade), Justin is blind, and Abu turns into a dog. When it seems that the rest of the film will be told in retrospect through the gaze of blind Ahmed (Justin), we find that halfway through the film we catch up with the present, and the adventure continues. In truth, the second half is better in some way, it is full of a bigger incident and more fantastic in nature. <br /> <br /> Three small songs cross the play, although since the film lasts 100 minutes, it looks like a soft flavor, and not a real ingredient; I would not classify it as a musical. It's all very fun; Justin and June Duprez is a love interest for moms and dads, Weidt is a villain-chic, and Abu is a young, irrepressible robber. It may take some time to get into the somewhat outdated thinking and bloated melodrama of English films from the 40s, but as soon as you sit through the first half hour or so, this film will really attract you. Very commendable.
