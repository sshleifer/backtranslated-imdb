This is evidence of Gosha’s incredible mastery in creating the film, which he was able to complete both Hitokiri and his amazing masterpiece Goyokin in the same 1969 year. And this is evidence of how criminally undervalued it remains for the general public (compared to the media so expensive as the great Akira Kurosawa) that both Hitokiri and Goyokin received less than 500 votes between them. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu is Okada Izo: the killer of rabid dogs, the Tosh clan loyalty and their boss Takechi, played by another sturdy genre, Tatsuya Nakadai. Clan Tosh was part of a larger alliance that supported the Emperor against the oscillating Shogunate. The historical background is fairly accurate — with growing political turmoil in Japan between the imperialists and Tokugawa and pressure from the West to end the 300-year social and political isolation. It really helps to learn something about Japanese history and what ultimately led to the restoration of the Meiji and the abolition of the Tokugawa Shogunate, but this is not important. The film was made mainly for the Japanese audience, so some things are taken for granted, but it is very well suited for the uninitiated. <br /> <br /> As was to be expected from the Hideo Goshi film in its golden years (late 60s), the visual palette is breathtaking, the use of external and internal symbolism lies behind the picturesque beauty. Style, however, is never decorative for Gosha - it is always used to serve history. <br /> <br /> Speaking of history, the tortured protagonist Of Okada literally and figuratively dominates in Khitokiri Like most of the main characters of Chambara, Iso finds himself in moral double-bonding, torn between weights (commitment) and ninja (natural motivation) - although it takes time to realize what its weights are. In the first half of the film, Iso tries to achieve social self-improvement. High aspirations for social title and marriage with the daughter of an aristocrat are great progress for a person from a farmer’s past in the 19th century Japan’s tough social caste system. <br /> <br /> The turning point for Izo is when he realizes the price for self-improvement, the loss of his personality and, as a result, the loss of himself. It is at this moment that he undergoes a very symbolic transformation of the famous swordsman of the Tosh clan into a “nameless” vagabond without the past or future of Torazo the Vagabond. Although not technically nameless and not drifting in the genre in the Yojimbo sample, it is precisely the loss of his former self and the expulsion of ego, ambition and dedication that allow Izo to see things as they really are and to redeem themselves. <br /> <br /> Hitokiri ends (which I will not tell here) in the best way than any story: both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that makes Izo laugh at last, the last sardonic comment in the face of death.
