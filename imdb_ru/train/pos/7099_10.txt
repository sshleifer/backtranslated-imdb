Terry Gilliam’s fantastic, distorted story about a virus that destroys everyone except a handful of people all over the Earth, and forces them to go underground, and the man sent back in time to gather information about him is a fantastic, dizzying and highly stylized film that boasts bruce. The best result of Willis in the history. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes 12 Monkeys from most science fiction films about time travel is that the character of Bruce Willis actually deals with the psychological effect of time travel, that is, ignorance of what reality is reality: the place from which the time traveler comes or goes. In addition, the film recognizes that the past cannot be changed and that the prevention of a catastrophic event, in this case, the release of a specified virus, cannot be stopped or changed. As Willis says: “This has already happened,” while he is in a mental hospital, the main dilemma the film faces is not a banal, excessive conspiracy to save the world; instead, this is Willis's internal struggle to simply survive on his own. This is a fresh, innovative concept, and it works great thanks to the tightly written script of the unique dementia brand Peoples and Gilliam. <br /> <br /> In addition, Monkey's story 12 is completely non-linear and instead decides to distort and bend the way the story is told, skillfully including a set of different time sequences: memories, dreams, memories, present, past, future, and even the scene that is raised from Hitchcock's Vertigo. All of them serve to immerse the viewer in his disturbing cacophony of madness and worthlessness. <br /> <br /> Visually, Gilliam is a master of inconsolable deception and shadow, competing with Tim Burton in his strikingly dull scenery and images. With cold, wide and exciting cinematography, Gilliam plunges into the colorless surroundings and darkness of her characters. Scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic, deadly white color and help to contrast with characters that often change to madness. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt steals most of the scenes, completing their patented bad, non-standard work, which deservedly won him in an Oscar nomination. As already mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best results in his career, without returning to his heroic stamps and cardboard hero, and instead depicts Cole as a simple, sharp, tragic man. No less good is Madeline Stowe as a psychologist Willis. She clings to herself, giving her character both wild energy and strength, as she collapses under the weight of what she believes is a false "religion." <br /> <br /> Gilliam, an expert who is overwhelming and difficult to deal with, which could be an ordinary fighter / science fiction film, makes 12 Monkeys an irresistible vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape. His rich, well-designed, intricate storyline, bravura plays of the entire cast and gloomy, gloomy cinematography make him a masterpiece of madness. “12 monkeys” is in the top 10 of my best albums. This is a dark spectacle of a film filled with brightness. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
