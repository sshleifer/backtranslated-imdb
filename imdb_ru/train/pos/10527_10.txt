This is one of the best films I've seen in recent years! I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but she is gorgeous, like Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is great as Reverand Elton, and Emma Thompsonâ€™s sister, Sophie, is hysterical, like Miss Bates. And look at the gorgeous Jeremy North as Mr. Knightley; what a gentleman! Whoever said you need sex and violence in the film to do it well has never seen Emma. I think this is what sets him apart from many others - this is great. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie that can be watched by the whole family, or are looking for a novel for yourself, look no further. Emma is a movie. With beautiful decor, great costumes and an outstanding cast (did I mention the gorgeous Jeremy North?), Emma is the perfect ten!
