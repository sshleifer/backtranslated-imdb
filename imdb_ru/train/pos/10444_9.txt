Sweet and charming, funny and spicy, the plot is less but significant, "Before Dawn" (1995), the third film by Richard Linklater, dedicated to everyone who has ever been in love, in love or never loved, but still dreams about it and hopes to find him. This is one of the very rare films that / should / will be equally interesting to teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It seems like a very simple little movie without exciting visual effects, car chases or long and full sex scenes. Two young people aged 20, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke, returning home after a summer holiday in Europe, and a French student, Julie Delpy, who goes to Paris to study at the Sorbonne) meet on the train. They are instantly attracted to each other, even before they start talking, they jump off the train in Vienna, where they walk, exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, it's a movie. It could be boring and stupid, but instead it is a wonderful, believable, intelligent and touching novel that only gets better with each viewing (at least for this viewer). High praise and my sincere thanks to the director and writers for providing two charming characters, great writing, always interesting and witty dialogues, two amazing performances and an atmosphere of magic that falls in love. Julie Delpy, like Botticelli's angel, is gorgeous in the image of a smart, independent and incredibly attractive young woman.
