It was a great example of how to make an interesting film without the use of big stars and great effects. Just tell a true story about the struggle of two African-American women over the turbulent century. <br /> <br /> This film makes us all look at our personal prejudices and see that people are people, not white, black, etc. <br /> <br /> A good movie with a good message .
