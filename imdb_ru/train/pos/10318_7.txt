He said that films and baseball flourished during the Great Depression. It seems that the gloomy realities of the nation, which was the result of this economic disaster, gave rise to the need for periodic assistance to the population. In the current soap opera, which is called "Baseball", you can find a temporary escape. <br /> <br /> In addition, a random excursion for 2 or 3 hours to the dark auditoriums of the Cinema. The presence of Radio in almost every home kept the Depressive Era of America immediately tuned to World Events and provided many Dramatic and (especially) Comedy Shows for a pleasant break in harsh reality. <br /> <br /> Time literature also flourished at all levels. The youthful reading skills helped to create the Comic Book as we know it, with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures. But the comic book simply didn’t magically appear, everything is completely designed with all the colorful 4-color pages in itself. There were environments that were ancestors to them. Obviously, Comic Strip was one of the parents, providing a visual / narrative storytelling method. <br /> <br /> Pulp magazine was another direct ancestor. Inexpensive, prose plot publications, in which there were many stories about the same adventure characters, although not necessarily serialized stories. The pulp environment has existed for several decades and introduced us to TARZAN by Edgar Rice Borrow and ZORRO Johnston McCully. In the 1930s, such outstanding characters as “The Shadow”, “The Avenger”, “Fighting Battles”, the “Big Eight” and “Spider”, “The Master of People”, and many others found their way to newsstands. <br /> <br /> Another was DOC SAVAGE, the full-blooded superhero of a written story; on the covers of the pulp was, perhaps, the only "picture" of the hero. Possessing extraordinary strength, super sharp feelings and an intellectual class of genius-protan, Doc was the prototype of the Superhero. <br /> <br /> He also gathered 5 of his former army friends into a small, free team of adventurers. Each of them was an expert in this field. Thus, we had the highest rating: a chemist, a lawyer, a civil engineer, an electrical engineer, a geologist, archaeologist, paleontologist, etc. <br /> <br /> The stories of Doc Savage were very popular in the 1930s and 40s and were published. in the mid 50s. Then they went into a break for 12-15 years. Then a brainstorm began to pack old novels into a new “container”, a paperback book. A new look was presented on the cover, in which a stylized series of paintings of a very muscular Doc with a forever torn shirt was presented. <br /> <br /> Repeated introduction has been very successful thanks to the publication. titles per month (and for a while more). Soon there was a rumor about the movie Doc Savage! But when, who is the producer? Well, the venerable "Man of Bronze" returned to the news stands for more than 10 years before any real project was assembled. It was a veteran Stop-action Animator and producer of the best special effects films, Geoprge Pal, who made the film with Warner Brothers. <br /> <br /> When DOC SAVAGE, MAN OF BRONZE arrived in theaters, he boasted from a well-played team of actors, although largely “nameless,” how far familiarity was with the audience. With former Tarzan from television, Ron Eli is an almost perfect cast, starring beauty starlet, Pamela Hensley starring and female veteran Paul Wexler (as the villain, Captain Moray); no other name would be recognized. And maybe in this case it was a plus. <br /> <br /> The story copes well in order to acquaint the majority of the audience with an incredible group and at the same time create a story. The use of the Paul Fries narration and short videos is a method used to advance the introduction to the main part of the story. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning there are hints that this story will go with the same artificial humor "Camp", as the series "Batman". The story of Paul Fries and the unexpected, unlikely results delight some of the really great looking early scenes in which Doc and the whole team perform their individual tasks. (For example, the Doc experiment with a miniature rocket / rocket turns out to be part of the method of fishing, and a small one.) The whole story unfolds in this way, striking the viewer with a small “camp” every time. so often to constantly remind us not to take it too seriously. We are also puzzled that Mr. George Pal is the producer (his last). The one who was so well known for the special effects, undoubtedly, this factor could find application in the science fiction action scenes of the character’s world of the Criminal character. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it quite brightly. Mrs. Ryan (Dinah) was in the hospital, had just given birth to our second child, Michelle (August 14, 75). Our eldest girl, Jennifer, visited her grandmother, so after the visiting hours ended in the maternity ward, she went straight to the old Marquette Theater, 63rd and Kedzie, here in Chicago. <br /> <br /> After seeing and being a good acquaintance with Doc, I was disappointed with the final product. I could take a little bit of this “camp” business, but wouldn’t mind if Mr. Pal found it necessary to let him hang out and have real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give them a bit more reading / comics / serial excitement. <br /> <br /> Still, the cast, led by Mr. Eli and others, made the whole movie enjoyable, if not attractive. As far as we can see, the sets and locations were very similar to the TV shows of the 30s or action films that anyone would like. <br /> <br /> And maybe that is what they tried with this DOC SAVAGE, THE MAN OF BRONZE.
