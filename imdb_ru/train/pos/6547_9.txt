I took my 10-year-old daughter to see Nancy Drew over the weekend, and found that I was completely having fun. First, it was clean, and I mean by its standards. Most children's films today are full of harsh toilet humor and harsh jokes to make cheap pre-school crowds laugh. However, Nancy Drew is smarter than this, and humor is subtle and intelligent. <br /> <br /> The refreshing liveliness of Emma Roberts, cheerful and polite, not annoying, plays the main role. Unlike the film “Brady Bunch Movie”, where anachronistic characters are bullied and ridiculed, the style of Nancy is treated with respect and dignity. This is a wonderful moment when boutique owners are barred from "caring for the style" of girls from Los Angeles wearing Paris Hilton clothes, and Nancy in her bums and home dress with Butterick inscription embraces. This film avoids what we need in order to enlighten this useful girl, which is so much in Hollywood films. Nancy remains true to herself and her values ​​in everything. <br /> <br /> The secret is sometimes intense enough to be attractive. There were several disturbing moments when my daughter nervously grabbed my hand, but there were no random shock scenes. This is all based on tension and mood and a lot of fun. The supporting cast is good, especially Marshall Bell as a creepy caretaker. There are some wonderful cameos by Eddie Jamieson, Chris Cattana and Bruce Willis, and many moments that make adults smile. <br /> <br /> This film deserves better marks than some have given it. I was not only glad that I wasn’t dragged into another computer animated film, where talking animals belch and let gas everywhere, but I was also very entertained. If I were there without a child, I would still enjoy the movie. This is a DVD on which my daughter’s name will be written under the tree.
