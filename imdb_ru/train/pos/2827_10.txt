This is probably one of the worst films in history. It's horrible. But it is so good! It will probably be better if you don’t look, expecting an exciting plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining, because you’ll be disappointed. However, if you want to watch it, to see 50 million vases and Goro / bad English's fantastic hair, real pleasure awaits you. The harder you think about the film, the worse it gets, if only you have no competitors to reveal most of the plot holes / failures, and in this case you have hours of entertainment ahead. I would recommend this movie only to bored Smap fans. And even then, the latter should be a little more cautious, because Goro's Japanese fans were a little upset about it, they thought he was selling himself. (He wasn't really, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do it for him).
