This is a wonderful film ... First impressions of cynicism and rudeness are soon dissipated by a funny love demonstration of how different motives for men and women diverge (Vive la difference!) <br /> <br /> You can love people, despite sometimes due to their weaknesses. People are actually a little rubbish, but we have big hearts and we try our best, despite the temptation. It is not our fault that sometimes it is impossible to resist temptation, it is just who we are. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning to the end, there is constant style; a clear picture and a clear composition, a very pleasant viewing, when you add provocative content, good music and loud laughter. <br /> <br /> Don't miss the very young "lonely wise voice" ... brilliant; the wisdom of innocence, balancing the comedy from the human condition.
