This film may seem outdated today, but remember that it was filmed in 1974 - before Saturday evening live, before Howard Stern, when George Carlin was just going beyond the limits of the Hippie Dippie Meteorologist and sank into heavy satirical humor. This film is their grandfather. Enjoy it because of its historical value, and also because of its high entertainment value.
