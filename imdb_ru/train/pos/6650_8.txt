I would not like to comment on how good the film is or what the disadvantages were, since I am not a professional film critic and I do not have enough knowledge to create films. What I know is that making such a film in the very first frame is a great achievement, and I would like to thank the director for that. However, in some reviews that I read, critics complained that Hiralalâ€™s relationship with his brothers was not covered, and his brothers and sisters were completely erased from this story. Now I really would like to emphasize that, as the name of the film suggests, this is not a film about the Chiralal brothers, this is a film about the relationship of Mahatma Gandhi and his son Hiralal Gandhi, no more, no less. If we start complaining that some characters do not act in the film, it will be a little unfair, because these characters do not fit into the picture, no matter how relevant they are in real life. Therefore, I think it would be better if we adhered to the main idea and stopped satisfying the criticism in ourselves. <br /> <br /> Enjoy !!!!
