The film is not as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> He has a good cast. Nice to see on the screen of Roger Moore and other British actors. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more Olivia DÊ»Abo in future projects. Maybe the leading role opposite her cousin is sexy Maryam D'Abo. <br /> <br /> It is also good to use invisible places such as Luxembourg. <Br /> <br /> We hope that we will see even more of such joint British-European projects.
