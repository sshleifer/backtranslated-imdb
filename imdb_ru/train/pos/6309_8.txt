I saw this jewel of the film in Cannes, where he was part of the directors for two weeks. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Collinwood is nothing short of superb. Great fun everywhere, all the members of a strong cast remove their socks. Sometimes this is a loud funny comedy about a petty rogue (Cosimo played by Louis Guzman) who is caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison. While in prison, he meets a “lifeguard” who tells him about the “greatest bellini” ?? what for you and me ?? This is a sure quick way to get rich. It turns out that there is some way out of the abandoned building to the city’s jewelry store? that could bring millions. Sounds easy? ?? well add all sorts of wacky characters and incidents along the way, and you get the ingredients for one wild trip !! ?? the rumor is passed on from one loser to another, and soon their team is going to try to make money on Cosimos 'bellini' led by the failed boxer Perot (superbly played by Sam Rockwell, no doubt a star in the making) and reluctant cheater Riley (William H. Macy ), which is forced to take with a child, because his wife was imprisoned for fraud! street), which also inspired a similar film "Collinwood" ?? `Palookaville". This confuses the latter effort, and although it is written and directed by the Rousseau brothers, it certainly has the shades of the Coen brothers. Produced by Stephen Soderberg and George Clooney, who has a small but cheerful role as a crippled safety switch.
