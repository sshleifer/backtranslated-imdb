In any number of films you can find Nicholas Cage in the role of a strong and silent hero, Dennis Hopper in the role of a killer-maniac, Lara Flynn Boyle as a vampire / tramp and the deceased, mourned J.T. Walsh is as heavy. These are the roles that these four can play in a dream, and they did it often enough to see how they play them again, bordering on clichés. What a relief, therefore, that John Dahl, a master in getting a great mood from a little action, directed this nuance of the Nurish thriller. Hopper manages to refrain from a coup, Cage demonstrates a little more depth than his usually superficial heroes, Boyle, in turn, is sultry, innocent and intriguing, and everyone feels the solid iron of the soul, which occupies a central place. to his character, Wayne. Dahl's direction gives a sense of the emptiness of the Big Sky country, where the story unfolds, and at the same time intimate enough to show how a wrinkled forehead can indicate a radical change in the plot in the store. Story plots are top-notch, and one of the other remarkable twists in this film is that some of the supporting characters actually act as if they have brains. It is not often that minor characters, such as deputy sheriffs, have more brains than their superiors. But with a clever director like Dahl, you shouldn’t be surprised at the intelligence associated with this film. A great movie.
