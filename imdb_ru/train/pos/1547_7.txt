Like everyone else who commented on this film, I can only wonder why he never appeared on video. <br /> <br /> I remember him at about 12 years old at the “Late Show,” around 1972. I also remember the attack of poison gas and strangely dressed horses. (I don’t remember the more horrendous fragments that I saw here, described here; they were probably cut out for a television audience.) But the scenes that I REALLY liked were associated with the death of Lord Kitchener on board HMS Hampshire, almost exactly 90 years back As I recall, the scenes of the doomed cruiser approaching the minefield in a storm were truly frightening. <br /> <br /> Don't remember the scores, but the comments of others now make me curious. Get it on video!
