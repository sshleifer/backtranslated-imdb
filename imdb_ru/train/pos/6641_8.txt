On December 28, 1895, the history of cinema itself wrote in the Big Cafe in Paris, while Louis Lumiere showed his short films, all individual shots, to the paying audience. "La Sortie des Usines Lumière" was the first film that was played, and I would like me to be there not only to watch the film, but also for the reaction of the audience. <br /> <br /> We start with the closed doors of the Lumiere factory. Obviously, since the image seems to be a photograph, people thought that they would just see the slideshow, and not what they hoped for. But then the doors open, and people rush home. First, many women, then several men and one man on a bicycle with a large dog. When they all close again behind the doors. <br /> <br /> Whether this is the first film or not (some say “The Train d'Anvey à la Ciotat” was the first film that Lumiere recorded) This is an impressive example of an early movie. Being boring because of this is almost impossible for several reasons. One simple reason: it's only fifty seconds. But for people who usually only like movies with special effects, there must be something interesting here; You cannot see historical things like this every day.
