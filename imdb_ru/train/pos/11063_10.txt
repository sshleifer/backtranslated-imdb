I was completely impressed with the "Waitress" by Shelley Adrienne (2007). This film only confirms what was clear from this film. Adrienne was an amazingly talented writer-director, an original and unique artist. She managed to show the misfortunes of everyday life with an absurd sense of humor and a genuinely warm optimistic and humanistic tendency. Ellie Sheedy steals this film with a terrific performance as a woman who fell over the edge. The male lead Reg Rogers, similar to Judd Nelson, is fine. There is also a wonderful cameo by Ben Verin. The song at the end of the film "Bastard's Song", written by Adrienne, can serve as her optimistic speech: <br /> <br /> "This is a world of suffering, <br /> <br /> In the sea of ​​pain, <br /> > No matter how much sun you bring, <br /> <br /> Rain beats you ... <br /> <br /> Don't let the heartless <br /> <br /> Don't greet the heartless at your door, <br /> <br /> Do not live among the heartless "
