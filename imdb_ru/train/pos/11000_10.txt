If you come to the movie with expectations, drop them now, because no fuss will make this movie fair. <br /> <br /> Categorizing this movie in one genre would be criminal. This is a spy thriller, in which there are elements of "noir", "pieces" and "action", science fiction and cyberpunk, all of them are connected by a brilliant narration, stunning plot twists and excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> A lot of the comments here are centered around the fact that it is derived, in both good and bad sense, of other films. But as they say, every story calls out from Shakespeare, therefore, as soon as you can get through this, you will have a hellish ride. <br /> <br /> At some moments you will have to suspend your disbelief, and while the set never becomes unbelievable, there are parts (read: elevator) that suffer from low budget and some stupid visual effects. You should not misunderstand that this means that it is on the same level as the silly movies on the Sci-Fi channels, because it is on a much higher level. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action, you should turn on far. This is pure psychology. But if you are ready to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a new cinematic experience, be sure to do it now! Watch this movie now, before it gets cool!
