This episode of Colombo is probably more marked for director Steven Spielberg as one of his earlier films. We must look at the role of Jack Cassidy as the killer, who kills his partner in writing, to save his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy will appear in later Colombo. In the end, Colombo meets his match in the form of Jack Cassidy. He is a mysterious writer who prepares a perfect murder. After his first murder, his next victim will be the annoying store owner / widow who will blackmail him with money. Instead of losing more money, he kills her. It's very interesting to watch Cassidy and Falk, as always. Falk's acquaintance with Colombo makes him attentive after repeated viewing of this episode over the years. The fact that television today forgets about the success of years is that people will want to watch the show again and again if they like the characters. This is not about who does it, how and why, but about getting to know Colombo and his sympathy, which is highly valued by viewers like me.
