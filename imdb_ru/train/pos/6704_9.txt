For the first three seasons, Sabrina was a gem hidden in a TGIF (and later, early school day repeats). Each episode was a maniac, energetic energy, and a fast tempo that overcame an occasional awkward joke. Melissa Joan Hart radiated a keen talent for physical comedy, especially in facial expressions. Her two aunts, playing "straight men," or as straight as two witches could have been, had a great funny time and general chemistry with Hart. Salem, like a talking cat, was free to indulge in any crazy scheme that interested him, and you could laugh and take it all in stride, because he was, after all, a talking cat. Sabrina's friends rounded out social experience in the school, which also housed typical “evil cheerleader” and “totalitarian principal”. Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to unite pop culture (eg, age groups, Jerry Springer), typical human condition / morality (eg importance of friendship, Christmas spirit), and a literal representation of such related metaphors in the magic kingdom. Unfortunately, like many other shows during the television age, the show peaked during the first three years, which coincided with attending Sabrina High School. Starting in season four, going to college marked what would be a dramatic decline in the overall quality of the show, especially when the writers decided to present Josh as Harvey's competitor, and come up with subtle excuses for Aunt Hilda and Zelda to stay on screen. as key players. The final season, where Sabrina works in the magazine of pop culture, was definitely disappointing. However, in the end, Sabrina (especially in high school) remains a unique record in the form of a hybrid sitcom with magic elements that raises her above the tedious fare that is produced in this genre every year.
