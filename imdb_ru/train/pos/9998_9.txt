Given that the average number of votes was rather low, and the fact that the seller in the video store decided it was “just fine,” I had no special expectations when renting this movie. <br /> <br /> But contrary to the above, I really liked it. This is a charming movie. It was not supposed to grow on me, I enjoyed it from the very beginning. Mel Brooks plays a great role as the main character, I think that he is somewhat different from his usual person in his films. <br /> <br /> There are not so many knockouts or something like that, but there are pretty funny scenes and, in general, this is a very nice and very easy to watch movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
