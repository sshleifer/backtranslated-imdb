Hi, I was an Allanricman. I'm still crazy. It was just another movie that I partially watched on TV. Then I needed to get a video tape to finally find out how it ends. Then I wanted a DVD because the tape showed the first signs of decomposition in a few weeks. After the DVD, I had to put my hands on the soundtrack. Then on several movie posters and movie scripts. Now it gets even worse when I try to get other people to get used to my website and Still Crazy parties. <br /> <br /> How could this happen? What made me addicted? <br /> <br /> OK, this is one of those funny, but somewhat sad and melancholic intellectual comedies that only the British can do. <br /> <br /> Good, the film is a world different from things like '' This Is Spinal Tap '', because of characters that are not childish or ultra cool, but real. This is a story about how men grow older. The story of how men get along with each other. Or not. It contains some of the best possible actors. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nyei. Bill Nighy, who puts on one of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Good, incredible soundtrack. Alien Mick Jones wrote songs for an imaginary group of Strange Fruit. Jimmy Neil, who plays bassist Les Wickes and Bill Nighy, portraying self-centered but awkward singer Ray Simms, truly sings. We know this about Jimmy Nail, but if you only heard Bill Nighy sing in “Love Actually,” you have no idea how big and powerful his voice is. <br /> <br /> Well, you will be in a fever for every scene that will appear in the x-th time, especially for these concert scenes. You would die to truly stand in the dance crowd when Strange Fruit performs "Around the World", sings on your lungs. You crave to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of these strange fruits on the festival scene of Wisbech. <br /> <br /> This is difficult, but ... I'm interested in this movie. I am addicted to strange fruit. If there is a world where this group really exists, I would like to move there. <br /> <br /> Still crazy ... anyone?
