I try to watch it every day most of the time, and although I’ve watched it for the past 4 years, I haven’t seen every episode. <br /> <br /> The series tells about Danny Tanner, the guy who does it. news for sports. His wife died in a car accident from a drunk driver, and he asks Jesse, Elvis's maniac with a motorcycle, and he is obsessed with his hair. Joey, an adult child who makes comedies all the time and voiced cartoons to take care of her three girls, Donna Joe, they call her DJ, Stefini, who is second in age, and Michelle, the youngest. <br /> <br /> They all live under one roof, and no one can help them. <br /> <br /> Later in the series, Jesse makes a girlfriend and later marries her, she has twins, Nikki and Alex. (it starts to happen in new seasons). This is a terrific show, if you like Zuck and Cody's suite life, this is Crow, the World is dating a guy and the Creating woman, you will like it. (It starts to get better in the final seasons) Watch this, you'll like it!
