I saw this film at the avant-garde premiere at the Imagina festival in Monaco. <br /> <br /> I saw the first trailer four years ago, and from that moment I waited to see the final result. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is a full-fledged 3D movie with a contrasting black and white render. Obviously inspired by some comic books, such as F. Miller’s books. In this optics, he goes one step further than the excellent adaptation of the “City of Sins” from R. Rodriguez. This time (almost) there is no gray or any medium color, but a graphic style that has never been in a realistic animated film. (I can't wait for the scanner to be dark) <br /> <br /> The massive use of motion capture gives a lot of life and trust to the characters, and we very soon forget the technical aspect to focus on more classical elements, such as direction or plot. The direction remains sober and manageable, despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and this is a really good surprise. <br /> <br /> The futuristic story (Paris, 2053) makes it a classic science fiction film and keeps the viewer's interest to the end. Despite the classic basic plot (an investigation that goes far beyond the original expectations), the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, the absolute power of certain companies ...) are of great interest to this film. <br /> <br /> Despite this animated film, clearly not for children. Here you will find neither a funny pet, nor a silly family moral, but only a cold reality. This is much closer to a good film noir. <br /> <br /> I found out that the scenery is one of the best aspects of the film: we still feel well acquainted with Paris, but it turns into a subtle touch of futurism. <br /> <br /> However, I regret a few mistakes. Editing is sometimes a bit flat, one or two very cliches, slow motion effects and some bad dialogs. Despite being technically excellent, it shows its limits in some romantic episodes (a bit like “final fantasy”). These little things make it 7/10. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a successful artistic challenge that you should watch if you can. Directed by Christian Volkman knows how to avoid potential pitfalls (fortunately, they didn’t ask John Wu to do the job!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is a film with stunning visual effects, an intelligent story and a wonderful artistic direction. See if you can! <br /> <br /> Please excuse me for spelling errors.
