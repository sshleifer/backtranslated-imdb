As Peckinpah did with STRAW DOGS, and Kubrick with CLOCKWORK ORANGE, director John Boorman makes an effective film about the violent side of a man in the movie Liberation, which may be a definite horror film from the 1970s. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronnie Cox portray four businessmen from Atlanta who decide to go on a canoe trip on the wild Kahulawassi River in northern Georgia before she gets to what Reynolds calls "one big dead lake." /> <br /> But the local highlanders, with terrifying obviousness, vaguely look at these "urban boys" wandering through the forest. And the next day, continuing the way downstream, Beatty and Voight are exposed and sexually abused (the infamous sequence of the film “SQUEAL!”) By two angry mountain men (Bill McKinney, Herbert “Cowboy” Trus). Thus, what began with the Appalachians as nothing more than a lark, has now become a nightmare in which our four main characters see a fine line between what we consider a civilization and what we consider a barbarity. /> <br /> James Dickey adapted the script from his own best-selling book, and the result was an often thrilling and disturbing shocker. Often known for its "SQUEAL!" and in the episodes of "Dueling Banjos", DELIVERANCE is also a rather difficult ordeal, with four leading men excellent in their roles, and McKinney and Trus are the two most terrible villains of all time. Be sure to watch the movie for those who want to take a chance.
